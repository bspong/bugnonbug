Hello Mozilla!

I already wrote this message to you by email and here is a post in bugzilla.

I want to warn you about vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox which I called properties not-inheritance vulnerability.
 
This vulnerability I found at web site megaswf.com (http://websecurity.com.ua/3131/). I already informed admins of the site about vulnerabilities at their site, but for now they fixed only one from three holes (only fixed one persistent XSS). And they didn't fix the hole which I'll tell you about, so all real examples (at megaswf.com) are still working.
 
This vulnerability at first sight can look like incorrect using of html code for embedding flash files. But because the attack works only in Firefox (in all browsers on Mozilla's engine), but not in other browsers, I decided that it is a vulnerability and it'll be interesting for you. Also this vulnerability can look like hole at single site, but it's possible that this html code (for embedding flash files) is widespread in Internet, so other sites can be vulnerable too, and so you can decide to fix it.
 
Real examples of properties not-inheritance vulnerability in Firefox which leads to XSS attack.
 
XSS:
 
It's persistent XSS via Flash.

Description of vulnerability.
 
There is official method from Adobe to protect from XSS attack via flash files, when they are placed at web sites. For this it's needed to set parameter allowScriptAccess value never. IE supports only tag object, so it's needed to set allowScriptAccess in it, and other browsers support tag embed, in which it's needed to set allowScriptAccess (or some browsers support both tags object and embed). So for all used tags for placing flash files it's needed to set allowScriptAccess.
 
Recently I found vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox, which I called Properties not-inheritance vulnerability. This vulnerability can be used for conducting Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
 
Browser Firefox supports placing of flash files via object and embed tags. At that at this site for showing flash file in all browsers two nested object tags are used (first for IE, and second for other browsers). In first tag object the parameter <param name=”allowscriptaccess” value=”never”> is set, but it isn't set in second tag.
 
In result XSS code from flash file works in Firefox, but not works in other browsers. Because for IE the protection is set in first tag object, while Opera and Google Chrome inherit this parameter from first into second nested tag object. Which doesn't do Firefox. So it's Properties not-inheritance vulnerability in Firefox.
 
Here I make three examples for you of html codes for placing flash files with protection from XSS.
 
1. Correct variant (which I used in my practice).
 
<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=8,0,0,0" width="550" height="400">
<param name="allowScriptAccess" value="never" />
<param name="movie" value="flash.swf" />
<embed src="flash.swf" width="550" height="400" allowScriptAccess="never" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" />
 
2. Variant similar to code at megaswf.com which is vulnerable for XSS in Firefox.
 
<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=8,0,0,0" width="550" height="400">
<param name="allowScriptAccess" value="never" />
<param name="movie" value="flash.swf" />
<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="flash.swf" width="550" height="400"></object>
</object>
 
3. This variant is my modification of 2nd variant which is not vulnerable for XSS in Firefox (as in other browsers). Which can be used by admins of megaswf.com.
 
<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=8,0,0,0" width="550" height="400" align="middle">
<param name="allowScriptAccess" value="never" />
<param name="movie" value="flash.swf" />
<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="flash.swf" width="550" height="400">
<param name="allowScriptAccess" value="never" />
</object>
</object>
 
Vulnerable version is Firefox 3.0.9 (and 3.0.10 must be also) and previous versions. Vulnerable are all browsers on Mozilla's engine.
 
Attend to security of all of yours web sites, web software, browsers and to security-audit.
 
I mentioned about this vulnerability at my site (http://websecurity.com.ua/3135/).
