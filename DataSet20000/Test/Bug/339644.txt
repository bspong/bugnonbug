Adding bookmarks to the bookmarks toolbar folder causes near 100% CPU utilization and increasing memory utilization.   This can be demonstrated by moving bookmarks into the bookmarks toolbar folder.  At some point the CPU utilization increases to  100 percent.  Removing these bookmarks eliminates the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Increase the number of bookmarks in the bookmarks toolbar folder
2. As the number of bookmarks increases the CPU utilization increases to near 100%
3. Removing the bookmarks eliminates the problem

Note:  This has been a problem with all versions of firefox on this platform (Windows 2000 service - with latest service packs and updates).
Actual Results:  
CPU increases to over 95% and does not decrease.  Memory increases slowly (possibly a memory leak).

Expected Results:  
The browser becomes incredibly sluggish (very slow drop down actions)...page scrolling is very slow....etc.

If too many bookmarks cause a problem, then a hard limit should be put on this folder size (at least as a temporary fix)....maybe something like:  "folder capacity limit reached".
