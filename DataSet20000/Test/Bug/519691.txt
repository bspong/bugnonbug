Print button greyed out when Firefox is run from a machine acting as Cups client

"Print" button is greyed out when Firefox 3 is run from a machine acting as CUPS client, eg has no running CUPS deamon but uses a /etc/cups/client.conf file instead. This is the case especially when the CUPS server is running CentOS 5. Other applications than Firefox 3 are not affected. Other distributions than CentOS might not be affected by the bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Stop the CUPS daemon on the machine you run Firefox on.
2. Create a /etc/cups/client.conf file. Add the directive "ServerName myprintserver" in this file. The value myprintserver is the host name or the IP-address of the CUPS server of your network.
3. Open a page in Firefox and choose "File" -> "Print".
Actual Results:  
The list of printers appears as expected. When mouse focus is placed on a printer the print button is grayed out and no printing can be performed. This is the case when CUPS is running on CentOS 5. If there are other hosts running CUPS on some other distribution and CUPS daemon is stopped on the CentOS server, printing worked.

Expected Results:  
Print button to be not greyed out and that pressing "print" would be possible.

This bug does not not appear in other client applications. Thunderbird (v.2) and Konqueror (v3), which where other test applications, were able to print normally as expected under the same setup(s).  This bug is also present on networks that have several CUPS servers running. In one case where two servers/host are both Ubuntu Linux machines the print button is not greyed out, but pressing "Print" returns an error. In cases where the primary print server is CentOS 5 the "Print" button is always grayed out - but only in Firefox 3.x, not other client applications. This bug prevents many LTSP (Linux Terminal Services Project) users from printing from Firefox.
