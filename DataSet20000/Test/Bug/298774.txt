Microsoft IE opens when read mail or new message button pressed in the tools menu as well as the toolbar button.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

When ever i try to read mail through the button in the tools menu or on the tool
bar button in firefox, microsoft's internet explorer opens to Yahoo mail inbox.
This happens although Mozilla Firefox is already set as the default browser.
Also when my keyboard shourtcut button for email used it also opens IE. I opened
IE and then made a shourtcut to the Inbox webpage and made it open in Mozilla.
Then i programmed the button to open the shortcut instead of the default E-mail
app. That at least was fixed the keyboard shortcut, but the email buttons in
mozilla still started IE which was extramely ennoying.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Hit read mail button
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Microsoft's Internet Explorer opens up Yahoo Mail

Expected Results:  
Open Yahoo Mail in Mozilla Firefox

This problem is very ennoying especially since i have tried to fix it for a very
long time and that i cant uninstall IE due to the need for Windows Update. Maybe
mozilla can be integrated to work with windoes update.
