Firefox eats the memory until it is killed from Task Manager

When i click on "Advanced Mass Sender 4.2" link under
http://www.getserial.com/index.php?search=a&nn=12 (yes, it's a cracker's site,
but the browser should not behave so anyway), firefox opens a new window and
immediately after that begins to eat system memory until i kill the firefox.exe
process from Task Manager (because it's not possible to work on PC while ff
behaves so). The same behaviour shows mozilla browser under linux (see
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=281136 ) so that it relates to the
mozilla/ff common code (possibly gecko?).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://www.getserial.com/index.php?search=a&nn=12
2. Click on "Advanced Mass Sender 4.2"
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc and see the memory consuming of the "firefox.exe" process.
4. After awhile, the ff begins to use your swap file :)
Actual Results:  
Firefox eats the system memory and blocks my work on PC

Expected Results:  
Firefox opens a new browser window and waits for me :)

The same under windows 2000. I have not tested it with the other systems.
