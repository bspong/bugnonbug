links with javascript onclick events do not function.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.3

If a link whose markup contains an onclick event is clicked, that link will not
function (browser will not attempt to visit destination URL). I've experienced
this problem on many sites, but to test it I wrote a simple page with this markup:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

<html>
<head><title>Firefox 1.0.3 Bug Test</title></head>
<body>
  <p><a href="http://www.yahoo.com" onclick="return confirm('Do you really want
to go to Yahoo.com?');">Yahoo.com</a></p>
  <p><a href="http://www.google.com" onclick="alert('You are about to go to
Google!');">Google.com</a></p>
</body>
</html>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clicking on the links produces a confirm or alert dialogue as expected, but
afterwords the browser does not attempt to visit the destination URLs, even if
the "ok" button is clicked in the confirm dialogue (function returns true). This
seems to be true of form elements including submit buttons as well. In Internet
Explorer these links function as normal links, simply showing the javascript
beforehand.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Paste the markup included in this report into an HTML file
2. View the HTML file in Firefox 1.0.3
3. Click either of the two links

Actual Results:  
The browser failed to visit the link's destination URL.

Expected Results:  
Unless the javascript function in the link returns false, the browser should
redirect to the link's specified URL.

I'm reporting this as "major" because it affects the usability of a large number
of high-profile sites.
