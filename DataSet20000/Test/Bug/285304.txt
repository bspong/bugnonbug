Print preview forces all calendar frames to be printed individually

When I print preview the Groupwise WebAccess calendar in IE, the toolbar
displays an option to print "as laid out on screen" (in 1 page). Firefox does
not give that option, but gives two others: ("shrink to fit" and
portrait/landscape). The result is that Firefox prints out all calendar frames
individually, so it takes 4-5 pages to print a 1-page calendar. Not so good.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Since Firefox doesn't give an option to print "as laid out on screen" (1 page)
2.each frame is printed separately
3.

Actual Results:  
Each frame of the calendar (toolbars, buttons, etc.) prints separately, so the
calendar is printed as several pages instead of as one page

Expected Results:  
The calendar should print as one page. I think the intention of Firefox was to
have the "shrink to fit" command form the calendar to one page and print one
page but, using Groupwise Web Access, the calendar extends to 2 pages and prints
as multiple pages. It should perform as IE does using its print "as laid out on
screen" option
