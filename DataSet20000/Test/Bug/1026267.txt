CPU constantly at between 50-99% when Firefox running b/c Firefox won't use my GPU's hardware acceleration
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:30.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/30.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140605174243

Steps to reproduce:

I ran Firefox. 


Actual results:

Everytime I run Firefox my CPU (Intel Pentium 4 Northwood@2.8 GHz, Single Core, Single Thread) is working at 50-99%. I found out that this is happening b/c Firefox does not use my laptop's GPU for hardware acceleration. I have manually enabled Firefox's hardware acceleration feature hoping that it will somehow use my laptop's GPU, but Firefox still will not use my laptop's GPU for hardware acceleration. My laptop's GPU is Nvidia GeForce4 460 Go. http://www.nvidia.co/page/geforce4go.html

CPU: Intel Pentium 4 Northwood@2.8 GHz, Single Core, Single Thread
OS: Windows XP Service Pack 3
GPU: Nvidia GeForce4 460 Go
Firefox Version: 30

Please note that I ran Firefox at Safe Mode and I have also reset Firefox back to initial settings, and still Firefox's CPU Usage would range between 50% and 99%.


Expected results:

Firefox's CPU usage ought to range between 1-50% and be usually in the 10-20% range as it happens with Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 and Google Chrome which work normally and both properly use my laptop's GPU for Hardware Acceleration.
