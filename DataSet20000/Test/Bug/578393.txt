Create a file with checksums for all builds that we upload
We would like to be able to verify that build artifacts that we consume are valid.  The best way to do this is to upload a checksum file along with the build artifacts.  Some possible ways that we could do this:
1. generate a checksum file entry per build artifact in the make target that generates the artifact
2. generate a single checksum file for all artifacts, appending to this file in each make target
3. generate a single checksum file in the make upload step
4. generate a single checksum file on stage
5. checksum on the slaves entirely in buildbot logic

Option 1 and 2 both have the downside that they require modifications in multiple locations in the build system.  Option 2 has the added downside of being very complicated to track a) when the file should be created, b) when the file should be zeroed out and c) whether the current checksum file reflects the artifacts in the dist dir.

Option 4 seems like a non-option as we would be generating the checksum file a) on a different machine and b) after a data transmission has already occured.

Using option 5 alone doesn't seem like the best option as there is no historical record of the checksums for future reference.  

I propose that we initially implement option 3.  Two approaches to option 3 are a) generating a checksums file in the build/upload.py script and b) generate the checksums in a separate script and add the checksum file to the list of files to transfer.

If there are no objections, I am going to implement option 3 b (generate in make upload using a second script)
