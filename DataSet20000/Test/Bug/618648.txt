My SSL/Https Pages do not work in Firefoxs new Browser 3.6.13.  
I have tried IE, Safari, Chrome with no issues at all.  It is seems to be only a the "new" Mozilla Firefox browser that has the problems recognizing my https pages. 
It only happens in Firefox's new version 3.6.13, which auto downloads as soon as you restart.  My previous firefox version works just fine, as I still use it on another computer.  
The new version 3.6.13 states that my https/SSL pages "use an invalid security certificate The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate is unknown (Error code:sec_error_unknown_issuer )".
I have contacted my security provider and server...This issue has everyone a bit perplexed.
