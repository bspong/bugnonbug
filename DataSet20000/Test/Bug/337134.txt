Good Day . . .

While viewing pages FireFox view area goes blank for an indeterminate time. It seems to happen on every page. The time goes from 1 or 2 seconds to ten to 15 seconds. When I used snapshot to capture an image snapshot and the Firefox page did not disappear just froze. It happens about every minute or less.

I used top to check for memory and cpu usage and everything appears normal.

All other programs function normally if they are outside the FireFox program.

The KDE character AMOR waks about as usual over FireFox except that the previous instances are not refreshed. The attachment tries to show this.

No other program is affected. I used fc5's built in Firefox then I downloaded the latest version and installed it in my home directory. The problem is still present.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Firefox.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
After a period of time the view freezes then returns to normal then repeats itself forever as long as I am using Firefox.

Expected Results:  
Normal operation.

Upon return to normal the page usually appears at the top not where I was just viewing it.

It has happened eight times while I was preparing this report.
