Favicon in a tab updates to that of Shoutcast.com when I don't actually go there.

This only happens in a tab.  I have a bookmark that links directly to an mp3
playlist (really a radio station).  If I'm at one site, say
http://jbaber.freeshell.org
which has a favicon, then I click that bookmark which automatically opens Winamp
(since I told it to), the favicon on the tab switches to that of
www.shoutcast.com, the host of the winamp playlist.  So I end up with a tab that
contains http://jbaber.freeshell.org 's actual content, but
http://www.shoutcast.com 's favicon.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0.  Bookmark
http://www.shoutcast.com/sbin/shoutcast-playlist.pls?rn=2748488&file=filename.pls
Specifically, the bookmark is in a folder of bookmarks in the toolbar.
1.  Go to any webpage.
2.  Press Ctrl-t to get a new tab.
3.  Go to http://jbaber.freeshell.org to get it's favicon on your tab.
4.  Click the prearranged bookmark.
Actual Results:  
Get shoutcast.com's favicon on a tab containing jbaber.freeshell.org 's content.

Expected Results:  
Retained jbaber.freeshell.org 's favicon on the tab

Of course the favicons aren't appearing in the address bar, but I'm sure that's
a well documented bug.
