reload page incorrectly if html of the page has been generated using document.writeln()
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.11) Gecko/20070312 Firefox/1.5.0.11
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.11) Gecko/20070312 Firefox/1.5.0.11

The problem is also reproducible on 

Firefox 1.5.010 Gecko/20070510 on Fedora 6
Firefox 2.0.03 Gecko/20070309 on Windows XP

She symptoms are that when a page is written using the javascript code in the attached file and the reload button is used to reload the page , the same is not displayed correctly: no css is loaded and no images are diplayed

I have installed the firebug extension and it detects no erro (I think also because no js has been loaded)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
To reproduce the link:

1) unzip the file attached

2) open in firefox the ricerca.htm file in sismica/main/

3) try the search form

4) regardless you have obtained results or not, hit the reload current page button or the F5 key

Teh content is written by either one of two javascript function in the 
sismica/js/searchFunction.js file.

The content of the result page in case of results exist is written by  the javascript function function formatResults(passedArray, text, urlTest) 

The content of the result page in case of results NOT exist is written by  the javascript function function function noMatch(text)



Actual Results:  
no images showed and no css loaded

Expected Results:  
correct display of the pages
