clicking/zooming on pictures shows an illogical error message and the browser keeps on waiting/connecting infinite

When I use for example Google in the picture search section and I type in the keyword the list of the pictures appears. When I go to the side, where the picture is from it is okay as well, but when I click on "show picture in original size" then firefox shows the following error-message (translated from german):  
- The graphic "URL" can't be shown, because it contains defects/errors -
original (in german): - Die Grafik "URL" kann nicht angezeigt werden, weil sie Fehler enthält -
"URL" is the address where the graphic is stored.
In the status bar at the bottom, the status switches from wait (warten) to connect (verbinden) very rapidly until I go to another tab. When I go back then, the picture is there

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. clicking on a picture to zoom it
2. error message appears
3. picture appears after changing to another tab and going back
4. status shows "stopped" but it still tries to connect (the grey running circle)

Actual Results:  
the browser keeps on loading (grey running circle)

Expected Results:  
the picture should appear suddenly without changing to another tab

it could not be a problem of my internet connection, because it is fast enough to load pictures in a short time.

i already had that problem before the new update 3.0.1
