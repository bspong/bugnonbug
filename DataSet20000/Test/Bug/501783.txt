Bookmarks toolbar unresponsive until Google Apps Mail page finishes loading
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090624 Firefox/3.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

It works fine in Firefox 3.0.11, but not in 3.5.

I usually open Google Apps Mail with Calendar included (GAM) in a tab, then while it's loading, I select more pages within folders on the Bookmarks Toolbar to start opening additional sites in additional tabs, so I don't have to sit and wait while GAM finishes loading.

With 3.5, I can't access any of the folders on the bookmarks toolbar until GAM completely finishes loading, so it forces me to sit and wait. In 3.0.11 (and earlier versions) I have no such issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Google Apps Mail page with Calendar included
2. While it's loading, try to open additional pages (tabs) via folders on the bookmarks toolbar

Actual Results:  
In 3.5, you can't access the folders on the bookmarks toolbar until the page is done loading.

Expected Results:  
To be able to access and use the items in folders on the bookmarks toolbar to open additional tabs while GAM is still loading, just like with 3.0.x.

Google Apps mail especially takes a while to load when the Google calendar is turned on within Google Apps mail on a slower PC.

This 3.5 bug is especially noticeable on my P-III/1.3Ghz/768.Meg RAM computer, but is also noticeable on my P-4/3.Ghz/2.Gig RAM computer. (Windows XP Pro SP3 + all updates, broadband Internet access)

I assume the same issue occurs with other pages, but GAM is the one I notice the most, probably because I use it the most.

I am not the only one to have this bug (someone else mentioned the exact same issue with 3.5 in a forum I was recently reading), but I didn't see it reported by anyone else yet even though I tried many different searches here, and reading through the dupe bug list.
