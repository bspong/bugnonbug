Firefox problem with Win XP Multiple Desktop Powertoy - unwanted find dialogs

Using Mozilla on a computer which is also using the Windows XP Multiple Desktops
Powertoy causes multiple problems with the browser. This Bug describes just one
of these problems, that where typing text into an input field unexpectedly
brings up the find dialog when ' or / is typed.
For example, using the word isn't when typing a Gmail message causes the find
dialog to appear and subsequent characters to be typed there, rather than in the
mail message

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox in new window on a single desktop on WinXP with multiple desktop
powertoy running. (This powertoy is available from Microsoft's Website)
2. Type in text containing ' or / into an input field. (When reproducing this, I
always used a new Gmail message.)
3. Words like "isn't" cause no problems.
4. Switch to a different desktop (in my reproduction case I used the assigned
key sequence of CTRL+ALT+x, where x is desktop number)
5. Switch back to desktop with Firefox open
6. Try typing in input field (in my case, create new Gmail message)
7. Typing word "isn't" brings up the Find dialog. The "t" appears in input box
of mail and in the find dialog. Subsequent letters only appear in find dialog.

Actual Results:  
The find dialog appeared for characters "'" or "/" entered in an input text field

Expected Results:  
It should have ignored these shortcut keys as the focus was on an input field.

Using Firefox 1.0.6. This bug I have also noticed in previous versions, 1.0.4,
1.0.5 and possibly further back.
