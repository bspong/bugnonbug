default bookmarks for new profiles in Firefox2
The default bookmark sets for Firefox 1.0 and 1.5 were designed to serve a user population that was, at the time, skewed more towards power users. Now that we're serving millions of users, we should examine the default bookmarks for new profiles.

Our design ethic has always been minimalist, focusing on providing what the user needs to get underway and to their task of browsing. We also want to provide localization when possible, and a consistent user experience across all locales.

We should remove all our existing default bookmarks and ship with:

 - a "Firefox" folder with bookmarks for: getting help and support, getting add-ons, developer resources, finding out more about mozilla and firefox. These should all link to portal sites that serve these more general user goals.

 - a "Getting Started" bookmark in the bookmark toolbar folder

 - a live bookmark sample in the bookmark toolbar folder

We should remove the bookmarks to Firefox Central, Mozillazine, Firefox Start, Spread Firefox, the Mozilla Store and /contribute.html. These can instead be linked to from the new portal sites.

We should also remove the quicksearch bookmarks; they're invisible to new users, and easily added by existing users. Instead we should properly publicize how to create quicksearches, and push on adding quicksearch support through the search manager. The bookmarks as they exist are of low value for new users.
