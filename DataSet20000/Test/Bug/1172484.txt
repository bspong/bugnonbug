Reading list returns null if url-bar removed (Breaks Browser)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:40.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/40.0
Build ID: 20150602110458

Steps to reproduce:

Installed classic theme restorer https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/classicthemerestorer/?src=ss

Classic theme restorer allows you to move the url-bar to panel ui or customize pallet by setting the url-bar attribute removable="true"


Actual results:

If you move the url-bar to panel ui or customize pallet then click buttons on the browser errors pool in the browser console from ReaderParent.jsm line 182

button is null ReaderParent.jsm:182:0
TypeError: button is null ReaderParent.jsm:182:6

If you then restart Firefox, You can no longer access browser console, customize mode and various other items due to reader returning null references.


Expected results:

Users should if they choose to be able to move the url-bar as proper handling of null ids should be in place like other browser elements have.

I understand the url-bar default attribute for removable is false but if an addon chooses to or needs to change that for some reason and the user or addon moves the original url-bar from the main navigation area to panel UI or customize pallet it should not break the browser completely.

Adjusting 
"browser.readinglist.enabled"
"reader.parse-on-load.enabled"

Has no effect on the above bug.
