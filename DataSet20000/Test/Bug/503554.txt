Site identifier differences reported in Ubuntu 9.04 VM
There is currently an issue in displaying certification differences between native and VM versions of Ubuntu 9.04 that has come across through testing across multiple laptops and desktops. 

Despite differences in certification across the location bar (Larry), certification is unchanged and functionality is untouched.

Example, 1: Paypal

So the major question is, why am I seeing blue certification and naming differences on my virtual machine?
