Intermittent browser-chrome leak of 1 nsCacheEntry and 1 nsStringBuffer
Calling this front-end rather than netwerk because bz took a peek at the log, and was flabbergasted by how something browserly was hanging onto things so we would up with 500-odd domwindows to get rid of at shutdown, including apparently the one that was still desperately clinging to this nsCacheEntry
