Firefox 16.0.1 loses bookmarks as soon as I open 'Show All Bookmarks'
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:16.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/16.0
Build ID: 20121024073032

Steps to reproduce:

1. Have Firefox 16.0.1 running. All bookmarks are shown in the bookmarks toolbar and on the bookmarks menu.
2. Select "Show All Bookmarks" (or press Ctrl-Shift-B).



Actual results:

All bookmarks disappear, from the new window, the bookmarks toolbar and the bookmarks menu. This has been reproduced many times.


Expected results:

Bookmarks being shown, so that I can backup them.

Additional things I tried:

a) Restoring backups: The automatic backup system seems to have encountered the same problem, but never reported it! The folder 'bookmarkbackups' contains empty (482 Bytes) files since Oct 15, before that date those files have ~600 KiB.

b) Restoring places.sqlite* from my personal backups: The same thing happens. I first get all my bookmarks back after launching Firefox, then they disappear as soon as I open 'Show All Bookmarks'.

c) Restoring them from Firefox Sync: Apparently Sync had the same problem, but didn't report it either (wtf!?), but instead uploaded the broken/empty state. According to 'view quota', my bookmarks on Sync are essentially empty.

d) Repairing places.sqlite: I tried the "sqlite3 places.sqlite .dump | sqlite3 places_new.sqlite" trick, but when using this newly created database, Firefox renames it to "sqlite.corrupt" and creates a new one. (Note that it never before called the database corrupt, only *AFTER* I dumped and recreated it. I find that very weird, but I suspect that I recreated it incorrectly.)
