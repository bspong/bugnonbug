Flash screen draw bugs with Firefox/Mac

This is some consistently ugly behavior I have been struggling to overcome in Firefox 2.0 (Macintosh) for some time now.  Please see the demo page I have created which I have found to be pretty reliable in reproducing this problem:
http://reubidium.com/flash_bug/

This page uses Dojo 1.0.2 to recreate the behavior, but I have been experiencing this in environments other than Dojo as well.  Pretty much any tool which I try to use to create these DHTML 'popups' to put Flash into will be a pretty reliable candidate for failure, I have found.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. With Firefox 2.0 on Mac OS X, go to http://reubidium.com/flash_bug/
2. Click on the "Show Dialog" button
3. Move the "dialog" around a bit, paying attention to the controller area.
Actual Results:  
I saw ugliness!

Expected Results:  
Consistent screen redrawing, no missing 'pieces' of the Flash animation

This is using Firefox 2.0.0.11 on Mac OS X 10.4.11 with Flash Player 9.0.115.0
