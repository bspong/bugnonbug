The "add SSL exception" dialog implies certs not recognized by Firefox are never legitimate
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9b5) Gecko/2008032619 Firefox/3.0b5

When I encounter a site with invalid SSL certificate and choose to add an exception I get a dialog which says:

You are about to override how Firefox identifies this site.

Note that legitimate banks, stores, and other public sites will not ask you to do this.

This is very inaccurate - this does not really change site identification in my view. It might at most verify the identification, or accept that it is not verified.

Also it implies that sites which did not pay to Verisign are not legitimate. Or that sites which are signed by a new cert that is not yet in Firefox are not legitimate either. This is also very misleading.

Yes, there are multiple dubious pay-for certs in Firefox, not only Verisign. Still I do not see how sites signed by any of these is more legitimate than any other site or how site not signed by one of these is less legitimate than the ones signed. 

I would only trust a site signed by a local authority with known policy for issuing certs. 

Thanks
