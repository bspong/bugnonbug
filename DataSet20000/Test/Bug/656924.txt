Browser crashes upon tab closing after sleep mode, error sending crash report
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/534.24 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/11.0.696.65 Safari/534.24

It happens on semi-regular basis. Haven't tried to nail exact reproducibility method but will try to be as informative as can be.

Usually, Firefox is open in multiple windows (3), each having a lot of tabs open (about 15+ per window). Usually among the lot there are a few tabbed pages that have scripts running (hotmail, twitter, bandcamp, youtube...)  
Put the computer in low-power/sleep mode for the night. Resumed work in the morning, application is sluggish. Close unnecessary tabs in one window. Browser has long response time, but should improve upon closing down more tabs.

- Often will receive prompts about processes that stopped responding (often coming from hotmail's tab and the such, but sometimes from browser add-ons too). Stopping or letting them run usually works either way. -

Change to another window, proceed to close more tabs judged superfluous. Browser crashes. Mozilla crash reporter comes up, press button to send crash report. Receive message that there was an error in sending the crash report.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open high amount of tabs, separated in different Firefox windows.
2.Computer go to sleep/power save mode, let sit few hours.
3.Awaken computer, if Firefox is sluggish, start closing tabs from window to window.

Actual Results:  
Browser crashes. Crash reporter gives error message when submitting report.

Expected Results:  
1.Tabs successfully close. Firefox regains some speed, hurray!
OR
2.Browser still crashes under the load but crash reporter sends report successfully. 

Expected crash reporter might fail, had copied the detail log. Can provide if needed.
