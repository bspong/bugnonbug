Typing a keyword in the location bar doesn't load the associated page if no arguments are given after the keyword.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add a bookmark to "http://www.lipsum.com/?amount=1&what=paras&start=" with keyword "lipsum".
2. Type "lipsum" (minus the quotes) in the location bar and hit ENTER.
Actual Results:  
The keyword is expanded to the URL in your bookmarks.

Expected Results:  
After the keyword is expanded the URL should be loaded.

From what I could reproduce this bug only occurs with http://www.lipsum.com as the target, regardless of the query string used. This is also regardless of what is used as the keyword.
A workaround is to put two spaces after the keyword, tricking Firefox into thinking that the second space is an argument to the keyword. Hitting ENTER twice doesn't work because the location bar loses focus after the keyword is expanded. This makes the current behavior useless even as a _feature_, because you have to manually return to the URL after the expansion in order to edit it.
