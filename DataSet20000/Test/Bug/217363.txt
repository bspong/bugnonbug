When entering bookmark keywords (also called keymarks by Eric A. Meyer in the
devedge link http://devedge.netscape.com/viewsource/2002/bookmarks/ ) an
accidental space at the end causes the keyword to not be recognized when used in
the location bar with a search term to fill the %s of the URL. Instead the words
get used in a google "I'm Feeling Lucky" search as if there were no keyword
present.  

The keyword by itself (without a search term) seems to work fine to load a
bookmark even if it has a space.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup a bookmark with a %s in the URL.
2. Set a keyword that ends in a space
3. Use the keyword with search terms in the location bar to attempt to access
the bookmark and fill the %s.

Actual Results:  
Google "I'm Feeling Lucky" search occurs

Expected Results:  
Mozilla (Firebird) should ignore the space at the end of the keyword when
matching keyword and filling in the search terms in the %s of the URL. 
Additionally, keywords (keymark) containing a space in the middle should also
work (a keyword such as "search this").
