Get a Network Timeout error when trying to log in to a website, page does not load
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; InfoPath.2)

When working with proxies turned on, going to a website that requires logging in such as hotmail.com, the webpage loads but when you try to log in the page doesn't load and you get a Network Timeout, this also happens when trying to visit addons.mozilla.org and bugzilla.mozilla.org but in these cases the pages doesn't open at all (I've had to log this bug in IE, with the same proxies on in IE everything works fine). With proxies turned off in FireFox everything works fine. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn on proxies
2. Visit a page that requires logging in, such as hotmail.com
3. Try to log in
Actual Results:  
Nothing will happen, the loading bar at the bottom will remain empty and after a while you will get a screen saying 'Network Timeout.  The server at login.live.com is taking too long to respond.'

Expected Results:  
The page should have logged in to my account

My proxies were 'edupass' port '800'
When visiting addons.mozilla.org and bugzilla.mozilla.org I get the same error but the page doesn't load at all, mozilla.org does work
