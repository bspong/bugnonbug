Problems With Printing To Acrobat Distiller When Using Mozilla Firefox and Having to Click Multiple Times to Open New URL

I have encountered two problems using Firefox: 

1) Printing to the Acrobat Distiller (from Adobe Acrobat 5.0) causes any and all operations related to the website I'm on to crash. I usually wing up sending the error report to Microsoft and cursing loudly.  Thai does not happen with IE7.

2) For some reason I cannot fathom, I'm now required to left-click the mouse two or sometimes three times on many, if not all, website URL's in order to activate same. This is more annoying than fatal as is (1) above.

Am I missing a security or other setting that would alleviate either or both problems?


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Item 1) above

1. Print Preview
2. Choose Acrobat Distiller as printer of choice
3. Hit go. Printer icon never shows (as it does in IE7). Firefox and all open tabs are closed. I can, of course, regain those tabs when I restart Firefox. I usually lose any downloads in progress at the time of the crash.
Actual Results:  
I always get Microsoft's famous 'sorry, we've got to close the application' error (including the "Dr. Watson" message) and always send the error report to them. The Firefox browser and all tabs close.

Expected Results:  
I should have seen the printer icon on the lower right of my screen, then been prompted for a location to save the '.pdf' file about to be produced. After completion of the print job, I would have seen the '.pdf' file in my default acrobat viewer Adobe Reader # 9.
