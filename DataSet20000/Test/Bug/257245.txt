Doesn't report lan card MAC address like the main mozilla browser
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040113
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3

The intranet here at school uses MAC address filtering to allow internet access.
 This version of the Linux Firefox doesn't properly report the MAC address (the
site shows "--.." without the quotes).  This version of Mozilla (Mozilla/5.0
(X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040113) reports it just fine, so I'm
assuming this is more of an oversight than a bug (although I really don't know
if it just isn't reporting vs. trying to report and doing it incorrectly).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Register computer's network card with the school network using a different
browser.
2.Attempt to connect to any webpage.
3.Attempt to re-register with the version of Firefox referenced here.

Actual Results:  
The normal mozilla browser will complete the registration fine and then will be
able to access the internet.  Firefox will get re-directed to resnet.stetson.edu
(I'm not convinced this page can be accessed publicly, but any site that checks
the MAC address should have the same results) because it thinks the network card
isn't registered.  When pulling up the registration form (up to 3 addresses can
be registered), it fills in the detected MAC address of the network card in use,
which in this case is displayed as "--.." without the quotes.

Expected Results:  
Properly report the MAC address of the network card in use.  All browsers should
be able to access the internet once the network card's MAC address is
registered, regardless of which one did the initial registration.  If Firefox
did this, it would then proceed to the internet in the usual fashion.
