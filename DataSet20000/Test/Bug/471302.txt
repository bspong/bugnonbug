"bookmark this page" resets the clipboard every time you enter the window

when you enter the "bookmark this page" window, all clipboard data is lost, and replaced with just the titlebar text of the page that is being bookmarked.

This When this window loses focus it goes away, so that every time you enter the window this happens. 

So there's no way to copy and paste data into any of the fields - tags, description, name, anything. 

If you copy data from an emacs instance, then go to firefox and press "Ctrl-D", the data that was copied to the clipboard is gone.  Now go back to emacs to re-copy the same data and the "bookmark this page" dialog goes away, preventing you from copying and pasting (because you will have to bring up that window anew, and lose the clipboard data again) 

It's also pretty bad in that one may be working in another application, have some data in the clipboard, come to firefox and bookmark a page, while doing no explicit user-level action to the clipboard, return to the original application, and the clipboard data is gone. 

As I understand it, the clipboard is only supposed to be modified if the user explicitly requests that it be modified.  



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. copy data to the clipboard
2. bring up the "add a bookmark" dialog (press Ctrl-D) - you don't even need to actually bookmark anything
3. close that box
4. paste data 
5. the original data is gone, replaced by the title  of the page to be bookmarked. 

Actual Results:  
clipboard data modified even though user never requested copied to clipboard, or made an explicit X selection 

Expected Results:  
unless there is an explicit user X selection or a "copy" menu selection, the clipboard data should be untouched 

not changed the clipboard data
