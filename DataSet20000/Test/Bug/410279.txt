Firefox on Mac OSX.5 forces me to close all tabs when multi windows on view instead of allowing me to choose which to close.

At any screen of any web site. I want to leave the page on view and return to a previous page. I need to click on go away "x" button of page on view. BUT I am forced to close all tabs open at that stage instead of having a choice as to which tabs should close.  This means I have to keep restarting my visit to that web site to be able to navigate the site. I hope this is the right place to draw attention to this problem - if not please advise. Using a PC and IE seems not to have this prolem?? Meantime I look forward to a solution and may I wish you all thanks in antiipation as well as best wishes for a lovely New Year
