If you select 5 or more bookmarks in the bookmark Manager and use the context menu to delete them here is what happens:
- they do not disappear from the bookmark list.
- their context menu becomes truncated to the first 3 opening options
- no other bookmark can be added !

Everything goes back to normal when you relaunch Firefox, the deleted bookmarks are gone.

Selecting 4 or less works all right.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. have at least 5 bookmarks
2. and open the bookmark manager (Organize Bookmark option from Bookmarks Menu)

The selected bookmarks do not disappear.
Their context menu is truncated.
