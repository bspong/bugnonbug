Since I upgraded to the latest Firefox Aug 28, I have been unable to email photos through my EasyShare software or send the invitation to view online.   So I cannot share my photos.   When I was downloading the upgrade - at the end I was asked something about Kodak Easyshare and I am sorry I do not remember what it said but the inference was that I needed to do this to make it work with the upgrade.   So I said yes.    Hasn't worked since.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Easyshare software and choose photo to email or share
2.If you chose email it will allow you to fill in the address etc but will not allow you to send the email
3.If you choose to send an invitation for the receiver to view your photos online..well it will not allow you to choose that
Actual Results:  
Cannot send photos 

Expected Results:  
Should allow me to choose either send photo as attachment or share online


I am not terribly techy so that is the best I can do to describe it
