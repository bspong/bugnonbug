Can't enter private browsing mode, fails with Error "ds is undefined" in _beginRemoveTab()
I hit this once a few days ago, and just caught it again...

Select "Start Private Browsing" from the menubar, and some (but not all!) tabs close. The about:privatebrowsing page does not open. The error console records the following error:

Error: Exception thrown while processing the private browsing mode change
request: [Exception... "'[JavaScript Error: "ds is undefined" {file:
"chrome://browser/content/tabbrowser.xml" line: 1511}]' when calling method:

Relevant code:

    <method name="_beginRemoveTab">
            ...
            var browser = this.getBrowserForTab(aTab);

            if (!aTabWillBeMoved) {
              let ds = browser.docShell;
-->           if (ds.contentViewer && !ds.contentViewer.permitUnload())
                return null;
            }

Not sure what would cause this, I've got 1 window with ~15 tabs open, all have normal page content, so it's odd that .docShell would be undefined.

Anything I should look at if this happens again?

If I select "Start Private Browsing" from the menu again, the tabs that were closed are restored. [Probably need better error handling here for when entering PB mode fails.]
