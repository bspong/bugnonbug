User file-extension choice overruled, allowing trojan execution

(I am filing this as requested by Mozilla staff.)  

The download File / Save As dialog box disappointed me by naming the executable file incorrectly IMO.   In the form I directed that it be named   "whatever.exe.off" instead of "whatever.exe"
to guard against accidental execution.   (In that particular case, I hadn't chosen to download the file- I knew it to be either a virus or trojan payload. 
But the browser redid the hazardous
choice, saving the file as "whatever.exe.off.exe"
We must be very careful not to save files as executables when the user doesn't
expect it!  Dropping executables in the wrong directory can get them to be run
automatically, soon or at reboot.   Never add a executable suffix without the
users' knowledge!  I assume the MIME type was used to add the "correct" suffix,
contradicting the suffix I chose.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go  to http://download.nullsoft.com/winamp/client/winamp5541_full_emusic-7plus_en-us.exe 
(This is a legitimate executable that demonstrates the problem, but you can also demonstrate it by going to a malware/Trojan laden website.)

2. "You have chosen to open foo.exe-- what should firefox do?"  SAVE FILE

3. Enter filename "Foo.off"  (since you want to run antivirus on it before there is any chance it will executed by some process on your computer.)

EXPECTED.   File saved as "foo.off".

ACTUAL 
4. Observe the file was saved as "Foo.off.exe" 


Actual Results:  
4. Observe the file was saved as "Foo.off.exe" which could be executed, putting my security at risk. (I encountered the problem on a real malware site, but demonstrated it with more reliable legitimate site.)  

Expected Results:  
File saved with the name and extension I chose for it.  
Not an extension that puts my computer at risk for Trojan attack.  

This was observed in a very actively spreading Trojan attack. 
We should fix the obvious bugs that help Trojans spread faster.
