Clear recent history dialog refresh follow-up
The recent clear recent history dialog refresh sprint (bug 480169) didn't quite work out.  We dropped the fine-grained page/time selection via the tree view.  The purpose of this bug is to track development of a follow-up design and implementation.

Here are mconnor's thoughts copy and pasted from an email:

* Site should take absolute precedence over time.  The task is "clear everything starting when I visited site X" rather than "clear everything since 5:22 PM" even if that's the implementation.
* Having a treeview with a selection I can't deselect items from is confusing/frustrating, especially since nothing in the UI indicates that I can only select a range (and that I can only select a start time, not an end time, which I also found confusing).
* We're creating a new type of interaction [with the treeview] than we've ever had, and this fails the "I can understand how to use it without asking someone" test, IMO.
* We absolutely shouldn't use a flat treeview, the number of entries makes scrolling/finding very suboptimal for larger timesets than one hour.
* I'm not at all sure that the selection UI should be shown when selecting timeframes other than Custom.
* We should figure out how to collapse a bunch of visits to the same site within a certain timeframe.  i.e. clump all visits to example.com where the gap between visits is less than 30 minutes (tweakable, of course) into a single "engagement" or something.  Then I would get something like this (@ would be the favicon, time would be the first visit in that clump):

Clear everything since I visited:

@ bbc.co.uk             5:43 PM
  (31 pages visited)
@ cnn.com               5:27 PM
  (12 pages visited)
@ bugzilla.mozilla.org  5:12 PM
  (49 pages visited)
@ twitter.com           5:04 PM
  (8 pages visited)
@ amazon.com            4:49 PM
  (22 pages visited)

Now, instead of 122 entries, I get five.  We can even expand to show details if people want, but I think that's not required, but nice to have.

We could use the toplevel page title (or the first page visited title) instead of domain.

What we should definitely keep:

* Collapsed details pane (especially the removal of Saved Passwords)
* Warning displayed when selecting Everything
