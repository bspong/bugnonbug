Try to view a pdf attachment in gmail online, it opens a new tab and then the new
tab shows the normal progress bar and stops there, no progress further at all.
I verified that this works in firefox 3.6 beta 3. However, it stopped working after I updated to firefox 3.6 beta 4. Even the latest 3.6x firefox nightly builds
have not fixed this problem.
Alternative way to reproduce this is to open a pdf document in google docs,
the same behavior is observed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a pdf attachment in gmail or upload a pdf document in google docs
2. Try to "view" the attachment in gmail or open the online pdf document in google docs.
3. The page shows progress bar and then stops loading...the document is never shown.
Actual Results:  
The progress bar is shown and it stops.

Expected Results:  
The document should be shown.

Although I am reporting this bug with firefox nightly builds, it is observed in 
firefox 3.6 beta 4 too. I verified that it works in firefox 3.6 beta 3.
