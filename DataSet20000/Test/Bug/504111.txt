overflow: settings other than visible don't display -moz-column-rule lines

When a block (div) is set to render columns (using -moz-column-width) with column rules (using -moz-column-rule) the setting of overflow: directly affects the display of the rule lines in ways that the web-kit versions (using -webkit-columns and -webkit-column-gap) are not affected.

With overflow:visible the rule lines appear as expected. With either overflow:auto, overflow:hidden and overflow:scroll the rule lines are not displayed whatsoever (also, the layout of the page slightly changes).

In web-kit based browsers the lines always display (if not always in the right place if "auto" is used!) and the layout never changes.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the example page (http://www.davidviner.com/rule0.html) which is displaying using overflow:visible to see the rule line displayed.
2. Try the alternatives via the links at the bottom of the example page which only differ by the overflow: settings.
3. Compare by using the same pages on web-kit based browsers (Safari, Chrome).
Actual Results:  
In Gecko the rule lines are not displayed when overflow: is set to anything other than "visible" (I also checked "scroll", "hidden", "auto" none of which display the lines - with "inherit" on the test code it responded as "visible" but I suspect this really depends upon exactly what it is inheriting from). When the rule lines are not displayed, the layout of the displayed text also changes when compared to when the lines are displayed.



Expected Results:  
Should not have changed the display at all with the different overflow settings.

I have checked this using both FireFox 3.5 (under Windows XP) and Minefield 3.6a1pre (under Windows 7 RC1) obtaining the same results in both cases.

The web-kit based browsers used for comparison were:
Chrome 2.0.172.33
Chrome 3.0.191.3
Safari 4.0.2
