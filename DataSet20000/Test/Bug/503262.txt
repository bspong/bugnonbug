Similar to Bug 483204 - page load fails or goes to text format; not a problem with 3.0.11

I spent some time discussing this on the mibbit chat line earlier.  They were unable to reproduce the bug, but suggested numerous troubleshooting steps.  They said it had to do with dns, a .net extension and the css page display.  We got it working, but as soon as I cleared my private data, my next visit to http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/directories.html; http://webapps.ama-assn.org/doctorfinder/html/patient.html would either give me a message saying "firefox can't find the server" or cause the page to display something that looked like the text in notepad.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Install 3.5 (any version, apparently).
2.  Try to access majorgeeks.com, freewarefiles.com or website above.
3.  Wait a few minutes after firefox fails and then access same site in IE8.
Actual Results:  
Go to altavista.com.  Go to majorgeeks.com.  Click on links at majorgeeks.com.  Go to freewarefiles.com.  Go to www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/directories.html.  Go to webapps.ama-assn.org/doctorfinder/html/patient.html.  Page either won't display at all or look like notepad text.  Then dns locks up (for lack of a better word) and can't access any websites at all for several minutes.  Then can access all of these in IE8 without any problems.  Seems like other users having similar issues from viewing support forum, but no one at mibbit was able to reproduce this so maybe it is something on my machine.  I finally gave up and uninstalled 3.5.  I went back to 3.0.11 and everything is back to normal.

Expected Results:  
I tried everything you can think of, every possible way to fix the problem and nothing worked until I went back to 3.0.11.

It should have worked.  I can't imagine what software on my machine possibly would be different than the people at mibbit.  I am really disappointed that 3.5 doesn't work and I won't ever update the software unless I can be sure that this problem is resolved.
