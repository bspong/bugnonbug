Webpage with 2400 checkboxes hangs Firefox

a page with username and 2400 checkboxes loads properly under windows ff, windows ie, mac safari, mac chrome but not under mac ff 3.16.13... it did load properly in previous versions of mac ff.   under 3.6.13 mac ff, now presents spinning wheel and can take several minutes to load.   normal load time previously was less than several seconds.  load times for other browers are normal.  web server is not affected, but local mac ff browser goes to 100% cpu when tried on page with 2400 names/checkboxes.

haven't done any tests to see at what point it fails, but pages with less checkboxes do load properly in mac ff 3.6.13.    it's only the page with lots of checkboxes (2400 will show the problem)

if i remove the checkbox code, leaving just name/email... it loads fine, albeit a little slower (3-4 seconds) than other browsers which load everything, 2400 names/email/box in less than 3 seconds.  previous mac ff browser also loaded all in under 3.

all run on macbook pro (windows running with parallels)

hope this helps.  please let me know if additional data would be helpful, thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. haven't stripped our code, but make a page with 50 char name  and checkboxes
2.  if 2400 records are tried, fails on my system
3.
Actual Results:  
spinning wheel... eventually loads

Expected Results:  
should load 2400 names/checkboxes in several seconds

within our html page, this code puts up spinning wheel when there are 2400 records involved.  userlist is a list of 2400 names

<input type=checkbox name=user<@currow> value="Yes"> @@local$userlist[<@currow>,2]<br>


this code works (no checkboxes)
@@local$userlist[<@currow>,2]<br>

only mac ff 3.6.13 produces spinning wheel with first code  previous versions of mac ff and all other browsers work as expected.

the pages that produce this problem are not publicly available.
