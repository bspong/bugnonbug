After showing apple quicktime movie Win98 hangs completely when going into powersave mode

This is a very hard bug top track down. I ran a lot of trials to see that it is
really the Firefox/Quicktime plugin combo.

After loading a page that requires the Quicktime plugin, the page is loaded and
displayed correctly. But if I wait for a while and the screen goes into
powersave mode, a crash dialog box appears. You know: "The programme Firefox has
performed an illegal operation and will be shut down", or something. The
background is not drawn correctly; it has a lot of black squares on it (just
like it didn't get around to drawing the desktop on the black background). No
sense in pressing the "details" button, since the OS is truely and utterly
stuck, crashed, and in all non-responsive. If you close firefox after I viewed a
page using the Quicktime plugin, the crash still occurs and windows reports the
crash, blaming the topmost window for the crash.

Please note that this is limited to once combination only, i.e. Firefox,
Quicktime plugin, powersave mode. Remove any of the three and it will not occur.
  Possibly superfluously: IE with Quicktime does not show this problem.

P.S. I'm sure this is a problem Apple should solve. But It's always good to be
aware of a problem.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 0.9.3
2. Install Quicktime 6.0
3. Load a page that requires the quicktime plugin loaded.
4. Wait until powersave mode engages.
5. Press the reset button, since nothing else works.

Actual Results:  
Windows shows the crash dialog; destop is not completely redrawn; OS has
completely locked up.

Expected Results:  
Go to powersave mode correctly. 

Sorry, cannot acces "details" in crash dialog since OS crashed.
