On Linux, when I double click to edit a note it crashes.
On windows, when I double click to edit the note goes into edit mode but the note is blank.

Even if a node is not imported, it should not crash the browser like it does on linux.

I am referring to the 3.0a2 build on both platforms.

This is related to :
"Moving DOM nodes between documents now requires a call to importNode or adoptNode as per the DOM specification."

In the error console I get :
"Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Node cannot be used in a document other than the one in which it was created"  code: "4" nsresult: "0x80530004 (NS_ERROR_DOM_WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR)"  location: "http://www.google.com/notebook/js/4253011231-notebook_en_binary.js Line: 328"]"

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. login into http://www.google.com/notebook
2. double click on an existing note ( or try to create a new one )
3.
Actual Results:  
browser crashes

Expected Results:  
thrown an error that the node was not imported
