system restarts when closing last firefox window and all personal info lost
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

This is a rather odd issue.  I will be browsing along, minding my own business,
then I call it a night and close down all browser windows.  When I get to that
last window and click the X, my computer screen goes blank and then I am looking
at the startup sequence.  So it causes my system to crash and then reboot.  So
when the computer is  back up, I bring up Firefox and all my bookmarks are gone,
my theme is gone, and the browswer buttons are reset (as I added in a button to
open up a new tab).  What's going on?  And more importantly, how can I fix this?
 Is this just a problem with version 1.0.6?  (as I had this problem before I
reformatted my computer too)  And one last thing, sometimes I click on the icon
to bring up Firefox and it takes a long time to load the program.  Thanks for
your help.
