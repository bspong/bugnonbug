can't remove toolbar items once dragged to top menu bar

I customized my toolbar by going to view/toolbars/customize.  I grabbed and
dragged the print, bookmarks, and history to the main menu toolbar (next to
Help).    I then successfully grabbed and dragged the address bar and search bar
to the top menu bar.  Finally, I dragged the TinyURL extension there.  

That, I thought, would allow me to eliminate the navigation bar and leave me
with only one toolbar so as to maximize the viewable window...  until I realized
that I would lose the forward, back, reload and homepage buttons.  So I tried to
drag everything back but the items became locked on the top bar.

Now if I view the navigation toolbar, I get a duplicate address and search bar,
and cannot get the print, bookmark or history items to the navigation bar since
they are locked...

Any ideas?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to view/toolbars/customize
2. drag the icons mentioned to the top menu bar (File/Edit/Go/etc)
3. drag the adrress a.d search bars to the top menu bar

Actual Results:  
Once they were placed up there, they became locked and I was unable to drag them
back out

Expected Results:  
Allowed to be removed
