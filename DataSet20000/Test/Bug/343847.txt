window.status text persists when switching to a different tab

The original error is that when a window.status is set and the user changes the tab that the status of the previous tab remains.

In build 20060706 the status is completely lost when toggling between tabs.  If tab A sets a status and the user switches to tab B and then back to tab A the status no longer appears.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any page that sets window.status.
2. Toggle to a different tab without window.status.
3. Toggle back to the tab that had set window.status.

Actual Results:  
The window.status disappeared when returning to the original tab where the window.status was initially set.

Expected Results:  
When toggling back to a tab that set window.status the window.status should be restored.  Related to another bug the window.status should not appear for other tabs (unless of course they have the same page setting the same status).

1.) There are too many poorly created bug reports.

2.) Bugs are taking way too long to address while new technologies are implemented practically overnight.

3.) Most bug fixes I see are half-assed requiring new bugs because the original poster of the bug did not properly create the bug report.  This is keeping Opera's rendering engine superior to Geckos.
