I find a handy feature in IE to be the ability to load a local HTML file I'm
currently authoring, and then to be able to edit the HTML source directly using
View->Source.

There is no easy way I've discerned so far to load a page for editing from
Firebird.  Perhaps the solution would be:

a. Add an option to configure the source viewer to use either the internal
display or any other external program.

b. Additionally, allow the user to add other apps to the Tools menu, which are
then passed the filename of the currently open page.

On a related note, if you're viewing a local file in IE a right-click on the
window icon in the top left gives the usual context menu for the file, allowing
you to easily send the current page to A: or open it with any other app from the
"Open With" list. Could similar functionality be duplicated in Firebird?

Great work with the browser so far - I'm very impressed.
