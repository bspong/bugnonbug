New pages do not open in new tab in 2.0.0.1 contrary to Preferences setting
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1

Problem: Firefox 2.0.0.1 has stopped loading new pages into new windows although it is set to do it in Preferences.

Discussion: I only noticed this issue after downloading and installing the new Photoshop CS3 beta. While installing PS CS3, I was told that the program could not be loaded while Firefox was running. I closed Firefox and restarted the setup application and it ran to completion.

When I went back to Firefox, I found that new pages loaded onto the same tab as I was working from rather than opening a new tab. I went into Firefox preferences and checked that the setting under Tabs to Open new pages in a new tab was checked. It was.

I restarted Firefox but it made no difference.

I downloaded a new copy of Firefox and reinstalled it over my previous installation. It made no difference. I checked that the preferences setting was correct; it still was.

I disabled the Google Toolbar plugin because it has caused crashes in the past. I restarted and it made no difference to this issue.

NOTE:  This issue seems very similar to Bug 364595 which is for a PC also running 2.0.0.1 and which occurred after the insatllation of new (but different) software.  Did that bug also occur on a dual core Intel processor?
