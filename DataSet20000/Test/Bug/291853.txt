ctrl-, shift- and alt-click cannot be intercepted/suppressed by onclick returning false.

In the application we are developing, overriding the default ctrl-, shift-, and
alt-click behaviour on certain links makes a great deal of sense.  

We could wire up some extremely useful and dare i say not-very-confusing
functionality. 

At the same time, and also given the situation in our application, there is
really no use for firefox's default behaviour here. 

However, ctrl-click, shift-click and alt-click on any link in firefox cant be
intercepted by javascript in the normal manner, by returning false at the
appropriate time. 

Instead, these special events seem to short circuit the usual event handling,
and proceed regardless.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. make a blank page, 
2. write a link, with onclick set to return false. 
3. clicking on the link will do nothing
4. but alt-,  shift-  and/or ctrl-clicking on it will step right over your
return false.

Actual Results:  
does default mozilla behaviour 

Expected Results:  
should have been blocked by the return false in the onclick handler
