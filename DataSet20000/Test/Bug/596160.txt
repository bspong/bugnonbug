Bug turned Firefox to all default settings & never saves changes.

I just updated to 3.6.9 and I can't get Firefox to save my settings. It reset everything to default, and after several attempts in using Tools > Options, hitting OK, then closing FF, it returns to default when I re-open it. Considering I've had the same theme and settings the past 4 months with no trouble, and this includes updates, I should be fine. But it not only defaults, it acts as if I have just installed the current plug ins I've had for several months. It opens all of the release notes for each plug-in in tabs. So every time I open Firefox, I have many tabs opening, telling me welcome or otherwise along with noting my them and privacy/other settings are returned to default. 

I tried going to an earlier version, but it reacts the same way. I may try going down to a version from several months ago to see if this changes anything. I realize Beta happens. I would also like to note that I'm very internet/troubleshoot savvy.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start up FireFox. 
Actual Results:  
Default settings, default theme, never saves settings, opens multiple tabs from plug-ins.

Expected Results:  
Keeping my current theme and settings.

It saves my passwords from sites I visit. The one thing it never does is log me out.
