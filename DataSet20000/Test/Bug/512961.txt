Firefox process is not getting killed in 64 bit systems
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.13) Gecko/2009073022 (CK-IBM) Firefox/3.0.13

I am running a process which records some activity in firefox & close it finally. If I run this recorded activity for two times by using a single run, then In first run the activity is getting completed in first run, but while closing the firefox & Opening the another firefox automatically via process is throwing the error "Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window you must first close the existing Firefox Process, or restart your system.". This is blocking the activity to run the second time. The behavior is seen in 64 bit systems only. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a process which can run firefox & close it & again run it as soon as it closes the first instance. You should get the error while second run.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
The below error is being displayed :

Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window you must first close the existing Firefox Process, or restart your system.


Expected Results:  
Firefox should not go in that mode. Firefox should close the process in the first run & Should open the instance smoothly in second run.

Firefox Version: 3.0.10
