I receive this error message when doing a function in my forum which is running on Invision Power Board 2.1.3. I have tested it on other Invison boards with the same result. The same message does not happen with FF 1.0.7.(Although the person who tested it for me was running FF 1.0.7 on a Mac). It looks like it may be a syntax incompatibility of some sort. Here is the error message I received in a pop up box. I could not copy & paste, so I hope I got it right.

[Exception…”Component returned failure code:0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIDOMNSHTMLDocument.execCommand]” nsresult:”0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)”location: “JSframe::http://www.natcoa-forum.com/jscripts/ipb_editor_rte.js :: format_test :: line 965” 

Here is "ipb_editor_rte.js", lines 949-974 (965 is the line with "rtewindow.document" in it)

                              //-------------------------------
                                // Ignore error for blank urls

                                rtewindow.document.execCommand("Unlink"    , false, null );
                                rtewindow.document.execCommand("CreateLink", false, szURL);
                        }
                        catch (e)
                        {
                                //do nothing
                        }
                }
                else
                {
                        rtewindow.focus();
                        _gecko_kill_css();
                          rtewindow.document.execCommand(command, false, null);
                          rte_button_update( command );
                        rtewindow.focus();
                }
        }
        catch (e)
        {
                alert(e);
        }
}

This same problem happens on other Invision forums. You have to have rich text format set in the control panel of the user under board options. I have a test login set up at www.natcoa-forum.com you can use to see the problem. It is login "test", Pass is "1234". It is set for rich text format in the users control panel. Go to any existing post & select reply. Just above the upper right hand corner of the text entry box, you will see a 123 symbol for inserting a list. Press that to see the problem. If you go to the control panel/board options & change from rich text to standard, the error does not occur. The error also does not occur in IE or Netscape. If you would like a full copy of "ipb_editor_rte.js", let me know.
