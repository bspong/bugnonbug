A page includes two forms, one before a set of Google AdSense items, one after. When the submit button is hit, the second form calls the form target page twice instead of once. It is not sensible to the eys, but the script on the page called by the form proves that the form target page is really called twiced. The form located before the AdSense items is not affected. When the Google AdSense code is removed, both forms are correctly working. This does not affect IE 7 RC1.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a page with a form. the form target should contain a script that render visible the double call : for example an hit counter recording into a database.
2. Insert Google AdSense items (ads, not "Firefoxfox with Google" stuff that doesn't trigger the bug) BEFORE the form. 
3. Use the form and see what happens. remove the Google ads and see what happens.

Actual Results:  
The form calls its target file twice.

Expected Results:  
the form should call its target file only once.
