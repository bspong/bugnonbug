Firefox displays huge (>25MB) BMP image from embedded web server, but doesn't let me save the image
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20070515 Firefox/2.0.0.4

when doing a network scan via a embedded web server, if the size/resolution of the scan, gives an image more then 25meg byte, the image will display, but with not save.

A right click on the image gives a:   "Size of File:    Unknown (not cached)"
if the image is less than 25m, the size is reported correctly.

A right click, SAVE IMAGE AS, will save a file, BUT it is not the BMP.  The file contents are:
"503 Service Unavailable"

If the file is less then 25m, this save if fine.

Seamonkey has the same issue.
IE 6 and 7 are fine.
Again, the image displays on the web page just fine, just wont save (from SAVE AS, or DRAG to DESKTOP)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.dlink dpr1260 connected to epson printer mfp (cx3xxx or cx4xxx)
2.do scan on highest resolution of size greater than 8.5" x 2.8"  (8.5 x 2.8 x 600dpi x 600dpi x 3RGB = slightly less than 25mbyte)
3.the server doesn't know the length up front, so transfer encoding type is NONE, with connection close at end.
Actual Results:  
the image is displayed in browser, but unable to save
