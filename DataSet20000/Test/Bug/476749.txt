the 3ed column identified in css as #column_3 has a set css height of 2667px when it should be 2825px or vice-versa 
I'm not going to count nearly 3000 individual pixels.
numbers are proximate
bottom line the height on column_3 is not always interpreted the same it could also be the 1st column not matching the third
regardless the same numbers should always add up to be the same every time
sorry if that is a little difficult to understand i was getting tong tied when you reproduce it you will see what i mean

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load the page a few times
2. scroll to be bottom
3. it should be about the height on the column on the left without getting cut off
Actual Results:  
height of object varies by over 200px

Expected Results:  
height of object should stay the same each time

i was able to reproduce this with no addons via Firefox portable on my desktop so it is not addon related
it happens more often than it does not happen
