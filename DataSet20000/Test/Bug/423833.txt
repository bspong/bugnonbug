Show Only This Frame code uses about: url for error pages, instead of original site url

After bug 423247 (Certificate error for iframe is shown as a dialog instead of an error page, making it impossible to add an exception) was checked in, I wanted to check the new behavior on a page that used to suffer from this problem.

The original URL is on the intranet of my company, but it contained a frame at the top for which no valid security certificate was present. Because the error was displayed in a dialog box, you couldn't easily add the certificate to the exceptions list, unless you copied the URL form the dialog box, and manually went to the advanced options.

After bug 423247 was checked in (even though that mentions an iframe in the title, but this was about a frame), the normal error page was show instead of the dialog box. You can check the result here : <http://img301.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshotyq5.png>

Since no scrollbars are present (due to the way the frame was build), I couldn't read the 'add an exception link'. So I wanted to be clever, and I selected 'show only this frame' in the context menu. Then I saw the normal error page, as you can see here : <http://img329.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshotqb4.png>. Note the URL, which is <about:neterror?e=nssBadCert&u=https%3A//all.alcatel-lucent.com/wps/portal/iframe%3Flu_lang_code%3Den&c=ISO-8859-1&d=all.alcatel-lucent.com%20uses%20an%20invalid%20security%20certificate.%0A%0AThe%20certificate%20is%20not%20trusted%20because%20the%20issuer%20certificate%20is%20not%20trusted.%0A%0A(Error%20code%3A%20sec_error_untrusted_issuer)%0A>.

Then I clicked on the 'Or you can add an exception...' link, but that didn't work. I got into the 'Add Security Exception' dialog box (impossible to take a screendump on a modal dialog, sorry), but clicking on 'Get Certificate' only proceed a 'Attempting to identify the site' warning. The reason is that the URL is the about:neterror URL, and not the one that caused the error.

Maybe should 'Show only this frame' try to show the frame, and not the 'about:neterror' page ? Or the about:neterror page should try to open the dialog box on the original URL ?
