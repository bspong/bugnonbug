Since updating to 2.0.0.12, Firefox no longer lets me change the action assigned to txt

I use MimeEdit 0.60 to change the actions associated with file extensions.
Specifically, I associate the extension ".txt" with a batch file, which calls
a Cygwin shell, which in turns calls "vim" (an editor) so that I can edit the
TXT file in a console window.  This means I can click on local TXT files in my
browser and edit them directly.

This has been working beautifully for months, but suddenly it just stopped working.  Suddenly, when I click on a local reference to a TXT file I just get plain text displayed - no editor.

I looked under Tools -> Options -> Content -> File Types Manage, and TXT was no longer even listed.  So I entered MIME Edit, "deleted" the TXT entry, and added it back in.  Going back to Tools -> Options -> Content -> File Types Manage, I now see it is listed (as it should be), with "text.bat" as the associated action (as always), but clicking on a TXT file to edit it still doesn't work, even when I restart Firefox, etc.  Hmm.

I remember seeing one of these automatic Firefox updates flash by on the screen -- Firefox had re-started at some point -- roughly at the time the edit action for TXT stopped working.  So I checked the release notes and see
http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2008/mfsa2008-09.html -- that has something to do with the handling of TXT files.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Write a simple batch file that opens a text editor on argument %1
2. Use MIME Edit to associate that batch file with files ending in TXT
3. In Firefox, click on a link to a local TXT file, e.g. file://localhost/E:/foobar.txt
Actual Results:  
What happens is that instead of executing the batch file to run Cygwin, calling the editor to edit E:/foobar.txt (as it has unerringly done for the past few months), Firefox simply displays the plain text in the browser.

Expected Results:  
Hitherto, Firefox always ran the batch file associated with the TXT extension, resulting in the creation of a shell console window within which I could edit the TXT file using my editor, vim.

I use Cygwin, a Unix lookalike for Windows.

I associate other file extensions with other actions in a similar way, and all of these actions continue to function flawlessly.  For example, I associate the file extension mbox with a batch file which calls Cygwin, which calls mutt (my mail program) and opens the mbox file for editing.  This continues to run flawlessly.  The batch file in question for calling Cygwin and mutt is identical to the batch file text.bat (the one I am writing about today) except that it calls a mail client instead of an editor.

I have not made any configuration changes in Firefox recently.  The problem just started occuring out of the blue -- as far as I can tell, at the time the latest Firefox update was automatically installed.

Given my entire style of working, not being able to edit a TXT file by clicking on it would be major loss of functionality.  I'm wondering if I could work around this by rolling back to a previous version of Firefox but am not sure how to do that without risking disruption (i.e., losing configuration data).
