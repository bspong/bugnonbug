can't use full screen area after 1.5.0.4 upgrade on Mac OS 10.4 with 23 inch display (Firefox window keeps bouncing to center of desktop)
After updating Firefox to 1.5.0.4, I'm noticing that when I try to drag a Firefox window towards either the left or right edges of the screen, the Firefox windows "bounces" back to the center as if I had dragged the window beyond the allowable screen boundaries. But I haven't in fact dragged "too far"; this occurs even when at the conclusion of the drag, the entire Firefox windows is still within the visible area of the desktop.

It appears that Firefox thinks the allowable screen area is smaller than the actual screen area of my 23" flat screen Mac monitor. Perhaps Firefox is incorrectly calculating screen size in the lastest release on Mac OS for wide screens?

Further strangeness: this doesn't happen 100% of the time. It occurs on about 60-80% of drag attempts. Every once in a while, I'm able to drag the Firefox window close to the edge of the screen. But when I repeat the attempt immediately thereafter to as close to the same location as manual placement allows, it then fails. 

Even stranger: sometimes a single window permits me to drag it all the way to the edge of the screen half a dozen times (even placing the right side of the window beyond the right edge of the display, for example), then suddenly that same window gets "touchy" and begins not letting me move the window away from the center of the screen at all.

I don't think I've restarted my Mac since I was cued by Firefox to update, so I don't know yet if a restart will cause the problem to disappear. I'll restart, retest, and report further.

I verified that I could see this problem with various web sites (http://boxer.senate.gov/ and http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/), so it's not some goofy web site programming (which was my first thought).

I also verified that Safari is not experiencing the same problem on my machine, so it doesn't appear that I've got global machine settings set wrong.
