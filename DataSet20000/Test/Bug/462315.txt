If you hover the ASTROLOGY link at Yahoo.com, it opens a larger window.  My sign is Aquarius, and it is preselected when I am on the site.  Then you hover over the name "Aquarius" and at that point, I want to RIGHT CLICK to make a menu pop up that will allow me to open that link in a separate window.  However, upon the RIGHT CLICK, no menu pops up, instead, it opens Evolution.  This happens 75 percent of the time I do this.  Sometimes it does work.  I have tried this on other signs, it seems that it either starts working when I substitute other signs (because I have tested it 3 or 4 times by then), or maybe it is only on the sign of Aquarius.  I am not sure.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to site
2. Hover over "Astrology"
3. In larger window, hover over the astrological sign displayed
4. Right click to open context menu, at that point, it should open Evolution
5. You might need to change the default sign to your own, or to Aquarius if that is the only one on which this problem happens.
Actual Results:  
Evolution opens about five times. 

Expected Results:  
It should offer a context menu, and I should be able to open my horoscope in a separate window, where I can get a longer version of my daily horoscope.
