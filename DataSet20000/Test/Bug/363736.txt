Displaying extension preferences on Mac causes Firefox to act strange
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; pl-PL; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20060601 Firefox/2.0 (Ubuntu-edgy)
Build Identifier: N/A - reported by extension users

I'm developer of the Notify extension for Firefox: http://notify.torino.pl/en/

I've received a few messages from Mac users, like:
"I can't access the options. Every time I click the options button the Notify window disappears from the screen and then bounces up and down until I force quit from Firefox."

"I double click on it in the extensions window & a huge (from top to bottom)
empty dialog box opens. If I click on the dialog box, it blinks like crazy.
From there, the only way to get rid of it is to quit firefox."

I cannot reproduce it (I have no access to a Mac machine), and I didn't manage to figure out why it happens. If some developer could look at the problem, I'll be very thankful. Everything seems to be ok on different versions of Windows and Linux, so it could be a bug affecting only Mac.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
(as users reported)
1. Install Notify 0.92 ( from http://notify.torino.pl/en/ or https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/3149/ ) on Mac
2. Try to open preferences windows (from Extensions window or Notify main window)

Actual Results:  
Firefox acts strange - "Notify window disappears from the screen and then bounces up and down until I force quit from Firefox." or "a huge (from top to bottom)
empty dialog box opens. If I click on the dialog box, it blinks like crazy.
From there, the only way to get rid of it is to quit firefox."

Expected Results:  
Preferences window should be displayed correctly.
