On our os ( qnx ) as well as on windows there is a problem with midle button
scrolling.
The special icon that is displayed while the middle mouse button is pressed
leaves traces up/down ( or left/right as misght be the case ).
This is what happens:
- the special icon gets displayed when the middle button is pressed
- nsWindow:Scroll() is called and we blit the content of the window up or down.
This means that the special icon will be blitted up or down.
- the special icon is redisplayed at the old position, but portions of it are
already displayed up or down, leaving traces.
Please note that the middle button scrolling is disabled on windows ( you have
to change your pref.js in your profile to enable it ).

I think the code that handles the scrolling should clear the special icon off
the screen ( expose the space underneath it ), then call nsWindow:Scroll(), then
redisplay the special icon on the same position.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. In Windows enable the middle button scrolling in your pref.js
2. Click the middle button and hold it pressed over a scrollable area
3. Move the mouse up or down while holding the button down. The traces will appear 
up and down.
Actual Results:  
There are traces left from the scrolling, that are due to the special icon being
displayed while the window is scrolling.

Expected Results:  
No traces should be displayed.

On linux this works, but I guess their implementation of the nsWindow::Scroll()
is not blitting the actual content of the window up/down.
