longrunning firefox instance cannot execute and close dialogs like "add bookmark" or "add RSS"
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Firefox running on Thinkpad T23 XPSP1 with daily "hibernate" and never closing
the browser seems to loose some dialog functions. If I try to add a bookmark for
a page the dialog opens, I choose a destination, and clicking "OK" or "Cancel"
does nothing. The dialog does not close, and the bookmark is never added. Same
is true for live bookmarks. There's nothing I can do to close the "add bookmark"
dialog other than to shutdown firefox.
In this situation, when I close the browser, only the window closes, but I still
see a firefox.exe in the Task Manager or ps output (cygwin tools).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
firefox 1.0.en.zip unpacked, started and running some days without stopping the
browser, only hibernating the laptop at end of workday.
Choose an arbitrary page to bookmark after firefox ran for a week or so.
Actual Results:  
the "add bookmark" window stays open

Expected Results:  
added the bookmark and closed the dialog window
