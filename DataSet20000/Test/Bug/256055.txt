default browser does not integrate winxp taskbar address bar with firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3

When typing an web address in the address bar located on the Windows XP taskbar,
the default browser launches and displays the website.  After setting Firefox as
my default browser, my previous default browser (MyIE2 - www.myie2.com) still
launches.  I have tried uninstalling MyIE2 and then reassigning Firefox as the
default, but Firefox only reports that it is "already the default."  And after
uninstalling MyIE2, the address bar on the Winxp taskbar simply does nothing
when given a web address.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox.  Set as default browser.
2. Activate the address toolbar on the Windows XP taskbar.
3. Type a web address into the address toolbar and press enter.  The previous
default browser will launch.



Expected Results:  
Firefox should launch when it is the default browser and a web address is
entered into the address toolbar on the Windows XP taskbar.

I am using Windows XP Professional (SP1).

I have installed and uninstalled MyIE2, also known as Maxthon.  More
