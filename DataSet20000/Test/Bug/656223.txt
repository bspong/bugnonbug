Yahoo! News gives readers the opportunity to vote (thumbs up or down) on their news stories - but not with Firefox 4.0.1...NOTHING happens!
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1

When you click to vote "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" on a Yahoo! news story, Firefox doesn't just NOT RECORD the attempt do vote - it does nothing at all.  So far, I'd say 4.0.1 is a piece of crap.  Give me back my older, WORKING version of Firefox 3 until you actually get version 4 ready for release.  It obviously is not ready yet.  It works like a beta version.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Yahoo!
2. Read a news story.
3. Just try to vote on the comments that follow the story.  Go ahead.  I dare you.  Just use a dual-processor Intel MacBook Pro.

Actual Results:  
The same as described above.  I ever rebooted the computer.  Same results: none.

Expected Results:  
It should have let me vote ("Up" or "Down") the way EVERY previous version of Firefox did.

After all the answers above, you really can't guess?  IT SHOULD HAVE LET ME VOTE MY OPINION OF PEOPLE'S REVIEWS!!!!!
