Tab drag&drop can confuse tabbrowser

If you heavily drag and drop tabs around, it can happen that tabbrowser loses
count of the tabs and behaves strangely. Symptoms include: a tab can't be moved
to the end; the tab at the end can't be closed with Ctrl+W; when closing the
last tab, a warning about closing 2 tabs is shown; the tabbar can get
"disconnected" from the browser.

This has been reproduced on today's nightly, on a clean profile, in safe-mode.
So it's surely not related to extension problems (no dupe of the FLST bug 304456).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open your homepage and two additional (blank) tabs.
2. Move the third tab to the start and close it.
3. Move the tab with your homepage to the end.
4. Close both tabs with Ctrl+W.
Actual Results:  
Step 3 fails and step 4 results in the warning about closing multiple tabs (if
it works at all). Occasionally, after step 3 the browser is not usable anymore,
since the tabbar seems disconnected (not tabbable, no active tab).

Expected Results:  
Steps 3 and 4 succeed without warnings or errors in the console (I've seen once:
Error: uncaught exception: 2147500037 and some errors in tabbrowser.xml due to
the absence of a tab - such as failing to call removeTab).
