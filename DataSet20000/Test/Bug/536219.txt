PDF printing from Guardian.co.uk loses text at page breaks

This happens in WinXP as well in 3.5.5 (WinXP SP3 on VMWare Fusion on OS X 10.6) (also happened in 3.5.5 on OS X 10.6)

When printing to PDF a web page than spans >1 print page, the page break is messed up so that there are several lines missing from the print out.

This does NOT happen with Chrome on WinXP or with Safari on OS X (i.e. they both print properly).

So far this problem exhibits only when printing from Guardian web pages. Maybe it has something to do with the Guardian option to set text larger or smaller?



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to guardian.co.uk
2. pick an article of sufficient length (spans >1 print page)
3. select printable view (though I think it also exhibits from basic page)
4. file>print
4a. in WinXP, I was using Acrobat Distiller 5 to create the pdf. (file>print select Distiller as the printer).
4b. in OS X, select PDF>save as PDF from the print dialogue.

In both cases the corruption occurs. I did not test with an actual hard copy print.
Actual Results:  
A readable pdf is created but there is text missing at the page breaks.

Expected Results:  
the printout correctly contains all the page text.
