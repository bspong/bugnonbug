Setting the value of browser.sessionstore.max_tabs_undo to a value, is not giving the correct functionality/numbers in Recently Closed Tabs list

While executing the test case 10266 in FF 4.0, FFT (Tabbed browsing), the parameter 'browser.sessionstore.max_tabs_undo' was set to '2' and in the Recently closed tabs list, it is expected to have only two tabs; only two closed tabs should appear. But, all the closed tabs(more than 2) are appearing. Is this
bug the same one?
