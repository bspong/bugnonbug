Flash movies get filled with black

I noticed this happens in Firefox 1.0 (Linux), and also some previous versions.
It doesn't seem to happen in Mozilla, which would suggest that it's not a
problem with Gecko.

What actually happens is, Flash movies become filled with black "boxes". If the
Flash movie updates a certain area, that area will be redrawn over the top of
the "boxes". However, if there is an area which isn't being updated, the "boxes"
remain on top, and it takes a few right clicks to get rid of them. Quite
annoying, and they often reappear soon after anyway.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a website containing a Flash movie (ie. http://www.macromedia.com/).
2. Right click the Flash movie a few times, play with the scrollbar, click the
Flash movie and then the outside document, or switch to a different tab and back.
