When reloading a page or going to a subsequent page of the same IRL, I frequently get a failure to load (still trying to access the page but failing to do so).
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060508 Firefox/1.5.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060508 Firefox/1.5.0.4

This occurs with a tabbed window or a single window. Very rarely will it reload after shutting the window (with Firefox still running in another) or after shutting the tab window and retrying. Usually Firefox must be completely shut down to restore functionality. That delay also seems to affect the load times of almost every site selected.

I had zero problems with 1.5.0.3. This began immediately after upgrading to 1.5.0.4.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Firefox Start, Google search.
2.Do one.
3.Leave text the same and do it again.
Next try
4.Firefox Start, Google search.
5.Do one.
6.Do another.
7.Go home (Firefox Start).

Actual Results:  
The first one reproduced. The second one reproduced. Trying to reproduce everything again failed to even get the Firefox Start to load. A continuous and maddening "loading..........................."

Expected Results:  
Immediately did what I asked it to do (IOW, just "do it", and be quick about it.

I have no themes installed or activated but the default. No crash info. Just doesn't respond during the "loading". Doesn't time out, doesn't error out, does nothing.

WinXP Pro 2002 SP2, fully patched aside from that annoying "Windows Genuine Advantage Notification" patch. No firewall installed as I use an external one in my router. Pentium 4 3.0GHz, 2GB RAM, mirrored hard drive (system, apps). 100Mb home LAN with 8 computers; one wireless, setup in the router with MAC addy only.

No virusses, no spyware, no trojans. All machines are as clean as they can be and still be functional (M$ OSs excluded, of course). Yes, I also use two xenix platform machines here as well (RH and SUSE) so I am well situated and well educated.

At no time during any of this has my CPU usage ever gone beyond 10%, and I kick the snot out of my system. One other XP box does not use Firefox (my wife refuses to use anything but IE [argue what you want, but I keep her system clean anyway]), and I have not upgraded the other XP box from 1.5.0.3 as of yet.

I take precautions when updating anything. Too bad I didn't use my least-used XP box to do the 1.5.0.4 upgrade instead. You guys have been exceptional and perfect every time before.

I hope we can figure this one out or I will have to revert back to 1.5.0.3, along with the hassle to do so.
