text offset downward when using absolute positioning

Absolute positioning works correctly with images (including maps and links), but
text is uniformly offset downward from intended position by about 1 character
height (12 point Arial). This happens uniformly on all pages with all text.  The
first code fragment is good, the second displays the problem:

CORRECT:

<DIV style="top : 0px;left : 0px;
  position : absolute;
  z-index : 40;
  visibility : visible;
" id="Layer16"><A href="XenaduInfo.html" target="_blank"><IMG src="Header.gif"
width="1004" height="80" border="0"></A>
</DIV>

FAULTY:

<DIV style="top : 82px;left : 10px;
  position : absolute;
  z-index : 4;
  visibility : visible;
  width : 600px;
  " id="Layer78">
<!--Title--> <P><B style="font-size : 12px;font-family : Arial;">United States
of America</B></P>
</DIV>


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Display the page above (or any page in www.xenadu.com)
2. Observe downward displacement of text relative to images, clearly in a
dysfunctional position - the title "United States of America" is now behind the
main panel image, when it should appear immediately above it.

Actual Results:  
As stated above.

Expected Results:  
It should have preserved the true absolute positioning (which .. ahem .. MS IE6
does).

This is a small but vital problem that renders www.xenadu.com unusable in Firefox.
Hope something can be done.  Down with Microsoft!!
