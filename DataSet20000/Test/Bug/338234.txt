User accesses firefox preferences dialog with orca, the name of current preference tab can not be reported by orca. It will only issue 'no name' instead of its real name.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch orca and firefox.
2. Open preference dialog.
3. Press Tab to move focus between different items till the focus is moved onto top tab again.

Actual Results:  
The tab name can not be issued to orca, it only set out 'None' instead of its real name, say 'General' or others. Therefore, orca reports nothing when user tabbed focus onto this tab again.

Expected Results:  
The tab name should be reported to user by orca.
