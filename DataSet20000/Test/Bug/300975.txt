Tooltip bug for items in forward/back icon history dropdown from toolbar icon
1. Visit a site with an rss feed. eg http://news.bbc.co.uk/
2. Left click the rss available icon in the bottom right of the browser window.
2. Hover over "Subscribe to 'rss'" popup.

Expect to see a tooltip showing the address of the rss feed appear below the
popup (a la FF1.0) but instead the tooltip gets shown over the mouse-pointer,
which triggers the button and then makes the tooltip disappear before you can
read it.

This seemed to be broken since the patch for it landed. But I think this bug is
the same bug as the following:
1. new profile. opens with homepage.
2. goto www.google.com
3. in the dropdown history list from the back icon hover over the entry.

Here also the tooltip is drawn in the incorect place (over the mouse pointer,
rather than below it as before). So it is this regression i have actually found.
(assuming it to be the same effect as the first one)

(note, when hovering to get a history item, an empty and unusually small tooltip
will be drawn, but that's perhaps a seperate bug.)
