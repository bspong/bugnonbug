Hi, Unfortunatly I don't exactly know when this problem occurs. but it happens frequently. I think, when I drag a firefox window to the side of my desktop, it maximizes to half the screens size. this happens without a problem. but when dragging the firefox window away from it's (half)maximized position, it freezes after about half a second. you can't click anything(not even other programs) and you aren't able to mouse over your windows 7 menubar at the bottom of the screen. the way to get it working again is to alt-tab. then everything returns to normal, and the firefox window jumps back to its (half) maximized window. only then, the firefox menu isn't visible anymore. if you click on any menu item the border of the menu box appears, but the menu it self is totally empty and transparant. unmaximizing firefox gives the same problem once the problem already has occured. dragging will freeze everything and alt-tabbing will restore it to the previous location. closing and restarting firefox solves the problem, but eventually it happens again after about half an hour. you can still browse the webpage without a problem after the problem occurs and the window is restored to its previous location.

I recently installed firefox personna plus and use a personna. can this have anything to do with it? haven't tried if the bug happens with the default theme.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
I THINK...
1. dragging a firefox window to the side of a windows 7 desktop
2. dragging the window away from it's half maximized possition
3. freezes after half a second, while dragging
Actual Results:  
everything freezes except the mouse.
can't click anything, windows menu bar becomes inaccessible.
alt-tab restores everything to the previous possition.
the firefox menu is now empty and transparant when clicked on
firefox reboot fixes everything


personna theme: firefox tail twister
