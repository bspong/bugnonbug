Activating controls by mouse

Steps to reproduce:

I tried to type to an input or textarea field or even to the address or the search bar.


Actual results:

Sometimes when I try to type (anything to the only possible input), existing text won't dissappear nor my input won't appear.
Tried to click in (input or textarea field, address bar or similar) - no cursor; double-click doesn't mark existing strings to edit contents.
I don't know if it is a problem of Firefox. Now I have 'MouseActivate' installed which makes me able to scroll esp. within Explorer windows without explicite activating the belonging control (move the cursor to the tree control enables to scroll there; move it to the file control enables to scroll even there.)
I know I former had a similar program, but i did not have the prob with not-existing cursor within activated controls.
Now I have to type or delete to see if a cursor may be there. Hit 'return' may also not do what it should do - mostly nothing happens; so I have to move the pointer and click.


Expected results:

Clicking an input field should mark existing text or at least let the cursor blink. A "submit" button should work by pressing 'Enter'.
