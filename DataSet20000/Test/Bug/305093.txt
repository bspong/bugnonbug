Firefox caches login information even with logout or reopening browser

I have more than one GMail account. When I try to logout of one to check
another, I keep getting re-logged in to the first account. I've tried logging
out manually, closing and reopening the browser, no dice. Consider this a
significant security problem, short of clearing the cache (not always practical
for novice users) there doesn't seem to be a way to login to a different account.

This could be an issue with GMail, but this problem is NOT reproducable under IE
or Safari.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.gmail.com
2. Login to account
3. Click "Logout" in upper right hand corner
4. Login as a DIFFERENT GMail user.
5. Look in the upper right part of the window, notice that you are still logged
in as the first account you tried.

Actual Results:  
I remained logged in as the first account, regardless of the number of attempts
to log out.

Expected Results:  
I should have been logged out and been able to login to the other pertinent
accounts.

This is a vanilla install of the latest version, I just installed it an hour ago.
