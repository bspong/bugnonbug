clicking on a mailto: link with pre-populated subject= content doesn't work with gmail.  it simply causes firefox to end up in a locked loop.

this is easily reproducable at the below URL by clicking on the link to "please email us"

notice that the URL that FF interprets also isn't correct.

i recognize that it needs to be rewritten for gmail but it should be similar to this:
devices@songbirdnest.com?subject=MTP%20Device%20Compatibility&body=Hello%20Songbird,%0A%0AMy%20MTP%20device%20works%20and%20it%20isn't%20listed%20on%20the%20Songbird%20MTP%20Device%20Compatibility%20wiki%20page.%0A%0AHere's%20what%20I%20tested,%20you%20should%20consider%20adding%20it!%0A%0AManufacturer=%0ADevice%20Model=%0ADevice%20Type=%0ASongbird%20Version=%0AAddon%20Version=%0ACapabilities=%0AAdditional%20Comments=

instead it's interpreted as:
https://mail.google.com/mail?view=cm&tf=0&ui=1&to=devices@songbirdnest.com&su=mtp%20device%20compatibility&body=hello%20songbird,%0A%0Amy%20mtp%20device%20works%20and%20it%20isn%27t%20listed%20on%20the%20songbird%20mtp%20device%20compatibility%20wiki%20page.%0A%0Ahere%27s%20what%20i%20tested,%20you%20should%20consider%20adding%20it!%0A%0Amanufacturer=%0Adevice%20model=%0Adevice%20type=%0Asongbird%20version=%0Aaddon%20version=%0Acapabilities=%0Aadditional%20comments=&fs=1

note: it appears that subject= gets truncated and other issues fail.  might be a gmail issue too?

Reproducible: Always
