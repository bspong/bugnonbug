Browser is not 'seeing' my Java-VM
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6a) Gecko/20031002 Firebird/0.7+

The cited page includes a link for the "Interactive Sky Chart" that evidently
uses java.  On clicking it, the received message has Mime-Type
Application/X-Java-vm.  

I do have a Java installation: Sun JDK-1.4.2.  It was installed /after/ my very
first FIrebird installation.  The browser, however, doesn't know what to do with
that Mime-type.

BTW, I've stuffed the most-likely plugins from elsewhere into the
<firebird>/plugins directory.  It didn't help - but at least it didn't hurt.  
For the present, we need to recognize that many plug-in installers aren't going
to recognize Firebird.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to cited page; locate the button for the Interactive Sky Chart - near bottom
2. Click on 'view sky chart'
3. OBSERVE ERROR MESSAGE in the new window opened; click "Get the Plug-in"

Actual Results:  
"Get The Plugin" is displayed; clicking that shows the type "application/x-java-vm"

Expected Results:  
Loaded/activated the applet for the skychart.
