While trying to import data using the Import Wizard, and not selecting
'Bookmarks' for Netscape/Mozilla and Opera, or Favorites for I.E. disables the
next button. Even on reverting to previous display (using back button) does not
enable the 'Next' button.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Import Wizard under File menu and select any one of the browsers in the
listing.
2.Navigate using the Next button and under "Select which items to import" check
off 'Favorites' for I.E., Bookmarks for Netscape or Mozilla.
3.Now navigate back (using back button).

Actual Results:  
On selecting as described above i.e. not selecting 'Favorites' for I.E. and
'Bookmarks' for Mozilla or Netscape, the 'Next' button is disabled.
Not only for this display dialog, but when reverting to the previous display(s),
the 'Next button continues to be disabled and the user cannot navigate further.

Refer Snapshots.

Expected Results:  
If selecting the 'Favorites' or 'Bookmarks' is mandatory and not doing so
disables the 'Next' button, then on reverting to previous selection screen, the
'Next' button should be enabled.

Refer Snapshots.

Follow up tests
---------------
1. Tried verifying the same behavior with different combinations of the options
provided, however only checking of 'Favorites' or 'Bookmarks' causes this behavior.
2. Went ahead and imported the checked items and then re-imported the data from
the same browser(s). *Instead of prompting or updating/appending the existing
bookmarks, a new bookmark directory gets created and so we have redundant
bookmark information from the respective browser(s).

Importance of the bug
---------------------
1. It seems that somehow navigation within the Import Wizard is entirely
dependent on what selections the user makes from the choices listed. This is
obvious when the user finishes selection and wants to go ahead and import data.
However if the user wishes to revert or change some previous selections
(profile, browser) then the navigation should not be dependent on the choices
selected. 
This bug indicates 'feature interrrupting feature' and prevents ease of use
(since  one has to cancel and reopen the wizard everytime the big occurs).
