These are contests that all entry on a daily basis. What I have noticed is that
even though I have enabled the "Save Form Information" option when I revisit the
pages to enter the contests again, sometime the stored form data is there and
sometimes it is not. I can click in the fields in the form and press the
down-arrow key and sometimes the stored information for those fields is
available, other times nothing happened. It seems to be somewhat random as to
when it does or does not work. I did notice that the emptying the cache and
restarting the browser seemed to help but that may have just been a coincidence,
as the problem is sporadic in nature.
