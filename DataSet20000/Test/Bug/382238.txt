On some web pages the scrolling stops working, when mouse pointer comes over certain parts of the table. In the given example the problem area is the lower part of the left (green) column of all pages of the opensuse.org wiki, under the text. 

Distribution: Gentoo.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://en.opensuse.org/Documentation 
2. Put mouse pointer over the leftmost vertical green bar under the text. Try moving the wheel.
3. Put mouse pointer over the text on the green bar or outside the green bar.  Try moving the wheel.
Actual Results:  
In (3) everything works. In (2) scrolling doesn't work.

Expected Results:  
Vertical scrolling should work everywhere, as it does in Konqueror and Opera. The page does not contain frames or iframes or plugins.
