whenever a "captcha" is shown to verify human login, the captcha is invisible. I go to (gasp) IE and do the sign up, then go back to FF.  Some pictures are also invisible, but I have not found a pattern to this problem.  It seems to "come and go" or to at least be inconsistent enough to evade being repeatable.  Also, when I use "no squint" add on, pictures are invisible IF I set the background color.  Pictures appear if background setting is disabled in no squint.  I do not know if this is FF bug or no squint bug...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to a site which uses a captcha in the sign-up process
2.the picture in the captcha window will be invisible
3.the same site works fine with IE

Actual Results:  
the captcha image is invisible, making it impossible to read it and type in the characters

Expected Results:  
the captcha image should be visible

Sporadically, the captcha will show up on a page when other pages have no visible captcha, but I have not been able to repeat this.
