"Keep Until I close Firefox" cookies option doesn't always delete cookies on FireFox close

If the Main / Startup option
    "When Firefox Starts" 
is set to 
    "Show my windows and tabs from last time", 
then *ALL* FireFox session cookies are preserved between FireFox sessions, 
not just those of windows and tabs open when FireFox shuts down. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set Main / Startup option to "Show my windows and tabs from last time", 
2. Set Cookie options to "Keep Until I Close FireFox"
3. Go to site (e.g. www.bing.com) with cookies. Go to another site.
4. Close Firefox.
5. Start Firefox. View the cookies. 
Actual Results:  
The "session" cookies for www.bing.com (and any other sites visited) have been preserved between sessions. 

Expected Results:  
Cookies not preserved between sessions. In particular cookies of sites not currently opened should not be preserved.

This has privacy implications. If this is the intended functionality, then the user should be warned when setting "Show my windows and tabs from last time" that FireFox sessions will not end when FireFox closes and ALL session cookies will be preserved.
