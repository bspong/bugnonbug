I can't see embedded pics
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)

I installed Firebird but it is not displaying embedded pics.  I went to eBay to 
an item but when I went to the product info, I could see the words, 
description, etc., but I could not see the posted photos.  I deleted Firebird 
and completely re-installed the browser.  Still doesn't work.  I installed 
Mozilla and it shows pics(links) fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to:  http://www.manuelstavern.com/(in Mozilla)
2.go to:  http://www.manuelstavern.com/(in Firebird)
3.

Actual Results:  
In the Firebird Browser, the ONLY THING I CAN SEE is an orange background and 
the paragraph, "The New York Times Magazine (October 7, 1984) .........."

If I hover the mouse over the links (which I can't see where they are), the 
cursor changes to the pointer.

However, in the Mozilla Browser (& in IE) I can see the the red border on the 
left with the links (Daily Menu, Catered Parties, Trivia Night, etc.).  I can 
see the title "Manuel's Tavern" and the picture of the old man & horses 
underneath. As well as the paragraph.

Any suggestions?
