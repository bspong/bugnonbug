NTLM auth not working for extensions in Minefield

I use Firefox in our intranet environment. That means that I rely on the functionality of (automatic) NTLM authentication to access all stuff that is in the intranet. This works fine for Firefox 2.x but with recent Minefield builds I run into an issue.

example:

I have an address for a webservice: http://it.mycompany.com/WebService

I can open this address in Firefox 2 and Minefield without getting asked for my NT password. That is fine.

Now, I have an Firefox-Extension that uses the webservice to pull data (SOAP) and do something to it. This extension does also work fine in Firefox 2.


Watching the traffic I see that every call to the given address results in
- a first non-authenticated call that returns a 401 and asks the browser to authenticate
- a second call where Firefox/the extension sends NTLM auth data along with the request and finally gets the response


But when the extension is used in minefield it does try to call the address, gets the first 401 response and stops. It does not issue the second request.


Note again that in Minefield it does work but not in the extension running in Minefield

Also, it makes no difference whether I use automated NTLM ("network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris" set to "it.mycompany.com") or have the auth dialog come up ("network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris" not set)

Reproducible: Always
