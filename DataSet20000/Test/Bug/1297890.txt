DevTools CSS Rules Inspector incorrectly collapses list-valued properties whose list entries are only separated by CSS comments (sometimes changing valid values into invalid ones)
Created attachment 8784607
testcase 1

STR:
 1. Load attached testcase.
 2. Inspect any of the three lines of text, in the CSS "Rules" view.
 3. Compare to the "computed style" view to see what actually took effect.

ACTUAL RESULTS:
- The "rules" view shows the original author-provided styles, with the comments removed, which converts e.g. 1/*ThisIsAComment*/2; into "12", and "5px/**/0/**/0/**/20px/**/;" into "5px0020px".
- It also strikes out the last one ("5px0020px") as being invalid CSS, despite the fact that the actual declaration (with CSS comments) *does* parse successfully and does get honored, as you can see in the rendering & the computed-style view.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- The "rules" view should preserve CSS comments inside of a CSS property's value.  Or, it should collapse them away to "/**/", if needed. Or replace them with a blank space -- that would be fine with these properties, at least, though I'm not sure if it's fine in general.


For comparison, Chrome preserves the comments in their entirety, in its equivalent of our DevTools "CSS Rules" view.
