A web page uses javascript to vary the src attribute of
an image tag by reading in graphics files from an array.This is done
automatically using the setInterval method or manually via user
control. When the array is exhausted, javascript uses the
window.location function to jump to a new page.
If manual, back button returns to the previous page in its initial state.
If automatic, back button returns to previous page in its final state.

If javascript tries to load a non-existent picture file just before
calling window.location, in automatic mode the back button returns to
previous page in initial state.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.load page
2.use javascript to alter content (img.src="newpicture")
3.use setInterval (or setTimeout) or not.
4.use window.location to new page
5.backbutton result depends on whether setInterval was used. 
Actual Results:  
if setInterval running backbutton shows page with newpicture
if setInterval not running backbutton shows page before newpicture loaded
if setInterval running but non-existent file called just before jump to new window backbutton shows page before newpicture loaded

Expected Results:  
same behavior whether or not timer has been set

I have a tar file with pages that show described behavior
