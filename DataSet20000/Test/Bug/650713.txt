After setting one option in the privacy options a certain way, many other options are temporarily grayed out, and are not ungrayed when they normally would be.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Tools->Options.
2. Click the Privacy tab.
3. Set "Firefox will:" to "Never remember history".
4. Set "Firefox will:" to "Use custom settings for history".
-- Since "Permanent Private Browsing mode" will be checked off, many of the options below it will be disabled.
5. Uncheck "Permanent Private Browsing mode".
Actual Results:  
The disabled checkboxes underneath "Permanent Private Browsing mode" remain disabled.

Expected Results:  
The disabled checkboxes underneath "Permanent Private Browsing mode" should become enabled, like they normally would.

I can re-enable the checkboxes without closing the window by setting "Firefox will:" to "Remember history" and back. From there, checking and then unchecking "Permanent Private Browsing mode" will behave normally.
