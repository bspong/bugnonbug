During web browsing, particularly if I have multiple tabs open firefox starts to consume 200,000K. The only way to stop it is to use the task manager to kill firefox and start a new session. Sites that are flash heavy or include lots of exotic display methods will bring about the issue faster than others. A funny site that I found brings it about is Bugzilla's Firefox search portal, which repeatedly made the memory issue occur.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open multiple tabs (7-10)
2. Visit flash sites
3. Wait a moment. Check task manager if your computer can still even function. 
Actual Results:  
Massive hike in memory usage. Firefox is rendered useless.

Expected Results:  
Not commit suicide when I try to use it.

This error only seemed to occur some time after the introduction to firefox3. I've been dealing with this problem for many months.
