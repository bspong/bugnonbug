Investigate icons that load during startup but aren't displayed
In addition to the icon covered by bug 1363040, when I load Firefox and just display the start page I see various other icons loading that are not actually displayed. We should investigate whether we can and should avoid loading these icons and spin off bugs as appropriate.


chrome://browser/skin/toolbarbutton-dropdown-arrow.png

  I thought this was part of the magnifying glass in the search
  field, but that doesn't seem to be the case since the arrow
  there is baked into the magnifying glass icon in
  chrome://browser/skin/search-indicator@2x.png


chrome://browser/skin/places/bookmarksToolbar@2x.png

  This doesn't seem to be the icon we use, even after clicking
  on the bookmark icon (this has rounded corners on the right
  hand side, but the one we use seems to be joined to the
  bookmarks menu button without the corners at the join
  being rounded.

  These don't seem to be displayed


chrome://pocket/content/panels/img/pocketmenuitem16@2x.png

  Seems like this should only be displayed once the
  Pocket button is actually clicked. (And it seems like we
  should be using chrome://pocket-shared/skin/pocket.svg
  with an appropriate -moz-context-properties fill rather
  than this PNG icon.)


chrome://browser/skin/search-arrow-go.svg#search-arrow-go-inverted

  The default them uses the non-inverted icon, so it seems
  like we shouldn't be loading this inverted one before
  then going on to load the non-inverted variant
