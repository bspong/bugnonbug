Back button blocked after Iframe submits and is closed.

The example has 4 small pages that demonstrates the problem. The first page calls the second one that has a link to display the third page in iframe. When the third page submits to the forth page, it displays a close link. After closing IFRAME, the history.go(-1) or back button becomes locked, and only a direct history.go(-2) works. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
The example has 4 small pages that demonstrates the problem. The first page calls the second one that has a link to display the third page in iframe. When the third page submits to the forth page, it displays a close link. After closing IFRAME, the history.go(-1) or back button becomes locked, and only a direct history.go(-2) works. 


Expected Results:  
The expected behaviour would be to 
1. remove from the history the "Iframe" where it's closed OR
2. let the history,at least, work back. There are few users that know that the back button has access to the history.

I Think this is a major bug. Everyday we have to use/develop new Ajax applications  and this kind of problem could not be tolerated. 
Also it works on IE...
