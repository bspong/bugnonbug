crash when closing popups and windows in Firefox 1.0.6

error does not seem to be associated with any specific url

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.closing out multiple windows
2.thunderbird is openn in background
3.

Actual Results:  
firefox crashes and displays the memory error.  I have the close out the error
message, and re-open Fire Fox again.

Expected Results:  
simply allowing me to close out any windows without crashing

I made a screen capture displaying the firefox error:  eg, a "memory reference
cannot be read".  Send me an email, and I can attach the file from Paint with my
reply.  It will at least give you the memory addresses, if that would be helpful
information towards what might be happening.  I regularly use software like
Adaware, Spybot search&remove, and Registry Mechanic to keep my system tweeked,
so I am thinking that this might be a valid problem with FireFox.  I use 1.0.6
at work as well, and will get the same crash problem once in awhile there also.
 At the moment I cannot confirm any similarity of memory address locations.
