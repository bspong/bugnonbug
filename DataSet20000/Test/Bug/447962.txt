When scrolling up and down with a fixed background image in place, script based elements like Google ads for example will lag behind and go outside of their nexted table. on www.mypawbook.com you will notice on the right side of the front page there is a shoutbox. if you scroll up and down, the shoutbox will lag behind and go outside of its nexted table and overlap other tables temporarily.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open www.mypawbook.com or any site with a fixed background and google ads
2.scroll up and down
3.notice the script based elements lag behind and overlap other tables.
Actual Results:  
script elements temporarily lag behind and overlap other elements on the page.

Expected Results:  
the script based elements should stay fixed when scrolling up and down.

i even edited my config for firefox to speed scrolling using the mousewheel config edit and it webpages with fixed backgrounds now scroll up and down really fast with no slow downs but the script based elements have always lagged behind temporaily and for a web designer this really bugs me.
