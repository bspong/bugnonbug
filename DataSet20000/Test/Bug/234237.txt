Download of this pages causes firefox to hang indefinitely
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

The download starts, nothing happens, and then the spinning icon stops.  From
then on, no downloads work at all.  The menu on links doesn't appear.  Things
like window resize and switching tabs work ok.  But no new pages can be downloaded.

The browser also ignores commands to exit.  It can only be killed with "kill -9".

This seems to happen with random pages.  Several pages at slashdot have
triggered the bug, though most work.





Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the URL into a tab.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
The tab blanks out, the spinning icon spins for a while but no text appears in
the tab.  Then the icon stops spinning.  The browser is now unable to fetch any
web pages, in that or any other tab.

Expected Results:  
Display the web page, of course.

This was the first thing I tried after installing firefox 0.8.  The reason for
this is that this page had just hung firebird 0.7, and I was curious as to
whether it had been fixed in firefox.  So I started firefox, went to the same
slashdot pages, and it hung in the same way as firebird.

Note that the browser can only be killed with "kill -9" (or "Force Quit" on the
Mac).
