Clicking on a link to a page that is wide enough to have a horizontal scrollbar from one that does not, then clicking on another link, then going back through history until the first page leaves the horizontal scrollbar on the bottom of the screen. If you scroll down, it remains on the same place on the webpage. If you scroll up so that it is out of view, then scroll back down, it is gone again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. From http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&limit=20&offset=120&ns0=1&ns6=1&ns12=1&ns14=1&redirs=1&search=gold, click on the thumbnail of 'File:Gold Class.jpg.'
2. Click on the picture in the page that loads.
3. Press the 'Go back one page' button twice, so that you are back at the first page
Actual Results:  
An image of the scrollbar remains on the bottom of the window.

Expected Results:  
The scrollbar should not be there.

The scrollbar scrolls with the rest of the page. Once it is scrolled out of view, it disappears again.
