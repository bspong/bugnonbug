[ActiveX] javascripted controls frequently fail with activex plugin / windows media player combo

* Summary:
Windows XP, Firefox 1.5, Plug-in for Hosting Active X controls(npmozax.dll) version 1.0.0.4

When Windows Media player is loaded through the ActiveX plug-in, scripted controls (through document.MediaPlayer.controls) will often--but not always--fail.

If such a control is implemented and failing, nothing happens when the control is used, and the Javascript console reports simply: "document.Player.controls has no properties"

* Test case: 

An example of the plug-in failing to work can be found here:

http://www.accuradio.com/testffax/noframes.html

Note that this example will fail most of the time, but not all of the time.  There seems to be no pattern: it did not always work the first time, it did not always fail the 5th time, etc.  In our experiments on different machines on different days, the success rate was around 50% at best, 5% at worst.

* Steps to reproduce error

- Load the wm activex control into a web page using the <object> tag
- Attach a javascript start, stop, next, etc. controls
- Try it
- Reload your test page several times and test to observe the controls alternately failing and working

* More notes:

Windows Media Player version: 9

Properties are still gettable: document.Player.currentMedia.getItemInfo(), for example, works (demonstrated in example above)

Events are still thrown: currentItemChange() works (demonstrated in example above) 

Loaded extensions:
- Dom Inspector 1.8
- Talkback 1.5
- User Agent Switcher 0.6.8
- Fasterfox 1.0.3

This has been tested on machines with NONE of these extensions loaded (save Talkback), and the results are the same.

Firefox 1.0.7 and appropriate plug-in, no problem.
IE, naturally, no problem.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the wm activex control into a web page using the <object> tag
2. Attach a javascript start, stop, next, etc. controls
3. Try it
4. Reload your test page several times and test to observe the controls alternately failing and working
