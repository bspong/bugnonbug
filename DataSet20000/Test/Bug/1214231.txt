HeapAnalysesWorker should respond with census tree nodes rather than census reports
The census tree node is designed to be fed into a tree view widget and be super easy to render. It's like a lower level IR between the initial report generated by taking a census and the final result of a tree UI displayed to the user.

Because going from census report => census tree node doesn't touch the DOM and is a pure function, we should really do it in the worker rather than on the main thread. We talked about this while writing the census tree node stuff, but haven't actually put our money where our mouth was, so to speak. We should do that.

In summary, the situation right now is (or is on the way towards being):

1. Main thread sends census request to worker
2. Worker takes census of snapshot to generate report
3. Worker replies to main thread with generated census report
4. Main thread turns report into census tree node
5. Main thread renders tree widget UI with census tree node

But (4) doesn't need to happen on the main thread, is O(size of report) and therefore potentially slow, and therefore we should avoid janking the UI and do it in the worker like so:

1. Main thread sends census request to worker
2. Worker takes census of snapshot to generate report
3. Worker turns report into census tree node
4. Worker replies to main thread with census tree node
5. Main thread renders tree widget UI with census tree node
