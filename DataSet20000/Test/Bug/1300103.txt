Context menu is wrongly displayed if using the left click in the viewport while Touch simulation is enabled
[Affected versions]:
- Firefox 51.0a1 (2016-09-02)

[Affected platforms]:
- Windows 10x64, Mac OS X 10.11.1, Ubuntu 16.04x64

[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Launch Firefox.
2. From about:config, enable the devtools.responsive.html.enabled pref.
3. Open RDM.
4. Enable Toggle tools.
5. Hold the left click pressed in the viewport.

[Expected result]:
- If the click is pressed while the cursor is over an element, that element is correctly selected and if is pressed while the cursor is not over any element from the page, nothing happens.

[Actual result]:
- The context menu is displayed. Here is a screencast of the issue: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-cUbHVNThEKQWpucHNKMVd4YWs

[Additional notes]:
- Note that if the left click is used in the viewport in an area where is no element to be selected. the nearest element from the cursor is selected(from my point of view is not en expected result).
