Single window mode does not work for external links
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6

Please note the user agent string is incorrect as I had to change it in order to get into sites that do not accept FF2 :-( This is the OS/2 Warp build.

Since running *any* version of FF2 I have been unable to get external links to open in a new window.  I have *every* setting I can find on google WRT opening new windows in tabs set in about:config and a link
from an external program *still* opens in a new window. :-( 

browser.link.open_newwindow 3
browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction 0
browser.tabs.showSingleWindowModePrefs true
browser.windows.loadOnNewWindow 1
browser.link.open_external 3
browser.link.open_newwindow 3

Messing with these settings makes no difference. (BTW is changing in about:config enough or do you need to bounce FF?)

I think it also might have been the case with 1.5 but I was using Tab Mix + which has a "force single window mode" that works. However, there is not a FF2 version of that add-on.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use any external program to open a link in existing browser

Actual Results:  
New window opens

Expected Results:  
New tab opened
