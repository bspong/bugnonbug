when I close a tab I can no longer select a tab and view it, also mouse scroll and side scroll up down buttons stop working.

I have the tabbrowser preferences extension 1.2.8.9
Also session saver .2 I have others but these are the ones that could be related.
I have 100+ tabs open.  I then close a tab that is not viewable on the tab bar because it is far to the right of the first 20 or so viewable tabs.
After closing it I can no longer switch tabs by selection one with the Mouse.  The Mouse scroll wheel is unable to scroll and the up/down scroll buttons are unresponsive, however when I grab the scroll bar left mouse button and and drag the bar and I can scroll that way.  Also control page up and down will still work to navigate through the tabs.  When put in this state by closing a tab, Firefox becomes real sluggish.  Restarting will get me back to "Normal"


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open 100 tabs
2.  Close one that has the tab out of the first viewable 20.
3.

Actual Results:  
Same result in up in the description.
