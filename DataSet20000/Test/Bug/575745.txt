This is most annoying with Yahoo!, but it happens on EVERY website that has an input field on the top of the page. Whether I am starting Firefox, or typing in an address from any given website, when I type in a web address in the address bar, it will reload/refresh the page and put half the address in the address bar, and the other half of the address in the search bar on the Yahoo! page. I have tried this on several Mac computers, Windows PCs in and out of safe mode, and it happens 100% of the time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to Yahoo.com
2.use my mouse and move to the address field
3. start typing in an address in the address bar
4.half of the address will wind up in the "search" field on the Yahoo page

I put my cursor in the address bar, but when i start typing, in the middle, it jumps to the "search" field, so half of my address is in the address bar, and the other half is in the search bar. For example, I start typing google.com. "google" will be in the address field. ".com" will be in the search field.
Actual Results:  
Well, I have part of the address in the address field and the other half in the Yahoo search field. So, I have to delete all that and start all over again. This will only happen the first time you enter a page. 

Expected Results:  
Well, when I do the same thing in Safari, I open a window and go to Yahoo.com, it automatically puts me right at the input field, but if I start typing in the address bar, it doesn't force me back to the input field, like Firefox does. So it's not Yahoo's problem.
