Bug 574654, which landed in Firefox 4.0, removed browser.tabs.tabMinWidth and browser.tabs.tabMaxWidth in favor of CSS min/max width style rules.  As part of this bug, it was advised to use the custom tab width addon (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/custom-tab-width/) by Dao Gottwald. Other addons like Classic Compact Options (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/classic-compact-options/) followed Dao's suggested model for restoring the ability to customize the min & max widths of tabs (a feature CCO has had since FF3.0).  Now Bug 465086 has landed in FF5a2 to stop tabs from resizing when tabs are closed until the cursor leaves the tab bar.  The problem is, the "fix" in bug 465086 stops working if Dao's solution is applied to restore functionality lost because of bug 574654.

Given that bug 574654 and the suggested solution to restore functionality lost in bug 574654 landed first in FF4. The "fix" in bug 465086 needs to be reworked to accommodate Dao's min/max width CSS solution.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the Custom Tab Width add-on https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/custom-tab-width/
2. customize min and max tab widths
3. Open a bunch of tabs.
4. Start closing tabs

Actual Results:  
Tab widths jump around

Expected Results:  
Tab widths stay the same.
