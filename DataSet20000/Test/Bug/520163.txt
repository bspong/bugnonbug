Vista: Firefox is already running...
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.14) Gecko/2009082707 Firefox/3.0.14 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.14) Gecko/2009082707 Firefox/3.0.14 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

This is an ongoing issue, however, I do not see any Vista postings. This issue is a pita for me, an IT Specialist, I can only imagine that the layman will tire of this very quickly and cease using Firefox and begin or return to using I.E. The longer this issue persists the greater the impact to the Firefox user base. 

I attempted to adjust profile permissions but the profile was not where the instructions indicated it should be. I looked for the profile elsewhere, did not find it, and do not want to waste any more time trying to debug something that should 'just work as is'. I see I.E. doesn't have this same issue.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Issue: After having used and closed Firefox an attempt is made to open it again. Most times this works, other times a ritual is required to end the running process prior to re-instantiating Firefox. 

Actual Results:
