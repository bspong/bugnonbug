Regression: can't get session history list immediately

Previously, I could popup the history list immediately with a single click. I now (4.0b1) have to hold down the back or forward navigation button quite a while before the history list pops up and I can make a selection from the list. This is very annoying, and a real regression. Moreover, in MacOSX it is standard that the menu pops up immediately when you drag the mouse down after pressing the (popup) button. This does not happen with the navigation buttons in Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press the back or forward button
2. Drag down the mouse, while holding down the mouse button
3.
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
The history list should pop up immediately. Moreover, there should be an area which when I click it pops up the history list immediately,as it was in earlier versions.

So what I propose is that both:
1. If I hold down the mouse and drag the mouse down, the history list pops up immediately.
2. The navigation buttons should again have an area where when I click it the history lists pops up immediately.
