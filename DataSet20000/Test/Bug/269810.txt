When on kuro5hin.or, http://www.dailykos.org, and other Scoop-rendered sites,
clicking on links leads to stalling and (most often) total lockups. Pages open
in other windows stop working, too.  This is a new thing with FF1.  I did not
experience this with 0.9x branch builds.  Does not happen in IE, Opera or Safari.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to page using Scoop (a perl-based dynamic CMS).
2.  Click on a link.
3.  Only occasionally it takes a second link click.

Actual Results:  
The processing icon starts to spin, but the status bar still says page load is
done.  If I wait a minute or two, the page may start to load, but not always. 
Meanwhile all other pages open also stop functioning.  New URL in address bar
yields no response.  About 10% of the time, closing the window of the Scoop site
leads to regaining browser function.

Expected Results:  
Load the new page.

It usually takes 2 or 3 times of selecting Quit Firefox (or apple-Q) for the
program to actually close.  Less than 10% of the time it takes Force Quit. 
Closing usually takes 20 seconds or more from closing of actual windows to
closing of FF from the title bar.

I searched for existing reports.  This is such a specific problem, I did not
find any open or unconfirmed bugs listed.  My apologies if I'm repeating
something already reported.  I love FF!!!
