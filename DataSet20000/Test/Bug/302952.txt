The localstore.rdf has no information about icons size before the first toolbar
customization. Any buttom you put on the first customization outside the
Navigation Toolbar will become small instead the default settings determine
large icons for all buttoms.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a new profile.
2.Go to "View">"Toolbars">"Customize".
3.Drag and Drop the "Bookmarks" icon to the Bookmarks Toolbar. Don't make any
change on the icons size. Let it as default.
4.Click on "Done"

Actual Results:  
Notice that the bookmarks buttom you just placed on the Bookmarks Toolbar is
small instead large as the default settings determine. The other buttoms on
navigations bar are large. 

Now do followed:
1.Customize the Toolbar again
2.Click on "Use Small Icons". Click again to dismark it.
3.Click on "Done"

Now all the buttoms are large include the Bookmarks Buttom...

Expected Results:  
It should always act as determined by icon size settings...
