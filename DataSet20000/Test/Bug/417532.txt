Heavy memory and processor load (F3B3)

Have tried both Firefox 3 Beta 2 and Firefox 3 Beta 3 versions.  Memory performance actually seems worse than with Firefox 2.  Intermittently, when I open Firefox 3, the browser halts, and Task Manager shows the memory usage steadily climbing above 200,000 MB, before it stops, and then starts releasing memory.  At the same time, the CPU usage spikes to almost 100%.  This occurs after my startpage (Google), has already loaded, with no other browser action.  Aside from a few resource light options running in the taskbar, this occurs while no other application on my system is running.

The degree of resource consumption doesn't seem to be consistent.  Sometimes, I am able to open the browser and surf for a while before memory chokes.

Possibly related to this, when I exit Firefox (without a crash), if I check the Task Manager, is shows that Firefox is still loaded, and consuming memory.

I classify this as critical, because the memory leak which seemed to improve at the end of Firefox 2, seems to have been "unfixed".

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox 3 Beta 3
2. Allow startpage to load, take no other action in browser.  Open Windows Task Manager, observe resource usage.
3. Close Firefox.  Open Windows Task Manager, observe resource usage.
Actual Results:  
See details.

Expected Results:  
Memory usage should be much lower, considering that the only page loaded was Google (and as this is the Beta version, I have practically no plugins running).  Coincidentally, Firefox never seems to obtain the memory caps set in about:config.
