There's an incompatibility "somewhere"
I have invidia Gforce screens set to (usually) 32bit colour
TomTom software uses "my browser" as interface
but data from the unit results in showing such a difficult gamut of colors that it it illegible.
It could just be a bad Tomtom s/w release but it works in M$ browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start tomtom home
2.access TT720 
3."connect to computer" choice yes
4.FireFox starts sutomatically
5.Tom tom home program
6"Operate unit" choice yes
7Mono text screens at start OK
8 Any colour screeen has illegible text.
Actual Results:  
At step 8, the text is not malformed in any way, but the composition of the letters is made in an extremely difficult manner. Remember back in the 286 days when PCXs came up in "pseudo color" gamuts? just like that.

Expected Results:  
I expected to read text normally ??

It could be:
Tomtom fault, eg non standard color settings
Windows setting
Nvidia problem
Beta-related
(Firefox previous version seemed to work OK
