Firefox unusable due to horrendous performance
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/8.0.552.11 Safari/534.10

At times, FF chews up 100% of my admittedly small CPU (1.2 GHz Athlon64 w/ 2GB memory), sometimes even when there are no tabs open. In other cases, simply clicking on an open FF windows causes FF to be unresponsive for 5-10sec and uses up 100% of my CPU.

Just after startup, FF performs acceptably. I usually open a standard set of 10-12 tabs, but after a certain amount of time (on the order of 10s of minutes), responsiveness disappears and CPU use climbs to 100%. FF becomes unusable. 

I believe that FF's performance issues started with the release of 3.6. (Here's my installation history:

I believe that 3.6.4 was the first release that exhibited horrendous performance. After the 3.6.7 update, I switched to Chrome, and I was hoping that the 3.6.10 update would solve the performance problems. FF does seem better, but performance is still unacceptable, even with the latest release.

Since Chrome on the exact same machine does not exhibit these performance problems, it's likely that FF is to blame.

In the meantime, I have switched to using Chrome because FF is way, way, way too slow to be usable.

I'm willing to gather information to help solve this problem, but I need to be told what to gather, how to gather, and when to gather it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start FF up
2. Use FF for some amount of time (10s on minutes)
3.
Actual Results:  
FF uses 100% of CPU; GUI completely unresponsive; response time measured in 10s of seconds.

Expected Results:  
Acceptable performance, perhaps sub-1/2 second response time.

I have marked this bug "Critical" because FF is unusable in its current state. Even though FF is not hung, it might as well be.
