We have an intranet that begins by opening a new window (windowB) using a link that has javascript window.open (on windowA). From this new window, we have a navigation menu. This menu has (a) some items that open in the same space (same window, same tab), (b) some items that open in a new tab (same window, new tab), and (c) some items that open in a new window (new window, new tab). In Firefox 2, all three of these options worked. In Firefox 3, option b is not working properly. The link (<a href="info.php" target="_new">New Page</a>) opens a new tab in the original window (windowA: the one that the window.open was on).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create page with link to open new window (using window.open)
2. open page in windowA
3. click on link to open windowB
4. in windowB click on link to open new tab (<a href="info.php" target="_new">New Page</a>)
Actual Results:  
Link opens in a new tab in windowA

Expected Results:  
Link should open in a new tab in windowB
