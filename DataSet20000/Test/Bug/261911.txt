This is a split of bug 257375.

Piotr Komoda <gorky@neo.pl> reported

Having translated about:mozilla and about:buildconfig pages requires from us
(localizers) to "hack" toolkit.jar and change mozilla.xhtml and buildconfig.html
in \global. Now, when the whole build process of localized official releases is
covered by mozilla.org, we can't do this modification. Besides, even draft of
trademark policy doesn't allow us to do so.  The easiest way to solve the
problem and (by the way) to make L10n teams life easier is to let us translate
contents of those abouts via .dtd or .properties files, just like in
about:plugins case....

So I'm happy to create a patch for about:mozilla (it's mostly done in my tree),
but about:buildconfig isn't going to happen (besides, if you're geeky enough to
read about:buildconfig, you're gonna have to know the English word for
"compiler" anyway).
