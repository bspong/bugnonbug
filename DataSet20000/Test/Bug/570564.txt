Improve tab overflow navigation

Tab overflow and "tuck" under the new Firefox 4 theme

Currently, we show two little arrows for scrolling tabs left and right when they overflow.

Some problems with the current approach:

1. It's not easy to see at a glance whether there are more tabs to the left/right side, since the only indicator is a very small arrow that gets ghosted if you are at the end of a row of tabs.

2. It introduces two more controls which adds visual noise to the tab bar, which is already quite crowded with the overflow pulldown and the new tab button.

One suggested way of fixing this would be to make sure the overflowing tabs are always shown partially, so instead of requiring discrete UI elements for scrolling to the next tab, you simply click the partially hidden tab, and it scrolls over to reveal that tab & parts of the next one (if it exists). 

This also makes it much easier to see whether there's tab overflow on either side or not, since spotting a partial tab is a more visible UI element than a ghosted/unghosted arrow.

Visual treatment of how this would look under Firefox 4 attached.

The only downside of this approach is that you can't keep the mouse button depressed to scroll several tabs after each other, but need to click instead. Of course, scrolling using the mouse wheel/trackpad still works as before, and a random sampling in the field seems to have people in two main categories: those who use the scroll wheel or those who click once for every tab they want to move over. I haven't seen anyone using the hold-to-scroll behavior yet, possibly because it's hard to know when to stop. I don't claim to have anywhere near representative data on this, though. :)

Frank Yan has a partial implementation of this already, so we can test how it works in practice. He told me he'd attach it once there was a bug on file for it.
