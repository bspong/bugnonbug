Tabs are always restored at startup after closing in Private Browsing mode

If you exit FF in Private Browsing mode, restarting has the same effect as exiting Private Browsing from the menu: pre-Private Browsing tabs are restored. This occurs even if a user has selected "Show a blank page" or "Show my home page" (as opposed to "Show my windows and tabs from last time") as the option for "When Firefox starts". 

Restoring tabs when exiting Private Browsing is sensible, but start-up behavior should be the same whether Firefox was closed in regular or Private Browsing mode. If a user has "Show my windows and tabs from last time" enabled, Firefox should (and does) restore the pre-Private session when Firefox is restarted. But if the user has enabled "Show my home page", the home page should be shown, not the tabs from the previous non-private session. Users can always restore tabs with "Restore Previous Session" in the History menu if they need to. But if a user closes the browser (rather than exiting Private Browsing via the menu), then Firefox should close both the private session and the suspended non-private session unless a user has selected to have sessions restored at each startup.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Start Firefox. Set start-up option to "Show my home page" and set a home page.
2) Switch to Private Browsing.

Actual Results:  
Firefox restores the tabs that were open before switching to Private Browsing.

Expected Results:
