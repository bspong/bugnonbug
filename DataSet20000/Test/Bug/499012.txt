Mozilla is completely CRASHING my computer shutting it down
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I have multiple sessions of Mozilla open on my machine with each session having multiple tabs. One of the websites or sessions becomes unresponsive, I get a pop up telling me that Mozilla has become unresponsive and is ENDING the program now. I also get a pop up asking me if I want to save my tabs before it quits.

It then continues to shut every single program that is running on my computer down and restarts the machine.

This has happened twice in the past 24 hours.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Mozilla, have it on a website
2.(can't make this next step just happen) Website or window becomes unresponsive
3.Once it becomes unresponsive, window's pop's up telling me it has become unresponsive and it is ending the program. (I do not hit end now)
4. Mozilla has a pop up asking me if I want to save my tab's before I quit. (Again I do not hit any buttons)
5. It continues to shut down all programs on my machine and reboot my computer
Actual Results:  
Same thing

Expected Results:  
Should not have done anything to my PC. The program should have allowed Mozilla to be shut down with out restarting my PC.
