If you start to move off a page that has a linked RSS/Live Bookmarkable feed,
but then stop the operation and remain on that page, the RSS icon on the right
side of the status bar remains visible, but will not do anything. The tooltip
"Add Live Bookmark for this page's feed" remains if you hover over the button.

Switching tabs (not windows) and then going back makes the RSS button disappear,
and the tooltip will no longer show up.

Obviously what's happenig is that the new page is beginning to load, and so the
feeds that were available through the RSS button are no longer valid. There
needs to be some sort of cutoff point, like when the next page starts to paint.
At the moment the feeds are disabled too early, but the RSS button itself is not.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a page with an available feed (e.g. http://www.alistapart.com/xmlfeed/ )
2. Click a link but imediately press Esc or Stop.
3. Hover over and click the RSS button

Actual Results:  
Nothing. The RSS button looks like it's still available, but does not popup a
menu when clicked.

Expected Results:  
Either rolled back to the visible page's feeds, or removed the RSS icon as soon
as the user begins to move away from it (by clicking a link, selecting a
bookmark etc.)
