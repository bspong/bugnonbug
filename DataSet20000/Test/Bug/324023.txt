Command line method of setting the default browser
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20051007 Debian/1.7.12-1

I have a build environment for machines which automatically installs an operating system image and applications. As part of this process, where Firefox is installed on a machine I want to be able to silently set is as the default browser for all users on the machine.

I can achieve the effect I want by logging into the machine as Administrator, and setting FF to be the default browser through "Set Program Access and Defaults". I cannot find any way to automate this from the command line easily.

With IE, I can make it take over as the default browser by the simple expedient of running "shmgrate.exe OCInstallReinstallIE", but I can't find any way to go in the other direction, and make Firefox silently become the machine's default browser.

This isn't really a bug, but having an analogous capability added to FF would make network management an awful lot easier for me, and might make it more popular in other business environments.
