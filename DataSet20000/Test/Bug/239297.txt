The Firefox Browser seems to have problems when the browser is open for a long
time, on a page, which is auto refreshing itself.

Window Crashes, and gives :

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to DWaal.net
2. Login as Guest, Using something like "Dumm90"
3. Keep your browser open for about 1 and a half day.

Actual Results:  
FireFox Crashed.

Expected Results:  
Keep on Running.

The Browser is Talking to a Apache Module, Which keeps on the Request for a long
while, and releases it when there is a event. If no events are being send. The
Server  waits "X" Seconds, and answers the client -- which then sends out a
request again.

I don't think a exploit could be created from this (normal people don't have
their browser that long open on a site). But since it really crashed (i have now
seen this 3 times) I have marked the Security Flag
