Log-in problems with some websites, but mostly www.linkedin.com
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.2) Gecko/20100316 Firefox/3.6.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When I attempt to log-in to my LinkedIn account, Firefox gets stuck in a loop and does not actually transmit the log-in and password to the website.  If I use internet explorer I can access the LinkedIn website without difficulty.

This happened with another website, but only temporarily.  However the problem with the LinkedIn website persists.  I have emptied the cache, deleted cookies etc, but still it remains.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to LinkedIn website (www.linkedin.com)
2. Insert log-in and password
3. Click on "enter"
4. Repeat the steps above 3 or 4 times
5. Use Internet Explorer
Actual Results:  
Prior to step 5, I get stuck in a loop of "register or log-in" and "log-in".  Naturally, I choose the "log-in" option from the former as I already have a LinkedIn account.

Expected Results:  
At the "register or Log-in" stage, I should be able to log in to my own LinkedIn profile.
