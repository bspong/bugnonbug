Currently the link target has the odd Chrome-like behavior of omitting http from the start of the URL.

There are several problems with this:

1.) This is very inconsistent, especially when both ftp and https URLs display normally. Why should http get special treatment? Also, why are we assuming that users know a URL without http:// is really a http link?

2.) Eyes have to look in separate places for domain name between http and ftp/https. For http links, I have to start at the edge of the screen to find domain name. For https/ftp links, I have to start after the http://. This is bad because I now have to look in two locations depending on what the url type is. You may think this is a nitpicky thing, but it makes a big difference for me in terms of glancing speed. The link target is supposed to be something that you look at real quick. Having to scan your eyes across the URL to find the beginning of the domain name slows me down.

3.) Without the http://, the URL constantly looks cut-off for links without "www". Often times I'd mouse over a link (e.g. digg.com) and I would think that part of my Firefox window was outside my screen space and that's why the "http://www" was cut off.

4.) Having http:// present is a good reminder to the user that the link target is NOT encrypted. Without it, the user really doesn't have any idea what protocol the link is using.

5.) Removing http:// doesn't save much space and adds more code complexity.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
"http://" is removed for link targets

Expected Results:  
Link targets display http:// in front of URL
