PAC: FindProxyForURL host.length terminates call

The following proxy.pac file works OK and the alert shows up in the JavaScript
Console.  If you remove the comment and allow host.length to print, it doesn't
print, and the proxy host does not get used.  It looks like host.length is
getting an error.

function  FindProxyForURL(url, host)
{
  var proxy = "PROXY 127.0.0.1:8000";

  if (host != null && host != "") {
    alert("Host is " + host);
//    alert("host.length = " + host.length());
  }
   return proxy;
 }



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Put the proxies.pac file in a file.
2. Refer to it in the automatic proxy by file://localhost/path/to/file.pac
3. Verify that proxy host is used and check JavaScript console for printout.
4. Remove "//" comment before host.length line
5. Press Reload on automatic proxy
6. Verify that proxy is not used and and check JavaScript console for lack of
printout.

Actual Results:  
Access to host.length seems to throw an error.

Expected Results:  
host.length should return a number.

This worked until 20050826 trunk build.  I haven't tried intermediate ones.
