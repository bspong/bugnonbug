can't scroll with PgUp/PgDown when "automatically switch to new tab" setting is on

After opening a link using Ctrl-RightClick (so it opens in a new Tab), I cannot use PgUp/PgDown there for scrolling.
I either have to first click on the scrollable area and then use PgUp/PgDown. 
Altertively, I can use the mousewhell to scroll (which is usually not available on notebooks).

This only happens on some sites - I often had it on http://www.iht.com
 
This only occurs, when I use CTRL-LeftClick to open the link in a new TAB.
It does not occur, when I open the same link in a new WINDOW using ALT-LeftClick.

This only occurs, when the Option "Tabs" / "When I open a new link in a new tab, switch to it immediately" is active. 





Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Activate Option "Tabs" / "When I open a new link in a new tab, switch to it immediately"
2. got to www.iht.com
3. use Ctrl-LeftClick to open a link 
4. try scrolling using PgUp/PgDn
Actual Results:  
Scrolling was not possible (unless I click into the scrollable area)

Expected Results:  
Scrolling should be possible
