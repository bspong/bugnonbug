for several days i have observed a full crash of firefox anytime the page being viewed is displaying a .pdf document.  The tabs disappear and a dialog box comes up asking if i want to send the error report and i click yes, have done this 5 times or so in the past couple days.  i was opening a pdf document on a web page, it shows the first pdf page just fine, i was on another tab typing an email when it all went away.  everything i had typed, gone.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. http://www.rollanet.org/~eksi/2008EPHEM.pdf
2. mozilla browser crashes
3.

Actual Results:  
after several seconds the browser crashes and a screen says an error occured, do you want to send data to mozilla.  This has happened on ANY page i have tried that is showing a PDF document

Expected Results:  
past version of mozilla shows the pdf document just fine, as does ie and chrome

It should give a dialog screen saying that an update for adobe .pdf viewer is needed, click <HERE> to get and install the update, then restart firefox to apply changes.

Im guessing that when the pdf is opened, it expects that adobe acrobat reader will open and handle putting the object into the browser, but it doesnt happen and hands off control to some invalid or null pointer.
