Importing Chrome history from places organizer hangs for minutes
[Affected versions]:
- Fx 40 - 47.0a1 (2016-02-16)

[Affected platforms]:
- Win 7 x64

[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Add several bookmarks to Chrome
2. Close Chrome
3. Open Firefox
4. Open Library View
5. Go to Import and Backup/Import Data from another browser
6. Select Chrome and click 'Next'
7. Select all the options and click 'Next'

[Expected result]:
- The import should finish in couple of seconds. All the Chrome's bookmarks should be imported.

[Actual result]:
- The import takes 2-3 min and the bookmarks are not imported. In the browser console appears:
"Error: Transaction timeout, most likely caused by unresolved pending work.
Stack trace:

[Regression range]:
- works fine on Fx 39
- no longer works in Fx 40

[Additional notes]:
- bookmarks are imported if Chrome is running during the import
