[UX] Figure out hover/keyboard interactions in search dropdown
There are a number of different issues here:

- keyboard selection of a search engine, followed by mouse hover over a search engine, followed by enter
- keyboard selection of a search engine, followed by mouse hover over a suggestion, followed by enter
- keyboard selection of a suggestion, followed by mouse hover over a search engine, followed by enter
- keyboard selection of a suggestion, followed by mouse hover over a suggestion, followed by enter

and then for each of these, one could potentially add more keyboard navigation after the mouse hover, before hitting enter.

What we need to know is:

- what happens when you hit enter (which suggestion and which engine get used)
(- potentially: how does the hover affect any keyboard selection after it's happened)
- how do we visualize this as the user hovers/further-keyboard-navigates


It's not obvious what the answers here are. For the location bar we only have one list of 'things', and while it shows hover as 'selection', enter will use the keyboard-inputted (and completed into the input box) item. Only clicks activate the item indicated by the mouse.

We could try to do the same here, but you run into the fact that:
- the search engine is not visible / put in the search box like the URL/search is
- showing two items as selected is confusing
- having two lists means that manipulating both items with both forms of inputs quickly gets confusing.


The one thing we seem to agree on so far is that the current behaviour (hover always influences everything) is unintuitive and messes things up esp. when unintentional mouse moves happen.

Philipp, can you untangle this? :-)
