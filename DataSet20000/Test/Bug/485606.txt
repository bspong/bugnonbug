Important elements, buttons, frames on web pages disappear after a Preferences change

This problem appears on many pages at many sites I've visited. Severity depends on complexity of the page design.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Preferences > Content pane > Colors button  
2.Uncheck "Allow websites to choose their own colors instead of my settings above"
3.Perform the above steps while on www.kcrw.com and you will see the effects instantly; no need to close Preferences.
4. Re-check the box and the page reverts to its correct form. 
Actual Results:  
Web pages hide certain elements, including Javascript buttons, frames, and part or all of tab rows (e.g. the tab name may appear, but its border and colors won't). Also, some frames containing lists don't draw properly (missing or overlapping text). And background colors disappear.

Expected Results:  
Complete, accurate appearance of the web page, but colors for text and backgrounds and visited and unvisited links should be as the user has specified.   

If you know the button etc is there, you can hover the cursor over the point on the page where the button should be and then click it. This will launch the process etc (on www.kcrw.com, starting an audio stream). But, of course, a new visitor to the page can't see what's not (apparently) there.

Being able to change color preferences is minor compared with losing buttons etc. The preference should be disabled until fixed, or a warning added: "Caution: Clearing this checkbox may cause some pages to not appear correctly."
