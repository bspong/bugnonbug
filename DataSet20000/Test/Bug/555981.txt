In previous version of Mozilla the Omnis Webclient messages (Ok - Message, Yes/No Message etc.) were all modal. Therefore it could been used for exception handling. Once a message pops up the user is not able to trigger any other button or field within the Omnis application that runs within the Omnis plug-in. To test this behavior you need to download and install the latest plug-in from the Omnis website: http://www.omnis.net/download/index.html?detail=webeval
After that you may check this at: http://mhlinux.mh.omnis-software.com/v42webgallery/quiz/rfquiz.htm

There is a Start button. Click this without entering any data and the button will ask you to fill out data first. Still with the Firefox version 3.7a it is possible to click on other objects within that app which shouldn't be until the ok message is confirmed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download and install the Omnis Plug-in at http://www.omnis.net/download/index.html?detail=webeval
2. Go to http://mhlinux.mh.omnis-software.com/v42webgallery/quiz/rfquiz.htm
3. Click the START button. An Omnis OK-message appears.
4. Try to click on any other object within the app. 
Actual Results:  
It is possible to click on any other object within the app before the ok message is confirmed.

Expected Results:  
It should be blocked until the ok message is confirmed.

This breaks any exception handling within the Omnis Web applications.
