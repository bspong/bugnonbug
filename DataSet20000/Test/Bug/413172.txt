When printing selected text, via "file" , "print..." then "print selection" to my networked Konica Minolta 2430dl on this Dell with a 700mhz processor and 384 mb ram,  the print job hangs and never gets sent to the printer. It just shows "printing " in the printer status box. This does not occur with firefox 2.0 or IE . And any subsequent print jobs of any type will back up in the queue , waiting for it to finish the first job, which never starts. I can't pause or delete the job without a reboot. Printing entire pages works fine, issue only occurs with selected text. Website does not matter.  It will hang with any site. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.select any  text, any method
2.click "file", "print.."  (or Ctrl+P )
3. check "selection" radio button in "print range section"
4. click "ok"
Actual Results:  
printing never occurs, just sends a print job into queue that never gets sent to printer, while hanging up any subsequent jobs. Only a reboot will allow that job to be deleted.

Expected Results:  
I expected it to print my selection. 

no problems printing entire pages, only selected text
