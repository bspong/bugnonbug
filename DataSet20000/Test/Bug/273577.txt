When popping up a window with Javascript, Firefox visually pops the window up full size and then resizes it

At the URL provided,
http://cosmos.jasonpfeil.com/~pfeil/firefox_window_resize_issue.html, when the
user clicks on the "TEST" link, a window that is the same size as the parent
window is displayed by firefox and then shrunk down to the 200x275 size that is
requested in the Javascript on the page.

Firefox should resize the window to the proper size and move it to the proper
location *before* mapping it.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://cosmos.jasonpfeil.com/~pfeil/firefox_window_resize_issue.html
2. Click on the "TEST" link
3.

Actual Results:  
Firefox pops up a new window the same size as the parent window, moves it to the
new location, and resizes the window.  All of which is visible to the user when
it shouldn't be.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should create the window at the correct location and with the correct
dimensions *before* mapping the window.  Once the window has been created with
the proper dimensions and location on the screen, Firefox should map the window.
