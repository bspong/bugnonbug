crash with segfault if I open this page with certain plugins installed
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050225 Firefox/1.0+

The page listed above causes FF to close without any notification or talkback. 
The page is usually part of a frameset.  You should be able to get it by
navigating to http://www.worldtribune.com and opening one of the news stories in
the middle of the page.  This nightly FF build reports a segfault on the command
line: ./run-mozilla.sh: line 131: 20483 Segmentation fault      (core dumped)
"$prog" ${1+"$@"}
There are no symbols in the executable so gdb wasn't much help.  I found this by
clicking a link on www.drudgereport.com .

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.navigate to url http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/left.htm (part of
frameset but can be loaded separately as part of one of the news stories in the
main page)
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Browser closed without notification or talkback.  The nightly build from 2/25
said it had a seg fault on the command line.  The 1.0 version that came with FC3
just closed without any message or talkback.

Expected Results:  
displayed page contents.

talkback doesn't display.
extensions installed and enabled: CookieCuller 1.1.0 and Flashblock 1.2.9.  If
either one is disabled the page loads fine.
This problem occurs only in Fedora Core 3 with these plugins enabled.  The page
loads fine on Windows XP with FF 1.0 preview release (Gecko/20041001).
The problem may go away if the site changes content.
I was only able to reproduce this problem if I navigated to the site.  If I
saved the page locally (Save Page As) it would load and display fine.
