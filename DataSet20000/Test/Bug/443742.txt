The CSS doesn't load correctly.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.15) Gecko/20080623 Firefox/2.0.0.15
Build Identifier: Firefox 3

Whenever I explore certain sites such as Myspace.com or Forums.facepunchstudios.com the CSS doesn't load correctly. Like some of the text starts bunching up with other text and usually there will be borders around words that wont load, so the words just bunch up in the corner.

The only way that I've found to fix it is to install Firefox 2.0.0.15 but the latest Firefox is the one with the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to one of the mentioned websites in the details
2. Wait for page to load
3. Watch as the page morphs into unreadable garbage
Actual Results:  
Most, if not all of the text becomes unreadable garbage. Usually it bunches up in the corner and then the text starts overlapping. Also the borders and other page elements disappear. This problem makes Firefox 3 almost impossible to use. I'm guessing it's the CSS render.

Expected Results:  
The text loads the way it should, in it's own designated area, not overlapping other text, and the borders load properly, giving the text a place to stay on the webpage.

The only additional information I can give is my system info:

Operating System: Windows XP SP3
CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo 6700
GPU: GeForce 8600 GTS
ISP: Comcast High Speed (I know they suck)

And that all the other Web Browsers I've used don't have this problem.

Opera 9
Apple Safari
IE 7
Netscape
