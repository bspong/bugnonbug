Bookmarks Toolbar does not update after changing bookmark's name

When the toolbar is almost "filled" and a page is bookmarked with a short name
that still fits in the toolbar (does not hide under the arrow marks sub-menu)
and then if the name is changed to something longer, the bookmark does not hide
in the sub-menu. Similarily when the name is shortened - the bookmark still
ramains in the sub-menu, though it would fit in the toolbar. In Mozilla Suite
the displayed name is changed from for example "Googleeeeeeeeeeeeee" to
something like "Googl...". After opening/closing a tab, the toolbar is updated
and everything is OK.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Fill the bookmarks toolbar folder with random bookmarks
2. Add another bookmark with a short name
3. In properities change the name, so that the bookmark won't fit in the toolbar

Actual Results:  
Bookmark's name written off-screen

Expected Results:  
Shorten the name by replacing the end of the name by "..." or put it in the sub-menu
