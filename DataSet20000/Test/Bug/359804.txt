When I have enough tabs open so that Firefox is drawing them at their minimum width, if I scroll to the end of the tab list (possibly a long scroll) then open a bookmark in the sidebar, the scroll position of the tabs is reset to zero: i.e. the leftmost tab in the list is aligned to the left, even if the tabs were scrolled all the way to the right.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open tabs until you have to scroll through them.
2. Scroll to the right until the leftmost tab is not shown.
3. Open (or alternatively close an already opened) sidebar.

Actual Results:  
The leftmost tab of the list is shown 

Expected Results:  
A few possibilities come to mind.

* Keep the rightmost drawn tab the same.
* Expand equally the range of indices of drawn tabs.

There could probably be usability arguments for some other schemes, but the current behavior definitely feels wrong.

When the window is horizontally resized by the window manager, a similar bug occurs, except the tab scroll position is set so that the rightmost tab is drawn at the right.
