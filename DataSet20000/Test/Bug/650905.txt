In FF 4.0, Thunderbird is listed in Edit>Preferences>Applications>Mailto as "use thunderbird (default)" yet clicking an e-mail link does nothing.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:2.0) Gecko/20110414 Firefox/4.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:2.0) Gecko/20110414 Firefox/4.0

In Edit>Preferences>Applications>Mailto, thunderbird is shown as default but it is dead.  It also shows Gmail and Yahoo!mail as selections and they both work but they are not external mail apps.  Clicking below that list on Application Details would only show the Gmail and Yahoo as possible selections without the default T-bird included.  I clicked on "Use Other" and selected /usr/bin/thunderbird with the box checked to use this app alwaysand this provided a working solution.  It is shown as added to the list.  Clicking an e-mail in Firefox now properly brings up a T-bird Write window with e-mail address inserted properly.  So, the solution in Firefox to provide the proper default should be simple, I hope.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure Thunderbird is installed as the active mail program.
2. Open a page in Firefox with an e-mail address, eg., a Craigslist listing.
3. Click on the e-mail address to inquire about the listing.  See Details.
Actual Results:  
Before I made a new Thunderbird link in Edit>Preferences>Applications>Mailto, clicking an e-mail address in Firefox would do nothing.

Expected Results:  
It should have opened a Thunderbird Write window with address already in place.

As stated above, since it was easy to setup a correctly working entry in Edit>Preferences>Applications>Mailto, it should be easy to correct the dead link of "Thunderbird (default)".
