Firefox 0.9 does not compile on Linux (kernel 2.6.7, gcc 3.3.3, glibc 2.3.2)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.9
Build Identifier: N/A

Even after applying the suggested patch 247292, the build does not finish. 
Configuration is

./configure --prefix=/opt/firefox-0.9 \
  --with-system-jpeg --with-system-png --with-system-zlib \
  --enable-default-toolkit=gtk2 --enable-xft \
  --disable-gnomevfs \
  --enable-extensions \
  --enable-optimize='-O2 -march=pentium3' --disable-debug --enable-strip \
  --enable-cpp-rtti --enable-cpp-exceptions

After a few trivial problems like the one mentioned abv. or a bogus 'extensions'
subdir in some Makefile, compilation finally stops when a missing
'nsIExtensionManager.h' is encountered, which seems to be a generated file from
a corresponding IDL file (which seems to be present in the source archive).

Reconfiguring without '--enable-extensions' did not yield any difference.

Where do i get the missing file or how do i generate it?

It should be contained in the source archive or the makefiles should try to make
it (and fail if some necessary IDL compiler is missing).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. configure as described abv.
2. fix the trivial problems
3. make
4. wait ;-)

Actual Results:  
The build fails

Expected Results:  
A successful build
