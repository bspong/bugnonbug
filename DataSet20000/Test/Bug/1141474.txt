selecting a search term from suggestion list does not autocomplete

Steps to reproduce:

Note: The bug happened to me with german wikipedia (de.wikipedia.org) as preferred search engine for the one-click search, so I give steps to reproduce with this search engine, but I guess the bug can also triggered with other preferred search engines. It should also trigger the bug by starting to type other search terms and klicking one of the suggestions

Steps to reproduce (example):
1.) make sure to have german wikipedia (de.wikipedia.org) as preferred search engine in your one-click search (top right input line in Firefox)
2.) type "Konfo" into the one click search line
3.) you should get a few suggestions - among them "Konfokalmikroskop"
4.) click at the suggestion "Konfokalmikroskop"


Actual results:

After clicking one of the suggested words (in my example "Konfokalmikroskop"), wikipedia searched for the initially typed "Konfo"


Expected results:

After clicking a suggested word, the search term should be auto-completed, and wikipedia (or any other search engine if selected as preferred one) should search for the complete search term instead for just the first few letters typed into the search line
