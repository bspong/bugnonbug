Fonts don't show up as I wrote them - Arial isn't Arial, etc...

I designed a few pages with CSS font specs in them. But my browser's settings always override the page's code, even though I have clicked the box that is supposed to let it read pages and use that info. I want pages to display in the code they were written in, not my defaults, and not viewers' defaults especially when I've laid out pages to look good using specific fonts. I'm not sure why things are looking the way they are - serif fonts are coming up as sans serif, etc... and I downloaded a fresh version of Firefox yesterday, thinking maybe I had a corrupted version, but I don't think so. Thanks for being there, and for helping. Overall I love Firefox! :>)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go the the web page, and fonts are not what they should be.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
When I go to the web pages, the fonts called for are not the ones I see. I can change what I see by changing my Options, but I don't want to have to do that. I clicked the button ON that says it will allow pages to use their own fonts, but that isn't working.

Expected Results:  
I want it to go back to the way it was, which was that I could specify fonts and Firefox wouldn't change them to anything else.

The software should leave fonts alone. Website designers design them the way they do on purpose. We design something to look right, then these kinds of bugs mess it all up, causing things to no longer line up. Thanks very much for looking into this.
