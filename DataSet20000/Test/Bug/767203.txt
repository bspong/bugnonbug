Firefox 13 - Constant Lockups In Linux
I'm running the latest Firefox 13.0.1 in Linux Mint 13 x86, on a Dell Laptop N5010
and Slackware 13.37 x86, on a Sony Vaio, both laptops also with completly different hardware and both systems have the exact problem of constant locks up and freezing the entire desktop...

On occassion I'm able to run Ctrl Alt F1 to boot out the desktops to the console to log back in and start over, but many times the entire system is locked up and I have to do a hard shut down, turn the power off and repower on and I'm not enjoying this at all...

I've used Firefox since Firefox came out, and I've been using it that long in Linux and I've never had lockups like this till version 13, but whatever is going on with this version to cause it, it's really bad, this is like every 1-2 hours I encounter this and working all day long needing a browser is a real pain and I hope this issue will be resolved soon.

If I click any section in the toolbar, needing to adjust Preferences, addons, or use the Bookmarks, or add a new tab, Firefox will sooner or later lockup and this is happening on two completely different Linux systems, different kernel versions, different desktops, so the situations between these two systems have nothing in common, except for the fact that this is both Linux, practially all of the system libraries and dependencies are also different versions, there isn't much similarity here  between the two, so that makes me realize this is a Firefox issue, not a system problem.

In Linux Mint I'm using the Cinnamon desktop and in Slackware I use only OpenBox.

Whatever logs or files, information, etc., you'd like from these systems to help resolve this please let me know and I'll submit this, but I hope we can get on this, hopefully since I'm having this on two different systems, I can't believe I'm the only one with this issue...

Also under the Advancved preferences for Browsing I unchecked all these new features, hoping it might help on both systems, but it didn't. 

In Slackware, since I have greater control over it, I've changed two different kernel versions and the Sony has an Nvidia 410M GPU and I've changed three different driver versions and none of this has also helped...

I personally don't know if there is anything I can change, it just feels like a buggy version of Firefox is all...
