Installation of SPKAC generated certificates no longer possible

This bug is about certificates applied for through the keygen tag, sometimes this is also called a SPKAC certificate application.

When applying for a certificate through this way, the private key is stored in the certificate database and only the public key is transferred over the wire. Most of the times, the certificate created from the request is fetched through a web server, having the content type for the file set to application/x-x509-user-cert

With FF up to 1.0.8, it was also possible to install such a user certificate by dragging it from the file system in the browser window. Alternatively, it could be imported through the certificates dialog by going to the "Other people's" tab, where it was put to the "Your Certifcates" tab because a private key existed.

With FF 1.5.0 and higher, this is no longer possible. There is no way to install a user certificate from the file system.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Apply for a certificate through a website using the keygen tag
2. Sign the certificate by some means and transfer it as a file (or email) to the client
3. Try to install the certificate from that file by either dragging it into the web browser

Actual Results:  
Certificate is silently ignored

Expected Results:  
Certificate is installed

As this is breaking functionality that was working in FF 1.0.8 I propose to fix this bug in the next possible minor release. This change in behaviour first of all is inconsistent, and it is breaking used functionality.
