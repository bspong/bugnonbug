Java applet which has a login dialog and i can not put the focus on password field to enter password.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3
Build Identifier: Firefox/3.6.3

n the login dialog of the applet it does allow the user to enter the password in to the field. Password field does not takes the focus. I can not put the cursor in to the password field.
I tried tab key and it is not working. It looks to me that any key on key board is not working. I can see the focus on "Ok" button but when i press "enter" key it does not work. I am able to use the mouse. I can click "ok" and "cancel" buttons of the dialog using the mouse click. If there is no password then i can login to the applet. After that it works normally and all the fields in the applet take focus. But if there is a password set, then i am not able to login as i cannot enter anything to the password field in the login dialog. I have JRE 1.5 on my mac osx. It works fine with firefox 3.0 and has problem in 3.5 and above including 3.6.3.



Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
So it looks like keyboard does not work on the login dialog of the applet. Cursor can not be put in to password field.

Expected Results:  
Keyboard should work on the login dialog and cursor should be accepted in the password field.
