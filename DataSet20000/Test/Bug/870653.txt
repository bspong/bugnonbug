Steps to reproduce:

see bug 867880 if you want to see the thread.
searched tools menu and buttons for debugger/web console


Actual results:

not there, (but at least menu item and or button is in most other browsers)



Expected results:

I suggest for all the web developers out there that you make this debugger available to users via the Tools menu, a button you can add in, in addition to the ctrl-shift-s key combination. it would be most appreciated - because the first I ever heard that firefox had a debugger was from the firebug folks. not from looking at my browser (like normally you would easily find in any other browser in the menus under tools).

the fact that the debugger when you click on step-over which is supposed to step over to the next line, doesn't do that. 

now, we know that one of the functions is undefined. there's no way for me to see that it's undefined without checking the errors, which is in an unseen panel. so I am caught incessantly swapping back and forth between the errors panel and the code panel.

since I do a LOT of page/js debugging, I would personally like to have a the option of a button I can put right in the browser via customization (just like you can with bookmarks, downloads, tab groups, etc).
