Live bookmark loading closes menu when using keyboard navigation
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

I use keyboard navigation (alt+B) for opening my Bookmarks dropdown menu. When I
choose a live bookmark right after opening Firefox, it is not yet loaded, and
indicates that the bookmarks are loading. When they are loaded, however, the
dropdown menu closes, and I have to open it up once more. This is inconvenient
and different behavior than when navigating with the mouse.

As said, this only happens the first time you access the dropdown menu for each
session. However, this is what I do every time I open Firefox, because this is
how I scan for news, and therefore it happens to me every day.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox (it must be just started for the bug to show)
2. Open the Bookmarks dropdown menu by keyboard navigation (alt+B)
3. Use arrow keys to navigate to a Live Bookmark
4. The dropdown menu closes by itself when the bookmarks have loaded.

Actual Results:  
Step 4, the dropdown menu closes by itself when the bookmarks have loaded, is
unwanted behaviour.

Expected Results:  
The dropdown menu should stay open.
