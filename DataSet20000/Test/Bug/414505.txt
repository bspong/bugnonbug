awesome bar should order primarily by number of tag matches before frequency

Using Edward Lee's recent build of firefox from here:
  https://build.mozilla.org/tryserver-builds/2008-01-19_00:36-edward.lee@engineering.uiuc.edu-glob.fast.adap.book.matc/edward.lee@engineering.uiuc.edu-glob.fast.adap.book.matc-firefox-try-linux.tar.bz2
as linked from his blog post here:
  http://ed.agadak.net/2008/01/another-way-to-awesome
I am able to search for 2 tags at once.  Good.

But URLs matching only one of the two tags are appearing before the only URL that matches both tags.

I posted a comment on his blog, saying:

----


This is markedly more awesome than the trunk builds I’ve been running, but it could be even more awesome.

I just tagged your blog as “firefox” and “blog”. Your blog in the only URL I have tagged in such a way, and yet when I type
firefox blog
into the location bar, your blog appears third in the list. The first two results are both tagged “blog”, but neither of them has ever even mentioned firefox. Typing “sdlkjwsljvlskdjv” as a separate word in the location bar doesn’t reduce the list any further either.

I think it would be better if ALL words in the address bar had to match, rather than ANY, as now seems to be the case. Or, at least, order the results by the number of words each page matches first. I would expect to see your blog first when typing “firefox blog”.

but he suggested I should report a bug instead.  So I have done.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0. use the above-linked version of firefox
1. tag your most frequently visited page with "tag23"
2. tag a page you rarely view with "tag23" and "tag24"
3. type "tag23 tag24" into the address bar
Actual Results:  
the frequently visited page is listed first, even though it only matches one of the two typed tags

Expected Results:  
the rarely visited page should be listed first, because it matches both of the two typed tags

Another example, not involving tags:

I want to visit http://synfig.org/Special:Allpages but can't remember the exact URL.

I type "synfig allpages".  The page I want is listed, but 14th.  I have to scroll the list of suggested pages to find it.  The first offered URL is http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=144022&atid=757416 , which has absolutely nothing to do with 'allpages', but the other 13 are tagged with 'synfig', whereas this page isn't tagged at all.  I think the fact that this is the only page matching both search terms should make it the highest ranked result.
