Windows Media Player Halfway Loads

When viewing a video embedded within a webpage, it will play with Windows Media Player, but there is an interesting glitch.  The controls and the actual Media Player interface won't load into the page, but rather, the video will simply load and start playing.  Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but when the video starts playing, sound does not start playing right away, but takes some time.  Plus, with the controls gone, stopping, pausing, and changing the sound with the Media Player Controls is impossible.

Another interesting note, is that Windows Media Player appeared fine for a few days, and I not having installed any new extensions or anything of the sort, it ceased working.  This is all on a fresh reformat of my computer as well.

I have the following plugins installed:
-DOM Inspector
-Adblock Plus
-Adblock Filterset.G Updater
-Tab Mix Plus
-IE Tab
-Resize Search Box
-Fasterfox

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have the above extensions installed
2. Visit a webpage with the video embedded directly into it
3.

Actual Results:  
Windows Media Player failed to appear, though the video played without the console.

Expected Results:  
The Windows Media Player console should have appeared with the video.
