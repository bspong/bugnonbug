Steps to reproduce:

This behaviour might derive from recent changes to the autocomplete feature.
There were similar reports from thunderbird that could be related. 

Preconditions: 
1. Privacy settings -> Location bar -> Suggest "entries from bookmarks"
2. Bookmarked site containing the letter e.g. "s" (any letter will work)
3. Open another website that contains this letter as the first in the adress (e.g. spiegel.de) a few times (so it gets to the top of the autocomplete feature) 
4. Close all tabs / restart firefox

Steps:
1: Open new tab
2: Click location bar
2: enter first character (s) 
reaction: 
* location bar autocompletes to spiegel.de as a suggestion and
* a dropdown with the bookmarked page is shown (and probably other bookmarks with the same letter.
3. move mouse over / close to the bookmark entry 
reaction:
Firefox highlights the line
4. move mouse out of the dropdown area, click the location bar
reaction:
dropdown fades out and
the previous entered letter (s) is visible together with the piegel.de suggestion.
5. press "enter"


 




Actual results:

Firefox opens the adress that was the previously highlighted entry from the dropdown list.
Repeated tries:
No matter what you do, the last adress highlighted in the dropdown list will be opened if you press enter.


Expected results:

Firefox should open the visible, selected autocomplete suggestion in the location bar if the dropdown was closed. The user is irritated since he might not even have noticed the mouseover that selected the entry from the dropdown.
