Firefox hangs when opening a local HTML file with an applet if the file path contains an accent
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_5; fr-fr) AppleWebKit/533.19.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0.3 Safari/533.19.4

Firefox hangs when a local HTML file with an applet is opened if the file path contains an accent (with a path starting with file://). It works when the URL is on the web and the path starts with http://, or if there is not special character in the whole path to the file.
The whole window becomes unresponsive, and Firefox has to be quit or force-quit from another application.

The Console displays the following error message :
Mozilla has caught an Obj-C exception [NSInvalidArgumentException: *** -[NSCFString stringByAppendingString:]: nil argument]


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a simple HTML file with an applet (I only tried the applet tag)
2. move it into a folder with an accented character
3. drag an drop it into Firefox 3.6.13
Actual Results:  
The applet does not display, and Firefox hangs.

Expected Results:  
The applet loads and displays, and Firefox does not hang.

Disabling all extensions did not change anything.
