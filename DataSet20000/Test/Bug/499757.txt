Ok so i play this game called darkorbit. Its an awesome game but everynow and then when i log out of the account or get killed and have to refresh the game window, which is seperate from the backpage, I can't get back in. So in turn i have to close out firefox and then do ctrl alt delete. Now, since you have closed out firefox previously, it should not be running correct?!?!? Wrong, it is still running. I presume it is the hidden window that for some reason is not showing up. This has only been happening until the updates that i got about a month ago. Thought it would be fixed by now.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.create darkorbit account
2.press start on game page and log out several times

3.AFter a few times of logging out, it will not let you press start any longer. This does not happen all of the time, maybe 3 times or 4 times a day.



Since this is my private account, and i dont wan't to reveal the information( my log in and password) you have to make your own or just see if you can figure out what im talking about. This is not only happening to me, many other users have noticed this. Since i love firefox, i am very disappointed that for now, until this issue is fixed my firefox will be limited almost to nothing. Ill be moving to internet explorer until this issue is fixed. :) regards
