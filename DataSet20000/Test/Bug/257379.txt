Missing the close tab button by a few pixels verically does show visual feedback
(mouse-over, mouse-down) but does not close the tab.

You have to move the mouse cursor closer to the red icon of the button and click
to really close the tab.

I know this is ultra-fussy but I stumble across this bug quite often.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Be sure the tab bar is shown by opening a few tabs
2. Approach the red close tab button from the top or bottom until visual
mouse-over feedback is given. Make sure you really stop moving the mouse once
the mouse over state is reached. Do not enter the red square.
3. Click.
4. If the tab closes, open a new one and try again (step #2) but try to stay as
far away as possible from the red square. It's only a 1-2px area where tabs do
not close.
Actual Results:  
Visual mouse-over and mouse-down feedback for the close tab button is given, but
the tab does not close.

Expected Results:  
Either
  - Do not provide visual feedback (change) and do not close the tab (status quo)
or
  - Provide visual feedback (status quo) and close the tab (change)
