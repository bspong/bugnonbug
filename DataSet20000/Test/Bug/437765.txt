If you search for tickets for an event, after typing in the captcha, it keeps displaying "please hold" message and doesn't let you get past the screen to buy tickets.

I go to comcasttix.com which had worked just fine with the older version of Mozilla Firefox.  If I try to search for tickets for any event, it brings me to the captcha to type in...I do it and it says "Please wait while we reserve the best possible seats".  It does state it may take up to 3 minutes. I waited 10 minutes and it won't pull tickets for me and let me past the page to buy them.  I try on other browsers and no problem at all.  It seems to be an error with the new version of Mozilla Firefox.  Thanks.  Looking forward to the problem getting fixed. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to www.comcasttix.com and click buy tickets for any Event currently onsale
2. Enter quantity of tickets and select "best available"
3. Type in the code/captcha given and you will see it has you hold and never pulls up tickets. 
Actual Results:  
I was never let past the "waiting to pull the best available tickets" screen, but on other browsers, it pulls tickets for me in less than 10 seconds.  On Mozilla (this new version)...it almost seems stuck. 

Expected Results:  
I hope to be able to use mozilla to search for, pull and buy tickets soon on comcasttix.com as Mozilla Firefox is my preferred browser.

one that I can think of...other than I never had any of these issues with the older version...only with this new 3.0
