a piece of UI that I miss from MSIE7

When I am surfing on laptops with tiny crammed keyboards tend to want to use the mouse for everything. I have added buttons for all my favorite websites in the toolbar below the normal toolbar/address bar etc so basically I can switch to these sites very fast. I still want to use tabs though. basically what I do is that I select "File::New tab" and then I press one of my bookmark buttons in this very nice bookmark toolbar. However, going up to open the file menu is kind of unconvenient for an operation (new tab) that I do so very often. when I first sit down at the computer I usually something like this:

1. file :: new tab
2. press the slashdot bookmark button
3. file :: new tab
4. press the osnews bookmark button
5. file :: new tab
6. press the reddit bookmark button

thinking about fitt's law and all that UX stuff i'm sure you can imagine why I feel this process is a little bit tedious. this process makes me itch for a "new tab" button next to the back/forward/reload/stop buttons. or, alternatively you could go with somelike like MSIE7 did with a "dummy tab" which automatically creates a new empty tab when clicked. I'm pretty convinced this "dummy tab" is the result of some UX study at MS or something, it's a very smooth piece of UI and I wish there was something like it in FF3. 

If you think about it, isn't it actually a little bit strange that we have a toolbar button for "STOP" and no button for "new tab". I don't know about you (or the "average" FF user) but I can tell you that from a personal viewpoint that I tend to use the "new tab" command way way more often than the "stop" command.

so my wishlist item is something of very fast way to create a new empty tab using only the mouse (if I have a decent keyboard I just use CTRL-T and that works like a charm ofc).
