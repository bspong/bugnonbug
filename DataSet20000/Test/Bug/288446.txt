Bookmarks and status bar don't calm down

Since a day I changed the screen resolution with Dark Basic a few times with
FireFox opened (other apps never did this), the Bookmarks and status bars are
continously changing their heights (by 5 pixels or so each one), so if the
status bar changes it's height, it's just annoying. But also the bookmarks menu
does, and when it does, the "screen" where the webpage is seen goes up and down
because the bookmarks bar gets thicker and thiner and makes reading very
difficult. Also I noticed that all my Bookmarks are gone and I had to put them
back again. The Weather toolbar that goes at the Bookmarks has never left.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Guess it was:
1. Opening Mozilla FireFox (I had some www.DarkBasic.com windows opened)
2. I opened Dark Basic demo (IDE), which changed my screen resolution from
1024x768x32 to 800x600x16, and then to 1024x768x16 and so when I was executing
the code.
3. I pressed Alt+Tab to check another tutorial, so Dark Basic went minimized
Actual Results:  
The bug started :( and the bookmarks were gone. I mean:
"the Bookmarks and status bars are continously changing their heights (by 5
pixels or so each one)". They looked like hiperactive.

Expected Results:  
Not deleting my bookmarks and keep the bookmarks and status (the bar at the
lower part of the screen) bar at their original height.

Note: Just to let you know, when I close or open a tab it stops moving, but
sometimes it just comes back by entering into a new webpage or something.
