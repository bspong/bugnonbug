Store recency of browser data in telemetry when importing to see how good a predictor default browser is
+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1275114 +++

Bug 1248077 seeks to improve the experience of the first-run "import data from another browser" process by doing it automatically. We'd like to gather some additional data to help understand if our selection of what browser to import from is doing a good job, by looking more closely at the choices users are currently making. As with the original probes added in bug 731025, these will need to be opt-out because they need to record things before the browser has fully started for the first time.

<snip #1 and #2 which are in bug 1275114>

3) How fresh/relevant is the data available from other browsers? In some cases, the user's default browser may not be the browser they actually use the most (and thus want to import from). In other cases, the most-recently-used browser may not have been used for anything more than downloading Firefox, so importing that minimal history and default bookmarks is not really useful. Again, with telemetry analysis, we'd like to see how often the browser users actually import from is actually what we think is the freshest.


#3 is a little tricky to define precisely, as difficulty of implementation may guide what we actually do. I'd suggest a erring on the side of simplicity to see what the initial signal looks like. One option would be to pick a particular data source (bookmarks? history? passwords? all?), and see how old the most recent entry is. A file timestamp might be enough. Another option would be to see how many entries there are for a type -- is the user importing from the browser with lots of bookmarks/history/passwords? Are browsers with < X bookmarks/history/passwords generally ignored?
