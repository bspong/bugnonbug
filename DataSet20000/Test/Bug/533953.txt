Spell checker does not check spelling prior to a correction

In a text box, you can make multiple spelling mistakes. If the user makes a correction near the end of the text box, all prior spelling mistakes that were marked become unmarked. All text that is incorrect after the spelling correction is still correctly marked.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type three misspelled words in a text box.
2. Right click the middle word and opt to correct it with a suggestion from Firefox.
3. First misspelled word will be marked as correctly spelled. Last misspelled word will remain marked as incorrectly spelled.
Actual Results:  
First misspelled word will be marked incorrectly as spelled right. Last misspelled word will remain correctly marked as incorrectly spelled.

Expected Results:  
First and last misspelled words should be marked as incorrectly spelled.

The problem can be worked around by scrolling to the beginning of the text box and correcting spelling from start to finish instead of arbitrarily.
