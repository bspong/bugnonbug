I recently got into downloading FLV files and found out that there is no option for Firefox to open it permanently with a certain EXE file (Riva FLV player). When I double click on the video, FF doesn't allow me to check the box "Do this automatically for file like this for now on". So I have to browse and find Riva to play the video every time. Could someone make a Riva FLV plug-in for Firefox? Thanks - Al

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use the Fast Video download to download the video.
2. Once its downloaded if you don't have a FLV player, Google Riva and download one.
3. Once you set it up, double click on the flv file
4. As you see, there is no option for making Riva play the video every time, you will have to continue to browse for Riva if you want to watch the video.
Actual Results:  
The same it always does, having no option to open the FLV video in Riva as the default player.

Expected Results:  
Had a check box to use Riva to open FLV videos. Having a FLV plug-in.
