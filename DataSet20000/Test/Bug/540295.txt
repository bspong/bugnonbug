Drop-down form SELECT menus on web pages will randomly cease function.

<SELECT> drop-downs on online forms will randomly cease to function during browsing, especially if the CPU is at 100% load. (I have a Core 2 Quad Q8200 @ 2.33 GHz, and all 4 cores were at 100% load.)
Also, the browser's main close button doesn't work, so I have to kill the process directly. After this, the Restore Session page only has anything listed in it half the time (but always appears). Using last build from 2010/01/15.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Put CPU at 100% load using Prime95 or similar.
2. Open many tabs.
3. Go to a configuration page of some sort, and try to open a drop-down menu.
4. If it opens, refresh the page until it doesn't.
5. Sometimes it always does. It's weird.
Actual Results:  
The menu opened, but I'm using a different build now.

Expected Results:  
Ideally, it would do what it did, but what it did was antonymous expected.
