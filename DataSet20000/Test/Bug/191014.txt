client javascript gains access to windows password
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.3a) Gecko/20021207 Phoenix/0.5

This url loads javascript that should prompt the user for some text (their
name). On my windows 2000 machine, it never prompts and displays my windows
password (not good, considering the javascript could then submit the password in
another request). Tried it on v. 0.5 on linux... works as it should (wouldn't
make sense seeing it's a windows password).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start up phoenix in windows 2000 
2.got to url specified http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~geoffo/humour/flattery.html
3.observe your windows password

Actual Results:  
a pop-up with the password 

Expected Results:  
prompted the user for input, and displayed that.

The password displayed is not necessarily the user's domain password. This
machine is not attached to a windows domain, so it's probably the user's local
password.
Did a view source, here is the javascript. I believe the prompt function is the
culprit:

var nombre;
nombre=prompt("Please write your name","");
if (nombre == "Ren‚ Eijkelhof" || nombre == "Rene" || nombre == "Eijkelhof")
{
	document.write("<BR> <H3>Hola Rene...</H3>");
}
else
{
	alert ("What a beautiful name " + nombre + ".");
	alert ( nombre + ", you are fabulous.");
	alert ( nombre + ", you are one of the most talented people we know." );
	alert (nombre + ", lots of people love you.");
	alert ("You are smart, intelligent and beautiful " + nombre + ".");
	alert (nombre + ", we enjoy working with you.");
	for (x=1;x<=4;x++)
	{
		document.write("<HR>" + "<H3>" + nombre + " you are fabulous !!!</H3>")
	}
}
