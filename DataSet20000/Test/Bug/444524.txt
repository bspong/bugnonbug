Usernames and passwords remembered, but not automatically logged in

Usernames and passwords are remembered, but it keeps making me log in manually whenever I come to a page. Example situation: I start Firefox and head to [website]. I enter my username and password and log in, continue my business as usual and then close the browser. I open Firefox again and head to the website, which would normally log me in automatically [set to "Remember me"] asks me to press log in again. It does this to every site that requires a log in. It will remember the username and password, but not log me in.

My settings are

Accept cookies from sites
Accept third-party cookies
Keep until they expire

This wasn't a problem until about Firefox 3 Beta 2 I believe it was, never found it an annoyance until now though
Also, I noticed that my Firefox is the only one of all the computers that have it in my house that doesn't ask me if I want to save my session or quit or cancel
Any connection or is that a different bug or am I just overlooking a setting?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log into a site and set to remember
2.Close browser
3.Return to site
Actual Results:  
It asks me to press log in/sign in again

Expected Results:  
Log me in automatically without me having to confirm it every time

Firefox doesn't ask me to save session, quit session, save and quit or cancel close.
