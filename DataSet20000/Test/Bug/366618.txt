The reload button does not paint when opening Google Personalized homepage.

When a new Firefox window is opened and the Google Personalized homepage loads, the reload button either disappears completely, becomes mostly painted over by the background color, or bits of the reload button appear at random positions in the toolbar. The reload button reappears after clicking in the space where it is expected to be. This problem was also noticed in Firefox 1.5. This problem is noticed on an Apple Macbook running OS X 10.4.8.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a new Firefox window with the Google Personalized homepage set as Home Page
Actual Results:  
The reload button in the toolbar either does not paint, paints incompletely, or artifacts of the reload button paint at a random position on the toolbar.

Expected Results:  
The reload button should display in tact and in the usual place.

Theme, toolbar, and button positions are all set to defaults. Problem only exhibits itself with the reload button regardless of position in the toolbar.
