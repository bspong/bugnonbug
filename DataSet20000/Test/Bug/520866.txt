Using apostrophe in email (AOL and Yahoo) brings up 'quick find' and will not let you finish the word you are typing.

I canceled my AOL account thinking it was an AOL problem, but it happens with Yahoo as well. Typing words with a contraction (using the apostrophe) brings up something at the bottom of the screen called 'quick find'. You can't finish typing the email using any apostrophes until this eventually goes away. I notice this bug was reported in 2008, but not recently. I have been having this problem for several months.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.type an email with a contraction in the text
2.as soon as you type an apostrophe, 'quick find' shows up at the bottom of the screen in the grey area (where the word 'done' often appears).
3.You can't finish the email with apostrophes until this finally goes away, often by canceling the email, closing the browser, and starting over.
Actual Results:  
Does not happen every single time, but most days it does.

Expected Results:  
Should be able to use the apostrophe!
