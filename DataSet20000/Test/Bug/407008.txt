One of the things that annoys many Windows users is the useless files, folders and registry entries (aka 'gunk') that gets left behind after an application has been uninstalled. Firefox is much better than most programs at removing traces of its existence on your hard drive, but there are still a few leftovers. (The following applies to Windows Vista, although I'm pretty sure that it's the same on Windows XP and Windows 2000, but just with different paths; I have no idea about Mac and Linux :)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download and install a recent nightly (but not the most recent; for example yesterday's).
2. Open Minefield, Help > Check for Updates... > Download & Install Now
3. After update has downloaded, click to restart Minefield.
4. After update has been installed and Minefield has restarted, close Minefield.
5. Uninstall Minefield through the Control Panel, making sure to select the checkbox 'Remove my Minefield personal data and customizations'.
6. Look in C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming, C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local and C:\Program Files.
Actual Results:  
In C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming, note that there is a folder called 'Mozilla' with just a sub-folder 'Firefox' which contains just an empty sub-folder 'Profiles'.

In C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local, note that there is a folder called 'Mozilla' with just a sub-folder 'Firefox' which contains just a sub-folder 'Minefield', which in turn contains an 'updates' sub-folder (with an empty sub-folder '0' and the file 'last-update.log') and the files 'active-update.xml' and 'updates.xml'.

In C:\Program Files, note that there is the empty folder 'Minefield'.

Assuming Minefield was the only Mozilla application installed, that's 9 folders and 3 files left behind that are of no real value to the user; even if he decides to reinstall Minefield at a later date.

Expected Results:  
When Minefield is uninstalled and the option to 'Remove my Minefield personal data and customizations' is selected, I expect that every trace of Firefox's existence should be deleted from my hard drive. Most traces are removed, but some gunk is still left behind. It is my understanding that the files listed above are recreated automatically when the need arises, and they certainly don't contain any personal information. I see no harm in deleting them when just Minefield is uninstalled, and IMHO they should certainly be deleted when I select the option to remove the profile data as well.

I realize of course that if you have other Mozilla products installed (e.g. Thunderbird) the folders themselves should not be deleted because they would not be empty, but if Minefield is the only Mozilla product installed on the system then I don't see why the empty folders should not removed as well when it is uninstalled.
