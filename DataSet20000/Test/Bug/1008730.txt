Do not test with the Windows High Contrast themes. These themes are not usable in the wrold world since they also strip out graphics and navigation objects. They also, somehow, sometimes resolve this problem and change colours on the fly.

For a fuller test go through all Windows objects and change all font/background settings to white on black. To aid troubleshooting it can help to use unusual colours such as lime green text on a red background - such colours make it easier to see which colours have not been set in the user interface and which have defaulted to the OS colour settings.

It is also impossible to see the text on Tabs too.
