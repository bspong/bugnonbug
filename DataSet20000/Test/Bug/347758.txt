The browser tends to commit erratic deadlock,and, flashing/shimmering after a javascript alert is opened
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)

There are two media players embedded in the page and i have found they can
become confused(id/name) but they are not connected effectively with the
scripting of the players(of are for the main windows media but is dependent of the OS which player operates,usually the generic).
   This "problem" has occurred after the auto downloaded Firefox-update on both a windowsXP and Win2000 machine X86 PC systems.
   I found no difference in the behaviours of either machine finally.
When the onMouseover that triggers the alert occurs the alert pops up
but the GUI starts to shimmer after a short period,flickering at a fast rate
after that the alert can be swithched off but only by lunacy of fast repetitive
clicking but that itself does not finally save the browser that then starts
to flicker and shimmer again and crash requiring cntrl+alt+del for the process
manager to terminate it(the application).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open the window @
2.allow to load or not completely load and mouseover the the table to cause the alert
3.try to switch off the alert window by its OK button.

Actual Results:  
   Since Opera and Netscape8-7.2 are OK and Explorer it makes Firefoxs'
recent update in the past three days stand out like a sore thumb.

Expected Results:  
simply load the alert window and exit after the OK or corner button for
exit is pressed.

 I use a large quantity of X-browser scripting in my site but i don't gaurantee
it every time and only for Mac-90% Linux-90% The Others Win Explorer and Opera
Firefox Navigator(above 4.X not much for 6.x now) 99%.
