I can be browsing any topic on slashdot and will click either on non link text or in what "looks" like empty white space and the stupid page will jump all the way to the bottom. This began happening after slashdot did their recent upgrade to css. This is driving me nuts. I'm assuming it's a bug in the browser regarding css. If it's not that then I suppose it could be improper use of css but I can't say that as I know nothing about it only of it. So PLEASE look into this and fix it. It doesn't happen every time either but at least 50-75% of the time it does IF you've been just scrolling a little at a time while reading the comments.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open some topics for the day on slashdot in seperate tabs.
2. Browse one topic in it's tab at a time scrolling and periodically click the left mouse button to regain focus when you come back to the browser as you've been checking email ssh'ing into machines and doing other things.
3. After clicking the left button at some point on slashdot the whole page hits the bottom like you pressed the End key.

Actual Results:  
Stupid scroll location jumps to end of document

Expected Results:  
For the frigging page to stay smack dab right where I had it so I don't loose my place if I don't recall a good amount of the last sentene I read to search under which is still annoying to need to do.

The only theme I use as I CAN'T stand ANY others is Skypilot. Speaking of themes. When that site (don't recall it's name) that freshmeat absorbed which was devoted to themes lost it's archive of user submitted themes why have people stopped submitting completed polished stylish dark and light themes? Off topic yes but I'd like throw that question out to anyone I can. Purely retorical.
