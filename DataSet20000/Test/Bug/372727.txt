JavaScript modifications of alt text for disabled or missing images are not displayed

When images are disabled, alt text is displayed instead. Trying to dinamically modify the alt text of images by JavaScript does not trigger Firefox to change the  displayed text.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the attached URL -- a slot machine reproduced on a web page by using HTML and JavaScript
2. Click on the "Spin Me" button
3. Inspect internal HTML representation (by using a tool such as Firebug) vs alt text displayed on the page: the internal representation changes, the text displayed does not change
Actual Results:  
The internal HTML document representation changes alt text of non-displayed images. The alt text displayed on the page by Firefox does never change.

Expected Results:  
The displayed alt text of disabled or missing images should change according to JavaScript dynamic modification of that attribute.
