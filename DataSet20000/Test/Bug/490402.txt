I got one of the late 2008 15 inch Macbook Pros (2.4 GHz, 2Gb, 250Gb, but that shouldn't be relevant) in January (three months ago) and immediately installed FF 3.1b2 so I could take advantage of the multitouch gestures that was now available.  The problem prompting this report has persisted from then to even now (through 3.1b3 and 3.5b4 which I just downloaded today).  It was a new machine, new installation of the OS, a new profile with no extensions provides no remedy, and the behavior has remained exactly the same every time for the last three months.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any website
2. Click on a link
3. Go back (click back, hit delete, or swipe left)
4. swipe right
Actual Results:  
the browser hides as if I pressed command + H

Expected Results:  
move forward in history

The error console provides no output.

This is not bug 478600 or bug 469483, but these seem to suggest that there is a bigger fundamental issue.  Also, following ideas in comments on those reports provides no remedy.
