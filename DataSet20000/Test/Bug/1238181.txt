0. (optional) Open 12 tabs with different bugs. You can skip it if you already have 12 different items in history
1. Open about:preferences#general
2. Click in the field "Home page", delete all text there, press Down key to open suggestions
3. Scroll suggestions list to the end

Result:       A blank unselectable line appears in the end of suggestions list.
Expectations: There should be no blank lines in suggestions popup

 to install extension "Stylish" and create the following style (without ">"s)
>   @namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);
>   @-moz-document url-prefix(about:preferences){
>   #browserHomePage tree > treecols { border-bottom-width: 0px !important;}}

It was regressed by bug 1087618 because I see exactly "border-bottom: 1px.." added in the changeset
