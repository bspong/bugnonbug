Hello,
I have just installed 'user agent switcher (version 0.7.2), it was happy and didn't say it was not incompatible.

After installing it said changes will take effect after a restart. So I let it restart. Except it didn't restart.

So I manually started firefox and in the add-ons the item is still in the waiting to install and firefox is still saying 'restart firefox to apply changes'.

If I uninstall a plug-in or try and and install another one, they just go in the queue and wait forever.

I've tried following the usual website finds, i.e. rename/delete the extensions files (.ini, .cache, .rdp) and this still fails. Starting in safemode fails as well.

i.e. Firefox is knackered.
