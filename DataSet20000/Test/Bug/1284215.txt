Scrolling continues after I let up on the left mouse click

Steps to reproduce:

Open Firefox 47.
Find a very long page.  Here are some suggested sites:
Visit http://OneMileScroll.com, a long page that will scroll.  Another source is a YouTube video with comments below it.  Go to the end of the page of comments and "Show more" a few times.  You might better be able to see the scrolling behavior with a page filled with text.  Performing a Google search with preferences set to show 100 results will get such a page as well

Hover on down-arrow on scroll bar, left-click-and-hold, then release.
It SHOULD stop scrolling.
Drag the slider button  It SHOULD take you to a section of the page and stop when you release the click.

I created a clean profile, also I went Help > Restart with Add-ons disabled.


Actual results:

Clicking on the down-arrow end cap on the scroll bar and holding will cause the page to scroll down until mouse is released.  Scroll will continue for a bit more time.  Same is true with the up arrow end cap.  Did not investigate horizontal scrolling.

Did investigate the scrollbar action inside the edit box on a lengthy posting being written in the Mozilla Support forum.  That scroll bar behaved properly always.

Clicking on the slider and dragging it gives me a bouncy overshoot.  "Whoa! where are you going??"  Did not test the slider with new profile or with Add-ons disabled.


Expected results:

clicking on end arrows up or down should stop upon left-mouse-button release.
Clicking and dragging slider should move the page and stop in its tracks when left mouse button is released.  No matter how long or short the 

Dragging the slider should stop moving the page when the left mouse is released.
