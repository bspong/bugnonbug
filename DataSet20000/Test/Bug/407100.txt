Starting with the 2.0.0.7 update release, every single time you right click on the webpage content (ANY WEBSITE OR PAGE CONTENT) and click on a main menu items, you are fine. If you put your mouse over ANY child menu, it immediately pops us with the error:

[Exception..."Component returned failure code: 0x8000fff (NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED)
[nsIDOMXULDocument_MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH.popupRangeParent]" nsresult: "0x8000ffff
(NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED)"location:"JSframe::chrome://browser/content/browser.js::
anonymous::line 3932" data: no]

I have the screen shot as well. This will freeze the application and nothing more can be done in any shape or form and when you close the application, it remains in memory and has to be killed using terminate process tree. I have disabled all extensions, still does it. I have started in safe mode and it still does that. I am at my wits end with this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open browser
2. Go to any website or nothing
3. right click anywhere
4. browse to a submenu on the context menu
5. BAM!
Actual Results:  
Exactly what I said in the summary "or not so summary with all the details" :D

Expected Results:  
It should open up the item and allow you to click on the action but nothing is available and crashes every time. I hate IE and I have been reduced to using it because its the only option.

I have uninstalled COMPLETELY and reinstalled and still does this. I have years of bookmarks, extension settings, custom whitelists, blocklists, so on and this is going to suck if I have to redo it all over again. I am using the default firefox theme, nothing fancy here.

I am running Vista Ultimate x64 on an AMD Turion 64 x2 using an HP tx1000 laptop. I have 1 GB of RAM and over 250 GB hard disk. I wish we could upload screenshots.
