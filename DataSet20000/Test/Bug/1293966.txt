Forget about some browser history button doesn't clear things you started doing before that timeframe
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:48.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/48.0
Build ID: 20160726073904

Steps to reproduce:

I was logged in gmail and other sites.
I have click on that button and clear the history for past 24 hours.



Actual results:

After re-opining the browser I have open gmail and my session was active.
It is not forgetting everything. So what it is forgetting?


Expected results:

It should forget everything or users should have given proper information that what it is going to forget and what it is not going to forget, so that additional steps should be taken. 
See technical people are getting confuse about that feature think about non-technical users.
This is really big security threat. Suppose someone using PC in public places he login in to any account and instead of login-out they press on that button and left the PC now next person comes in open gmail or other....
Bingooooo enjoy someone else fb, gmail or other account details.

So Plz either forget everything or remove that button or educate users what it is forgetting or what it is remembering.

Thanks,
