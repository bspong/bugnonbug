When I go to tools and click on options then when I go under General and go to homepage space and I put a webpage in the homepage space then I push ok then I exit the options menu.  Then this is where the problem starts when I exit firefox back to the desktop and when double click on the firefox icon to go back on to the internet then I have noticed that my homepage has changed.  Firefox goes to a different webpage then the website I have set for my homepage.

Click on firefox and go out on the internet and then click on the tools menu and go down to Options and click on it and then go under General tab and go down to where it says Homepage and in that space put google.ca into the homepage space and click ok.  Then exit firefox back to your desktop and then double click on firefox to go back to the internet and you should notice that firefox has switched homepages and went back to it's previous homepage and not your current homepage in Options.
