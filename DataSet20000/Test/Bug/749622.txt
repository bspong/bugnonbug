centered three column layout repositioning for no reason

Steps to reproduce:

created standard three column layout with floating divs (container, left-column, middle-column, right-column). important: the CSS of the container is set to width: 800px; margin:auto; to center it horizontally in the browser. that works fine. the left and right column content is static. next, i vary the content of the middle column using server pages. tested in FF.v.12. (my current HTML code is generated by PHP and ZEND. if you need a simplified sample please let me know)


Actual results:

as long as the height of the middle column is smaller than the height of the browser window, everything works fine. but if the content of the middle column extends below the bottom of the browser window, the entire container is shifted horizontally several pixels to the left (the internal layout of the container seems fully preserved) in comparison to the previous scenario. this is quite visible if you jump between pages with contrasting content. has been reproduced both on Ubuntu and Windows XP. IE displays the same scenario correctly i.e. without any horizontal movement.


Expected results:

the horizontal position of all elements of the layout should remain unchanged. only the bottom border of the layout should move up and down depending on the size of the middle column content.
