Bookmark Keyword searches are not encoded properly (though keyword.URL is)

Quick Search does not URL-encode plus signs (+). 

Searching for "c++" (without quotes), the %s (replaced portion of the URL) appears in the URL as:
c++
Instead of:
c%2B%2B

The encoding (++) being decoded by the server as two spaces. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Create a bookmark with the address:
http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&q=%s&btnG=Google+Search&meta=

2) Assign a keyword to the bookmark, i.e: 'g' (without quotes). 

3) Type "g c++" (without quotes) in the address bar and press Enter. 

Actual Results:  
The plus signs (+) do not get URL-encoded. 

Expected Results:  
+ should be encoded as %2B

This may be a regression as it is reported as bug 319169 and bug 316863 (and an number of others mentioned therein). The status of these bug reports have been set to "Resolved". 

But this feature has never worked for me since Firefox 1.0 and (mostly) automatic update versions up to 2.0. 

This is a fresh install of Firefox 2.0 (no previous version) on a fresh install of Windows.
