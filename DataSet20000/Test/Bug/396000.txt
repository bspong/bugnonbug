support a "search:" protocol
support a "search:" protocol

the "search" protocol (that your browser would register for) would make it easy search for some text in your "default" engine.  

(This seems related to have web apps as content handlers, right?)

Instead of allowing search engines (like google / yahoo / msn, etc) to register, the browser just uses whatever your default search is (as IE, Firefox, Opera, Safari all have search boxes these days)

One use:  adding a context menu to the message pane in Thunderbird that would launch my default browser to my default search engine with the selected text.  

Another use, but an internal to firefox one, was for bug #373352.  When a user typed "foo bar" in the url bar, we could present a "Search for 'foo bar'" option, that would send the search to the default search engine.

(Maybe applications like thunderbird could be smart and only show that context menu if the search protocol was registered with the OS?  not sure.)

Of course for things like this, it is only useful if other browsers followed along, and that's always the tough part.

see also bug #395998

My only concern is adding protocols to firefox might open up attack vectors, so I'll cc the right people so they can weigh in.
