firefox on vista, background windows inappropriately pop forward and steal focus
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506; InfoPath.2)

On Windows Vista, with multiple Firefox windows open, background windows will frequently pop forward and steal focus for no reason. 

Reactivating the proper focus window will often result in the inappropriate window again re-stealing focus, and clicking on the proper window to focus it will cause this cycle to repeat several times for a few seconds. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
On Windows Vista...

1. Open an AJAX Application in a firefox window (i.e. Google Calendar)
2. Open another Firefox window to another site (i.e. slashdot)
3. browse in window #2.... 
Actual Results:  
Background firefox windows inappropriately pop forward. This does not happen with the same websites on IE7 on the same Vista installation. This does not happen with the same websites on Firefox on Windows XP.  

Further, once it pops forward once, re-activating the correct window will often result in the wrong window popping forward repeatedly each time for several seconds. 

Expected Results:  
Background firefox windows stay put, not popping forward. 

While it seems to happen more frequently with AJAX apps, that is not necessary. It seems to happen with any site in the background window. 

This bug makes firefox virtually unusable on Windows Vista. The user must minimize all except one main window in order to avoid this focus popping problem.
