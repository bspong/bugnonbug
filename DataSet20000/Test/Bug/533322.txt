Image GIF with Width and Height specified in EM results in unnecessary scaling
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When an image (Only tried GIF) has its height and width specified using EM anti-aliasing (Bi-cubic?) filtering is applied to the image. The filtering is still applied even when the image is still at its original size.

Taking a screen shot confirms that the image is still the same size yet right clicking on the image and going to "Properties" reports that the image has been scaled.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a basic XHTML 1.0 Strict page 
2. Create a basic GIF image (10 pixels wide by 11 pixels high)
3. Inside the BODY tag include the image <img style="width:0.6em;height:0.65em" alt="Test" src="10by11Image.gif" />
Actual Results:  
A 10 by 11 pixels image is shown on the page with filtering applied to it (Looks more blurry). Yet in the properties window it says:
Image Dimensions: 10px x 11px (Scaled to 10px by 10px)

Expected Results:  
Since it’s still at its original size no filtering is needed. The properties window should also report that the image has not been scaled:
Image Dimensions: 10px x 11px

Since my image was white I made sure the BODY tag had a background colour of Blue so the outline of the image stood out. This meant I could easily count the pixels contained within the image.
