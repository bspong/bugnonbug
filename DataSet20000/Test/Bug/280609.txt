error importing bookmarks.html between Linux & WinXP versions of Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041103 Firefox/1.0RC2

I am trying to use my bookmarks from my Linux computer in Windows, but the list
only partially shows up in the bookmarks drop-down menu after import (or even
after just copying the file over it manually).  I get about half my bookmarks,
and the subfolders are messed up.
the bookmarks.html file looks fine when I view it in the browser, all the links
are there, they don't appear in the pull-down menu.  
I have done this in the past (at least from Win -> Linux) with no issues.  
I guess the problem is possibly with how the Linux version writes the
bookmarks.html file?

After searching, I noticed there are lots of bugs pertaining to this, but
between IE and Firefox, so I figured this was a different problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to bookmark manager
2.import (from file), selecting bookmarks.html copied over from linux computer


Actual Results:  
bookmarks in pull down menu are incorrect.

Expected Results:  
bookmarks should appear as they do in the pull down menu in firefox on Linux
computer
