I insert www.yahoo.com and it returns the above URL and Address Not Found Page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7

I entered Yahoo.com in order to provide you with the above example. The page that displays says: 
Address Not Found Error
www.msn.com could not be found. Please check the name and try again.
The address (URL) does not correspond to a known site and could not be loaded. This could be due to a misspelling in the address or because the site does not exist. If the address is known to be valid, or if the problem occurs for many sites, it may be an issue with your proxy service (if you use one) or the directory name service lookup. In such cases you should consult your system documentation, administrator or Internet Service Provider (ISP) as appropriate for further assistance.

Any new URL you enter returns the saem Address Not Found Page but does not change the URL line. It will stay msn.com etc.

The internet is connected and working as MSN is on a hotkey and I can connect to it without going through Mozilla.

The ISP is working as this laptop is one of 5 computers we have on a wireless network in the house.

I have run adaware and Spybot. Both congratulate me for having a clean system. I can't run HiJackThis because I can't get to the internet to install it.

I've looked up other resolves such as regedit where you look in the run logs for anything suspicious.

I did find New.net in the Add/Remove program files and removed it. There is one new.net that will not allow me to remove it. It says I am not authorized. I have no other browzer as I only have Mozilla and blew away IE years ago.  

I've run out of ideas. Hope you can help!
