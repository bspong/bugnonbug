Create omni.jar at install-time to reduce installer size

Steps to reproduce:

To shave off some weight from the installer, we should avoid putting the compressed omni.jar in the installer but rather its contents and have the installer produce the jar/zip file.

As a quick test I just downloaded the en-us windows installer of fx8.0.1, uncompessed the contents of the sfx in a folder and run 
7z a -t7z -mx -m0=lzma lzma.7z core setup.exe (*)
then I unpacked the contents of core/omni.jar in the directory core/omni.jar/, deleted the jar file and re-run the same 7z command.
The size of the resulting files were 15.9 MB and 14.2MB respectively for the original and unpacked versions, i.e. the unpacked version is about 89-90% of the original.

The downside is obviously the need, for the installer, to perform an additional task (i.e. compressing the contents of the omni.jar folder).

Now, if we think this installer/size savings are worth it, there are two ways of tackling the problem. Either we roll our own solution (i.e. modify the build system to not produce the omni.jar file but to leave just its contents in a folder; modify the installer to take the contents of the folder and compress it in the omni.jar archive) or we contribute a 7zip filter that does all of this transparently (i.e. when a file A of a known archive type is inserted inside another archive B, the contents of A are decompressed before being archived in B; upon decompression of B, the contents of A are compressed again in A's original format. note: this is likely not a "lossless" operation, i.e. the original A and the decompressed A will likely be different, even though their contents will be the same) 

(*) I'm aware that the sfx of the installer is compressed using 7zip's manual stream binding voodoo; this is just a quick PoC
