Firefox yields significantly slower Intetnet download connection speeds compared to IE, using ISP Bell Sympatico Fibe 25 (nominal DNL speed of 25 Mpbs) connection. 

Between March 6th and 16th, 73 paired speed tests of the browsers were made (each tested within 1 minute of each other). Two speed-test programs, "Internet services-bell.ca" and "Speedtest.net" were usedas were the latest versions of Firefox and IE. In all 73 tests, Firefox was at least 5 - 7 Mbps slower.

Extensive, detailed evaluation of the issue by the ISP's top tech analysts concluded: (1) the problem as reported is valid and replicable; (2) no problem was found on the user's computer or with the hardware/software link, or on the ISP's servers. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Connect to ISP Bell/Sympatico's "Fibe 25" 25Mbps connection. 
2. Run a speed test using "Internet services-bell.ca" and "Speedtest.net"
3. Observe test results
Actual Results:  
In all 73 tests, Firefox was 5 to 7 Mbps slower than IE

Expected Results:
