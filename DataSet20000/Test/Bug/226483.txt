As a page is loading, FB allows you to start typing into a textarea as soon as
it appears. Then, when the page finishes loading, the textarea is reset to its
default contents, irreversibly destroying your changes.

This is a common occurrence over a dialup connection. I ran into it when
replying on a forum. If the page contains images, or is particularly long, or
there are other applications competing for bandwidth, it can take 15-20 seconds
to finish loading the page. By that time, I'm halfway through writing my reply.
Then it is summarily deleted, causing anger and frustration.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start loading a long page with a textarea
2. Start typing in the textarea as the page is loading


Actual Results:  
3. When the page finishes loading, observe as fb obliterates your changes

Expected Results:  
Once I start typing in a textarea, fb should not mess with it. If it must reflow
the page, fine, but keep my textarea changes.

If this is impossible, disallowing typing into a textarea until the page is
finished loading would at least prevent data loss.
