Bugs with bookmarks when I switched from latest FF2 to FF 3RC, both U.S. Eng.
When running FF 3RC in Sandboxie, all bookmarks were missing & could`nt add any new bookmarks at all. Could`nt restore import any bookmarks from FF3 dir. In a nutshell... FF3RC Bookmarks fail when running in Sandboxie.

Running FF3RC without Sandboxie the bookmarks were OK for the most part but had some bugs with R.Clk Sorting under subdirectories of personal BM toolbar which were possibly caused by Duplicate Tabs Ext. Dup Tab Ext failed to uninstall & I had to disable it for it to uninstall which fixed some BM bugs but not all. The next step was to remove FF3 altogether & it caused more bugs w/ Sandboxie. After which I decided to uninstall & reinstall Sandboxie. At reboot attempt there was the dreaded BLUE SCREEN. After that my Keyboard failed when trying to restart.

At this time... 
I`m back on latest FF2x w/ Sandboxie still buggy & a new keyboard. Whew!!! :)
Sandboxie bug is likely due in part by Registry entries left behind by FF3 which I`ll have to sort out later but at least I`m running OK with the bugs for now.

In general.. FF3RC is OK but is`nt quite ready for full release just yet.

I`m staying with this FF build for now...
