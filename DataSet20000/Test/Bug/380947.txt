Firefox forgets restored window size when you hit Ctrl+W to close browser.

Something that has been bugging me for a while: I am the type of user that likes to use many tabs and windows at once. I may have one window loaded with several tabs running in maximized mode, and the other window with more tabs at a certain size, say 25% of my screen. If I hit the Ctrl+W shortcut to close my tabs and hit Ctrl+W one last time to close the browser itself, Firefox will open my 'restored window' as a full screen window that is not maximized. I would like for it to remember that I like having my restored windows at a 25% scale of my screen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a Firefox window
2. Click the restore window to normal size button.
3. Resize the restored window to any size (25% of the screen)
4. Close Firefox window using Ctrl+W shortcut.
5. Reopen Firefox.
6. Click the restore window to normal size button again (notice it remains a full screen window)
Actual Results:  
The restored window remained to take up the entire screen.

Expected Results:  
It should remember that restored windows are to run at 25% size.

I use the Noia Extreme theme and this bug still occurs with all other themes including the default theme. The only workaround for this is to resize the restored window every time (which is neither difficult nor time consuming) but it would be nice to have it remember my preferred normal window size.
