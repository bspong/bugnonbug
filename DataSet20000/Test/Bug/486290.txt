I have two monitors connecting to one PC, side by side. No problem when FireFox is opened / displayed in monitor one (1).

When FireFox is shown in the monitor two (2), no matter where the mouse is located in the browser window, right click always brings up the context menu to be displayed only next to the left frame border of the 2nd monitor, even out of the browser window if its left border is away from the left frame of the 2nd monitor. Vertical position of the context menu follows the current mouse location. But not the horizontal position.

If the browser window is extended on two monitors, part on monitor one, part on monitor two. The horizontal location of context menu depends. 
* If more than 50% of browser window is on the 2nd monitor, it's the same as described earlier, even the mouse is currently located on the 1st monitor, the context menu displayed next to the left frame of the 2nd monitor.
* If less than 50% of browser window is on the 2nd monitor, context menu does not displayed next to the left frame of the 2nd monitor. It is displayed certain distance away from the current mouse location instead, even out of the browser window if right click while the mouse is located on the left side of browser window.
