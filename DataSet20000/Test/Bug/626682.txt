Firefox has crashed at least 5 times in the last month and hangs at least 10 times per day the day.  I cannot find a clear pattern of what makes it hang and crash, as these events happen so frequently.  Certainly, these events occur when I am using Gmail and Google Calendar.  It has gotten to the point that I really cannot use Firefox because it is hanging and crashing so frequently.  The one consistent thing I have found is: in trying to clear my recent history over a period of two days, it always hung.  I sometimes got a message that there is a problem with the script running, and it gave me the option to stop the script.  However, now I am able to clear my history.  That is the most consistent thing I have found. 

Reproducible: Sometimes




This is how the most recent hang was described in my Administrative event viewer:
