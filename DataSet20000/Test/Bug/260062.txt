After clicking 'Send' on Compose Message page, an 'Unkown command' message
appears.  I've contacted Maktoob (1st 1gig free email service, most popular Arab
email service) about the issue.  To test this, you're going to have to make an
account with Maktoob.

An additional problem is that the Quick List on the right is always empty (when
it should list quick list names for quick access to email addresses) in Mozilla
browsers.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create email account with www.maktoob.com
2.Login with user id and password
3.Click Compose Tab
4.Fill To, Subject, Body fields
5.Click 'Send'

6.Click Address Book
7.Add new contact and make sure Quick List is checkmarked

Actual Results:  
Message saying 'Unknown command' appears on the same page, just above the body
to the right.  Of course, the page reloards.

Also, Quick List to the right is empty when it shouldn't be.

Expected Results:  
Message gets sent and you get directed to a page stating the successful sending
process.
Quick list should show the contact person's name who was added to the Quick List.
