separate preferences for Clear Private Data command from automatic clear on exit prefs
When the Clear Private Data feature was introduced, users could choose to either invoke it on-demand using Tools > Clear Private Data or have data automatically cleared when the browser exited. The two invocation methods share a single set of preferences, though.

We should decouple the two commands from sharing a single set of preferences about what type of data is removed, as the requirements for on-demand private data removal are unlikely to be the same as those for on-exit remove. The former is used when a user wants fine-grained control over removing data, whereas the latter is used when a user wants certain data to always be removed.

The on-demand function should show the dialog (see bug 453440 comment 12 for design) with a time-range for history, and:
 - the state of checkboxes & dropdowns should be persisted for the next time the on-demand function is invoked,
 - the default state of these checkboxes & drop downs should no longer be tied to the "Settings" dialog in the Privacy prefpane

The automatic on-exit deletion of selected items should still be controlled by a preference in the Privacy prefpane, but the Settings dialog (sheet on OSX) should look like this:

 | When I quit %productName;, it should automatically  |
 | clear all:                                          | 
 |                                                     |

 - the persistence of these selections will not be tied to those of the Clear Private Data command
