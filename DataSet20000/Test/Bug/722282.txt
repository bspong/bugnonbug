12a1.txt output from the Profiler.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_8) AppleWebKit/535.19 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/18.0.1017.2 Safari/535.19

Steps to reproduce:

Using 12a1 from the Nightly builds, OS X 10.6.8. MacPro 2009 (approx)
Loading my usual environment, 3 windows, 23 tabs, 5 of them loaded (loading on demand is enabled), FB and GMail are in these 5 tabs.  Uses 100% CPU, completely idle.


Actual results:

FF constantly uses 100% of one of my CPUs (2 physical, 2 cores per each). See attachement for a run with the profile.

Expected results:

Idle should mean... idle, no unnecessary CPU comsumption.
There should be a way to find out what is taking up CPU (à la Task Manager in Chrome).
