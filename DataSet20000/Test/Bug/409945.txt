Charset annotations created on import should be itemAnnotations (was: Clear private data doesn't force smart bookmarks to rebuild)

I just went to clear my private data as I'm letting someone else use my computer for the day (so bookmarks and like I want retained but everything else can go).

Given there was no obvious way to clear 'places' or 'smart bookmarks', I assumed clearing browser history would do this, because it essentially is browser history. To my somewhat dismay I found it wasn't cleared and furthermore there was no obvious way to clear them without just deleting them...

I expected this bug to already be reported as it'd be pretty essential to get something like this in for Firefox 3 final otherwise people would get rather upty about it not actually letting you obviously clear private data, but did several searches and couldn't find anything. I sort of want to report this as Major, but I'll leave it as normal for now.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clear Private Data (any possible combination of options)
2. Click on 'Places' or 'Smart Bookmarks'
3. Notice data is still there.
Actual Results:  
Data wasn't cleared

Expected Results:  
Data should of been cleared.
