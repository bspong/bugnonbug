Can't click on web links within TB e-mails, and have FF 2.0RC3 open up & go where they point to like it normally should.

Usually, clicking on an link within an e-mail message in Thunderbird 1.5.0.7 gets Firefox to pop up, get on the web and go where the link tells it to go. After installing FF 2.0 RC3, though, that stopped happening.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firfox 2.0 RC3
2. Open Thunderbird, find any e-mail with a web link it, and click on it.

Actual Results:  
Firefox 2.0 RC3 doesn't pop up, access the web and go to the link like it's supposed to.

Expected Results:  
Firefox 2.0 RC3 opens, gets on the web and goes to the location that the web link specifies.

Created a clean profile with Thunderbird, then went to Help/Release notes trying to get that link to work. It didn't. Created another clean profile in Firefox and tried to get any TB links to work, and still nothing happened. I then did clean installs of both FF 2.0 RC3 and TB 1.5.0.7. That didn't solve the problem, either.
