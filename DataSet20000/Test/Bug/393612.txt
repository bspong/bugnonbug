With visual problems, windows theme must be set to high contrast black.  I have allowed firefox to take on system colors so that websites are also inverted.  When the mouse sets overtop of a link that drops down a window, the words are visible, but so is everything beneath the window making it impossible to read the menu entirely.  This only happens when using system colors under preferences. This problem has been the only reason for recent Internet Explorer uses.  Thanks ^_^

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In windows, set the appearance to "windows classic".
2. Next, set the style to "high contrast black".
3. In mozilla's options section, set the color setting to "allow system colors"
4. Set text color to white and background to black
5. Remove the check beside "allow pages to use their own colors"

(all pages should have pure black backgrounds with white text now)

6. Go to nearly any site containing a mouse over menu.
7. Mouse over an option that has something underneath of it.

(the example website was a random example, but there are many menus out there)

Actual Results:  
The drop down options should be unreadable, or atleast very difficult to see. There are several web sites that I have encountered that have a very specific menu layout and do not have transparent backgrounds.

Expected Results:  
The background of the displayed menu should not have displayed a clear background with white letters, but a black background with white letters

The only other bit I've got is that I know Internet explorer does just fine, so it's obviously a code interpretation or browser overlay issue and not the coders mistake.
