Visiting this site will trigger a popup. I poked through the javascript, but it
looks like whatever they're doing is a complicated multi-step process. Not sure
exactly what they're doing, but it's clearly designed to bypass popup blockers.

Oh, it looks like they set a cookie to limit how often the popup is triggered.
It's easily reproducable if you clear the poststuff*.etensity.net and
paypopup.com cookies.

At least on my system, the popup is barely on the screen, only a tiny bit shows
in the lower right corner. But it does show up as a window on the XP task bar. I
dunno if it moves, or if it's there because I have the Firefox Javascript
options set to disallow moving windows.

It also seems to add three or four entries to the browser history (eg, under
"Go" menu), which seems a little odd.

It's a bit disturbing because this is the first popup I've seen in
Mozilla/Firefox for a *long* time... Many months, at least.
