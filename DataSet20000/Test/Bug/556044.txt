Firefox randomly starts to break down.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.2) Gecko/20100316 Firefox/3.6.2

I'm running Windows 7, and my Firefox has been acting terribly lately. Typing this up now, I have an entire sentence done before I can see what it is I am typing. If I go too fast, the screen whites over, and says not responding. It's NOT my internet connection, because Chrome works fine the entire time.

I also CANNOT minimize, maximize, or close Firefox by the bar in the top right corner. I can close to through right clicking the Firefox icon, or through task manager, but I shouldn't have to. The top right "X" should work. Also, when I click on of them, it starts to blink frantically, but nothing ever happens.

Another thing, when I play videos, like Hulu or Youtube, they will only play if I am constantly moving my mouse, otherwise they just freeze.

Looking over Google, I see it is a common problem, but no sign of a solution that I could find.

AND, right click doesn't work. Nothing will show up, just the outline of the box.

I have also ran system restores, and virus scans (AVG) and I can't find anything wrong.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Opened my Firefox
2. Just did normal shit
3. It happens sometimes, and doesn't others.
Actual Results:  
Just being on seems to do it.

Expected Results:  
Ummm... not fucked up? It should respond to the top right buttons, it shouldn't require mouse movement to play movies, it shouldn't lag my typing, and it shouldn't remove my use of right clicking.
