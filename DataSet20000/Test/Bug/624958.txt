After i opened Facebook in a tab and slept and then resumed it, if i try to refresh the page, it doesn't load anymore and display a status of stopped.

I tried accessing other sites and it's working fine, i've also tried to access Facebook using the ip address and it's also working, well kinda as Facebook won't load properly using the ip address but my point is that it's still loading something... 

Also when i do the same with Safari, i don't have any troubles... 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Load Facebook
3. Sleep the computer
4. Resume the computer
5. Try and refresh the page.

80-90% of the time, the page won't load and gives a status of STOPPED
Actual Results:  
the page don't load anymore and the status bar displays stopped

Expected Results:  
Refresh the page and display a status of done

The only way to work around this is to close firefox and reopen it
