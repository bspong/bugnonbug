Link openend in firefox does not work in mediaplayer, in IE that same link does work.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; nl; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

If i try to open the above link in firefox, windows Media player (version 11) produces an error saying: Cannot play this file because the protocol is not supported.

THIS IS CAUSED BY: 
I open the link in firefox, and then in media player select the file "currently playing" and select properties. it says: ".\ftp://ftp.ncsoft.com/Aion/Movies/dd2-highres.wmv".
When using Internet explorer, it says : "ftp://ftp.ncsoft.com/Aion/Movies/dd2-highres.wmv"

This means firefox sends an malformed url to media player. (".\" at the beginning.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open the url in forefox
2. click off error message in mediaplayer
3. view properties of the file in the media player playlist by rightclicking on it and select properties.
Actual Results:  
File is not played by windows media player because Firefox sends a malformed url.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should send the correct url.
