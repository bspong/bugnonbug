Google results clear from the top search box after viewing a cached page and hitting the back button.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

What I typed remains in the search box at the bottom of the page but the top is empty. If I click straight through to a link it's OK, just when I click into cached results.

I also had the issue with Firefox 3.0.01
Not a problem in IE or my old Mozilla 1.7.13 install.

1. Go to google page and search anything.
2. Click the [cached] link below any result offered that way.
3. Hit the back button on Firefox.
Actual Results:  
The top search box has been cleared. The bottom search box still includes my search term.
