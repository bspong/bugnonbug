Running Windows 7 x64 build 7600 RTM, and experienced performance problems on virtually all pages I've visited, most notably those running flash applets, and those that are generating HTML code to be displayed, dynamically changing (chat rooms, for example). What bugs me, is the method that succeeded in resolving it. I've downloaded a prerelease 64bit build of Minefield from http://wiki.mozilla-x86-64.com/Firefox:Download, installed it, and after realizing that the flash player plugin won't work, and until after v10.1 any support from Adobe isn't planned, I've switched back to Firefox 32bit and realized that the performance improved miraculously to the levels I've known under WinXP 32bit. The performance problems began after upgrading from Firefox 3.5.2 a few months ago, up to 3.6 at present, didn't skip any of the patches between these two points. I'm running Win7 from the Beta release, and up until v3.5.2 of firefox there weren't any problems.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install Firefox 3.5.2 and later under Win7 x64 (beta or final version doesnt matter)
Actual Results:  
reduced performance and occassional freezing of the application

Expected Results:  
no obvious lags in performance

Like I said, worked around it by installing the 64bit build, then using firefox 32bit afterwards without any switch to the 64bit build
