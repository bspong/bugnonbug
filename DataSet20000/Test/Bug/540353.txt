With a large collection of bookmarks (the exported html has 4 megabytes, around 8500 lines), trying to move a relatively big folder around can cause firefox to start thrashing, completely filling /tmp with clipboardcache-* files.  I watched this gradually eat 5gigs of disk... I suspect it continues without limit until the partition is full.  I reproduced this behavior three times before giving up.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a large collection of bookmarks (~8000 entires, with some moderate sub-division into folders)
2. Grab a bigger folder (with around 60 entries), drag it into another folder, then try to drag it up to the top level again.
3. If you get the system to hang-up on you, do a Ctrl-Alt-f4 to get a terminal, watch the disk usage climb by doing a "df" repeatedly.  Look at what's showing up in the /tmp directory. 

Actual Results:  
System freezes up, entire /tmp partition is filled.
If you let it go long enough to fill the disk, you can lose 
data: I blanked out my Profiles.ini file this way and had to 
recreate it manually.


Expected Results:  
My expectation would be that you can move a hundred lines around in a collection of 10000 lines without chugging and thrashing.  

(1)Give me a preference to dump the Icon data in the bookmarks-- I don't care about it, and it eats space. 
(2)Get a better sqlite library?  Let me use a real database instead? 
(3)Force us to use tags instead of physical rearrangment of the data?
