Change in Firefox 11.0b1 loopback connections?
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0
Build ID: 20120129021758

Steps to reproduce:

Updated Firefox 10.0b6 to Firefox 11.0b1.  No changes in any other software/application; no new applications or Add-ons installed.  

This is my first Bugzilla post.  I asked for assistance on Mozillazine/Firefox forum and received no response.  I know this is not a help forum, but I can not think of another place to turn for guidance/advice/information.  Sorry if I do not supply all information correctly, but would appreciate an answer (fairly non-technical) or a link to read about the change(s), if applicable.


Actual results:

Loopback connections shown in TCPView have decreased from 2 pair (currently shown in Firefox 3.6.26 and Firefox 10; previously 2 pair in Firefox 10.0b6) to one pair in Firefox 11.0b1.

Has there been a change in Firefox 11.0b1 to account for this?

If not what do I do next?

I have already uninstalled Firefox 11.0b1 and performed clean reinstall (removed old program folder before reinstalling Firefox 11.0b1.


Expected results:

In all versions of Firefox prior to Firefox 11, I have seen 2 pair of loopback connections in TCPView. Now in Firefox 11, I see only 1 pair.  For all versions installed:
*all installed versions have their own separate profile
*No proxy
*No History, cookies
*tcp/ip dns flushed
