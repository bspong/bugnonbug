I wasn't able to click on "Sign on to Other Services or to see the dropdown arrow that should be next to it, so that I would have been able to click on "Card Services Online".  I was able to do it in Internet Explorer, but not in Firefox.  I don't normally use Internet Explorer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.pnc.com
2. In orange area on left side, 4th line under User ID white box, says "Sign On to Other Services:", but there is nothing underneath to click on
3. I opened up Internet Explorer and was able to see below the "Sign On to Other Servies:" and "Select Service" with a dropdown arrow to its right and then was able to click on "Card Services Online"

I don't normally use Internet Explorer, but went there to see if the PNC site, in that section that I needed, worked properly, and it did, but not in Firefox.
