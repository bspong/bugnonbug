After I had upgraded from FF3.6 Hebrew to FF4 Hebrew (via the built in upgrade tool in FF), I was amazed to see that the window buttons (close, minimize, maximize) moved to the left hand side, instead of the right hand side.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install FF3.6 Hebrew on an English Windows 7 (mine is 64bit).
2. Make sure the windows buttons are on the right hand side.
3. Upgrade via FF to FF4, then look where they are (hint: the wrong side).

Actual Results:  
The window buttons (close, minimize, maximize) switched over to the left hand side instead of the right hand side.
Needless to say, no other software on my computer has the windows buttons on that side

Expected Results:  
The window buttons should have stayed on the right hand side, where they have always been.
It's important to mention that on Win XP, I upgraded as well, but there the window buttons remained on the right hand side, so it must be something with FF in Win7, and not all Operating Systems.
