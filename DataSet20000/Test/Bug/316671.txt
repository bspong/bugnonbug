Could you please add another choice to the download actions.  I would like to have the ability to tell Firefox NOT to download something just like we can block pictures from sites.  I am currently running into an issue where I do not want Firefox to auto download .asx format but all i can do is tell it to save that file to my hard drive.  I tried to create a fake application and told it to use that but it changed it back automatically.  Please the auto download is slowing my system down and I have no way of turning it off.  Thank you.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. created fake application
2. told firefox to use fake app to open .asx file
3. firefox changed it to windows media player automatically

Actual Results:  
it automatically downloaded an .asx file

Expected Results:  
not opened the file with windows media player

Please set it up so that we can disable file downloads in the Download Actions section.  This problem does slow my computer down and my be responsible for causing Firefox to crash on my system.
