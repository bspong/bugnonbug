Pasting multi-line text into location bar does paste only first line.

This is relevant to:
- keyword/web search feature, when e.g. you try to google for something and paste text to be searched copied before from web page which turned out to be multiline
- pasting text into form fields from other applications

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select following text (with/without quotes):
  "Hello
  World!"
2. Press Ctrl-K to focus web search field
3. Press Ctrl-V
Actual Results:  
Only first line (Hello) is inserted

Expected Results:  
Newline(s) should be replaced by white spaces and "Hello World!" should appear in search box.

This is not critical, but in some cases it becomes PITA, since Mozilla tries to recreate formating when copying text into clipboard. And since formatting isn't always apparent, later pasting the text into form/search field/location bar become pretty impossible w/o running extra application (terminal/notepad) and removing manually the newlines.

I presume the change is pretty simple and would have no side effects, since pasting multi-line text into single line form element isn't defined anyway.

At least pasting whole text replacing newlines by spaces is something meaningful and useful, compared to never-desired pasting first line only.
