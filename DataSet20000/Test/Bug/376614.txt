I'm using Windows XP w/ sp2 and the site http://www.sexmovieporn.info loads a
trojan(uvcx.exe) without prompting the user.
How i noticed it: the page was taking too long to load completely so i checked it ctrl+alt+del and saw uvcx.exe.

Later i've disabled the javascript function and the problem is not reproducible. So i'd like to know if it is a Firefox bug related to javascript handling or something else.

I've opened the same page using the Opera browser and it's ok. Actually, i  access lots of porn websites using Opera and never had similar problems.

I am not promoting Opera or any other browser. I'm just concerned about security. Besides, Firefox is great.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close your anti virus.
2. please go to http://www.sexmovieporn.info and wait 20 or 30 secs.
3. you will perceive a strange behavior, like a program being loaded.
4. it will stay in c:\windows\system32
5. delete uvcx.exe manually. 



In the step one I recommended that you close your anti virus. Please keep in mind that i always search porn using Opera without any anti virus/anti spyware without any problem.
I know how to avoid PC infections. I'm not that kind of user that does not know the difference between a picture.pif and pic.jpg.

I believe in me, a human being, instead of anti virus and all these stuff.
