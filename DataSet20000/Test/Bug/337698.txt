Since CoxWebMail site change, I cannot get my log-in to "hold."

Using FireFox 1.5.1 on Mac OSX 10.4.6, I am in an endless loop at Cox WebMail site. When I select the address tab in the WebMail window, I get the log-in page even though I am already logged in. The same thing happens when I select the Settings tab and/or Addresses. Choosing any of the mail services tabs takes me back to the log in page. 

Apparently, the log in page does not "Remember username."

The problem does not exist with Safari, Apple's browser software, nor in Netscape 7.2. What's the problem and how can I fix it so that I can use FireFox?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to <http://webmail.west.cox.net/do/mail/>
2. Fill in user name and password, select "Remember my username" and log in.
3. In resulting incoming mail list, when I select any of the tabs, such as Settings, Addresses, Compose or Search, I am taken back to the log-in page. 
4. When I log in again, I still can't access the tabs but again am returned to the log-in page in an endless loop.

Actual Results:  
See above. 

Expected Results:  
It should have taken me to my address book, settings (preferences for Cox WebMail), etc. 

The problem does not exist with Safari, Apple's browser software and I have no problem getting my mail with any mail application. The problem seems to be with the new Cox WebMail site and some FireFox setting. 

When I called Cox Tech Support, I was told to call Cox Plus Technical Solutions 800.609.2054 where I could pay for support service that would fix my problem because Cox supports only Microsoft browser software, none of which is supported on the Mac platform. 

fwiw, I find it offensive and misguided that Cox supports Microsoft's browser software and designed its main service site to work only on that software, even for PC users who have sought refuge from spyware and viruses associated with MS products.
