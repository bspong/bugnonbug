Preferences lost after Firefox shutdown

I have some problems with the default settings in Preferences.  So I change the values, and for the remainder of that session everything works as I specified.  However, after a system restart the preferences behave as they did before I made any changes, despite the Preferences page reporting that the changes I had made were still in effect.

For instance, I prefer new pages to open in tabs, but the default is a new window.  I can change the setting to Use tabs and for the remainder of the session it works.  On restart, despite the option in Preferences still being set to Ose tabs, new pages are loaded in new windows.

Another example is the application used by Firefox to open movies.  The default for Linux is Totem.  Unfortunately this shipped without plugins for the various file formats.  So I changed it to use kMplayerwhich worked perfectly for the session.  On restart, Firefox attempted to use Totem again.

This only affects the 64-bit version of Firefox
