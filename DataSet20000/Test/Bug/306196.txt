Gecko interferes with sound system (xmms)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050720 Fedora/1.0.6-1.1.fc4 Firefox/1.0.6

Just rendering a page in either firefox-1.0.6-1.1.fc4 or mozilla-1.7.10-1.5.1
causes clicks and the like in xmms-1.2.10-16 (plain FC4 rpm as well as with mp3
support reenabled) playback (so does tabbing through windows). Using alsa (with
or without mmapping), OSS or esd does not make any difference.

No such problems when neither browser is started.

Athlon 800, Asus A7V, SB PCI128, 256MB. FC4 full updates as of 2005-08-27,
although the issue exists on a fresh FC4 install with firefox-1.0.4-something as
well. Running xmms as root with a nice of -10 makes no difference so I don't
suspect a lack of resources to be the problem.

Sorry if this is a duplicate, but although some of the reports I read speak of
similar issues they seem not to be as general as my problem.
