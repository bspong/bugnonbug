using taskbar to switch windows, wrong window gains focus

This is an infrequent event, <10% chance or so. This only occurs when using the taskbar to select a window. This same event has occurred in prior generations of Firefox.

When I click the icon for a window that does not currently have focus, a different Firefox window that ALSO does not have focus will be selected instead. I have not noticed this behavior with other programs on this computer, nor have I witnessed it with any copy of Firefox under Linux/BSD. Have not tested for this under Vista. The XP "Feature" of window-grouping is not active.

This will also happen when right-clicking. This is primarily a minor annoyance but, if a person intends to select and close a pop-up or other unneeded window, it is possible to kill the wrong window if Alt-F4 is pressed immediately after clicking. This is unusual behavior and requires extra time to verify that I am closing the correct window.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
0.Task Grouping has been disabled for the Windows Taskbar.
1.Three or more Firefox windows open.
2.Using Windows Taskbar to change focus to an inactive Firefox window.
Actual Results:  
Wrong window gains focus. If Alt-F4 was pressed immediately after clicking, wrong window is closed.

Expected Results:  
Correct window should always gain focus when selected from the taskbar.
It should be possible to select and rapidly close unneeded windows, without fear of losing the wrong content.

This likely will be deprecated to something that doesn't require attention, if the ability to recover closed windows is ever added.
