Tab Counter extension: text in toolbar item displays blurry box-shadow on dark developer edition theme
>>>
STR_1:
0. Set dark devtools theme, which is set by default on Firefox Developer Edition
1. Install  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-counter/

AR:  Text in toolbaritem created by Tab Counter is blurred ("text-shadow" CSS property)
ER:  Text in toolbar items shouldn't be blurry, just like in built-in toolbar items, tabs, bookmarks.

Note:  (explanation and more detailed expectations)
 I decided to report this as a bug on Firefox side, because I think that here's at least 1 FF bug.
 Tab Counter simply creates <toolbaritem> and doesn't apply any style to it.
 "text-shadow" is applied by Firefox stylesheets - [1] and [2] (see below). Thus I expect:
 1) DARK devtools theme shouldn't set :-moz-lwtheme-darktext, because text isn't dark.
 2) [2] is used to work around [1] for dark theme (to remove text-shadow). It's applied to bookmarks,
    some toolbar items and even to labels in findbar (such a huge workaround!). If there's really
    no way to avoid setting :-moz-lwtheme-darktext, then [2] should be applied to <toolbaritem>s.

[1] ----chrome://global/skin/global.css
:root:-moz-lwtheme-darktext {
    text-shadow: 0 -0.5px 1.5px white;
}

[2] ----chrome://browser/skin/devedition.css
#navigator-toolbox .toolbarbutton-1, .browserContainer > findbar .findbar-button, #PlacesToolbar toolbarbutton.bookmark-item {
    color: var(--chrome-color);
    text-shadow: var(--toolbarbutton-text-shadow);
}
