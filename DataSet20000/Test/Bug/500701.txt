I have read about the problem, and I founded about Firefox hanging about all the time of download, but in my case, it happens only at the first download or image saving.

I already have tried to reinstall Firefox, tried to use BETA versions, RC's and tried also to change my directory of downloaded archives.

Nothing happened.
