I just recently upgraded my computer to a BFG 8800GTX video card.  After the upgrade I noticed that menu rendering in Firefox was extremely slow.  In many vBulletin based forums the rendering of forum menus would take 2-3 seconds.  Also if I use the navigation arrows to scroll the page the scrolling takes place one line at a time.

This behavior doesn't happen with IE7 on the same sites.  

Thought it might be just this computer.  So I pulled the GFX card and put it in my testing system.  Fresh install of Windows XP.  Fresh install of FF.  Same problems.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Obtain a 8800 based Nvida based GFX card and install it.
2. Visit a vBulletin based web forum.
3. Either use the forum menus or scroll using the navigation arrow.

Actual Results:  
Very poor menu rendering times and scrolling one line at a time.

Expected Results:  
Menus should render almost instantly.

Scrolling should be a smooth as glass.
