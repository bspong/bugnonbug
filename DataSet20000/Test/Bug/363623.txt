When you manage to open a tab, just when a popup dialog comes Firefox just hangs. It occured when I was logging into gmail. Just when I enter the data and send it. Normally a popup comes with the question or you want to save the password in the password manager. Just before the popup comes and after I hitted enter I opened a new tab with CTRL+T. The new tab was opened with a grey background. I saw the the layout of the popup, but in the popup I saw only the text of gmail. (I guess it wasn't updated with correct information, so it takes the text standing on that page). Then after a couple of seconds firefox crashed and closed.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
(I think you need to do everything very fast AND the computer need the have a bottleneck (or something) causing the space between the enter and showing the dialog. So it has happened one time, but I'm sure it I'm right to say everyone can do it. You need to have only a little bit of ?luck?)
Actual Results:  
Crash

Expected Results:  
show the dialog and open the tab
