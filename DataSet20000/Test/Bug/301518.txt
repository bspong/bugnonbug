Once logged into internet banking (top right corner of the page above), the icons and images do not refresh

In the page http://www.stgeorge.com.au/ there is an internet logon link. I go to
this link and log onto my account. All comes up fine on the first page. But if I
try to do any banking the page refreshes BLANK. To correct this, I have to do a
right click (I use a microsoft PC mouse on my mac) and select from the dropdown
"refresh account list" in order to see the icons and images. Another way that is
a little less successful is to move the mouse around the page. If the mouse goes
over where an icon or image has disappeared, then it shows up individually.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. This is a little hard to give you an example, as it is in a private bank
account. And I am not going to give you those details. However, it does
reproduce wherever there is a java enabled page, with moving  or active icons
and pictures
2. 
3. 

Actual Results:  
Icons and images disappeared.

Expected Results:  
Refreshed the page and shown the images and icons.

The default reproduces the same error with the default theme. The fault does not
happen in Internet Explorer (unfortunately, as your program is superior in every
other way)
