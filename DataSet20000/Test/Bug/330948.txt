Stall when changing KDE desktop background

I use KDE's feature of auto-changing desktops to cycle my backgrounds every 15 minutes.  Whenever the background cycles firefox will stall and I will have to minimize it and leave it alone for about 30-60 seconds before it will finally refresh and work properly.  This seems to happen on every cycle.  I have not confirmed if the problem occurs on other linux distros or not, however.  I think I didn't notice such a problem when I was running gentoo though... so it may be something about the version from kubuntu dapper drake.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup KDE to rotate desktops in a cycle every minute (I really use 15)
2. Open Firefox
3. When the desktop changes watch firefox stall

Actual Results:  
Instant stall, works great, makes food for 5, oh, and if you rotate every minute firefox pretty much is never useable...glad I'm using konqueror while trying to write this!

Expected Results:  
It should still work without stalling. 

OS - Kubuntu Dapper Drake using Kernel 2.6.15 Amd64 last updated yesterday

(I lowered severity on this because it may not be your fault.. this is only happening when I was using kde's theme profile in appearance.. changing to another theme setup .. which I decided to do when I noticed my gentoo machine next to me didn't crash, seems to resolve it. This may really be a KDE or a purely kubuntu related problem since it uses it's own control panel...

I'm not sure.
