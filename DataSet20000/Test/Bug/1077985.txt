Build ID: 20140923175406

Steps to reproduce:

asp page scans recursively through a series of directories on the server (2008R2. IIS 7 SQL 2012) server using filesysytemobject looking for files (placed there by users) For each file, it parses the name and file features, adds that to a record in a to a SQL database using ADO. Then it renames the file using a unique recid/date/time combination (fso) (already generated in the SQL database) and moves the file to a designated folder. The code works fine every time. When it gets to the end of the sweep, the page shows a date time remark ("last run at...") and the number of files it found (collected as a variable dimensioned and then set to RecordsProcessed=Cint(0) at the top of the page, then incremented as RecordsProcessed=RecordsProcessed + Cint(1) for each file it finds) 
On Chrome, Firefox 32.03 and IE11 the purpose of the process works fine. On Chrome and IE the "number of files" works. On Firefox it ALWAYS says zero.


Actual results:

A vbscript variable is not incremented correctly (or at all!)


Expected results:

variable should increment - it does with other browsers
