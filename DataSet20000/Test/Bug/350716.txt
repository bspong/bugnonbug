Good Morning, Mozilla Firefox developers i have a problem when i use the feature save and i have to use IE explorer instead...

Problem 1: Mozilla can read .txt files like IE Explorer, but i can't save this files in .html format, in IE explorer i save those .txt files as .html files, i use it for quick editing, or saving plain text format as .html and then use Dreamweaver or another editor.

Problem 2: This problem is worst. When i see a home page in an diferent lenguage like spanish or other i can't save it in the correct character codification. I can read the correct contect from the page using the option View - character codification - Unicode (UTF - 8), but i can`t save the page with this code and i have to use IE explorer because i can select the correct codification type when i save with IE. This feature is missed in FIREFOX.

You should try to reproduce this problem, visit some spanish pages like:

and you will se the problems that i have with characters like ñ,á,é...

Please solve this soon..

Thank you very much

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit a home page with a special codification
2.Manualy change the codification in View-character codification
3.Save the page to the hard disk
Actual Results:  
When you try to see the page saved in the hard disk, the characters are unreadable and you have to change manually the special codification

Expected Results:  
Well i know that firefox isn´t a html editor, but i have problems when i see a web page with a special codification or in other lenguage an i want to save it, firefox need to add the option to choose the unicode while sqaving, in this way i colud see the webpages in the correct form in my computer...
