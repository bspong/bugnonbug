Second request to same site fails with "Firefox can't find the server at...." but ''try again" button works
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.2; WOW64; SV1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; InfoPath.2)
Build Identifier: 64bit with sp2

Most of the time the second request to a site(navigating to a second page) fails with error "Firefox can't find the server at ssss.com"; and if I click on "try again" button, it works. So this is NOT related to Firewall.

 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go go a site with multiple pages(like forums) or sites with links.
   First page of the forum comes out fine.
2. Click on the link to go to the second page of forum, then "Firefox can't    find the server at...." error sowsup, but If I click on "try again" button, page gets rendered as if there is were no problem.


Actual Results:  
Firefox can't find the server at hotmail.com.
    *   Check the address for typing errors such as
          ww.example.com instead of
          www.example.com

    *   If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
          connection.

    *   If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure
          that Firefox is permitted to access the Web


his problem is reproducible against numerous sites, not just forums and happens even when I click on the links inside wikipedia.com
