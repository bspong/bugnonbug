After installation of 3.0.15, Access of RSS feed with no information does not work
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: Zero Index Problem

When you access an RSS feed that has no information (links), you get prompted for bookmarking the RSS link.  It then stores the link incorrectly so that when you go to access the link, it asks you to bookmark the link and you go round and round.  All other RSS links work.  It is only in the case where you go to a link that is a dead end link (zero index) that you see this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Happens on a classified area, so can't give you one you could use.
2. Find a RSS feed that has nothing at the other end (links or information).
Actual Results:  
The I.E. browser handles the exception without error and displays an empty page with a header that says there is nothing there.

Expected Results:  
Expect to see what the IE browser does with a dead end link/RSS feed.

Remember, this only happens is a unique case of a RSS feed that goes virtually nowhere and does nothing.  All other normal situations of RSS feeds works fine in bookmarking and navigating the RSS path.  

The exception handling needs to be tightened up.  This worked fine in 3.0.13.
