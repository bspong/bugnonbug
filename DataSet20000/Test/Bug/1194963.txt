No pointer event is dispatched when a physical contact with digitizer is made - Windows 8 touch screen
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/44.0.2403.155 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

I found an issue with pointer events relating to Windows 8 touch screen devices using  FF Nightly v. 41.0a2. 

When I "touchstart" the screen nothing happens. The first event is dispatched only when I remove or move the pointer (finger).



Actual results:

The sequence of events dispatched is but only after my pointer (finger moves or leaves the digitizer): 
pointerover > pointermove > mousemove > pointerdown > mousedown > pointerup > mouseup > pointerover

See quick jsfiddle made:

Expected results:

According to the w3c pointer events spec:

"3.2.2 The pointerdown event

A user agent must dispatch this event when a pointer enters the active buttons state. For mouse, this is when the the device transitions from no buttons depressed to at least one button depressed. For touch, this is when physical contact is made with the digitizer. "

My understanding of this spec is that I make a physical contact with the digitizer of a device 'pointerdown' event should be dispatched.
