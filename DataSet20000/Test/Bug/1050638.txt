Allow closing a tab directly while the (tab-modal) onbeforeunload dialog is visible
In bug 578828 comment 65, I took a quick look at the state of unbeforeonload on Mobile... Safari does not support it at all. Mobile Chrome/Firefox only support it for navigation, but not for closing a tab. (Desktop Firefox, Chrome, and Safari all always show a prompt.)

For example, in mobile Chrome/Firefox, the following occurs:

0) Load some random page to fill a history entry
1) Load http://dolske.net/mozilla/tests/prompt/onbeforeunload.html
2) Click back
3) Enjoy a onbeforeunload dialog blocking the navigation

But if in step 2 you simply close the tab, no prompt is shown. The tab is immediately closed.

Seems like we could pick up the same behavior for desktop Firefox.

Alternatively, we could show the prompt on the *first* attempt to close the tab, but make tab-closing UI abort the prompt the *second* time. Currently you can't close a tab when the prompt is already showing. This would allow closing such a page by clicking the close button twice, or pressing Control/Command-W twice. This would be a more conservative change, but given that the major 3 mobile browser already ignore it (when closing a tab), I think we should just go for it.
