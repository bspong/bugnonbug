Firefox not allowing photos to show up on facebook but i can see them when i open a browser that is not run by firefox
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:39.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/39.0
Build ID: 20150806001005

Steps to reproduce:

for the past 3 weeks or so.. whenever im on faceboo via .. firefox.. the photos will not show up. i get a blank aquare the size the photos would be.. those are for the photos stored on facebook. now if its a linked to another site.. like flikr..  or a video.. it shows up.. as well as profile photos.. but the regular photos and the cover photos. do not.


Actual results:

Tried to get the photos to show..  checked websites. did searches.. updated files on the computer.. etc.. and nothing still could not see them.. in a   aha.. moment.. i disabled firefox and opened Facebook via my internet explorer.. and the photos showed.. like nothing happened.. and thus discoverd.. it was not my computer.. it was not the internet per se.. it was firefox.


Expected results:

what should have happened is all my photos should have shown up.. and been up when i started up firefox..  when they did the update.. that should have fixed the problem. but it did not.. at this point.. i will be deleting Firefox and anything Mozilla ..  from my  computer by the end of the month if i still cannot see them.
