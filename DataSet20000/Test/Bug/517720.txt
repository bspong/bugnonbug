Hello... I'am a new firefox user... I noticed a difference between firefox3.5 & ie8 .

Firefox support OpenSearch. Thats good.
But the java code for adding a search engine to search bar, there is a problem I think.

Example: IE8 Support like this code.
window.external.AddSearchProvider('opensearch.xml');
But firefox says "Your search engine doesnt support for firefox" (something like that)

To can add a search engine, firefox want to source code link like that,
window.external.AddSearchProvider('http://www.firefox.com/opensearch.xml')

I think thats a problem and easy to fix that. 
Maybe you can support this in new version.

Have a nice day. Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Original window.external.AddSearchProvider('opensearch.xml')
2.To Fix Change like this : window.external.AddSearchProvider('http://www.firefox.com/opensearch.xml')

Actual Results:  
It fixed

Expected Results:  
Firefox must support first code like IE8

I dont understand what I must write here. Sorry for my english.
