PDF files fail to open in browser

This is not exactly a new problem (in fact, I have experienced it for several months, always with the latest nightly builds), but I can't trace back its starting point.

When opening any pdf file, the browser will first hang for about 20-30 seconds, and then a window with the title "Acrobat plug-in" and the text "Couldn't launch Acrobat" will turn up. Occasionally, I also saw a parallel error message with title "Acrobat plug-in" and text "I/O error". From then onwards, when you try to open a pdf in the same session, it will just load a blank page (i.e. it doesn't even try to launch Acrobat anymore). My usual workaround then is to render the page with IE through IETab which mostly will load the PDF then (although occasionally it got stuck again and showed a similar, "IE-generated" error message à la "There was a problem opening Adobe Acrobat").

The problem's behavior is rather erratic, sometimes it is enough to close Firefox and restart it and then the problem is gone (i.e. PDF files are shown), sometimes the same problem occurs after restarting.

I am working with the newest Adobe Acrobat and I already re-installed Adobe Acrobat.
