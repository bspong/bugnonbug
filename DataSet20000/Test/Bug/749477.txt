Searching from about:home broken if chromeappsstore.sqlite is deleted from profile folder.
Someone complained on a forum that their about:home search box had been hijacked by Yahoo, wanting it to go back to the default Google search.
Knowing that the chromeappsstore.sqlite file is where that setting is stored and that the file would be regenerated on the next startup, I recommended that the person move the file out of the profile folder to their desktop while Firefox was not running, then restart Firefox to regenerate the file.

The file WAS regenerated, but now the search box stopped working entirely.

I tried to reproduce this with my profile, and saw this error in the error console when I loaded about:home after deleting the file and restarting Firefox:

Timestamp: 4/26/2012 8:02:47 PM
Error: SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character
Source File: chrome://browser/content/abouthome/aboutHome.js
Line: 181


The affected line of code is: 
  gSearchEngine = JSON.parse(localStorage["search-engine"]);


This is probably related to bug 637561, bug 645189, bug 637639, and/or bug 615785 (would this error go away if I waited for Firefox to upgrade to a newer version?).

Expected results: Reset DOM storage when chromeappsstore.sqlite gets regenerated (or just revert back to a default engine when that JSON.parse() fails).


I can upload both the original chromeappsstore.sqlite and the regenerated one if that'd help.
