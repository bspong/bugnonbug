I am currently remaking my web site using XML and XSLT (don't worry, I will make HTML versions for accessibility and search indexing). I decided to offer RSS and Atom feeds to my web site and I also wanted to display the feeds by transforming them using an XSLT stylesheet. However, with the recently added Feed View, I was worried that it would override my stylesheet, and unfortunately it does. So instead of seeing my home page with links and all, I see that pretty useless (in that context) feed view. It's very annoying and not inviting. This behaviour doesn't show up on local files (file: protocol) and the XSLT stylesheet is used as expected.

By the way, is it possible for a web page to use JavaScript to subscribe to web feeds? Feed view provides links to subscribe to the displayed feed: can I use these functions or do I get a security error?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to http://fragag.ifrance.com/xml/index.xml or directly to the feeds, http://fragag.ifrance.com/xml/rss.xml and http://fragag.ifrance.com/xml/atom.xml.
2. Note that the XSLT stylesheet should be used instead.
Actual Results:  
Feed view is used instead of the XSLT stylesheet defined in the XML document.

Expected Results:  
The feed should use the XSLT stylesheet defined in the XML document. Also, the page could be allowed to use the JavaScript functions the feed view uses to subscribe to feeds.
