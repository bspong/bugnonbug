strange scrollbar behaviour when reloading a specific webpage

There are a lot of strange things that happen, but I think that they are all
symptoms of a single issue.  I'll just describe how to make them all happen.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Follow these steps without doing anything else between:

1) Open a firefox window and make it fairly small (640x480 is small enough).

2) Go to http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~desrt/firefox-breaks.xhtml

3) Hit ctrl+F to open the find toolbar.

4) Scroll to the bottom of the page, with the toolbar open.

5) Hit ctrl+R to reload the page.

6) Observe that the scrollbar has jumped up even though we're still at the
bottom of the page.

7) Close the find toolbar.  The area where the toolbar used to be is now black.

8) Slowly increase the vertical size of the firefox window.  The black area
grows.  If you grow it too much, it will go away.

9) In X11, drag another window over top of the black area.  It now contains
random junk from other parts of the screen.
Actual Results:  
The problem occurs in both Linux and Windows (I had a friend check), but part 9
only happens in Linux (it stays black in Windows).  The find bar thing isn't
strictly required.  It only produces the black bar.  Without the find bar, you
can still scroll to the bottom of the page and reload and notice that the
scrollbar has jumped -- it's just less fun this way :)

Expected Results:  
Expected result is that on reload the scrollbar should have stayed at the
bottom.  This probably also would have caused the find bar problem not to occur.
