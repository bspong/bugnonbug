Audio and then video stop (even in fully buffered videos) - both working in IE
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:20.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/20.0
Build ID: 20130409194949

Steps to reproduce:

Checked all plugins, graphics and sound drivers. Purged cache. Ran virus scans. Removed dead entries in Registry. Downloaded Firefox 20 (was using 19 when the problem started). Restarted Firefox with plug-ins disabled. Reset Firefox. Nothing helped.
Internet Explorer still works (as well as it ever did...); i.e. the audio and video DON'T stop...
The only download before this started happening was the XP Pro Tuesday patch and the latest Adobe reader update (BOTH hours before).


Actual results:

On Wednesday evening (4/10) after several hour of viewing them, any video (regardless of player selected or site) started having the audio stop and a few seconds later the video will stop. Clicking on the video will restart it (the audio resumes from the point where the video stopped).
This happens as close together as a few seconds, and as far apart as 20+ minutes. It happens as seldom as twice in 30 minutes, and as often as 10+ times in the same interval.
ANY interaction, either with other tabs in Firefox or other programs appears to immediately stop the video IF the audio has already stopped, and has absolutely no effect if it hasn't.
