I have been using Firefox for a while and I liked it very much. 
Not long ago Firefox starts to stop responding for a while when browsing but I
paid no attention. Then it starts read HDD so suddenly when browsing and hangs
at the same time. 
But this day I clicked a link whick triggered an OnClick event which runs a line
of javascript code which returns with the result of a comfirm(). (Forgive me of
my verbosity. ) Then after a long long wait, a box appeared telling me Firefox
has made an access violation
(later I found out,'twas caused by doing mov  dword ptr[eax],esi 
when eax = 00000000).

At this point I reproduced this bug with Dr.Watson running(for 3 times), and
found out if given sufficient memory and swap file(virtual memory), it will
still pop out the dialog. I also accidentaly found out this happens too when
Firefox prompts you if to save a password or not.

However these tests have made my computer run out of virtual memory(2 MMORPGs
installed on a 7.29G partition), so I rebooted and entered DOS to delete the
swap file. I also copied firefox to another directory (as I suspected this
problem has to do with XPCOM.dll so I want to get it's CRC hash in order to know
if the file is corrupted). 

After doing these steps I cannot reproduce the problem any more...(If not I
would have to report this as a BLOCKER, as this blocks me from entering password
to bugzilla.)

And just as I'm filling this report the OS prompts me that Firefox crushes
*again*... but it is still responding and functional and not closed, and the
problem was found in MFC42.dll. Maybe that's corrupted file(as I got numerous
errors with this file)?

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Execute a script with a confirm function or try to make the dialog asking if
to save password appear.

Actual Results:  
Firefox allocates memory at an amazing speed then pops up the dialog; or in the
end runs out of memory and try to access memory with an uninit'ed pointer.

Expected Results:  
Pop up the dialog without too much delay. 

Or at least say that the pointer is invaild(but how do you know that...)
