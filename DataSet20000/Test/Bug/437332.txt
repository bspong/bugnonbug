When logging into new Yahoo Mail (AJAX verision) in Firefox 3 RC2, a failure occurs
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008053008 Firefox/3.0

When logging into the AJAX version of Yahoo Mail using Firefox 3 RC2, I receive the following error 100% of the time.  This does not occur on other browsers:

"The page at http://us.mg1.mail.yahoo.com says:

Yahoo! Mail experienced a login error: Login error:
message: Component returned failure code: 0x805e000a
[nslDOMLocation.replace]
lineNumber:805"

If I wait for a while, a message appears about "Mail appears to be taking longer to load than usual".  Switching to Mail Classic is the only way to view my mail in this browser.  This error has been present in RC1, Beta 5, and possibly earlier versions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Set your Yahoo Mail version to the new AJAX version
2.  Attempt to check your mail on a PowerPC based Mac (this doesn't happen on my Intel Mac)
3.  Get the errors listed above
Actual Results:  
"The page at http://us.mg1.mail.yahoo.com says:

Yahoo! Mail experienced a login error: Login error:
message: Component returned failure code: 0x805e000a
[nslDOMLocation.replace]
lineNumber:805"

Can't check mail without switching to Mail Classic.

Expected Results:  
Able to check mail

This occurs 100% of the time on a PowerMac G5 running Leopard 10.5.x.  It never occurs on a Mac Pro running Leopard 10.5.x.
