36 hours after uploading Microsoft's latest critical security patch (Friday, October 24) and running without issues during that 36 hours, Firefox fails on our desktop after 3 to 5 minutes of operation and displays a series of errors in a "Module #" format. Internet connection is lost.

Our system is XP Media edition if that is significant.

A specific stand alone error message read: "The instruction at 0x6010e920" referenced memory at "0x40110318". The memory could not be "read".

This issue occurs only on our desktop computer,  NOT our laptop computer although each computer uses the same Windows XP system with the same recently installed MS update.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Activate FireFox
2. Wait 3-5 minutes for FireFox to fail and display error messages
3.
