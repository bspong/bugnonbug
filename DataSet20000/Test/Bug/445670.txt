I go to load http://fox.com/fod/play.php?sh=simpsons url and watch the Simpsons videos or any videos. They load then I scroll up or down while the video plays it moves and jumps out of its coding on the web page as I scroll.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load http://fox.com/fod/play.php?sh=simpsons url.
2.Scroll up or down while the video plays.
3.Scrolling to the bottom makes the video disappear.
Actual Results:  
Windows Media moves and jumps out of its coding on the web page.

Expected Results:  
Leave the Windows Media Player video in its coded box.

This is not a problem for Firefox 2.0.0.16 or on Windows XP running Firefox 2.0.0.16. On the Windows XP machine running Firefox 3.0 isn't possible due to lack of ram. The Pages would never load (I've tried it and it didn't happen so I down graded to Firefox 2.0.0.16 on Windows XP) with just 256mb and only 192mbs available.
