prior to the recent firefox update, all that I needed in firefox to use the megaupload happy hour is to be logged into my megaupload account (for free users, not a premium account). Happy hour allows you to download from 5 to 7 am est as if u were a premium user (ie you don't have to enter captcha code and can do parallel downloading). After the update, firefox does not recognize happy hour, i have to enter a captcha and can only dl 1 file at a time. Another user informed me that this happened to him and he was able to use happy hour when logged into his megaupload account in internet explorer 7.

I plan to try IE7 for myself in 5.5 hours.

Thanks for looking into this matter.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.register for a free account at megaupload.com
2.do not install megatoolbar, it is adware and you don't need it. Megamanager is optional, you do not need it either.
3.at 5 am est to 7 am est, you should be able to download megaupload files as if u were a premium user, so you shouldn't need to enter a code (captcha), and you'll be able to parallel download.
