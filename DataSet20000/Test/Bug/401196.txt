Visiting time.gov and atomictime.net causes Minefield to not respond.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a9pre) Gecko/2007102504 Minefield/3.0a9pre

http://time.gov/

I went there and selected a time zone.
It wasn't appearing right (java issue??) so I clicked the IE Tab icon to flip over to IE.
Minefield went in to "not responding" mode so I had to CTRL+ALT+DEL to close the browser.


The same "not responding" thing happened at atomictime.net

My about:plugins lists Java as being:
Java(TM) Platform SE 6 U3

    File name: npoji610.dll
    Java Plug-in 1.6.0_03 for Netscape Navigator (DLL Helper)


According to java.com, the recommended java is installed.

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a9pre) Gecko/2007102504 Minefield/3.0a9pre ID:2007102504

IE Tab 1.3.3.20070528

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit time.gov or atomictime.net
2. In time.gov, select a time zone.  In atomictime.net, select one of the options for java display.
3. It should become sluggish and cause the user to do a ctrl+alt+del command to exit Minefield.
Actual Results:  
I had to do a ctrl+alt+del command to exit Minefield.

Expected Results:  
Java should display proper time.
