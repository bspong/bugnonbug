Font spacing was Drastically increased on a few pages after installing TTF fonts.
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: Firefox 0.8

the url example above has a forum post where i stated the entire problem 
(http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=53367 )

but the major issue pretty much is that after installing TTF fonts from 
windows, some pages, or parts of pages that used Tahoma had extreamly 
streatched out letter spacing after. only tahoma font seemed to be affected, 
though i cant be shure all tahoma was affected, jsut the ones that were, had 
that font. normal mozilla displayed it perfect with that font.
for now i just un installed that 1 TTF font, the rest of them work fine.  that 
forum post has links to 2 sites where that problem is evident if you have that 
font installed (this is only on linux version, wondows one is un affected)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. install Tahoma TTF font from windows fonts folder to linux fonts/ttf folder 
(just copy over)
2. thats it, check out this site now http://djeyl.net/forum/index.php?c=7  then 
look at it after removing the fonts
3.

Actual Results:  
the font change from normal spacing (but a default wrong font is displayed) to 
the correct ahoma font but the letter spacing looks like  "a  b  c  d  e" 
instead of "abcde"

Expected Results:  
i imagine display the text properly like the normal Mozilla that came stock 
with Redhat 9.0 did with the tahoma fonts. 

i cant be shure if its just Tahoma or a coincidence with the page code causeing 
the problem and they just happen to be using the font, but removing that font 
solved the problems. and Firefox works fine with the other TTF fonts like 
verdana and such.
