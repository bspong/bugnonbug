Incorporate Status-4-Evar and Classic Theme Restorer into FF/TB for UI Choice
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 2013120700

Steps to reproduce:

Upgrade to FF29 and the new Australis interface from FF26


Actual results:

Completely disappointed in the interface and more importantly the ability to use Firefox the way I had for the past decade. It took hours of wasted time to search and install addons to get Firefox back to a usable interface. Gentlemen, this isn't a sour-grapes bug/feature request, it is a real-world-problem when dedicated Mozilla users cannot count on Mozilla to provide continuity in browser UI. Business, cannot afford the man-hours required to retrain and provide education every time some developer decides to radically change the way trusted products have worked.


Expected results:

The solution is to provide a CHOICE and CAPABILITY to choose the classic interface. A new feature is a bug if there is no way to turn it off. After the painful experience of testing addons to get back a usable UI on firefox, the solution in the end could be as easy as incorporating the addons "Classic Theme Restorer" and "Status-4-Evar" into Firefox and defaults that allow users to choose [ ] Classic UI and have firefox look/behave the way it did through FF26. (not 100%, but to a very usable level)

Don't get me wrong, I've been in opensource for over 15 years, lived through fundamental failures in roll-outs (KDE4/GNOME3), and the common thread in all the big flops was failure to provide continuity between the look/feel/operation between versions (along with the classic failure of version # races that result in pushing crippled software out the door well before it is ready) Here with relatively simple incorporation of 2 existing addons, Mozilla can avoid the user backlash that inevitably comes.

This is a FEATURE REQUEST.
