to be honest, i am just starting to learn the writing of arabic words, which also means, that i am not very experienced with joining the chars in html. Anyway, there are bugs with unicode chars.





Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Join a "ra" (&#x0631;) with the char kasra (&#x0650;) and the char shadda (&#x0651;)
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
ff will show a ra (looks like a j without dot) and above a shadda (small w), but below of all the kasra (horizontal line)

Expected Results:  
my knowledge from arab chars is, that kasra should appear below the shadda, but above from ra (while kasra would be below the ra, if there is no additional shadda)

even the kasra below the ra is rendered badly, because it melts with the ra and can not be detected. This combination without shadda is a possible join.

winxp ff renders it the same way. Though a bad example, IE7 renders this one fine (but others bad) ;-)
