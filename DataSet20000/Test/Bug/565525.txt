When I try to move the browser window around the screen it freezes up the screen
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20100503 Firefox/3.6.4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

This actually occurred after the last update, so I tried the new Beta 3.6.4 to see if it would improve things. Same problem. When I try to move the window on the screen, it moves a few pixels and freezes up the screen. I actually can't even get the mouse to go to the Taskbar. I do a ctrl-alt-delete and sometimes the screen unfreezes, but most of the time I have to exit Firefox. This does not happen right when I first start the program, but after leaving it on for a while, I can't move it. I also get locked up when I try to open the browse (for Power Point) window after a download of a PPS file. Freeze up.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Leave browser on for a while, usually with a few tabs, news videos often included
2.Try to move browser to another screen location. 
3.Freeze up. (Actually cannot open other programs on desktop.)
Actual Results:  
Total screen freeze-up, audio of video still proceeds, but video locked up.

Expected Results:  
Let me move the window, or sometimes open a browse for open-with program on a download.
