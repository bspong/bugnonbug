Once I realised that problem when I was using VLC player, it was showing movies correctly until I open a website with Firefox and later, vlc player slows down and begins not to show some frames... If I close firefox after see that, problem still continue and restarting vlc is not a solution too (I check my CPU and memory with windows task manager and everything is OK and firefox.exe is not in the processes list too). VLC player is not the only problem, Firefox also causes my Windows desktop to slow down, I can see that by observing. I use Firefox for browse to some newspaper sites and facebook and this sites are using flash, maybe problem comes from flash because in simple pages (like this bugzilla page), it doesn't give that problem to me. When I was using older version of firefox, there wasn't any similar problem.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I open VLC player and begin watching a video
2. Then I open some websites with firefox

Actual Results:  
VLC player begins not to show some frames in video, you can see similar problem on windows desktop too

Expected Results:  
VLC player or windows desktop graphics should work properly
