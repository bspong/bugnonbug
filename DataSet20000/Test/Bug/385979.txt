selecting tabs in Advanced Options (preferences?) pegs CPU 100% for 6 seconds, hangs/ pauses/ freezes/ delays response

One clearly repeatable symptom of what is otherwise a periodic hang with FireFox 2.  Was not an issue with FF1.5 previously, has been regularly happening with 2.0.0.4 after the upgrade.

Situation: Open Tools>Options dialog, click on Advanced category and then try to change tabs among those offered: [General | Network | Update | Encryption].  At each click/tab change, experience hang [freeze|delay|pause] of 6 seconds (one-onethousand, two-onethousand... six-onethousand) before the tab focus changes.  Running Process Explorer, see CPU go from 0-4% to 100% at each tab change for that same period.  Happens nowhere else in Options dialogs - eg: can change categories [Main | Tabs | Content...] readily with no delay, and no blip in CPU usage.

I am also experiencing periodic hangs [freezes|delays|pauses] when browsing web pages (like on this one) that affects typing, clicking on links, etc.  However, I have not been able to figure out a pattern for that behavior -- but the above is 100% repeatable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Tools>Options>Advanced
2. Change tab focus among [General | Network | Update | Encryption]

Actual Results:  
Experience 6 second delay while CPU usage goes to 100% and then drops

Expected Results:  
Minor to no delay and little impact to CPU usage while working in preferences

I can supply a flash movie of the preferences situation if that would be helpful.  I have tried running in safe mode for the general browsing freeze (no difference) but cannot remember whether I tried the prefs issue while in safe mode.  Will do that and post a follow-up.

BTW: Bug category reads "Preferences" but FF2 now calls that dialog "Options"?
