Page does not redirect to office.microsoft.com when installing Office 2010
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

I love firefox and thought you might want to know about this bug so that other people are not turned off by the new 4.0 version.  I have just upgraded from MS Office 2007 to MS Office 2010.  After the installation, it asked me if I wanted to reboot so it could complete the installation.  I chose not to restart.  The MS Office installer then opened up my default browser (Firefox 4.0) so that I could read the welcome pages for MS Office 2010.

Here's where the problem occurs.  Firefox did not display the page!  When I copied the URL from Firefox to IE and hit Enter, Internet Explorer displayed the page without issue.  The URL I am referring to is:
http://officeredir.microsoft.com/r/rlidOfficeSetupComplete?clid=1033&ver=14&p1=ltPERP&p2=ProPlus

Now, if I copy the URL into a new tab in Firefox and hit Enter, the page does display as it should.  I'm guessing that MS Office 2010 is pasting(copying) the URL in the default browser's location bar, but not actually telling the browser to "go".  I just found this out while I was writing this bug description, so maybe this isn't a problem with your software at all, but with Microsoft's Office install.  I don't think they care too much...

Anyways, thought you might like to know about it.  I'd like to see Firefox become the most used browser worldwide.  Let me know if you need anything else from me.

An Empty tab (page) showed in Firefox 4.0.  I was waiting for it to complete but it never did.
