X server hang on drag-and-drop from modal "Save Link As" dialog.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

When saving from the right click menu of a link, a modal Gnome "Save File As" dialog pops up, leaving the background Firefox window behind.

I can see that the background Firefox window does not respond to the mouse (it shows the hand cursor everywhere).

If I accidentally drag a file from the Save As dialog into Firefox, I get permanently stuck with the right angle DND cursor (and the little symbol disappears as it moves over the window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right click on any link, and select "Save Link As..."
2. Firefox window becomes unresponsive because there is a modal dialog.
3. Select a file in the right pane of the file dialog.
4. Drag the file over the Firefox browser window until the symbol on the right angle cursor changes.

Actual Results:  
This causes the entire X server to hang on the mouse grab.  CLicking or releasing anywhere does not help.
Neither keyboard nor mouse respond any longer, and the only way to release the grab as far as I have tried is to killall firefox-bin from a console.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should more gracefully handle dragging and dropping over a frozen window, or should prevent drag-and-drop from the "save as" dialog (I don't even see how it's useful in that case.)

I'm using X.Org 7.1 on Debian Etch/testing.
I'm using the official (not Debian) Firefox build.
