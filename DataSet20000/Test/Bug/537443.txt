When I choose to download a file (.zip, ...) and the "Save As" dialog appears, I'm given the option to select a folder where to save the file.

This part of selecting the folder sometimes is tricky, I think it has to do with the fact that in the meanwhile the download starts in the background.

It appears that "Save As" dialog maybe looses the focus, and if I try to double click a folder to explore that folder, the action doesn't have effect, so I have to double click another time. At this point, sometimes, the "Save As" dialog disappears instantly and the file get downloaded in the previously selected folder, not in the folder I was intended to select.

Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I'm not sure but it happens most of the times.

1. right click on an http download link of a zip file and choose "save target as"
2. double click a folder to save the file in that folder
Actual Results:  
If the bug occurs, the folder is not selected and the file is instantly saved in the current folder.

Expected Results:  
To select freely the folder where the file should be saved by double clicking the folder icon and enter the folder, from the "save as" dialog.
