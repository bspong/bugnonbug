Iframe scrollbars dont render correctly after display of SSL content in dynamically created iframe

I have a drop-down menu which uses iframes created on the fly in javascript. It seems that when content is displayed in one of these iframes, retrieved over HTTPS, the iframe does not get properly destroyed when the user navigates away to another menu view.

The symptom is that a scrollbar either does not appear to move at all, or only part of the scrollbar moves while the rest remains static.

If you scroll down, (lets say the content scrolls but the scrollbar appears to remain static), then you open another application window on top of Firefox, then close this app window, the scrollbar position refreshes and is displayed correctly until you try to move it again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the url provided
2. Click "Link 1" (nav pane is displayed and scrollbar works fine)
3. Click "Link 2" (wait for external site to load)
4. Click "Link 1" again (scrollbar behaves strangely)
5. Wipe another app over the scrollbar to reveal correct position.
Actual Results:  
Scrollbar doesn't slide while scrolling, or only part of the scrollbar slides.

Expected Results:  
The scrollbar slides down when you scroll down

This only happens on Windows XP, I haven't been able to reproduce it on Vista. It's been reproduced on various PCs including a VPC running XP on Vista.
