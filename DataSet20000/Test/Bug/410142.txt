Affecting multiple versions of Firefox on WinXP & Vista. Not dependant on websites, nor on usage load.

Intermittently, Firefox will disappear from the screen (almost as though it has been minimised), but is not visible in the Taskbar. Opening the Task Manager shows the firefox process continuing to run, as does hitting Alt-Tab until the Firefox application is selected, at which time it returns to the screen.

This gives the user the impression that Firefox has crashes silently, when it has not so much crashed, but has instead disappeared.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
There is no obvious pattern which will replicate this issue.
Fault has been experienced on different versions of Firefox, including the General Firefox release, FrontMotion's version of Firefox and Firefox Portable.
Has also affected Firefox running without any Extensions, as well as Firefox loaded with >20 Extensions.
Actual Results:  
As above -
