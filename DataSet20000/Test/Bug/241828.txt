When choosing "Web Search" on the "Tools" menu (or pressing Ctrl+K), the cursor
appears in the Search bar, as expected.  But if the search icon on the left of
the text field is "Find in this page", it doesn't change to Google (or some
other Web search engine).  In such a case, the user has to manually select a Web
search engine.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. On the Search bar, select "Find in this page" as the search service to use,
if it is not already selected.
2. Click on the "Tools" menu and then select "Web Search", or press Ctrl+K.
Actual Results:  
The cursor appears in the Search bar, but "Find in this page" is still selected
as the search service to use.

Expected Results:  
Google (or some other Web search engine) should be automatically selected if
"Find in this page" is currently selected.

Alternatively, the "Web Search" menu item could simply be renamed "Search",
implying that the user could either search the current Web page or search the Web.
