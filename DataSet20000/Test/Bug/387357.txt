I can't give a specific site because it does this on pretty much every site that uses quick time. when a movie clip starts to play it stops and send a firefox.exe error message. it gets so bad that i have to use Internet Explorer to view clips. the weird thing is firefox never crashed before till 2.0 versions came out. the 1.0 versions never crashed once. i already tried installing firefox and quick time again. the problem didnt go away. and i even checked my other computers to see if my computer was messed up. all 4 computers had the firefox.exe error so i know for sure its the browser. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to a site that has a video clip via quick time. Be sure that the clip is shown on the site and not sent to the computer via temp file.
2. play the video(s) at least 3 times
3. 
Actual Results:  
firefox.exe error message pops up and says it needs to close. then the browser crashes and closes. 

Expected Results:  
play the video clips without crashing the browser. Note: when viewing media player videos it will NOT crash.

if you attempt to open the file and watch a clip on your computer instead of the page you found it. the crash will not work. it only happens on sites that play clips on the pages. as stated before there is no specific site. any site with quick time clips will crash. but for some reason media player clips won't crash.
