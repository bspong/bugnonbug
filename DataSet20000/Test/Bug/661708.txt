When doing a ton of network IO the tabs cannot switch or close but page and other windows continue responding

I have a web comics tab with about 80 entries. When I open them all using middle-click Aurora will almost always stop loading data and stop responding to mouse clicks. However, page scroll keeps working and Javascript appears to keep running.

I can close the browser windows but the firefox.exe process does not quit. The Windows 7 resource monitor tool "Analyze Wait Chains" says it is blocked on network IO.

Strangely when I force-kill the firefox.exe process and then launch Aurora again, it will load the tabs in auto-recovery and they all appear to work.

It does not get stuck on the same download every time.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load 80 tabs with middle-click on a bookmark toolbar folder.
2. 
3.

Actual Results:  
All tabs appear on the tab bar and begin spinning. At some point the browser cannot switch tabs by keyboard or mouse, cannot close tabs with Ctrl-W or X-click and it will not successfully exit the firefox.exe process although it appears to continue processing the Windows message queue.

Expected Results:  
All tabs should load successfullly and allow tab navigation. Also Firefox should properly shut down.
