As I encounter this for the second time, I decided to post a bug.

I searched on google for"ntfs 3g" (see URL above).
It showed me results, the first being http://www.ntfs-3g.org/

But I can not load that page. If I click on the link, nothing happens (google result page is still displayed).

If I middle click it, a new tab is opened, but with no content (gray page, does not have a right click menu at all; the tab title is "(Untitled)"). Menu View / Page Source shows :
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"><html><head><title></title></head><body></body></html>

Manually entering the URL in the address bar does not do anything:
 - new empty tab : nothing happens, tab stays white, "View Page Info" claims about:blank is displayed
 - tab with other content : nothing happens, old content stays in the tab, "View Page Info" claims the old URL is still displayed

I noted, that about:cache?device=memory shows this :
