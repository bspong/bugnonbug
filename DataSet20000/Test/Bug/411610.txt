I was going through, organizing bookmarks by tags, as I have been doing on and off for some time, when the bookmark 'star' suddenly quit allowing bookmark folders to be moved automatically from certain folders to others.

Moving those bookmarks manually from the sidebar also fails - no error generated, drag and drop simply has no actual effect. Firefox opens the affected bookmarks without issue and seems to append tags fine, however accessing the affected folders from places organizer gives the following error

[Assertion Failed]
ASSERT: empty URL spec
Stack Trace: 
0:PU__uri(null)
1:PTV_getCellText(4,[object TreeColumn])

Restoring bookmarks from backup files has no effect. Have not yet attempted reinstall. No obvious cause.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
open places organizer and select the affected folder.
Actual Results:  
open places organizer and select the affected folder.

Expected Results:  
show the bookmarks in the folder
