Turn off the noautohide mode when the browser toolbox is closed, or when the browser is closed
I have been using the noautohide feature in the browser toolbox recently, and it's very useful. But I've been bitten by the fact that it persists its state. And Gijs was talking about this on IRC today too.

Say you turn it ON, debug a thing, then forget about it, close the browser, come back the next day and open a popup. 
The popup will stay and you might not realize that that's because the noautohide feature remained ON.

The feature should be considered as a debugging helper that should have its lifetime synchronized to that of the debugger you're using when turning it ON (if that makes any sense).

- either it should turn OFF when you close the browser toolbox where you started it and remain OFF
- or it should turn OFF when you close the browser where you started it and remain OFF
- or it should turn OFF when close the browser toolbox but come back ON when that browser toolbox is opened again

Gijs said he just lost 5 minutes trying to understand why a popup wouldn't close. And I've seen this a few days ago too. I didn't loose time because I was lucky to understand quickly the issue, but I can certainly see people being confused by it especially if they toggled it ON by mistake.
