My Yahoo! page has a set of modules, each of which has 3 buttons used to refresh the module, set the preferences for the module, or delete the module.  Additionally, the page is divided in a main (wide) column that goes about 7/8 of the width of the page and a 2nd (narrow) column taking up the remaining 1/8.  The buttons for the modules in the wide column often appear at the right of the page (lined up vertically with the buttons for the narrow column).  Usually, this seems to happen for all the modules in the wide column.  Occasionally some of the modules lower in the page will have their buttons correctly placed.  Additionally, the misplaced buttons do not perform their functions (nor does clicking where the button should be perform the function).  Correctly placed buttons (in the narrow column or in the wide column when it does have correctly placed buttons) do work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the URL (at least when logged in as me).
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Buttons are misplaced near the right of the window and do not work (per the description).

Expected Results:  
Buttons should appear at the right side of the module title bar and should perform their functions when pressed.
