Whenever I have "Remember what I enter in forms and the search bar" is checked, I have a problem manually signing into my Gmail account!

Whenever "Remember what I enter in forms and the search bar" is checked and OPERATIONAL when signing into Gmail, I am only able to manually type-in just the first FIVE letters of my Gmail "Username", before Firefox causes the caret to automatically pop down to the beginning of the Gmail "Password" box (and any additional letters of your "Username", that you may be typing, become Password asterisks [***])!  Because of this, in order to finish logging-in, I have to then manually delete the mistaken "Password" asterisks, manually move the caret back to the END of the first FIVE letters of my Gmail "Username" in order to be able to finish typing it, and only THEN can I go on to insert my Gmail "Password".  If "Remember what I enter in forms and the search bar" is unchecked and NON-OPERATIONAL, however, I have NO problem manually logging in to my Gmail account.  I have a work-around, however: If "Remember what I enter in forms and the search bar" is operational, I can fully insert my Gmail "Username" by clicking on the "remembered" username when it pops-up after typing the first letter of my "Username".  Even though anyone can easily use this "workaround", I feel that the this inability to be able to manually sign-in (should you so choose) to Gmail when "Remember what I enter in forms and the search bar" is activated, is still an obvious "bug" of some kind in Firefox > Tools > Options > History which should be FIXED (even though it may not be of the highest priority)!  Thanks! 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Activate "Remember what I enter in forms and the search bar" by checking box.  
2.  Attempt to sign-in to Gmail by manually typing your "Username"
3.  After manually typing-in ONLY the first FIVE letters of your Gmail "Username", Firefox will automatically pop the caret down to the beginning of the Gmail "Password box", and attempt to complete the "Username" with "Password" asterisks. 
Actual Results:  
Only the first five letters of the Gmail "Username" will show, and any letters that you were typing at that time in order to complete your Gmail "Username" will become asterisks in the Gmail "Password" box.

Expected Results:  
I have to delete the Gmail "Password" asterisks, move the caret back to the "Username" box in order to manually complete it, and then go on to insert my Gmail "Password".

Let me finish typing the Gmail "Password" COMPLETELY, and then go on to my Gmail "Password" box to type IT in.
