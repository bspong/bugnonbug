firefox disables latest version of flash
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686 on x86_64; rv:7.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0
Build ID: 20110922153450

Steps to reproduce:

install flash with the latest version.
I am running firefox 7.0
on linux kernel version 2.6.18-274.7.1.el5xen
which is CentOS release 5.7 (Final)
I've run a yum update on everything to make sure I have the latest version.
I have installed flash with yum, with rpm and by untaring it and installing by hand.
the manual install I used install_flash_player_11_linux.x86_64.tar.gz as the latest version I've just downloaded from adobe.
I have tried it with and without nswrapper


Actual results:

Flash is disabled with the message "For your safety, Firefox has disabled your outdated version of Flash. Please upgrade to the latest version."


Expected results:

flash should be working. This wouldn't be so bad if you were to give an option to go ahead and run flash. But there isn't one, you ASSUME that your auto-detect program is working fine... even when it's not. Give us an option to run flash any way and this would be fixed. I've looked on line and sifted through hundreds of emails to newsgroups about this problem in both linux and windows but nobody seems to have an answer.
