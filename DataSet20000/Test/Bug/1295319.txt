Menus and dropdowns stop working entirely after extended use
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:48.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/48.0
Build ID: 20160802074514

Steps to reproduce:

1. Use the browser normally for a while (maybe several days)
2. Right click. If a menu appears, try again later after giving it a little more use.


Actual results:

No menu/dropdown appears. No menus appear at all at any point. When navigating the main menu with alt, if a menu were to appear due to some action (e.g. alt+F) it does not and the menu bar disappears. Pressing F10 shows the menu bar appearing and disappearing rapidly. Pressing the hamburger menu does nothing. Right clicking anywhere on any part of the browser does nothing unless the website has set up some kind of handler for this. Typing in the address bar or search bar shows no dropdown. Pressing enter inside the address bar does not work the vast majority of the time. Clicking the search icon in the search bar, or the security icon in the address bar, or any addons with menus of their own, does nothing. Clicking on dropdowns ("select" elements) focuses them but does not show a menu.


Expected results:

A menu should appear on right-click, or on choosing a category in the menu bar, or on pressing F10. A dropdown should appear when a "select" element is clicked. The address bar should show history (or anything else) in a dropdown. The search bar should show search engines in a dropdown. The address bar should respond to the enter keypress. The security icon should show security information. The search icon should show search engines. The addons should show their respective menus.
