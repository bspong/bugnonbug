I've searched a lot of bugs, and this is not the case of menus showing up on the wrong screen.

I have a laptop with my monitor as a second display.
The laptop is the primary display, and the monitor is the secondary display.
The secondary display is placed above the primary display.
When I have Firefox open on the primary display, all menus work normally.
When I have Firefox on the upper/secondary display, the first menus that pop up on main menu bar (File, Edit, View, ...), the Bookmarks Toolbar, and context menus also all work normally.
But when you try to go to a sub-menu off of any of them, if that sub-menu is long enough that in it's default positioning (that the first sub-menu item is horizontally aligned with the selected menu item) it would have gone off the bottom of the screen (crossing over to the primary display), it will fail to display at all.
Sub-menus that are small enough to display in their default positioning without crossing the bottom edge display fine.
An exception are sub-menus that are so long that they are taller than the entire window and require up/down scroll arrows at the top/bottom.  These will display, but usually not sized to the entire window.

A way I can more definitively tell it has to do with exceeding the monitor/display boundary is with the context menus.  On the secondary display, if I right click on the browser window up high enough and select something like "Reload Every >" or "Web Developer >" it will display the sub-menu.
If I do the same thing too close to the bottom of the window, to where the sub-menu would reach the bottom of the monitor display (and normally require being repositioned to stay on the single display), then the sub-menu fails to display at all.
In some of these cases where the sub-menu does display, it incorrectly adds the up/down scroll sections.  I think this is after it has displayed correctly once, then failed to display, then got it to display again.  I have not consistently reproduced this though, and mainly provide it as additional info.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. See "Details" above.

Actual Results:  
Sub-menus on secondary display which hit the bottom edge of the display fail to show at all.

Expected Results:  
Sub-menus should display in the exact same fashion on the secondary display as they do on the primary display, and should of course always be displayed at all.
