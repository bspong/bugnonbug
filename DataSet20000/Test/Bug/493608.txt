Cookie header not being set in request when using "Save link as..." context menu item

When I use the context menu "Save link as..." item to download a file the resulting request does not have the Cookie: header set. (checked using burp logging proxy) The consequence is that files which are protected by any cookie based authentication do not download properly.

This does not occur at all when browsing normally.

I have tested this using FF 3.0.10 on Windows XP Pro and it does not have the same issue but some Vista users at my clients site have reported the same problem. I won't link to the site because it is NSFW but I have confirmed this issue on other sites too (see below)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any site which sets a cookie such as http://news.bbc.co.uk
2. CTRL Click on a link and select "Save link as..."
3.
Actual Results:  
Request is sent missing the Cookie: header

Expected Results:  
Request should be sent including the cookie header
