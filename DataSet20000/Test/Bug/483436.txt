history can help identify adware
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.7) Gecko/2009021910 Firefox/3.0.7
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.7) Gecko/2009021910 Firefox/3.0.7

Mozilla displays pages as a result of user actions, scripts
in already loaded pages, other processes requesting it, etc.
Sometimes users are presented with unwanted pages (it would
be fairer to state that users are plagued with that).
This displaying of unwanted pages breaks security since it
results in making users do something that they do not want to
do, like, e.g. reading an adware.
This request for enhancement it to display in the history the
source of the request that make a page displayed (addon, plugin,
user action, another page, external process, etc.). I.e. any
information the brower has regarding who asked it to display a
page. This helps a lot users to spot malicious adware.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. no way, there is an adware somewhere hidden in my Firefox that makes
it display some commercial page every 10-15 minutes. No antivirus and
anti-adware, and anti-spyware had been able to spot it.
Reinstalling Firefox makes the problem disappear for few hours only.


Expected Results:  
Displaying "show all history", I would like to see a chronological
list of pages displayed (that does not get reordered when clicking
on them, as it does currently). Clicking on one entry I would like
to see who told Firefox to display the page.
