YouTube is very slow when different tab has console open (STR: comment 11)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:44.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/44.0
Build ID: 20160209233610



Actual results:

Since Firefox is advanced enough that YouTube uses also on Linux at default the HTML video player I'm noticing that doing actions on a site on YouTube where a HTML video is embedded are very slow. Here are some details:

- It is not required that a video plays.
- The effect appears very randomly but is present about 50% of the time. Sometimes it happens shortly after Firefox is running and at other times it happens if Firefox is running for several days.
- Any actions will be delayed for up to a few seconds. For example moving over a running video to call its statusbar or even just scrolling sown through the comments will be delayed.


Expected results:

I would expect that YouTube would either run permanently slow (for example because of low system specs) or permanently fast.
