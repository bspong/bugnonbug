Live Bookmark Feed Discovery Includes Atom URI that is not a site feed

Links for Atom that are not site feeds are being recognized as site feeds.  On
the example site (www.stephenduncanjr.com), there are two link tags in the head
being recognized as feeds:

<link rel="service.feed" type="application/atom+xml" title="Stephen Duncan Jr's
Blog" href="http://www.stephenduncanjr.com/blog.xml" />
<link rel="service.post" type="application/atom+xml" title="Stephen Duncan Jr's
Blog" href="http://www.blogger.com/atom/3411034" /> 

Only the first one should be recognized.  User's who bookmark the second will
get a "Live Bookmark" could not be loaded message" when attempting to view posts
for that link.  The site feed autodiscovery feature should only  find the
service.feed link, I think.

Almost all Blog pages produced by Blogger (www.blogger.com) will feature this
particular example problem.
