Untrusted connection, missing "I understand the risks" and can't workaround
User Agent:  
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.8; rv:30.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/30.0

Steps to reproduce: 
1) Install Kuma locally as described here: https://kuma.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation-vagrant.html#getting-up-and-running

2) Visit the local site as in step 13 of those instructions (https://developer-local.allizom.org/)

Expected:
An invalid certificate that I can add an exception for (which is indeed what happens in Firefox 29).

Actual: 
There is no "I understand the risks" on the "Untrusted" page in Fx30. I also can't make an exception stick using Preferences->Advanced->Certificates, or about:certerror. In the latter two cases there is no error when trying add an exception; it just doesn't result in an exception that allows me to open the page.

Just to reiterate, this all works as expected in Fx29, but not in Fx30.

I'm pasting the certificate error here in case it helps:

Technical Details

developer-local.allizom.org uses an invalid security certificate. The certificate is not trusted because it is self-signed. The certificate is only valid for the following names: developer-kumadev.mozilla.org, developer-mdndev.mozilla.org, developer-dev.mozilla.org, mdn-local.mozillademos.org (Error code: sec_error_ca_cert_invalid)
