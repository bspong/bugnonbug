Summary:
An "unresponsive script" dialogue triggered by Firefox's session restore code prevent browser sanitisation: resulting in the disclosure of private data. No warning or error message was given.

Long version:
This afternoon I was researching a highly sensitive problem on the net using Firefox. During my research I collected a large number of open tabs all containing related and CONFIDENTIAL pages.
At the end of the session I right clicked on one of the tabs and chose "close other tabs" from the context menu, then loaded the default homepage over the remaining page. I then ran "clear private data" using the default setting (all options excluding cookies and passwords were selected).
Confident my browsing history was gone I closed the main window to terminate Firefox. The window closed revealing an "unresponsive script" dialogue which had popped under my browser session and been missed. I dismissed it by clicking the close cross then shut down the computer and left.
I returned later to find a colleague browsing through the tabs which I had been researching earlier!
I was using PC hardware running the current, mainstream, 2.0.0.5 Windows release of Firefox but am concerned that this frightening security & privacy failure will affect other platforms and OSs.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open many tabs in a single browser window and await the unresponsive scrip dialogue to be triggered by the crash recovery code.
2. Ignoring unresponsive script dialogue:
2a. "Close Other Tabs"
2b. "Clear Private Data"
2c. Close browser window.
3. Dismiss unresponsive script dialogue.
4. Start Firefox
Actual Results:  
The "restore session" dialogue is presented upon restart. Electing to restore the session, Firefox reloads all the tabs which were open (presumably) when the 

Expected Results:  
No tabs were open when Firefox was terminated. The session was sanitised at shutdown therefore:
No record of the previous session should be retained, no "restore session" option should be offered and the previous PRE SANITISATION session must NOT BE RECOVERABLE.
