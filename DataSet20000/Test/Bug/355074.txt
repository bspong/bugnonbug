search suggestions can be extremely inappropriate

Typing very innocent works in the search bar can result in being given suggestions most people wouldn't want kids to see.  The most glaring example I know of was found by Mozilla Champion Leonidas Jones;  typing "mommy" in the seach bar while Google is selected results in the top suggestion "mommylovescock".  With Yahoo, the second suggestion is "mommygotboobs".

The search sits make the suggestions, but it will look to the user as if Firefox itself makes the suggestions.  I'm filing the bug because (a) this could harm kids and (b) this could result in some very bad PR for the project.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Select either Google or Yahoo in the search bar.
2.  Type "mommy" in the search bar, but do not hit enter.
3.  Wait for suggestions to load from the remote site, and have a look.

Actual Results:  
Suggestions for popular but far from wholesome searches will be displayed.


I don't know;  one idea would be to disable the suggestion feature by default, going back to using saved searches to make suggestions.
