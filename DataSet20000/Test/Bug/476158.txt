Script in an inactive tab resizes window - this shouldn't be allowed

My Firefox is configured with a double home page (http://netradio.dr.dk/content.asp?kanal=klassisk|about:blank). When I start Firefox then activate the blank tab/page (and begin typing a URL) the window is resized down by what appears to be a script running in the inactive, background tab/page. This is systematic and very annoying.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set home 
page(s) to http://netradio.dr.dk/content.asp?kanal=klassisk|about:blank
2. Start Firefox
3. Click on tab for blank page (quickly)
Actual Results:  
Window is resized by script in running in first home page (http://netradio.dr.dk/content.asp?kanal=klassisk) even though it is in the background

Expected Results:  
Window should remain same size. It seems obvious that the window size and any other appearance attributes should be controlled by the foreground tab/page and not one of the background tabs/pages.

Workaround: manually resize the window to its original size.
