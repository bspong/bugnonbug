When opening some various myspace band profiles, all information was scattered about randomly, while information was displayed neatly and organized in other browsers like Internet Explorer 6. I'm guessing it's a bug in the Firefox decoder.

I experienced similar problems in Mozilla Firefox v2, but it is much much worse in Firefox v3

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter URL (i.e. www.myspace.com/asilaydying) into the NAV bar and enter URL
Actual Results:  
Page displayed scattered across the screen so far that it could not be displayed all at once. Had to use horizantal scroll bar. As opposed to a 600 pixel width for the main content of the page, it was spread across several thousand pixels.

Expected Results:  
Page should have displayed as it would in Internet Explorer

I have a dual display set up that might have added to this problem. 

My screen resolutions are set at 1280x1024 each.

My video card is an nvidea EVGA 8600GTS PCI-E card
