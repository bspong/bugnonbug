Using webmail to open multiple e-mails in multiple tabs: Attachment name shifts by ONE tab.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3

After openining around 80 webmails in the tab (all with attachments),
attachments shift to the next tab. Please note, that attachment filename
is correct BUT the contain of the attachment shifts by one.

For example:

--- Correct ---
Tab 1: Mail A with attachment A
Tab 2: Mail B with attachment B
Tab 3: Mail C with attachment C

--- Incorrect: Firefox ---
Tab 1: Mail A with attachment ?
Tab 2: Mail B with attachment A (Display of attachment is still B)
Tab 3: Mail C with attachment B (Display of attachment is still C)

Reproducible: Didn't try
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start webmail => Login
2. Open 50+ mails every one with word attachment(name: AA, BA, ...,ZZ)
3. Close some tab using the X and check for the contain of each attachment.
4. At some time: Attachment with display filename(n) BUT contain is filename(n-1)

Actual Results:

It just causes inconvenience in using of Firefox 0.9.3
