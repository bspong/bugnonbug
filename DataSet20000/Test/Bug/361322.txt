When printing web pages the resultant print is broken up over 3 or 4 pages, or very small, no matter what print settings I use on my laser printer.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.8) Gecko/20061025 Firefox/1.5.0.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.8) Gecko/20061025 Firefox/1.5.0.8

I can print normally from other windows applications, inc explorer. I have only recently come across this issue inthe past few weeks after downloading the firefox upgrade. 
I would like to drop back to the previous FF version which will probably resolve the issue.. How can I do that??


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.file>print
2.select printer
3.click ok

Actual Results:  
printout is either tiny, or small and spread over a few pages

Expected Results:  
whole webpage print covering whole page in one piece

sorry if this has been covered.. I have read the webpage on bug reporting, and have looked up the bug list... I really have not got a clue what a sea monkey is... except those little things that grow and breed and die in jam jars in kids bedrooms..
Thanks and please help.. I keep drifting back to explorer (yuk), as I regularly need prints.
