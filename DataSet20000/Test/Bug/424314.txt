On IPv6 SSL connections Godaddy Root CA will not detected
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; de; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080201 Firefox/2.0.0.12

If Firefox 2.0.0.12 (3.0b5 also) is connecting a SSL site by IPv6 it complains about the certificate. In case of IPv4 no problem occures. This may happen on dual protocol sites e.g. mail.taunusstein.net which have DNS A record for IPv4 and an AAAA record for IPv6. SSL certificate is for mail.taunusstein.net which is true for both IPv4 and IPv6 due to certificate does not depend on used protocol.

Microsoft Internet Explorer does neither complain on IPv4 nor IPv6, which seems to be right behaviour.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn off IPv6, so Firefox will connect with IPv4 to https://mail.taunusstein.net/webmail: Everything goes right

2. Turn on IPv6, restart Firefox and connect with IPv6 to https://mail.taunusstein.net/webmail: Firefox complains about certificate.

You ca do this also with https://mail.taunusstein.net/cgi/newuser.cgi which shows your IP address, so you can verify, if you connect with IPv4 or IPv6.

Actual Results:  
Firefox complains about certificate if connection uses IPv6.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should not complain about certificate if hostname matches certificates subject and root CA is known to Firefox, even when connection is done via IPv6.
