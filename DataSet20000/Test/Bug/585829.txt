html input fields with php coding producing whitespaces and linebreaks when it previously didn't

This is probably due to poor programming habits or whatever, but I have been known to do it a few times, so I'm guessing there are many others. Only reason I'm reporting it is because this was non-existant pre-4.0

The issue seems to occur when inserting php coding into tag. This problem did not exist in Firefox 3 (latest version).

Example:
<input
   type='text'
   value='
      <?php
         ...
            php coding here
         ...
            multiple lines n stuff
         echo $result
      ?>' />

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create input field which contains multiple lines of php coding within the value tag.
2. I pass the variables through a jquery.get method to a PHP script which simply returns the variable back
3. Using javascript, I use an alert box to display the variable.
Actual Results:  
Variable contains spacing, line breaks, and more...

Expected Results:  
In previous versions of Firefox (pre 4.0) there were no whitespaces or linebreaks
