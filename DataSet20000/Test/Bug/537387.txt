The ASX Company Announcements page shows a large list of PDFs.

Clicking on one "PDF" link makes an "agree" window pop-up, and you click "I Agree" to the terms. The pdf is downloaded and opened in a pdf reader and the "PDF" link turns pink ok.

If you click on another pdf to download it within a short time of the previous download (ie, less than 5-10mins), no "agree" window pops up, so you get the pdf immediately. However, the "PDF" link does not turn pink. If you wait sufficiently long so that an "agree" window pops up when you click a "PDF" link, then the link does turn pink.

Old versions of Firefox before 3.0 did not have this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit http://www.asx.com.au/asx/statistics/prevBusDayAnns.do
2.Click a PDF
3.Click "I agree" in popup.
4.Click another PDF
Actual Results:  
The first PDF link turns pink.
The second does not.

Expected Results:  
Both PDF links should turn pink.
