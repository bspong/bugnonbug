I'm in an intranet using an procy-server to connect to the internet.
On my exlude list (Don't use proys for) there are 2 Servers.

First Server is an HTTP-Server displaying an HTML page with an <IFrame>. The IFrame includes a HTML page on Server 2.

The page on server one is displayed correctly.
The page on server two is displayed correctly if i directly access to the server.

If i access on server one, and the page from server two is included in the IFrame, it dont get displayed. The load is extreme slow, and after some time I get a message that the page can not be displayed.
I get the same message if i shout down the second server, so i think the connection dont work at all.

If I change the settings to use no proxy at all, everything works fine. Page on server one, server two AND page on server two included into page on server one get displayed correctly. Of course i cannot access to the internet anymore.
