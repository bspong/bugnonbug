Opening local file via explorer fails if name contains spaces

Opening local files in "my documents" via explorer results in the following four pages being opened in separate tabs:
- file:///C:/Documents - titled "Problem loading page", which says file cannot be found 
- http://www.cdc.gov/
- http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/using/howto/security/settings.mspx
- http://www.law.ou.edu/hist/

I presume the last three are the result of an automated google? But why would it directly open 3 results, and always the same results?

The first page with the error "Firefox can't find the file at /C:/Documents" seems to indicate that the file name has been truncated at the first space. The file I was trying to open was: "C:\Documents and Settings\steve\My Documents\test.htm".

I have firefox set as the default browser. 

files with the extension "html" do not cause a problem and open correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. set firefox as the default browser
2. create a file with the extension "htm" in a folder with a space in the name (ie: "C:\Documents and Settings")
3. double-click the file to open in the default browser

Actual Results:  
the following four pages being opened in separate tabs:
- file:///C:/Documents - titled "Problem loading page", which says file cannot be found 
- http://www.cdc.gov/
- http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/using/howto/security/settings.mspx
- http://www.law.ou.edu/hist/

Expected Results:  
file displayed in firefox

files the the extension "html" open withoyut problem.
firefox is set as default browser.
cannot view advanced file associations details for "htm" via explorer, so cannot compare differences between "html" and "htm" handling.
previously had latest release version of firefox (1.07?) installed, and installed beta 1 etc without uninstalling previous version.
