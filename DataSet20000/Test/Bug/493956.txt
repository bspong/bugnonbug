Applet loses focus while executing Javascript method.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Happens with the 'new Java Plugin' 1.6u10+ which uses a new Interface to interact with Firefox. The 'old Java Plugin' (1.5 and 1.6 till update7) do not show this problem.

The left button belongs to the applet which upon clicking displays a Google Visualization Chart in the browser.

What you hardly notice is that upon displaying the visualization the applet button loses it's focus (focus is indicated by a dotted border around the button).

This focus stealing happens probably during the redraw of visualizations of type: Bar, Column, Line, Area and Piechart. They all seem to be somehow technically very similar. All other visualization do not steal the focus.

The same applet in IE, Chrome, Opera, etc. does not loose focus.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.chartle.net/static_html/Visualization2.html
2. Click applet button to draw chart

Actual Results:  
Result: applet button loses focus. This is only a testcase and a button losing focus does not seem severe. In our real-world applet this bug is disastrous.

Expected Results:  
Button keeps focus after being pressed. This is the behavior in all other browsers.
