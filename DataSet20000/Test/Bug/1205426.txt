Computed Panel on Element Inspector Malfunctioning
Created attachment 8662032
View of rules repeating over and over

Steps to reproduce:

Resizing window, selecting elements that are children of already inspected elements, just pretty much most types of behavior one would carry out while developing a site.


Actual results:

Rules in computed panel show up multiple times (ie height may show "100% 50% 100% 50% 100% 50% 100% 50% 100% 50% 100% 50% " rather than just "100%" with 50% in strikeout. Also seeing rules of parents/children/unrelated elements at times that should not be present and have no impact on inspected element.


Expected results:

Up until about a month ago this was much tidier, and not broken. If for example an element had one general CSS rule and one additional contained within a media query, the computed panel would display both rules once when the rule is expanded – the inactive one would have a strikeout. They now repeat over and over indefinitely if the window is resized to trigger each CSS rule interchangeably. I've tested this in both OS X 10.9.5 and 10.10.4, both Macbook Pros.
