Copy and paste fail with Firefox 3.6 and 4.0 on Mac OS X
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7

Both copy and paste of text via command-V and by mouse menu fail in all situations that I have tried.  No particular URL is involved.  No extensions are installed (retested with clean profile).  Copy and cut do not copy text.  Selected text is not copied to the pasteboard, so when switching to another application, any previously-copied text is pasted.  Paste within Firefox 3.6 to any of URL bar, search bar, Firebug command line, or textbox fails, regardless of the source of the copied text.  Cut (command-X) clears the selection, but does not copy to the system pasteboard.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Case 1: copy failure:

1. select text in other application
2. copy
3. paste to verify that selected text was copied
4. select text in FF 3.6
5. copy
6. select input field in other application
7. paste

Case 2: paste failure:

1. select text in another application
2. copy
3. paste to verify that selected text was copied
4. select input field in FF 3.6
5. paste
Actual Results:  
Case 1: Previously selected text pasted.

Case 2: No result.

Expected Results:  
Case 1: Expected text selected and copied in FF 3.6 to be inserted into input field of other application.

Case 2: Expected FF 3.6 input field contents to change.
