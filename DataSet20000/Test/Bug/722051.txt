Sessionstore.js being truncated after restart and a few tabs not restored

Steps to reproduce:

Restarted FF after a closure of FF (Crash, reboot, close etc).
I have FF set to restore sessions (if it can, it rarely does without "Oops").
I have many windows and tabs open (but I have enough RAM to spare).


Actual results:

The sessionstore.js file is smaller than it was (truncated) so only some of my windows and tabs are restored (most of them are).
I know this as I take regular backups of the .js and .bak files (as I have had various problems with bookmarks/session info over time) and I compare the sizes from different dates (the number of windows and tabs changes infrequently on a day to day basis).
The most recent file was ~4MB and the backup file from the last session is ~8/9MB.

It seems FF *sometimes* truncates the file *somehow*.  I have not tried to reproduce as it seems to happen depending on when/how FF terminates, and when the session is at the same or simialr state (i.e. I have restored a backup or .bak file and at some point the file is truncated again (I am currently using a store from 23/1/2012))

I have recently had to restart my computer many times and hence this happened a few times.  I also have FF crash A LOT when it consumes too much memory (the crash tool sends you guys an error report) and thus I have seen this problem many times in the last few days.


Expected results:

As per design - the sessionstore.js should contain the tabs and windows from the last save of the session, and I did not close the windows/tabs that are missing at any point prior to the crash/close/restart.
