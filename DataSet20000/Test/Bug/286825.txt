Firefox.exe is compiled with incorrect Product Version information
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0 StumbleUpon/1.9991
Build Identifier: All Including Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0 

Knowing what exactly which version of Fx is installed on thier PCs is very
important to corporate customers (for security purposes in particular).

Most software inventory scanners read the the properties of .exe files to
indentify the Product, Vendor and Version infomation.  This is what our sw
inventory scanner gets from the firefox.exe (v1.01.):

Product Name: Firefox
Product Version: 1.7.6: 2005022518
Vendor: Mozilla

This is a little confusing when you are trying to determine the "real" version
of Fx that is installed on PCs on your network.

I know that Product Version of 1.7.6 relates to the version of the gecko engine
however, firefox.exe is not the gecko engine and it should report the Product
Version of firefox not of gecko. Perhaps the gecko engine version (bundled
inside firefox.exe) could be reported in a different (custom?) attribute in the .exe

I think fixing this bug would be very easy to acomplish and I hope we can get it
right for the final compile of Fx 1.0.2 to make corporate adoptors of Fx more
confortable with rolling out Fx.
