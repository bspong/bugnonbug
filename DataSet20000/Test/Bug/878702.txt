disabling sharing on cache-control: no-store is an unexpected limitation
The share button is disabled if a page is served with the "Cache-Control: no-store" header. This doesn't appear consistent with the intent of this header, nor with the expectations of a user.

The use of this header has also slightly diverged from the RFC, in that beyond protecting sensitive information it is sometimes used just to prevent caching of timely and/or changing information. IT doesn't make sense to block sharing when this header is used as such. Even if used correctly however the RFC has the language that a user may still explicitly store the page. One would assume this intent would also be applied to explicitly sharing the page.

Lacking any sort of feedback mechanism it won't be clear to a user why they can't share a particular page. It should also be noted that nothing stops the user from copying the URL and sharing it directly on a provider. Thus the limitation is one that a reasonable user should not expect as it is a new restriction on their behaviour.

I would recommend lifting this restriction. If it will not be lifted then at least improve the user experience. This includes presenting a message saying why they can't share a page and providing an explicit override option (for example, clicking share on such a page shows a panel with a warning, pressing a "Continue anyways" button will then bring up the normal share panel).
