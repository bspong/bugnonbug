Repeating desktop screenshot fragments on page background on amd64

The page background on www.slskrecords.com has been replaced by a fragment of what's on my screen. Kind of hard to describe, look at the screenshot. This only happens on the 64-bit build; the 32-bit Gentoo binary package (mozilla-firefox-bin) does not exhibit this problem (different library versions?).

Some updates of my screen are also reflected in Firefox; for instance when clicking on the terminal icon, it updates once the terminal window pops up; the launch icon on the toolbar changes to the "mouseover" state. But there are no updates while the button is in the pressed state etc.

Rendering of this page is also very slow; it takes over 1 second (no exaggeration) to switch to this tab on my Athlon 64 3000+, with unaccelerated "nv" drivers.

I have observed a similar effect on another page as well, but I cannot recall where.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.slskrecords.com/
2. Observe the described awkward effect.

Actual Results:  
The background image has been replaced with a screenshot fragment of my desktop.


Expected Results:  
Displayed the correct background.

Cairo version 1.6.4, GTK+ version 2.12.5-r1, X.org 7.3 (X.org server version 1.4.0.90-r3)
Using nvidia's unaccelerated/open source "nv" drivers.

What else is relevant?
