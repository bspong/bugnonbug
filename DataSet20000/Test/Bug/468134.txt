"View Details" of debits/checks doesn't work any longer at Bank of America with new version of Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4

Yesterday I could view details of my payments/checks/debits through my account at the Bank of America website.  Since my Firefox updated this morning I can't view details any longer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Sign in and view account
2. Click on "View/Edit Details"
3. Sit and wait and wait and wait with no luck
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens, the browser just sits there

Expected Results:  
I should be given an image of my cancelled check

I have no idea what themes, etc. are.  All I know is that I'm not given a choice to accept or deny an update, my Firefox automatically updates when updates are available.  Because of this I have been stopped in my tracks on a project I was working on.  Below I selected "Critical: The software crashes, hangs, or causes you to lose data." because I believe the Firefox browser is "hanging" and that's why it's not allowing me to view my cancelled check details.  This is CRITICAL for me...  I've had to move to the Safari browser!!  That's CRITICAL to Mozilla...
