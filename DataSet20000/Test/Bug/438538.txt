When FireFox is set as default browser an error message pops up when using Mediachance Multimedia Builder 4 before connecting to the web site. The error message is "Multimedia Player - the specific file was not found". This does not occur when Opera, Safari, or Internet Explorer are set as default. Using Multimedia builder I create a project which has built in web links - I compile the project into an exe file. The problem has occured on four Pc systems using 3 different internet connections and two different MMB Versions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Produce small Multimedia Builder Project with inbult web links
2.set Firefox as default browser
3.test project
Actual Results:  
When Firefox is set as default an error message "Multimedia player the specified file was not found" occurs when the web link is activated within the project then the requested web link occurs.

Expected Results:  
The weblink should appear without any pop error messages.

I have tested the problem on 4 computers, two operating systems, 3 different internet connections - I have used Safari, Opera, Internet Explorer and Firefox the problem only occurs when Firefox is made default brwoser. I used 2 different versions of Medichance Multimedia builder
