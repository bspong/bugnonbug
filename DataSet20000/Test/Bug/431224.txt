'open tab' gets slow and slower during a browsing session

Over the course of a few hours of browsing -- a few hundred new tabs --, cmd-t (open a new tab) goes from being immediate to taking a second or two.  I'd not noticed this until the most recent update, to 2.0.0.14.  

This seems not to be a syndrome previously reported: Opening a new window is still fast; opening a link in a new tab is also fast.  Closing a tab is fast, and so is switching tabs.  It's just opening a new blank tab that is slow.

Workaround: restart firefox daily or twice daily.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open firefox anew
2. browse the web by opening a new tab every time you do a google search, a hundred or two times
3. hit cmd-t just one more time
4. continue browsing, then hit cmd-t
Actual Results:  
At (2), a new tab opens immediately with the cursor in the address bar.  At (3), a new tab pops up immediately, then I wait for a noticeable 1 or 2 seconds before the focus goes to the address bar of the new tab.  At (4), it takes a noticeable 1 or 2 seconds before the new tab opens, then a bit longer before the focus moves.
