In using webmail through Firefox, I can be typing an email message when all of a sudden, as I'm typing, the characters I'm typing are no longer part of the sentence.  Instead, they might be inserted in previously typed text, jump to a new line, or become part of a message I've received and to which I'm replying.  When it breaks off from where I'm typing, it can be in the middle of a word or sentence.  I can highlite it and drag it back where it belongs, but this is time consuming and, sometimes, hard to locate.  Any ideas?

Likewise, I can type a message, but when I hit "enter" to skip to the next paragraph, the text I just finished typing vanishes completely.  Hitting "Undo" in "Edit" doesn't reverse what happened.  It's just gone.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open webmail
2. start message
3. keep typing
Actual Results:  
Sometimes works without incident, other times problem describes happens

Expected Results:  
Typed text should appear as typed
