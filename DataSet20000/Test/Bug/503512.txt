Firefox 3.5 steals keyboard focus on startup

When using a window manager with pointer focus, launching Firefox 3.5 causes Firefox to grab the keyboard focus regardless of the pointer status.  Keyboard focus should be left to the window manager so as to honor system-wide preferences.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure your window manager to use pointer focus and to auto-place new windows.
2. Launch Firefox such that it starts up elsewhere on the screen (away from the pointer) while the mouse is on a window that accepts keyboard input
3. Keep typing in the current window, and see the keystrokes go to Firefox instead of the current window as they should.



I think I've seen this happen at other times, but I'm not sure exactly what triggers it.  Perhaps it's something related to switching tabs when some other application has focus, but that's not a frequent occurrence.

When I start up Firefox, I have it configured to restore the tabs from my previous session, and I usually have several.
