Mac version of minefield hangs with very heavy disk activity for about 30 seconds after restarting the browser
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko/20090212 Minefield/3.2a1pre

Each time that my browser is restarted (which generally takes place after a nightly update), Minefield hangs, and accepts no input for about 30 seconds.  The hanging may occur almost immediately after the browser opens, or may take a minute or two to start.  During the time that the hang occurs, I experience very heavy hard disk activity.  I can both hear the hard disk, and I can see the disk activity in Activity Monitor.  Once the disk activity stops, the browser stops hanging and the problem does not occur again until I restart.  This has been going on at least since January.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Restart Minefield (may require an update to the latest build)
2.  Try to use the browser
3.  Within 30 seconds to a minute, the browser starts heavily accessing the disk, and the browser hangs.  A spinning pinwheel is visible when this occurs, indicating that the OS thinks the browser has hung.
4)  Disk activity and the spinning pinwheel go away about 30 seconds later, and the browser functions normally.
Actual Results:  
Browser hangs for 30 seconds every time it restarts.

Expected Results:  
Browser should not hang.
