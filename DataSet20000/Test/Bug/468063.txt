I deleted my passwords since I temporary need to share my windows account. After running the automatic upgrade to 3.x the passwords returned. Also previously deleted bookmarks came back



Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firefox version 2.x
2. Store passwords for i.e. webmail
3. Create bookmarks 
4. Delete bookmarks
5. Delete passwords through the clear private data method
6. Bookmarks and passwords are gone (I kept pressing do not now at the "remember password" box)
6. Automatic upgrade appears (would you like to upgrade to 3.x)

Actual Results:  
After the upgrade I went to webmail, and the password field was filled in automatically. I pressed login et voila, I was logged in
Then I noticed all my old bookmarks had returned as well

Expected Results:  
Bookmarks still gone, passwords still gone
It should have deleted the passwords fully and not retrievable. The bookmarks reappearing I don't mind (although that is a privacy issue as well). But the password apparently wasn't gone completely. The fact due to an upgrade bug it returned means that the delete private data option doesn't delete the information 100%

This is on a Windows XP pc in a corperate environment with limited roaming profiles. I didn't however change pc in weeks.

I consider this sever since if you run upgrade on a shared pc, old information comes back that may expose peoples email, and other habits. This is especially a problem if the PC becomes shared later and the person feels save since (s)he deleted the private data
