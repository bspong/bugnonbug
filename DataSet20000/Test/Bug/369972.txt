javascript:self.print() incorrectly prints on 1 of 1 pages instead of 5 of 5

This FEMA website has popups for instructional purposes.

example: http://emilms.fema.gov/ICS100G/index.htm

There is a "Print" button for printing the content of pages within these instructional popups.  These, generally work.  

Some of the instruction pages have calls for additional popups windows, which also contain "Print" buttons.  

Example: Javascript:showDefLong(def05025)
This particular example is within the Lesson 5 [summary] of this instructional module.  As is a lengthy piece; should be multiple pages if printed.

When using the print button on this page
Javascript:Self.Print()

The print dialog box comes up and reports -only- 1 of 1 pages, rather than the correct total.

This behavior occurs in various places within the instructional modules, but not everywhere with respect to "Print" buttons.  I will attach the code.

In the example above, which will print only the first page OF THE EXPECTED content, I saved the content to a file [this is attached].  If I then OPEN the html file from my desktop into a new FoxTab, I get a version of the PARENT popup, without the CSS formatting.  I saved this content; its content is NOT the same [see SECOND attachment - ....WEIRD.htm]

Not sure if this is Javascript fault, CSS fault, or Firefox/Script fault or Firefox/Print fault.
