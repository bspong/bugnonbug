FF nightly Aurora jittery and causing other apps to be slow
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:14.0) Gecko/20120519 Firefox/14.0a2
Build ID: 20120519042007

Steps to reproduce:

just FYI
This mornings update only. Aurora (nightly) Firefox on Linux running KDE


Actual results:

after this mornings update, the two (2) systems i updated are Very jittery, menus are very slow and is causing other apps on other desktops menus to be slow and jerky. Even typing is jumpy and lags. 
Again only on the two systems updated this morning. Systems updated upto yesterday are ok
All Systems are openSuSE running KDE. the two that were updated today are openSuSE 11.2 and 12.1 / KDE 4.3.5 and 4.7 respectively. - i have openSuSE 11.4 and 12.2 and ubuntu 12.04LTS gnome  but not updated, unless you need me to.


Expected results:

There should be no, or not much lag in menus and definitely should not interfere with other apps on separate desktops (only mention sep. desktops because it might be kwin, kdm specific... ) . 
CPU usage on the 12.1 is flux btwn 5 and 10% (ff) and the 11.2 is .. same.. Nothing big and memory is low, about 270k +/- on 11.2 / kde 4.3.5 (less than half of usual.. I've seen it over a gig in some releases.. : )..
