Firefox consistently crashes when viewing the following webpage:
http://www.ittime.com.cn/content.asp?id=4721

it is one of the IT weekly magzine site in China. I visisted from time to time.
A weeks ago, I started to realize that Firefox consistently crashes when loading this site (not just this page, but other pages on this site).
I was using Firefox 1.5 or 1.6. After the initial crash, I switched to 2.0.
but the crash persist.

The problem is with Firefox, you do not give out any indication of what went wrong, so I can not report back to the website owner, specific details of the problem.

Can someone look into it?

Ming

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to the url I posted.
2. wait for the web page to be loaded
3. in the middle of loading the page, you will see a crash of the browser.
Actual Results:  
the browse would crash, saying sorry for inconvenience, etc.

Expected Results:  
the webpage being displayed properly.

in general, this site http://www.ittime.com.cn/ would cause Firefox to crash.
you can visit different pages and wait a few second for the crash to occur.

BTW, after the crash, when I restart firefox, if I goes into a different tab, you may avoid the crash. but as soon as you visit the tab with the trouble-some url, the crash will consistently occur.
