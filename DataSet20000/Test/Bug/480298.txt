Incorrect accented character typing for first accented character in a page

When typing an accented character with a deadkey, e.g., "´" + "e" to produce "é", the first time that any such combination is pressed in a page, it will render both characters separately, instead of rendering the composite character, e.g., "´" + "e" becomes "´e" instead of "é". For any subsequent typing in the same page, this works correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a page with text fields, e.g. www.google.com. If you are already there, refresh the page.
2. Type any deadkey + character combination to get an accented character, e.g., "´" + "e"
Actual Results:  
Two separate characters (an accent and a regular character) are produced on the text field. In the example above, "´e".

Expected Results:  
An single, accented character should have appeared on the text field; in the example above, "é".

Subsequent typing on the same page works correctly. After refreshing or changing page, the same problem occurs for the first character.

Did not happen in any 3.0 release I've tried, but does happen in 3.1b2 OSX.
