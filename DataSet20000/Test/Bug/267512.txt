Child window with positioned iFrames not repainted properly (Linux only?)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041026 Firefox/1.0RC1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041026 Firefox/1.0RC1

I implment and maintain a browser-based application for managing virtual
machines. The attached screenshots show a window from that application open in
Linux Mozilla 1.7, Linux Firefox 0.9.3 (Debian testing/unstable), Linux Firefox
1.0 RC1, Linux Firefox 0.10.1, Windows Firefox 1.0 RC1 and Windows Firefox
0.10.1. Note that in all browsers except Linux Firefox 1.0 RC1, the window is
painted as expected with a row of tabs at the top and the details for the
selected virtual machine below.

In the case of Linux Firefox 1.0 RC1, however, most of the window is not
repainted at all; instead "ghosts" of other windows positioned on top of the
browser window appear. A small square at the top left of the browser window and
a narrow vertical band on the right are the only areas painted properly.

Although I have not ruled out the possibility of a bug in the application rather
than the browser, the evidence suggests that the problem appeared in the browser
sometime after 0.10.1 for Linux. Other versions of Mozilla and Firefox (and
Internet Explorer) do not exhibit this problem.

Because I do not have a good, isolated test case, I am hoping that whoever
accepts this bug will be able to examine the relevant changes after 0.10.1 to
discover the source of the problem.

Please let me know if there is any additional information that could help track
down the problem.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Using Linux Firefox 1.0 RC1:

1. Log in to the VMware Management Interface for a VMware ESX Server 2.x system.
2. Click a virtual machine name to open the virtual machine properties window.

Actual Results:  
The virtual machine properties browser window is not [re]painted properly.

Expected Results:  
The virtual machine properties browser window should have been [re]painted properly.
