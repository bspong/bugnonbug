Previous web page cannot load if cached pages deleted manually.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040714 Firefox/0.9.1+

Experienced at http://www.mdgx.com/ (example) and any other web site, while
using Windows 98 SE, Millennium Edition (ME), XP SP1 and XP SP2, with Firefox
cache settings at default parameters:
in Firefox 0.9.1 and 0.9.2 after deleting all cached pages manually, previous
page(s) cannot load, and browser enters endless loop.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firefox 0.9.1 or 0.9.2.
2. Load main page at http://www.mdgx.com/ (example) = same happens with any web
site.
3. Run Windows Explorer, File Manager, a DOS box or use a batch file.
4. Manually delete all cached pages from Firefox cache directory, except the
ones that are currently in use (which cannot be deleted, of course).
5. Push the Back button in Firefox = see Actual Results #1.
6. Close all browser instances and then restart Firefox = see Actual Results #2.
Actual Results:  
1. Previous web page(s) cannot load, and broswer enters endless loop trying to
reload stored page(s) from local cache, instead of loading remote page(s) from
web server.
2. If all browser instances closed and then restarted, browser displays "page
not found" message.

Expected Results:  
Load remote web pages from web server instead of trying to reload local pages
from cache.
Only fix I found:
after closing all open Firefox instances must delete all cached files one more
time manually, and only after that restart Firefox to properly load web pages again.
