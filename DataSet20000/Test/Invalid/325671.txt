im a no nonsense person,i like firefox,and,I HATE TABS :) PLEASE,PLEASE,PLEASE, if you never want to hear from me again,PLEASE!provide a way to uninstall entirely the tabs for firefox,they suck(all tabs,not just firefox) many people dont want and do not use them,me inluded,the least you could do is give people a way to get rid of this"browser nazi" that makes me loose track of the pages i do want and forces me to answer stupid questions about tab closure before continuing or closes them all,or forces you to go to the tab manager to decide how to handle each one on a case by case basis,know what works better?,NO TABS, NO TAB MANAGER and ta-da problem solved. so please one more preference wont hurt
otherwise i think im not the only person you will loose when another browser comes along with the stability and security of firefox,and no browser tabs. the method
i use now to disable new tab creation doesnt resolve the other MAJOR problem with tabs,the extra bar taking up more room in the browser taskbar(desktop)
for people like me(ive asked around)the best scenario would be a one line firefox only task bar with address bar,back button,file menu,thats it,fini!PLEASE  ANDTHANK YOU FOR AN OTHERWISE SUPERIOR PRODUCT ALL AROUND:)
