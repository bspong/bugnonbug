Use case:

1. Move mouse to click on address bar (e.g. to correct URL typo)
2. Move mouse down a few dozen pixels to get it out of the way.
3. Start typing.
4. AutoComplete pops up with suggestions list that is long enough to appear under the mouse cursor. Item under the mouse cursor is selected.
5. On each key press event, the address bar is selected as the url, but then on a keyUp event, the suggestion under the mouse cursor is re-selected.
6. When finished typing, hit enter. Instead of going to the URL that was typed (as intended), the suggestion under the mouse is used as the target for the tab.

Suggestion: When the AutoComplete suggestion box appears under the address bar, it should not select the item under the cursor until the cursor moves.

Reproducible: Always
