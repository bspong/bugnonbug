browser window started from chatzilla does not use firebird homepage
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030706 Mozilla Firebird/0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030706 Mozilla Firebird/0.6

If a browser window is opened with chatzilla (either the button or ctrl+1 or by
clicking a link in a chat) the window opens with 'mozilla.org' as the homepage.
the preferences for chatzilla do not seem connected with those for firebird. if
the chatzilla preferences are changed to reflect a different homepage, then the
browser starts up with that different homepage, but clicking the 'home' button
or useing 'alt+home' returns to the 'mozilla.org' page. also, no bookmarks work
in the new browser window. this only occurs with browser windows created by
chatzilla. if another browser is already opened useing 'mozillafirebird.exe'
everything works fine, and links clicked on in chatzilla appear in the active tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start firebird from 'mozillafirebird.exe'
2.start chatzilla
3.use chatzilla to open a browser window
4.navigate to different webpage
5.type 'alt+home'
6.click 'home' button
7.open bookmark menu and select bookmark

Actual Results:  
wrong default homepage opens. after navigating away, attempts to return to
correct (by firebird pref) homepage return wrong page. the bookmark menu opens,
but selecting a bookmark does nothing.

Expected Results:  
the homepage specified in the firebird preferences should be used as the
homepage, and the bookmarks should work.

an easy workaround is to just leave a browser open and minimize it while not in use.
after searching the buglist, i think the problem is related to bugs 205199 and
206752.
