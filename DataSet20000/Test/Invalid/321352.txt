NoScript causes the orkut login to fail
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

THE LOGIN BOX REFRESHES WHEN I TRY TO LOG IN using Firefox. Even if you use the correct password the Login screen will just refresh itself and your orkut homepage never shows up.

I found the culprit: The NoScript plugin for Firefox 1.5

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Foxfire 1.5
2. Install No Script Plugin
3. Try to login at orkut.com
Even if you use the correct password the Login screen will just refresh itself and your orkut homepage never shows up. 

Actual Results:  
Login box just shows up again

Expected Results:  
I expected to see my orkut home page, since my login ID and password were correct.

I tried setting up "Allow cookies" on Firefox options (it was the recommendation on orkut's help - for IE - ironically, they also recomended I switch to firefox!) but it was allowing them already. I tried erasing the cookies, closing Firefox and entering on Orkut again. No success.

I tried setting NoScript to allow Orkut, no success.

After much trial and error I found out the culprit was my Javascript "NoScxript" plugin for Firefox. When I set it up to "Allow Javascript for ALL internet sites" I was finaly able to login to orkut with no problems.
But my NoScript plugin is pretty much useless now :(
