At cdcovers you should be able to just click on cd of the title you are wanting
and then click download,goes to another page the cover should display after a
moment and then you save it to your hard drive to use later. Well this works
just like this in IE but has never worked for me with firefox even when I had
9.3 and now it still doesn't work even with the new one.  I have tried
everything I can think of to try, so I thought would try here, because really
would rather be using firefox over IE but can't go to it completly until get
this problem solved.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to above url and go to any title you want doesn't matter.
2.click on your title then on cd or front cover either one then click on download.
3.another page will come up and everything else will load and your cover should
be the last thing to show, but it will just stay blank using firefox. In IE you
would then save it to your hard drive.

Actual Results:  
same thing that always happens when using firefox, the image is not displayed
everything else on the page is except your cover that you are wanting.

Expected Results:  
Should have displayed your cd cover so you could save it to your hard drive.

there are no error messages that I have ever seen it just doesn't ever display
the image.
