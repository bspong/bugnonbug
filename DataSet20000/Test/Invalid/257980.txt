Update icon disappears after restart on 0.10 builds
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040903 Firefox/1.0 PR (NOT FINAL)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040903 Firefox/1.0 PR (NOT FINAL)

The update icon has been moved from its previous position on the status bar and
placed by default on the menu bar starting with the 2004-09-01 build (this was
the first of the 1.0PR/0.10 bulids). When the browser is restarted, this icon
vanishes.

By switching themes using the re-enabled dynamic theme-switcher, the icon
reappears. At this point, it can be relocated to the status bar, the bookmarks
bar, the menu bar and any toolbar. However, when the browser is closed and
reopened, the icon vanishes again . . . unless the dynamic theme switcher is used.

For a theme that shows the update icon in its new postion (until the browser is
restarted) look here: http://www.pshrink.com/phoenix/SphereGnome_0_9_6_9.jar

To re-enable dynamic theme switching, use this pref:

user_pref("extensions.dss.enabled", true);
