All open browser windows closed at once, when I closed a single, non-responsive browser window.

Dear Sir or Madame,
May this find you well. I have had the following crash occur several times;
(a) I may have 10 different brower screens open (e.g., e-Bay, US Treasury
Department, etc.)
(b) a screen becomes "non-responsive", i.e., something happens such that a
server "goes down", so I can't complete my transaction
(c) Using Alt-Control-Delete - to open "Task Manager" to see a list of all
programs/windows, -I select the non-responsive Firefox Window, and hit "End Task".
(d) When I close it, all other Firefox windows also close, even those that are
working perfectly.

This is hugely disruptive. I am not an engineer, so have no clue, as to why
closing one window via "Task Manager" shuts down all others, when closing a
browser with the bottom-of-screen list, does not shut down all others.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open up several browser windows, and connect to other sites, e.g., e-Bay, etc.
2.Hit Alt-Control-Delete to access Task Manager
3. Select a browser window
4. Hit "End Task" to close that window
5. All other open browser windows should instantly close.

Actual Results:  
My blood pressure went up into four digits, as I had to re-connect to about 15
different websites.

Expected Results:  
It should have shut-down the single, non-responsive window, and left the others
alone.

I had open: MS Word and Excel (Office 1997); Adobe Acrobat 5.0, WordPerfect 10,
and juno e-mail. This 4-year-old computer has 1 Gig of Ram, so there's plenty of
processing power. After the automatic shut-down of all browser windows, I can
immediately re-open new windows, without having to re-start the computer.
