CTRL+F brings up the search toolbar as normal but trying to type into a textarea every time i pressed the apostrophe key the search box came up at the bottom of the browser. i updated to 1.5 beta 2 and now this particular text area seems to work ok '''' but if i'm not in a text box or textarea it still does it. find-as-you-type is turned off in preferences

Reproducible: Always
