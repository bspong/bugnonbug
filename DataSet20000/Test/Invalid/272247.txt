Crash When an Iframe relocates its parent page when page has a javascript alert up

I have an iframe that does some work, and returns a y/n value to a function on 
the calling page.  This function then relocates the page to somewhere else.  
the catch is, the function that starts this process also brings up an alert 
like this

function GoDoWork()
{
obj = document.getElementById("IframeToDoWork");
obj.src="workdoer.htm";
alert('its working on it');
}

the iframe does its work then it calls:

parent.iframeWorkSuccess()
 which looks liek this

function iframeWorkSuccess(){
document.location.href = 'elsewhere.htm'
}


which relocates our page to a new url (i.e. a success message)

The alert box has no time to close, since the processing is so fast.  So the 
page relocates and the alertbox is hanging there waiting to be "ok"d.  once 
the alertbox is "ok"d.  Firefox goes down in a ball of flames.  And the 
reporting agent doesnt work btw...



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a page with an iframe on it, id it, and put the above functions on 
the page
2.on page2, make a js call to parent.iframeWorkDone();
3.Click a link on page 1 that will fire your GoDoWork function and watch the 
carnage

Actual Results:  
alert box stays on top of the relocated page.  and when it is closed, the 
browser dies.

Expected Results:  
When the browser is relocated, it should either destroy the alert boxes, or 
wait for them to be cleared until relocating.
