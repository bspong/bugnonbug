Browser won't display although system says it is running
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; en) Opera 8.51
Build Identifier: Firefox/1.5

Tried to open Firefox numerous times.  Get the "hourglass" for a moment, then nothing.  When I check the system says "firefox.exe" is running but screen shows desktop only.  This occurred right after I cleared the temp files.  I restored all of the temp files, but still will not appear.  I re-installed without success.  I un-installed through the Windows add/remove programs and re-installed.  Still will not open, but it still shows running.  IE Explorer and Opera both open normally.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click on Firefox on desktop or in quick launch.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Browser window does not open

Expected Results:  
Browser window opens.

I opened in safe mode and it opened OK.  Everything looked OK in safe mode, but the browser window will not open in regular mode.
