Page with flash elements becomes blank when switching between tabs or opening new window [caused by RealPlayer Browser Record Plugin]

In the last two weeks I found out that a lot of pages containing flash elements get the content disappear when I switch tabs and then switch back, or when opening a new firefox window. 
This sometimes happens in youtube but not always, what makes me think it may be a problem caused by adds on the pages.

The problem only resolves when reloading the tab. But the problem is only visual, because if in the page was some kind of sound or music played, it's still played when switching back to it, but nothing can be seen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a web page with flash elements (maybe only happens with adds)
2. Open a new tab or window
3. Switch back to the first tab/window
Actual Results:  
All the content in the page is disappeared, although sound can still be heard if there was any.

Expected Results:  
The page should still be visible.

It doesn't happen in youtube, nor with a web I made including a flash element I created.
