FF upgrade to recent RC has erased everything: extensions, settings, bookmarks - all gone!

After upgrading to the newest RC (from the previous one) the first restart went fine. Everything worked. Now this morning there was a power outage for half an hour in the the whole area, so my computer shut off and booted again after power came back.

Then at starting Firefox again it complained that there were "problems with some" of my plugins. But _everything_ was gone. Attempts to restore the stuff with the previous RC tarball completely failed.

That's what I call an "security and stability upgrade"!
