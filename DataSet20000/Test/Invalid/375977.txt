Incorrect amount of memory usage shown in process displayers (which show the memory usage).

I have read (maybe on an official mozilla faq, the one about memory leaks I think) that the memory displayed in programs such as task manager do not show the true amount of memory being used by firefox. If this is the case it's important that it at least be clarified by the firefox program.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox and open a bunch of sites.

2. Open task manager and look at the increasing amount of memory firefox is supposedly using up.

Actual Results:  
Firefox appears in programs like task manager to be using an increasing amount of memory when supposedly it isn't but is instead being reported incorrectly by the Windows OS.

Expected Results:  
To see the correct amount of memory ussage, at least on the firefox gui.

There should be an extension or integrated program built into firefox which shows the true amount of memory it is using for stability purposes at least (no one wants to freeze their computer except for test reasons.) I recommend using the status bar on the bottom, in between where the url and the firefox icon is shown on the bottom left. I also recommend reserving the length for 7 or 8 digit spaces by default so it isn't lengthening and shortening in a distracting manner to accommodate the number length shown.
