Firefox 3 never shows the image for NewEgg.com promotion emails, whether opened in Gmail or whether viewed on the newegg.com site.  These are plain JPG images so I don't think it's the same problem as I reported in bug 416243, where images are not shown if there is transparency in the image.  I will attach a screenshot so you can see what it looks like in a recent FF3 build.  I will also attach the full webpage, saved and zipped up.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Unzip the attachment and open the html page in FF3.
