fake firefox upgrade needed!

You're really being attacked hard, but probably know by now!

I was looking at a picture, up comes a full screen notice, that looked like from firefox, that I need to upgrade immediately, to prevent further problems etc...
loaded it, 
The first time, I was sucked in, looked so real, downloaded, and ran it, and I'm now reformating the disk on that computer, before reloading Windows (2000).
http://ftp.jaist.ac.jp was one site that did this, probably many more.

email me if you want more info. You're really being attacked with this.
DAMN HACKERS!!!!
