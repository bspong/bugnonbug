Address bar shows all subjects of the email that I composed even after I log out from my email (yahoo). This is against my privacy and expose my email to other users of the same PC to know what are the subjects I read in my email and replyed to.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open yahoo mail
2.select any message for example the subject is "Our holiday this summer"
3.try to forward or reply to that message.
4.Log out from email
5.Go to address bar and type "our" for example, you will be surprised that the full subject appear among the history in there..!!
Actual Results:  
You will get the problem

Expected Results:  
it should only show the websites history that I have visited not my emails subjects. 

Nul thanx
