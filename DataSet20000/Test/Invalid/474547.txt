User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008121623 Ubuntu/8.10 (intrepid) Firefox/3.0.5

When a web site returns a page marked with MIME type text/x-server-parsed-html, the web page is NOT displayed in the browser window. Instead, the Download Manager pops up and prompts for a program to open the document with; if Firefox is specified as the correct application, all relative links on the page are broken (since they're relative to wherever the file happens to get saved to).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on a link that points to an shtml page.
Actual Results:  
Download Manager pops up prompting for a helper application.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have displayed the page.
