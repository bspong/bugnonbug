crash with old version of google gears [@ gears.dll@0xf00fb]
looks like google gears is consistently crashing on firefox 3 beta 4.

It's only ranked #75, but if more people start using gears it could ramp fast.

incompatability problems with fx3?

not much to go on in any of the stack traces

could be a case of users overriding compat checks as in bug 422018
