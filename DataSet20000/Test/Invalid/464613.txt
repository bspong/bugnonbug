When upgrading to 2.0.0.18, bookmarks disappeared and browser settings reset.

I got the prompt to update Firefox to 2.0.0.18.  Once I did, my bookmarks disappeared and browser settings reset.  The only thing that's remaining is a folder named "Bookmarks Toolbar Folder" with nothing inside it.  I never had a folder named that before the upgrade.
