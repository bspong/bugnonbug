Open link in new tab / middle-click link doesn't work in Alpha 2
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050706 Firefox/1.0+

In any website middle-click was not working. I tried right-clicking and
selecting open link in new tab but that did not work either. My next attempt was
to drag the link into the tab bar - the four or so versions of Alpha 2 prior to
the one with the URL specified crashed when this was done, however this version
allows the dragging of the link into the tab bar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load website - most common choice: qgl.ausforums.com
2. Try to middle-click link or right-click link and select "open link in new tab"
3. Drag link into tab bar

Actual Results:  
After step 2) nothing happened, no new tabs were open
After step 3) in earlier Alpha 2 versions the browser crahed, but this version
allows the new tab to be created and loaded.

Expected Results:  
Middle-click and "open link in new tab" should open the linked webpage in a new
tab in the tab bar. for the previous versions, the browser should not have crashed.
