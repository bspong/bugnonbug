FF instantly exits (no crash) when clicking on a newly opened tab

Firefox exits (does NOT crash- no errors, nothing in the app event log... it
just closes) upon clicking on a background tab to bring it to the foreground.

However, I noted that FF does NOT exit like this if I right-click on the link
and select either "Open link in new tab" or "Open link in new window".  Also
worth noting is that, if after a browser restart I perform either of these last
two operations, and -THEN- drag the link and then click on the resulting tab, FF
does NOT exit.  The only time it exits like this is if the only operation I
performed is what I described at the top.

This also happens on MANY other sites... this is the only time I was able to
reproduce it each and every time.  And it has caused the loss of data, in that I
was filling out foms when FF would crash, as well as research time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/11/181236&from=rss. 
Find post titled "Looking up on the SOHO gallery".
2. Drag the link to open it in a new tab (link text is "January 20th"); it links
to
http://soho.nascom.nasa.gov/data/summary/gif/050220/seit_00195_fd_20050220_2200.gif.
 The tab will open behind the active page.
3. Click on the tab (doesn't matter if the page has loaded yet or not)
4. Once the page loads, Firefox just exits as if I had told it to.  NO CRASH. 
Alternatively, wait for the page to fuly load and -THEN- click the tab.  A
split-second after the tab appears, FF exits.
Actual Results:  
FF exits.  NO CRASH.

Expected Results:  
Not exit.
