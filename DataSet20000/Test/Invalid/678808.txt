FF Add-ons manager freezes when opened
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:5.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0.1
Build ID: 20110707182747

Steps to reproduce:

The problem started all of a sudden, but I noticed that FF crashed many times while viewing various sites before the problem happened.


Actual results:

When I open the addons manager it starts loading and then after starting to download from static-cdn.addons.mozilla.com FF freezes and then I have to close the program forcefully, even if I open the installed extentions tab, it freezes.
I noticed the problem after the icon of Adblock Plus(ABP) in the toolbar was suddenly replaced by a button containing two rows of FF default icons (home, favourites, reload,.. etc.)
I disabled ABP in safe-mode but the problem persisted also after the last-installed add-on disabling. (the add-on manager works in safe-mode the way it should work)
