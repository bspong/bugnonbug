hello, i am a Computer User Non Technical, so I apologise if this is a stupid
problem we could fix ourselves, but we have tried a couple of things and they
didn't work.
 Would someone kindly take a look at www.aspectworld.com in Internet Explorer
and then in Mozilla and see why Mozilla does not render the correct font
(Trebuchet) nor any of the secondary defaults (verdana and sans serif family).
Mozilla displays all the text in (I think) Times New Roman, and we really don't
like the way it looks. We have tried using different HTML versions for the
source but don't know what else to try.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. view www.aspectworld.com in Mozilla, 
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
page displays with a serif font which is not correct.

Expected Results:  
Page should show up with Trebuchet font or if unavailable Verdana and if that
unavailable, any Sans Serif family font. Works well in IE.
