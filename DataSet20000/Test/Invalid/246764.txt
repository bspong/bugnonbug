Duplicate firefox shortcuts created on desktop, if one already exists
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.9

Upon installation of firefox onto Windows XP, if there already exists a shortcut
with the name "Mozilla Firefox" on the desktop, it seems that multiple copies of
the old shortcut are created.

Obviously this only occurs if the installer is told to create a new desktop
shrotcut.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a shortcut on the desktop called: Mozilla Firefox
2.Install firefox by running FirefoxSetup-0.9.exe
3.Tell it to create a desktop shortcut during the installation

Actual Results:  
Multiple copies of the old shortcut are created

Expected Results:  
Not have created copies of the old shortcut

I saw some weird behavior when deleting the shortcuts, copying another shortcut
from the taskbar to the desktop called "Mozilla Firefox" caused the multiple
copies to be deleted.
