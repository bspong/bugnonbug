PDF Full Window in Firefox, Save Page As Says "Adobe Acrobat 7 Document"
When PDF is full window in Firefox (2.X and 3.X) and you select the Firefox File Menu and Then Select "Save Page As", the dialog says "Adobe Acrobat 7 Document".  

This string is not supplied by the Adobe Firefox plug-in.  I request that the string be changed to just "Adobe Acrobat Document". 

This is an extremely minor request.  Adobe Quality Engineers, however, keep insisting that it be fixed in Adobe code :-).
