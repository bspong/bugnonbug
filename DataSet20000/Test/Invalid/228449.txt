External ICQ client will crash when Firebird or Thunderbird stay open
External ICQ Clients like Trillian or Miranda crashing when Firebird or
Thunderbird stay open. 

Following behaviors I tested:

Trillian: It only crashes during startup. Opening FB/TB after startup doesn't
run in a crash. Also reconnects aren't affected.

Miranda: Crashes occur in every state not only on startup. 

This behavior only appears for the *birds not for seamonkey.
