Imported bookmarks from IE6  are not sorted and the manerger does do a sort 
but on exit still show unsorted book marks, this does not help in using this 
software.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Import bookmarks for IE6
2.Noticed that they are not sorted.

3.Tried the bookmark manager, it shows them sorted, ie by name.

Actual Results:  
On exit  from the bookmark manager bookmarks are still not sorted.

Expected Results:  
Sort the bookmarks in what I have selected in the bookmark manager.



Tried this on 2 seperate PC's, this does not help user to migrate to Firefox, 
a very annoying bug.
