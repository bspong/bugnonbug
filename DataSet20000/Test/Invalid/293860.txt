Javascript code in <![CDATA[  ]]> won't run
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.3

I tried to validate a page I coded using the W3C's validator, and it flagged as
an error the appearance of "<" in the inline script. (I normally avoid inline
scripts, but this one was necessary; writing e-mail addresses chunk by chunk on
the client side protects the e-mail address from e-mail harvesters used by
spammers.) I then found out that code with such characters needs to be marked
off as CDATA, so I put <![CDATA[ before the code, and ]]> after the code, and it
validated, but now the script won't run in Firefox, and the Javascript console
says it has a syntax error which I can't find.

The script in question is the following:

<!-- The following script is a defense against web-crawling e-mail harvesters
--><script type="text/javascript"> <![CDATA[ document.write('<a class="contact"
');document.write(nam+dom);document.write('">');document.write('info@');document.write('somedomain.com');document.write('</a>');
]]> </script>

(the variables nam and dom are defined in the script area in the head element)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Write an inline script that uses document.write to insert a mailto:
2.surround the contents of the script with CDATA identifiers: <![CDATA[ and ]]> 
3.run the page: notice that the specified element doesn't show up.

Actual Results:  
The place where the element was supposed to be inserted by the inline script
shows up blank.

Expected Results:  
the inline script should have executed as it did when there were no CDATA
identifiers wrapping the script; in my case, a mailto: should have been
inserted. The CDATA identifiers were necessary because the script contained <
and other forbidden characters that prevented it from validating as xhtml 1.0.

the javascript console identifies the code as having a syntax error when I
reloaded the page after I wrapped the script with the CDATA tag.
