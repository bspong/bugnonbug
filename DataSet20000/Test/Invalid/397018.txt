hi

I use Unison to keep my home directories on different PCs in sync. Unfortunately it is difficult to keep my bookmarks files in sync: each time I use firefox, the bookmarks.html file changes, since the LAST_VISIT tag changes. 

Please add a config option so that the LAST_VISIT tag is not present in the file (it may be stored in a different file).

a.

Reproducible: Always
