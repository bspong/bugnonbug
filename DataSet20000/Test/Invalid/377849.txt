Two popups resulted for one required
User-Agent:       Opera/9.20 (Windows NT 5.1; U; en)
Build Identifier: Firefox 2.0.0.3

Operating a DB which uses a popup. Two appeared instead of the one required. Every minor operation on the main window popped up two more. Opera and IE ok. 
Haven't tried Firefox on this application for a few weeks. Have upgraded to 2.0.0.3 since it last worked correctly.
