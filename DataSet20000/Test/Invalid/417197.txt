Back button doesn't work if Firefox is started via a URL shortcut

When Firefox is started via a Windows shortcut pointing to a URL (e.g., http://www.mozilla.org), the Back button doesn't work when navigating through the site (it stays gray; hitting Backspace or Alt+Left doesn't work either). After entering a new URL, it works again. It also works in new tabs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close all Firefox windows.
2. Create a Windows shortcurt pointing to a URL.
3. Double-click the shortcut -- Firefox starts and opens the URL.
5. Click a link on the page.
Actual Results:  
Firefox loads the new page, but the Back button doesn't work.
