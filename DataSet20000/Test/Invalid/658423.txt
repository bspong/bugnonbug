Add "restore default permissions" button to site permissions interface
This was present in earlier versions of the patch in bug 573176, but it was removed for simplicity's sake. We'd want to address comments in that bug if we re-introduce the button.

From bug 573176 comment 50:

>+  restoreDefaultPermissions: function(aSite) {

Seems like this method is a better fit on the Site prototype, conceptually.

>+  restoreAllDefaultPermissions: function() {
>+  forgetSite: function() {

I wonder whether these should prompt, or something. Seems like bad buttons to hit accidentally (maybe less so for the latter).
