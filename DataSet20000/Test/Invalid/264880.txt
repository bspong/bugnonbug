In Firefox, after you have logged in, this page only shows the right-most column
of the table, while in IE, it shows all.  Likewise, someitmes I cannot log in to
my account because it says you have been logged out, and if I click log in again
and try again, it still says you have been logged out. This happens even if I
haven't been previously logged in on that browser. After about 5 tries, it
finally logged in, but like I said, doesn't show all the columns.
