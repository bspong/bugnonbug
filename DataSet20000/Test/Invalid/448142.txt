When I specify the font css property as

font: normal 100px inherit; 

Then the font property is totally ignored, not the normal or the font size is adheared to either. If I set the font family to an actual font then it acts as you would expect and the whole rule is obeyed.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Specify a font-family on the body say Verdana
2.On a child element, specify its font css property as, font: bold 100px inherit;
3.Expect that the child element will be bold, 100px in size, and have the font Verdana.

Actual Results:  
The font rule is ignored, it has the font family from its parent, but it does not apply any other rules of the font css declaration. 

Expected Results:  
All the other properties of the font declaration to be obeyed and the font family from its parent to be applied.

Works as described in the expected results in IE.
I went into firebug after I applied the font declaration with an inherit font family and none of the styles appear there as applied. Its as if it just ignores the font declaration in this case.
