Roaming does not build into Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8a2) Gecko/20040606 Firefox/0.8.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8a2) Gecko/20040606 Firefox/0.8.0+

When building Firefox, even with sroaming extension enabled, only sroaming.jar
is built, not sroaming.dll, and Firefox does not hook into sroaming.dll even if
it exists.

This results in no roaming in Firefox, even though the original bug seemed to
indicate it should work in Firefox.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Build Firefox with sroaming.
2. Configure the Roaming extension.
3. Close and open Firefox.

Actual Results:  
Firefox starts normally, no roaming dialog.

Expected Results:  
Shown the roaming dialog as it updated files.

If it matters, the same happens with both Branch and Trunk.
