[INSTALLER] Installer for non-windows operating systems needed
Now that bug 214263 (windows installer) is fixed, we still installers for other
operating systems like for example Linux, OS/2 or possibly Solaris. 

I'm filing this bug, because the bug covering this (bug 182409) has been morphed
to cover this issue and is essentially useless, because it only starts at
comment 25 to talk about this issue.
