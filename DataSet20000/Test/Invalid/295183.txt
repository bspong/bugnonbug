In yahoo music I cant create a station. After entering all details for create
station, the button create station does not work. The browser does not hang
though. It may be a java error. Or it could be that once the radio station is
created the output comes in another smaller window which is getting blocked ( as
pop up) but I think this is unlikely.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just go to yahoo.com->music->customise my station
2.Enter the details
3.Press create my station

Actual Results:  
Nothing!!!! That is the problem. 

Expected Results:  
It should have said station created and then allowed me to listen to it.
