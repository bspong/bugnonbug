I cannot install any extensions because of incompatibility issue. I would like that to be fixed please..

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Went to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search?q=Linky&cat=all
2.Selected an extension.
3.The install link is grayed out
Actual Results:  
The link is unclickable because it's grayed out.

Expected Results:  
I was hoping that all extensions can work with Firefox 3.1 Beta 1.

To fix this bug. Linky is one of my favorite extensions because it lets me know how many links are on the web page along with number of images on it also.
