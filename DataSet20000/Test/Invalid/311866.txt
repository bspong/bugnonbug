"About popup blocking" dialog appears when it shouldn't
Bug 250716's patch was completely wrong wrt to the "About Popup Blocking" dialog
it intended to replace with a browser notification bar. It made this dialog
appear when clicking on the "Don't show this message when popups are blocked"
option from the "Options" menu of the notification bar or the status bar icon
menu. It doesn't make sense to display a dialog to explain popup blocking to
someone who just selected the option to not display the notification for it.
This also made the privacy.popups.firstTime pref useless, since it is never
written to and this always true. The dialog is therefore always displayed when
selecting the "Don't show this message when popups are blocked" option.

This bug shipped with 1.0.
