This page holds and updates real-time scoring information for the LPGA (women's pro golf) tournaments. The only time it is active is during the tournaments, usually for a few hours on Thur, Fri, Sat, Sun. Firefox crashes within an hour or so of opening the page. I noticed that memory usage increases significantly and update performance decreases during the period before the crash. (Memory leak in the scripting?).  The page works well using Microsoft Internet Explorer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the page at http://www.lpgascoring.com/leaderboard.htm during an LPGA golf tournament.
2. Wait for the crash
3. 
Actual Results:  
Firefox quits with the Microsoft "Report this error" dialog box

Expected Results:  
Continue updating scores normally ( as is the case with the competition's browser)

Usually have other Firefox tabs and windows open to static pages. Sometimes one or two, sometimes more. Such as Yahoo home, broker log in page, xkcd and so on...
