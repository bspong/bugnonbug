Table background over riding cell background

If I set a background image on a table then set an idividual cell to have a 
different bgcolor of white so that the text is visible FireFox ignores the cell 
setting and my text is unfortunately practically invisible. All the other 
browsers I tested, Opera 7.x, IE 5.x-6, Netscape 4.8 and 7, on Windows and Opera 
6, IE 5, Safari 1.0 on Apple OS X 10.2.8 all worked correctly. FireFox faild on 
both operating systems.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set a table with a background image
2. Set a cell with a bgcolor of white
3. View in FireFox

Actual Results:  
Showed a table with the background image but the cell was not white.

Expected Results:  
The cell should have had a white background

This obviously is counter to the WWW3 standards for HTML hence I mark severity 
as Major
