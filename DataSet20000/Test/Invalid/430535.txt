When a htm-file is saved in unicode format and the corresponding css is in ansi format, the css doesn't get loaded. If both are in ansi it works and if both are in unicode it also works.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create htm which includes a css:
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
save the htm-file in unicode format.
2.Create a css file "style.css", save it in ansi format
3.Open the htm in firefox
Actual Results:  
No design elements appear, the css clearly doesn't get loaded.

Expected Results:  
The css file should load just like when its in unicode too.
