When I have an internet session along with Firefox, after a while of 5-7 minutes since the session started a fault pixel (say, white pixel on the black background) is shown up on the TFT-display. Different sessions with Firefox "produced" fault pixels on the different places on the display.

When I use a different Internet Browser (IE, Opera) there are no fault pixels on my screen. First I detected the problem along with Mozilla Firefox 2.x. There’s the same behaviour along with Firefox 3.0 Beta 2 and Beta 4.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox on the IBM Thinkpad T43 (SerialNumber: 1S266892GL3GXN26).

2. Wait a while (5-7 minutes).
Actual Results:  
A fault pixel is shown up on the screen.

Expected Results:  
Laptop's TFT-screen doesn't display any fault pixel.

1. Mozilla Firefox seems to be clashed with TouchPad-Driver of the IBM Thinkpad T43. The info about clash between Firefox and TouchPad-Driver of the IBM Thinkpad T43 came from IBM Service Center.

2. I can provide screenshots with fault pixels I did as the problem shown up.

3. Sorry, but Bugzilla-GUI doesn't provide an opportunity to attach a file like screenshot etc.
