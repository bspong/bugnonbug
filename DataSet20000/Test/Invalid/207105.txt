To get printing to work one has to have root access to install the Xprint stuff.
 This is a major regression from all previous netscape and mozilla versions that
did not require this.  This makes it very hard to evaluate new versions.

Reproducible: Always

1. Install phoenix
2. Try to print something.
3. Error message appears saying Xprint server not running.


Actual Results:  
Error message appears saying Xprint server not running.

Printed the page.
