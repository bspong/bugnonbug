When using group tabs, there is a scenario in which the "X" button simply disappears. It happens when two or more groups are in use.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a new session/window in Firefox
2.Open a new group, separated from the original open tab
3.Create 2 or more tabs in the new group

Actual Results:  
The inactive tab(s) appear with no "X" button over it, though there is enough space for it yet.

Expected Results:  
The good old close button should appear, because there is enough room to allocate 20 of them.

Just installed Firefox 4. Don't remember having difficulties with previous versions of Firefox. I have the "Faviconize Tab" Add-on installed, if it has to do anything with the matter, though I'm pretty convinced it doesn't.
