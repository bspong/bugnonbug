The headmenü on the page http://tempelsklasse.te.funpic.de/index.php?page=Portal don´t work in the new Firefox Version. In Version <3.0 all is ok. How it should work you can see here: http://s8.directupload.net/images/090717/jcqizd55.jpg
In the Internet Explorer 8 it works. But I hate the IE, so I would be happy, if you can repair this error.
