Firefox 1.5.0.1 shows up as Firefox 1.8 on McAfee Firewall not and is not reconized
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

whay does it show I updated to firefox 1.8 in MacAfee Firewal it is not reconized by them yet its new! Although 1.5 was reconized? but another confussing point is in my about Firefox info from the toolbar it shows this Firefox version 1.5.0.1 "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1"
I found this page that talks about 1.8 http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showbuilds.cgi?tree=Firefox
well it looks like there might be a problem with the way the new Firefox is being read by fiewall software maybe even web sites it comes up as I am using Firefox 1.8 check this link http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showbuilds.cgi?tree=Mozilla1.8
