when I tried to click "photo gallery" it said "flash plug-in needed".

When I went to Macromedia's website to install Flashplayer I still couldn't get it 
to work with Firefox.  This is the only thing I have detected so far.  This is 
the best web browser--it is so fast! Thanks for all your hard work on this.
