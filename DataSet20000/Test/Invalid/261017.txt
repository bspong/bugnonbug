New tab (Ctrl+T) dosen't give focus to location (address) bar

In the newest Firefox release, if I hit Ctrl+T or File > New Tab, the location
bar is not automatically given focus. Thus, when I make a new tab and start
typing, I get type ahead find instead of entering in a URL, and have to manually
focus the location bar.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox .10
2. Open a new tab
3. Start typing - it'll go to Type Ahead Find instead of the location bar

Actual Results:  
The location bar will not have focus.

Expected Results:  
The location bar should have been given focus.
