If you right-click on a link in Firefox 4 Beta 1 and click "Open in New Tab", a new tab will be opened. The address bar will have the url that the link was supposed to go to in it, but it doesn't browse to that page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a webpage with a link.
2. Right-click.
3. Click "Open in New Tab".
Actual Results:  
I tested it on the "Release Notes" link at the top of this page and a tab opened up. The link https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=upgrade-3.6.html was in the address bar, but it was a blank page that said "New Tab" in the tab bar.

Expected Results:  
I should have been brought to the page https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=upgrade-3.6.html instead of a New Tab.

The "Feedback" button was gone and I didn't know how to report this bug any other way, so I'm reporting it here.
