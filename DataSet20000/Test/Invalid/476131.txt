When browsing to certain websites, the graphics driver crashes. It does this every time at maps.google.com. Loading the same pages in another browser works fine.
Reproduced on 3 nearly identical systems.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox on a system with a SiS graphics driver
2. Browse to maps.google.com

Actual Results:  
The system stops and shows a blue screen with exception information:
SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION
In driver: SiSGRV.dll

Expected Results:  
A running system with Google Maps on the screen.

Info I got from dxdiag:

Manufacturer: SiS 
Chip type: SiS 760
Main driver: SiSGRV.dll
DirectX 9.0c

Using Windows XP Professional x64 (5.2 build 3790)
with a 32 bit Firefox

Updating the driver did not fix this problem.
