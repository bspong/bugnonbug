Firefox uses _lots_ of cpu time when loading pages
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20070213 Firefox/2.0.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20070213 Firefox/2.0.0.1

When opening a page (either following a link or creating a new tab) Firefox uses _lots_ of cpu time resulting in slow interactive response and/or interfering with other running applications.

I can see this on Linux and OS X, and hear complaints from people running Windows as well. 

The problem is that Firefox can use so much resources that 
 - it appears slow (on athlon XP 1800+)
 - it may interfer with applications that try to do things like video grabbing unless its priority is lowered
 - it is even slower if the priority is lowered

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. run Firefox
2. (optional) open several tabs
3. load a page
Actual Results:  
firefox temporarily (but for a noticeable time) uses lots of cpu time

Expected Results:  
much less cpu intensive operation, at least comparable to certain unnamed browsers
