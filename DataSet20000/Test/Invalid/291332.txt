The "quick search" box at the top right corner of pretty much every page on the
eBay site no longer offers auto-complete in Mozilla Firefox 1.0.3.
When you click on the search box and type something in, it works like a normal
text box, no matter what you had typed in previously. It doesn't check if you're
retyping an earlier search and offer to auto-complete it.
It used to offer auto-complete in Mozilla Firefox 1.0.2, and Microsoft Internet
Explorer also offers auto-complete.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to eBay.
2. Type something in the "quick search" box.
3. Click Search or press return.
4. Go to eBay again.
5. Start to type the same thing you typed in step 2 again in the "quick search" box.


Actual Results:  
The "quick search" box worked like a normal text box, with no auto-complete.

Expected Results:  
It should have offered the thing previously typed, and clicking on it should
have automatically filled it in.
