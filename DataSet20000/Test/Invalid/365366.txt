Firefox crashes when IE opened
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; pl; rv:1.8.0.9) Gecko/20061206 Firefox/1.5.0.9
Build Identifier: 1.5.0.9 and 2.0.0.1

I had installed Firefox 1.5.0.9. It was ok for dozen of months. Yesterday, I opened IE 6 and Firefox closed automatically. When I clicked shortcut to open it again I got error thet file js3250.dll is missing and reinstall may help to solve it. So I download version 2.0.0.1, installed it and problem didn't disappeared. It turned out that IE on startup deletes 4 files from Mozilla directory: js3250.dll softokn3.dll xpcom.dll nss3.dll. So, I changed these files permissions to read-only and now when I open IE, Firefox's closing automatically, but I don't have to reinstall it to get work. But problem remains. I can't use IE when I'm using Firefox. Please Help.
