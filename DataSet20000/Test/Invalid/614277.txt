The new target display in Firefox 4 really is quite a good thing, and I like it in principle. But my rather unusual white-on-grey color scheme seems to confound it.

The default (and only available) color for the target display is a dark grey. One that is similar to the dark grey I use for text box backgrounds. So similar in fact that it's completely impossible to see with the naked eye, and I effectively end up without any target display.

I've no idea how this should be fixed (all I can think of is an about:config setting to change the target display text color), but it is still a pretty nasty problem.

Also, to be clear, this is with the default theme. I've changed nothing about the colors Firefox uses by default. I also assume this can be made to happen on all platforms, so I have not marked this as Linux-specific.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set operating system to light text on dark background color scheme.
2. Hover over any link in Firefox.
Actual Results:  
Target display cannot be seen easily (if at all).

Expected Results:  
Uncertain, though anything's better than what I'm seeing now.
