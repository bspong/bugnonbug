launching browser window:no XBL binding for browser."
When I hit OK the window goes away and the browser does not launch.

Reproducible: Always

1.Double-click Firefox icon on desktop
2.Click on Firefox icon in toolbar
3.

Actual Results:  
Nothing - launch aborts

Expected Results:  
Launch browser

Tried uninstalling and reinstalling from new download. Downloaded and 
installed the most recent build of Mozilla to make sure it wasn't a Mozilla 
problem. Mozilla loaded without a problem.

Looked up problem in Bug reports but it was addressed several builds ago not 
with the most recent Firefox. If I made a wrong decision, I apologize.
