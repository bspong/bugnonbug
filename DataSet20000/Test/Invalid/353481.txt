When downloading an email attachment from a Gmail mailbox is still possible to download the file once logged out from mail account.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to your Gmail account
2. Download an attachment from any email and once downloaded rename it
3. Logout from your Gmail account
4. Open "Donwloads" tool and copy the URL of your downloaded file using "Properties".
5. Paste the URL in a new tab of your browser and get your file again !

Actual Results:  
I got my attachment file saved on my default location, even if I logged out from my Gmail account.

Expected Results:  
It would be advisable to get a new Gmail login window when trying to get that URL, since my session was expired.

I tried the same procedure usign Firefox (1.5.0.7) on Windows XP and Linux Fedora Core 5 with the same results. MS IE6 is not affected from this bug, since when trying to get an attachment from an expired Gmail session, it replies with a Login window. I think that's an uncorrect cookie management between Gmail and Firefox, but I'm not so skilled to say. Anyway, I found this bug really annoying because of possible privacy violations in an environment where a single PC is shared between many people.
