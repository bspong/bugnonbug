context: Firefox is my default browser but as a web developer I need to test sites in IE6.  Firefox seems to have mucked up IE6 so that if I just enter a URL, I get the URL displayed in Firefox.  If I search for a local file with IE6, find it and ask IE to load it, I get the file in Firefox.  At present, the only way of testing a page in IE6 is to load it to the web and make a link to it from another site.  The reason I am reporting it here is that this has happened since the last upgrade of Firefox.  IE6 has been static on my setup for a long time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load IE6, enter a valid URL, I will get that URL in Firefox
2. Search for a local file with IE6, ask IE6 to load it and get the file in Firefox
3.
Actual Results:  
URL or local file displayed in Firefox.  This matter because my reason for loading IE6 is to test sites in IE6 which is very necessary for pure CSS sites.

Expected Results:  
To see the URL or local site in IE6.
