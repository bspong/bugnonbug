If I want to save a page as a pdf it's fine the first time displaying whatever the page or post is using as it's 'title.'  Subsequent pages maintain the original 'name' and you can't paste new text in.  If you delete it you can type the new text you want.   Quiting and relaunching the browser fixes the problem but only the first time.  Thanks for your help.
