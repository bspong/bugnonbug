If you hover over a bookmark in the bookmarks toolbar, you get a yellow tooltip describing the bookmark.  This is good.  Now press whatever key you have assigned to the show desktop command in expose (this is the one that slides all of your windows out of the way so you can see the desktop.)  Notice that the Firefox window slides one way, and the tooltip slides in a different direction!  (It appears that the tooltip is a distinct window.)  The tooltip actually remains visible because it is small enough that it can't move completely off the screen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Hover over bookmark on bookmarks toolbar
2.  Wait until tooltip shows up
3.  Press show desktop expose key
4.  watch tooltip fly off in the wrong direction
Actual Results:  
On my machine, the tooltip flies towards the menu bar, while firefox moves off the right side.  The tooltip winds up on top of the menu bar.

Expected Results:  
Tooltip moves with the browser window
