Firefox starts, stops and hangs every 10-20 seconds.  This is a recent development. Files now time out and can't refresh.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Reloaded Firefox
2. Went back online
3. Clicked menu

Actual Results:  
Still starts, stops and hangs every 10-20 seconds causing downloaded information to time out.

Expected Results:  
I still have the problem.

What it normally does, completely download files and/or information without starting, stopping and hanging every 10-20 seconds.
