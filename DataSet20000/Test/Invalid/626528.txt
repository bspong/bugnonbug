XULRunner Error Platform version '2.0b9' is not compatible - from Portable Beta 9

I installed and setup FF4 Beta 9 Portable at my office PC.: Win7 64 Professional
Synced it to the cloud.
After coming home and syncing here: Win7 32 Home Premium
FF4 beta won't run. All I get is a popupwindow:

XULRunner

Error: Platform version '2.0b9' is not compatible with
minVersion >= 2.0b7
maxVersion <= 2.0b7

not even firefox.exe -safe-mode worked.
( bummer. I'm doing this for years with previous versions of Firefox :/ )

Reproducible: Always




Seems no crash report is written. Or does XULRunner put it somewhere else?
I'd love to give more about this. But yet I don't know how.
