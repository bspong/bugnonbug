Firefox ignores Application Action settings for pdf readers
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:6.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0
Build ID: 20110811165603

Steps to reproduce:

I have both the latest Adobe Acrobat plugin and the latest Foxit Reader plugin installed in Forefox 6. I set Tools > Options > Applications > "Content Type" Adobe Acrobat Document "Action" Use Adobe Acrobat in Firefox.


Actual results:

I opened a pdf in Firefox and it opened it in the browser with Foxit Reader.


Expected results:

It should have opened in the browser with Adobe Reader. It ignored the Application Setting described.
