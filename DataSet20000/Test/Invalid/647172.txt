Firefox randomly freezes the whole system while playing flash videos

Just as the summary says, Firefox will just randomly make the whole system freeze. A quick glance at the task manager shows that firefox.exe skyrockets to 100% CPU usage then you can't do anything unless you hit the reset button. I tried disabling both plugin-container (before this was the process that was eating all the cpu) and hadware acceleration but I had no success. It's certainly not a problem with my drivers or hardware and this wasn't happening in 3.6.x or prior to that. This also happens with no extensions. Flash it's up to date. 
Please fix this, it is super annoying, and it isn't happening just to me.

Reproducible: Sometimes



Expected Results:  
Even if it becomes unstable it shouldn't freeze the system at least.
