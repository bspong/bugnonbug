Steps to reproduce:

I was testing FF 6.0 beta and when you click on Bookmarks there is something called "Unsorted Bookmarks" on the bottom of the list (column).

Does anyone have a clue how to delete this option?

I do not see it on my FF 5.0 nor did I see it on any other FF browser till now.

My add-ons are IE Tab2 and Status-4-Evar
Windows XP Pro SP3 and Windows Home SP3



Actual results:

If you do a right click to delete it you can not do it.


Expected results:

You should be able to remove this Folder.
