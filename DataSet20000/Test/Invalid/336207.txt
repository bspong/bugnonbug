If all cookies are blocked, there is no way to allow cookies from a whole domain.  For example, if all cookies are blocked and you put "yahoo.com" as allowed, then  cookies will still not be set from mail.yahoo.com, games.yahoo.com, news.yahoo.com, login.yahoo.com, etc.

Recommendation: put in an option to have wildcards in the exceptions list, eg "*.yahoo.com" can be allowed.  This would allow all subdomains from a trusted domain.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clear and block all cookies
2. Allow cookies from yahoo.com
3. Try to login in to mail.yahoo.com and you cant.




This would be a powerful addition.  It should work for both allowing and denying wildcard subdomains to set cookies and could make looking at the cookies list much cleaner.
