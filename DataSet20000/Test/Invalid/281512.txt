Rendering is not correct for the navigation bar on this page.

The blue navigation bar on top of this page containing the "Internet Access",
"Services", "Channels" and "About TIMENet" displayed a single (blue) line with
options underneath it for all 4 options (as seen in IE before I installed FF)

FF displays the line with extra options on a separate line each.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. browse to webmail.time.net.my
2. look at the top navigation bar.
3. move over the top 4 items and see what happens

Actual Results:  
the lines with navigation options are displayed on 4 different lines

Expected Results:  
display the navigations options on one line right under the main navigation line

I am not aware if this is IE specific webpage or a rendering problem in FF.
