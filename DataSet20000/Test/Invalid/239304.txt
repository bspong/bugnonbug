Add "..." to the "New Separator" Button on the Bookmarks Manager Toolbar
If Bug 230370 gets Wontfixed, we should add the "..." at the end of the "New
Separator" button on the toolbar of the Bookmarks Manager to be consistent with
the UI for buttons that open a dialog.

If Bug 230370 gets fixed, this should be invalidated.
