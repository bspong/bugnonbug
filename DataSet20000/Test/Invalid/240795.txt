Persistence of favicons, should they be permanent or periodically refreshed?
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173762#c52 raised this issue, and
its worthy of its own decision.  Does the user expect the favicon to remain
stored, or to be updated when the site icon changes?  Does changing the visual
representation of the site icon imply that we should switch to the new title as
well? (this would be dependent on whether the user changed the bookmark title at
any point, of course)

I think that making part of the bookmarks listing dynamic while leaving the text
static is less "clean" from a UI perspective.
