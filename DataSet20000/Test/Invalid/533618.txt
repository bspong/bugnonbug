Happens with various applets from what I can tell.

If I right-click inside a Java applet, and drag the cursor out of the applet or the applet window, the context menu appears.

Although not unusual behavior in some circumstances, if the cursor is dragged over another Java applet for example, a context menu is produced which includes every possible context menu options, including controls such as Play and Pause even, when there is nothing to Play!

Reproducible: Always

1. Load a web page with a [Java] applet embedded.
2. Right-click in the applet, and drag the cursor out of the applet.
3. Observe context menu.
Actual Results:  
Context menu appears.

Expected Results:  
No context menu should appear.
