When I start firefox the screen appearance is not correct. There is approximately a 1" gap between the "Start" bar at the bottom of the screen and the last line of the image.  This line might have something like "Transferring data from bugzilla...."

I have a snapshot of the screen that I could send you that would make it very clear what my problem is.  I have two systems running firefox, both are W2000.  One is great, the other isn't.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on Mozilla Icon
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Firefox does not fill the screen.

Expected Results:  
Do not expect the appx 1" gap between the display and the "Start" bar.
