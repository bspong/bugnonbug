none of the buttons are showing up, and the address bar shows no url.
I even changed themes several times and they all have the same problem.
It has a little bar on it, when you click it, it says "this website does not supply identity information." This Quote shows up in the bottom left hand corner of the web page once the bar is clicked on.
The bar comes down vertically. It is next to the star on the address bar of the "Aero Silver Fox Basic" Theme.
