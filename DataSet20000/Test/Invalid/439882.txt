Setting to allow hiding of adressbar in new window

When opening a new window with javascript and the adressbar should be hidden, firefox 3 (as IE 7) shows a small adressbar anyway. While this might be fine regarding security I would be able to disable that feature at least in the extended JavaScript settings.

Reproducible: Always
