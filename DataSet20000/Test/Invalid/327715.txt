On the acer laptop there is a four way button that allows 2D scroling
This button works fine in all apps except mozilla products.
When working in an app it replaces the mouse cursor with a mini scrolbar(not animated) and scrols the window.
Under mozilla it just beeps.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open firefox
2.navigate to URL with more than a screen of text so that scroll bars appear.
3.press and hold scroll button.

Actual Results:  
no scroling

Expected Results:  
window should scroll.
