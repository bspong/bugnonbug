I recently bought a new PC (running Vista) and went straight to FF3 as you had just started sending out upgrade messages. While in general it works ok, I have a number of problems, which haven't been fixed by upgrading to 3.0.3:
A. Text/graphics is missing on pages. Sometimes though not often a refresh will return the whole page.
B. Pages are not formatted. Sometimes a Javascript message appears saying it is not activated or out-of-date. All Java options are ticked in the Tools menu and I downloaded a new Java version on the new PC.
C. Files do not download fully, often "completing" after about 160k. This was a major issue for some specialist software I use and the suppliers ended up sending me a new version on CD.
D/E. Major problems with Flash player and Windows media player. As above they would not download, so I copied versions I used on FF2.0.16 and installed those. Usually the video window does not appear on screen, though on one site, which uses WMP, the player can be seen but the video is not displayed, though sound track is ok.

All this time I have been using my wireless laptop to see the problem sites/pages. This runs XP and FF3.0.1, upgraded from 2.0.16 and earlier.

I have swapped my modem, and contacted my ISP (who can't find a problem). I have also read a number of threads on the FF Forum and tried a number of ideas, all to no effect. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
A. 1. Go to Firefox Support Forum site
2. Find a problem with multiple pages
3. Click through from page to page. Some load fully, some only partially. For this site the refresh loads the whole page.

B. 1. Go to http://fantasycricket.telegraph.co.uk/CleverTV/en/telegraph/tfc2008/3/clienthome.do
2. Click on player list down LHS
3. You should see a nicely formatted page, including a four tabbed table (batsmen, keepers, all-rounders, bowlers). I see a list of text plus the Player Points graphic. Some of the players (in the 4 categories) appear, though not all

C. 1. You will not be able to access the specialist software as it is a subscription site. 
2. Either the file starts to download but stops after approx 160k out of 55MB or I receive error message: C:\Users\Geoff\AppData\Local\Temp\oYygkazQ.exe.part could not be saved, because the source file could not be read.

Flash and WMP downloads were attempted from the standard sites. As above, the download appears to work but stops after approx 160k.
D. 1. Go to http://sharecrazy.com/beta/
2. On RHS click on Board Talk (say)
3. Then click any of the listed videos. The video window appears but no video

E. 1. Go to http://w3.cantos.com/cantos/dyn/main.php?t=a&CantosSID=dbb765103409c0bdbd64708fd074127a_C. For me this page isn't formatted.
2. Find Charts of the Week and click watch.
3. Using WMP there is a space where the video should be, though I can hear the sound.
