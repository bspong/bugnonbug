Firefox & Thunderbird problems.doc

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build ID: 20110615151330

Steps to reproduce:

Dear Sirs,
                 Starting with firefoc 4.0 and continuing with 5.0 for the mac main problem is that firefox freezes up and needs a force quit to exit. When starting fresh with a reboot of the mac firefox will freeze in 1 minute to 12 minutes from starting. Now version 5.0 works a little better I now get freezes in 5 to 15 minutes from a clean start with a mac reboot all freezes need force quit to exit. As you might guess firefox 4.0 or 5.0 for mac makes watching a movie via streaming video impossible. Well thats the problem now for a few suggestions.

I would love to see a version supported for the mac be it old or new but say that this version works best on the mac I.e. (version 3.6 etc for mac works best or maybe you know one that works better? Do the same for unix systems. 

Now for the poor beleagured IT people you need to support a version thats outside your quick release new versioning. You really need to give a version of firefox and Thunderbird that It has tested and knows it works with all their software. Again firefox 3.6 & thunderbird 3.1.11 are the working standards please keep these current for a 3-5 year period. If you try to force IT to get your latest quick release you will loose all your IT customers not because they don't like your software but because it takes most of a year to test all software to make sure it will work with the IT infrastructure. I sure hope you can do some things along these lines it will be very appreciated.

I understand why you have to do your quick releases your compitition almost drown you guys but please set up stable version for the mac and unix Please.

Oh I tried version 5.0 of firebird it did not run with all my addons but its big flaw was that an email I got in reply to an email I sent my friend was claimed to be from my in laws who had no way of knowing the content of the previous email so it could not be from my inlaws. It proved to show up when forwarded to my wife's email as from my friend I originally contacted but thunderbird 5.0 list it from the wrong people!

Thank You and I would really love a reply someday to :
