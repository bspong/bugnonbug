Entire blocks are missing under Mozilla
When searching the Ingram Micro web site for products using Internet Explorer,
there is normally a band of text that begins near the upper left with the words
"SKU / Mfr# / UPC Search Results" and ends a little down and to the right with a
listing of the available hyperlinks to pages one can follow to see the
additional products that match the query.  At the very bottom of the page, there
is another band of information that details "notes", "promos" and additionally
has the hyperlinked page numbers.

Neither of these is there in the Firefox 1.0 or in Mozilla 1.2.1 that comes with
Redhat 9.0.  I am not sure if this is an issue that can be overcome with a
little tweaking in the progamming, or if it is specific to the parameters set by
the Ingram Micro web site to only work with IE.

Thanks,
