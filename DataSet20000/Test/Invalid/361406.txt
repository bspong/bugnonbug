Crashes Randomly With No Specific Action

Firefox Crashes Randomly With No Specific Action.  I could be in the middle of browsing a site, or typing in text field.  It is never the same operation that causes the crash.  There is no core file dump or error messages printed in a dialog window or any of the log files (~/.xsession-errors, /var/log/messages, etc).

I have ignored the problem for so long with all the previous versions of Firefox that were released for Fedora Core 5 and older.  However, I am using the latest stable release for Fedora Core 6, and the same problem occurs.  Plus, I did not report the problem before because Firefox is Free Open Source Software (OSS).

However, I am getting very frustrated with the consistent crashing.  It makes me feel like I am using Micro$oft Windows.  That is one the main reasons I avoid using M$ Windows, and do not recommend it to our clients.

I have close to 20 years of experience with Unix Platforms.  These types of issues will not discourage me from using Linux, Mozilla and other OSS.  However, with these types of problems, promoting Linux, Mozilla and other OSS to our clients is very complicated.  These types of problems should not be taken lightly.

I am the NOC Director of a Linux & OSS Solution Provider.  Unlike many ISV, we do our best to make sure our Enterprise Business Management and other Web Based  Applications run on Firefox.  Please let us know what we can do to ensure that we can deliver our solutions to work well with Firefox.

If there is certain utility the Mozilla Team recommends to trap errors, then please let me know.

Firefox should not just die.  If it does crash, then a core file or error messages should be generated.
