Cannot show a blocked popup if the string 'dom.popup_allowed_events' is empty

If all events are removed from the string 'dom.popup_allowed_events', FireFox
blocks all popups which is very useful now as many sites have found methods to
circumvent the popup blocker. But if you want to show a blocked popup by
clicking "Show <POPUP_URL>" the popup isn't displayed, which should be the case,
to allow users to temporarily show some popups on such sites without adding
these sites to the white list.
