Crashed and caused corrupt prefs.js file

I was browsing at http://www.softmachine.de/artwork.htm when FireFox suddenly
crashed.

When restarting FF I get this message:
~$ firefox
INTERNAL ERROR on Browser End: Expected a version > 5! Version = 4

~$

If I rename prefs.js FF works, but I of course don't have my settings anymore.

Let me know, if you want a tar.bz2 archive of my entire .mozilla/firefox directory.
