More details in "Actual Results" and "Additional Information" below. 
I just note that I have no problems pressing any other OK buttons in Mozilla
Firefox dialogs - just the one from Advanced Fonts preferences, and just now is
the first time it happened, and I am sure I changed options in that dialog
before, also in exactly this version and installation of Firefox, and it worked
fine. 

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Edit -> Preferences
2. Go to Fonts - Advanced
3. Change some font options
4. Try to press OK - nothing happens

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.

If I try to press OK with the keyboard (selecting it first with TAB) nothing
happens, as if I would not press Enter at all.

If I try to press it with the mouse (but using X mouse emulation by keyboard -
Shift+Ctrl+NumLock, and using the num keypad arrows to movc the pointer, and 5
to press the button) the OK button changes color and is visible like depressed,
but still nothing happens - the dialog doesn't close.

Expected Results:  
The Fonts Advanced dialog should close with the changed preferences saved.

I am using ion3 window manager.
I was using only the keyboard to change the options in the advanced font
preferences dialog. 
I changed "Western" and "Central European" to use DejaVu TrueTyep fonts for all
"Serif", "Sans-Serif" and "Monospace". And all sizes and "Minimum Font Size" to
10. And display resolution to 110 dpi (the line was 36.1 cm).
