The binding and CSS changes implemented to fix bug #349079 break many existing themes (and possibly extensions with toolbars.) I don't wish to sound too critical but the method used seems like an inelegant way to solve what appears to be an text alignment problem with the menu toolbarbuttons. I say "appears" since bug #349079 looks like it was hastily written and rush through the system.

Reproducible: Always
