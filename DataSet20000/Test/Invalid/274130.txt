I have spoofstick extension installed, but it
only bas a bar showing the real url. It would be a dramatic improvement to
Firefox to have the location bar flash/colored red when the displayed url and
actual url differs. Would the Firefox developers consider this? 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.install spoofed stick
2.go to test spoofed site
3.observe location bar color

Actual Results:  
no change in location bar color

Expected Results:  
location bar flash and/or turn angry red

no theme
