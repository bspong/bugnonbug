Less than test in XSLT fails to validate

I was developing a small XSLT page and I was using an xpath query like:

<xsl:for-each select="experience/job[position() <= 3]">
   <xsl:call-template name="job"/>
</xsl:for-each>

This fails validation with the message: 
XML Parsing Error: not well-formed
Location: http://alexcorscadden.homelinux.org/~alex/testing/resume2xhtmlbad.xsl
Line Number 49, Column 52:
<xsl:for-each select="experience/job[position() <= 3]">

changing the XPath query to read
experience/job[position() <= 3]

Works, but is somewhat of a kludge and shouldn't be necessary.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an XML document to be transformed by an XSLT
2. Use a XPath query with a less than symbol somewhere in the query in the XSLT
3. Receive error when viewing the page in Firefox.


Actual Results:  
Received an incorrect XSLT processing error

Expected Results:  
XSLT should have loaded correctly and processed the xml document to which it was associated.
