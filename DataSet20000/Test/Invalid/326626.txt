Every time I fire up Firefox, even after nuking ~/.mozilla, nothing shows up below the seperator after "Manage Bookmarks" -- including the Bookmarks Toolbar Folder.  If I select "Manage Bookmarks" and close the window, though, it shows up in the menu.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Nuke ~/.mozilla
2. Launch Firefox
3. Click on the Bookmarks menu

Actual Results:  
Nothing below the "Manage Bookmarks" seperator, regardless of clean launch, or a second launch after bookmarking pages, or importing bookmarks, or...

Expected Results:  
Bookmarks are visible.

amd64 build of 1.5.0.1 out of CVS, using gcc 3.4.4, Debian/stable using APT sources for the base system from amd64.debian.net.

Also happens for me on a seperate system, 32-bit P4 system, as well.
