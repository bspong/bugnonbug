I am unable to post a message on the world of Warcraft forums using Firefox. I can in any other browser

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Login to wow forum (any section, it does not matter)
2.create a new forum posting
3.Try to post
Actual Results:  
It states there is an invalid access

Expected Results:  
I expect it to post what i have written, but that does not happen

The advice i have seen to temporarily correct the problem is stated as:

To fix this type "about:config" in the address bar
Then look for "network.http.sendRefererHeader"
Double click it
Change the value to 2

This is a non-permanent fix and has occurred at least since 3.5 came out, according to the forum postings i have read
