Tonight, when browsing the web, Firefox attempted to install a virus: JAVA_BYTEVER.R onto my computer.  There was no request to install anything.  The site said it wanted to install a toolbar and I clicked no, but Firefox tried to install it anyway.  The site in question was: http://www.musicsonglyrics.com/T/twistedsisterlyrics/twistedsisterburninhelllyrics.htm

Here is what the Java console had: 
load: class javainstaller.InstallerApplet.class not found.
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: javainstaller.InstallerApplet.class

I hope this can help you improve firefox

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to the site
2.This virus will attempt to install
3.

Actual Results:  
See above

Expected Results:  
I would it expect it to NOT install anything without asking me for permission.  If it wasn't for my Anti-virus software, this would have gotten through

This was used with Firefox in standard mode.  I also have Zone Alarm 6 and Trend Micro Internet Security 2005 running.

This is my first time reporting a problem... I apologize if the severity and security settings are appropriate
