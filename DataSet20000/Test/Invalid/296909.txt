Bookmarks created in FrontPage appear to be ignored when used in a Quicksearch

I have a role-play running on the BBS site Neoseeker.com.  I have attempted to
make a glossary of terms for the large number of times I suspect I would have to
give term definitions to others.  I got the site up fine, but I also found it
tedious to search for the term I needed.  So, I created a Quicksearch to
automate the process.  The process I used is in the first paragraph of the
glossary section.  When I first tried it, it went to the page, but it failed to
jump to the term.  I tried with a few more terms, but it didn't work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a QuickSearch bookmark with the Location set to
http://alanbunting.users.warpdriveonline.com/psaviors.htm#%s and the Keyword set
to psaviors (or another word of your choice).
2. Create a new tab, then use the Quicksearch to try to access a term in the
glossary.  (Examples: down, faint, kill)
3.

Actual Results:  
The browser navigated to the page, but did not jump to the bookmark.

Expected Results:  
The browser should have went to the page, then jumped to the bookmark.  For
example, if the search term was "faint", the browser would have jumped to the
glossary entry for faint.

I don't know that it makes a difference, but FrontPage appears to be scripting
the page for IE 4.0... I think.
