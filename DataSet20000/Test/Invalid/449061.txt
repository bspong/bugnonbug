Gecko based browsers should distinguish between unknown and invalid certificates

Dear developers,

This bug report should define and track an optimized new certificate handling of Mozilla Firefox 3.0.x as the current one may be seen as a bug:

#431386 and #433422 discusses the invalid behaviour of Mozilla Firefox 3.0.x in connection with a self-signed certificate. As noted there the definition of an "invalid certificate" (as it is shown right now) is just plainly wrong.
#446567 links to a page for the option "expert_bad_cert" ... certificates from unknown sources are not "invalid" or "bad" as they are shown in current versions.

As reported for example at slashdot.org this new behaviour is a violation of net neutrality and should be threaded and corrected with the highest priority available.
http://tech.slashdot.org/tech/08/08/04/0058217.shtml

Why is this the case?

Have a look at https://bugs.freedesktop.org/. This is a trustworthy website with an "unsupported" CA called "CA Cert Signing Authority" (http://www.cacert.org). Now Mozilla Firefox 3.0.x says not that this CA is not trusted. It says "invalid certificate" and in the upcoming dialog it even informs users "that trustworthy websites will not ask users to accept this certificate" which is, sorry for my rude language, a lie.

How should this bug be resolved?

1. Add a "Accept this certificate forever" checkbox and a button to continue using the website without a long four step procedure. Do not open a extra dialog with a mandatory process and unacceptable texts like the "trustworthy websites will never ask you ...".
2. Correctly define self-signed certificates as a "potential security issue" because defined values like company names etc. might be invalid.
3. Auto-download certificates in the certificate wizard for "untrusted" CAs or if the users selects "Accept this certificate forever". Make this process a one-click one.
4. Do never inform users that unknown certificates are not trustworthy. They are unknown to Mozilla Firefox - that's all!
5. As a workaround set "expert_bad_cert" to "true" until this bug has been resolved.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a https website from a "unknown" CA
Actual Results:  
Users are forced to accept "untrustworthy" certificates to visit trustworthy websites. This will influence user behaviour and they will click through these dialogs without differentiating between "trustworthy but unknown CA certificates" and "certificates from phishing websites".

Expected Results:  
1. A one or two click process to accept unknown but trustworthy = standard complaint certificates.
2. Correct definitions for self-signed and unknown certificates as unknown and not as invalid.
3. Removed text about "trustworthy websites will never ask you ..."

I know that this "new behaviour" is already discussed here at bugzilla and the mailing list - that's why I do not open a "simple" bug report but a "tracking bug" for changing / optimizing the current behaviour. Keep up the good work but please do not think anymore that all users should be treated as DAUs and practical "developer settings" should be hidden in the "about:config" dialog ...
