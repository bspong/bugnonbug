Erratic behavior of Location Bar, when using ibus
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0 Iceweasel/5.0

Steps to reproduce:

I use ibus 1.3.9 with input method "Russian-kbd".

To reproduce:

0) Activate "Russian-kbd" input method.

1) Activate Location Bar via Control-L, start typing. The first character will be Cyrillic (correct). The next characters will be Latin -- the input method has switched off (incorrect).

2) Try to enable "Russian-kbd" again -- hit a key that does so (F15 on my system). Instead, Completion Bar loses focus (incorrect), "Russian-kbd" is not enabled (incorrect).

3) Activate Location Bar again, by using pointer.

4) Continue typing until the completions dropdown list disappears. The Location Bar loses focus (incorrect).

The problem first appeared in Firefox 5 -- Firefox 3 and 4 worked just nicely. Firefox 5 Location Bar is nearly unusable due to described problems.
