If i close firefox and attempt to open it again, windows shows a message "firefox is still running". Then I open windows task manager and i try to close program using end proccess but it remains open. I only close the program if i restart my computer, which take so much time. Also, before this proplem happens, i have noticed that firefox was uncapable to open any web page.
