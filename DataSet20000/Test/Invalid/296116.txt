when firefox was opened, new profile needed to be created for use of firefox

When I tried to open firefox, a screen popped up asking me to create a new
default user profile.  This was the only screen that opened when I would try to
open firefox.  I did as it said to gain internet access, however I cannot locate
the screen to change it back to the original profile that held all of my saved info.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open firefox
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Small screen opened with default profile options.  Only 'default' was visible in
the options screen, and I was told to create a new profile in order to use
firefox, to which I did, and cannot figure out how to change back to original
profile.

Expected Results:  
Not asked me to create a new profile, as I was fine with the one I had.

I will need the info I had saved for business purposes as most of it was my
saved bookmark pages, which I have lost/cannot find.
