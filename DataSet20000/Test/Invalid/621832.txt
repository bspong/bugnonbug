Send page by email version 0.6.3 keeps coming up as incompatible with Firefox 3.6.13.  It works fine for me with this version.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  pull up Firefox
2.  Get incompatible message
3.  Sometime have to reconfigure Send by email 0.6.3  


Expected Results:  
Don't want to keep getting the incompatible message when add-on clearly works.
