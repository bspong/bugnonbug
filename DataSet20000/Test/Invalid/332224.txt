targetFrame.document.getElementById.className="nonSelectable" had no effect

Problem encountered with executing the following JavaScript code within "srcFrame"

dstFrame.document.getElementById(dstId).className = "nonSelectable";

"dstFrame" is an <iframe> within "srcFrame".document.
"srcFrame" and "debugFrame" are neighbour <frame>s within a <frameset>.
"dstId" is associated to a <table> whose <tr>s are made "selectable" or "nonSelectable".
"dstId" of course is unique within "dstFrame".document (checked!).

Execution success confirmed by debug output from a JavaScript routine, containing the line above, into a "dbgFrame". But: on the window, the rows unfortunately remain selectable!

A little hope: that the browser implementors one day will have time enough to offer us a document pretty-printer displaying a source out of the document most recent abstract syntax tree.
The effect of e.g. "document.replaceChild()" is perfectly visible on the screen, but not in the source given by the "View page source" menu entry.

Thanks in advance,

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Display a <table> in an <iframe> of <frame> "dstFrame"
2. Execute, in a JavaScript routine sent to "srcFrame", the code shown in "Details"


Expected Results:  
The browser should not allow for selection of <tr>s within the <table> (the "onMouseOver" event associated with the <tr>s checks for the <table>'s class).

The problem arised at transition, in my software, from a stage of full frame or iframe document redisplay to a stage redisplaying increments only, using DOM 1.0 JavaScript routine calls.

In this new model, the HTML increments are sent to a frame together with an automatically generated JavaScript routine implanting the increments into the document. 

Everything works perfectly, with the exception of the little problem described above.
