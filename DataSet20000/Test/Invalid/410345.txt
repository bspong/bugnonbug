Home page opens in english as defaulted. When searching using Google search box in upper right corner, results page is displayed with russian characters (cyrillic?) in all frame areas. Only my search words and the word 'Google' appear in english. Within the frame, some search results also appear entirely in cyrillic/russian. 

Ran SpySweeper, Prevx, Norton...uninstalled/reinstalled Firefox. Feel hijacked...don't know how to kill it.
