Opening foreground tab/window/tab with CTRL/SHIFT/CTRL+SHIFT + left mouse button is broken on some sites and open links with selected job, but also open this link in current tab, but this should happen.

Using menu for opening links didnt show this issue, only keyboard shortcuts are affected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.mangatoshokan.com/
2. open some manga in "Latest Releases" using CTRL + left mouse button to "Open link in Foreground Tab"
Actual Results:  
Link is opened in foreground tab, but also in current tab.

Expected Results:  
Link should be opened only in foreground tab, not also in current tab.
