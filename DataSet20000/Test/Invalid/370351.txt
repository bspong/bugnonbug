Firefox randomly displays source instead of rendering HTML

  Visiting some pages seems to display the source HTML, rather than rendering the HTML as it should. Clicking a link to the problem page does not seem to solve the problem, but refresh sometimes does.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
  No "exact" steps, seems to happen through random browsing.
Actual Results:  
  Page rendered as raw text, not parsed HTML.

Expected Results:  
  A properly displayed webpage.
