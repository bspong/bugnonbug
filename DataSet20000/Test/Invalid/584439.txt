With TACO 3.02 the home page loads when firefox starts.
After upgrading to TACO 3.10, a blank page is displayed when firefox starts.
The home page can be displayed by hitting the home icon on the navigation toolbar.
In my case, the home page is a local file (file:///) that is an html formatted page containing lots of links; that is, it is not a html reference. I have no idea if the fault would apply to an html:// style home page.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
With TACO 3.10, the home page does not load automatically.
A blank page is displayed.
Further action is needed (home on navigation toolbar) to load the home page.

Expected Results:  
Expect the home page to load automatically, as with TACO 3.02
