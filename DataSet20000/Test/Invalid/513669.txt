Firefox 3.5.2 works perfectly with OGV files contained in the same folder, while it refuses to play files in other folders or sites, a grey background with an X in the center appears, no errors or warnings at all in the error console.

-- EXAMPLE OF WORKING TAG --
<video class="v" src="myvideo.ogv" />

-- THESE ARE JUST NON-WORKING EXAMPLES --
<video src="http://www.myexamplesite.com/myvideo.ogv" controls />
<video src="myfolder/sub/myvideo.ogv">Blablabla</video>

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. use the VIDEO tag with as SRC an external video or a video in a subfolder
Actual Results:  
A video player with fixed width and height and grey background with an X in the center appears.

Expected Results:  
The video player included in firefox should load the video and let you play it.
