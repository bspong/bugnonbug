How do I tell Firebird to reuse tabs instead of opening new ones? I had no
problems when running Firebird 0.6.1 but since upgrading to 0.7 every time I
click a link in my email a new browser tab opens. I want to reuse tabs, opening
a new tab manually when don't want a tab reused.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a window open
2. Click on a new link in an email

Actual Results:  
New tab is created rather than reusing the current tab.

Expected Results:  
I want to reuse the tab currently having the focus.

I also have the Tabbedbrowser Extension and posted a comment to their forum but
it may be a FIrebird issue rather than an extension issue.
