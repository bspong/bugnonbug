the link at
http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Graphic-ads-show-teen-in-body-bag/2005/04/16/1113509969360.html
will not open the link either by clicking on it or by cutting and pasting into
the  address bar. 
The hyperlink does work (it works in IE6 and when converted to a tinyurl). The
tiny url is http://tinyurl.com/8ccq6. 
I have noticed this happening with other links as well, but only since version
1.01. I do not have the other broken URLS but come across at least one a day
(and not all from the one website).
