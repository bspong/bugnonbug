I have set my startup option as "show my windows and tabs from last time".





Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
scenario A
1. open 20 tabs
2. open DownThemAll manager [may work with any other extension process left running?]
3. Close Firefox but leave DTA manager open
4. restart firefox

or

scenario B
1. open 20 tabs in 'main' firefox window
2. open a second firefox window with 1 or 2 tabs
3. Close the main Firefox window
4. close the second firefox window
Actual Results:  
scenario A:  when firefox restarts it opens to blank window, no tabs are opened.  All data from prior sessions is lost. 

Scenario B:  On restart, FF remembers only the secondary window data.  All of the data from the 'main' window is lost

Expected Results:  
I would expect/desire that FF not lose session data due to inadvertent closing order where the 'main' window [desired to be resumed, restored] is closed before secondary windows or extension processes are closed.

At a minimum, a warning notice that other windows, extensions are active, and that all restore data of the window in focus will be lost on closing and not retored on restart.


alternatively, have a 2+ level session backup option and show all windows/tabs from prior session, with button/command to go to 'previous session'.
or
reopen:
[ ] window with 27 tabs
[ ] window with 2 tabs

Keep data from all FF windows during a session, not just the tabs on the last FF window or extension to be closed.

I am not sure of the optimal function.. but having some means to restore a session under these circumstances is the object.
