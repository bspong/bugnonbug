When I open a new tab, it doesn't become active.  After trying to change this option in the Preferences, nothing happens - the same behavior.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open new tab.  It isn't active.
2. Menu - Tools - Preferences (maybe not precise - I'm using Russian version of FF) - Tabs - "Switch to opened tab" on.
3. The same as (1).

Actual Results:  
The opened tab doesn't become active.

Expected Results:  
Make the opened tab active.
