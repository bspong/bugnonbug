getItemIdForGUID ignores anno name
The mDBGetItemIdForGUID SQL statement:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/places/src/nsNavBookmarks.cpp#295

Does not use the guid anno name ("placesInternal/GUID").  Seems to me this could return other items which have a different anno with the same value.

Of course, that is unlikely, but possible given some hypothetical extension that saves e.g., "myext/related" with the value being a related GUID.
