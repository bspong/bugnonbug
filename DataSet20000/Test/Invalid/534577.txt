Image does not render in the correct position with background-attachment=scroll (default) when using background-position

Image uses background-position (bottom right) to place background image. By default, background-attachment is scroll and this causes the image to be displayed incorrectly.

When background-attachment is explicitly defined as scroll, it screws up too. However, both Chrome and Internet Explorer render it correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add background image with background-position set to something (bottom right for example).
2. Set background-attachment as scroll or leave empty.
3. Express frustration with unexpected behaviour.
Actual Results:  
Background image is half displayed at top center.

Expected Results:  
Should place the image in expected location (ie bottom left)
