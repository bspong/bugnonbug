If I click on "X" to exit Firefox, and at a moment after, slide the mouse to an angle while still holding onto the mouse button for a moment (as I sometimes do), firefox will exit and my computer will reboot. This is annoying. The mouse be slid from right to left in a downward motion toward the other corner of the monitor. Just a little slide is enough. This is done almost without thinking. Just a natural movement of the cursor from right to left after clicking the "X". This only happens with Firefox. No other applications.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Move mouse from right to left just after clicking "X".
2.Must be an instant.
3.Computer should reboot after that.
Actual Results:  
Read above in "Details".

Expected Results:  
Expected browser to close.
But computer reboots, if mouse gesture is done just right.

Simply closed.
This has been going for quite awhile, even with updates.
Current version I have is 3.6.3.
