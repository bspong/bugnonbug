FF3.0 error message: Linkification not compatible with fire fox 3.0.  In Fire Fox 2.14 it worked.  It was the ONLY way I could type live, clickable (blue) links in Hotmail and Yahoo E-mail.   PLEASE MAKE LINKIFICATION COMPATIBLE WITH FF3.0.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I tried sending multiple e-mail with Hotmail and Yahoo e-mail, but the links I type are dead, unclickable and do not turn blue 
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
.I tried sending multiple e-mail with Hotmail and Yahoo e-mail, but the links I type are dead, unclickable and do not turn blue 

Expected Results:  
the links I type, do not turn blue and are unclickable, e.g. www.google.com


Linkification SHOULD have been made compatible with FF3.0, but it is not.  If there is another add-on or extention, please advise.  I have reported the problem to Hotmail (Microsoft).  Of course they blame it on Fire Fox.

However when I use IE7.0, every link I type in Hotmail or Yahoo e-mail is LIVE, BLUE and clickable.
