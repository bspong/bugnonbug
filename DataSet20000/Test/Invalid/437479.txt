When I create a job with Altiris Deployment Solution to remotely execute the Installer with the /S switch, Firefox successfully installs on XP but not on Vista.  It probably behaves this way with other remote installation software that most large companies use.  I've seen this problem with other software packages and you can usually reproduce it by getting the Installer to run with a /S under the SYSTEM account.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run "Firefox Setup 3.0 RC 2.exe /S" as the SYSTEM account while logged in as a user.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Firefox does not install

Expected Results:  
Firefox installs
