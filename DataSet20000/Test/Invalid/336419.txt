i used to visit dotaportal.com everyday, but after todays' update Firefox to version 1.5.0.3. I failed to enter the home page which used to be
"http://www.dotaportal.com/index.php".

Please go to "http://www.dotaportal.com" and then click "Enter Site". Then you will have a pop up on "chosen to open index.php". This happened everytime I clicked "Enter Site".

I restarted Firefox for more than 10 times after update Firefox to 1.5.0.3 today(3rd of May 2006), then i restarted my PC, and i tried to endter the same page again, but still, it's still asking me to "choose to open index.php". Then i Clicked Open With " my Dreamweaver start up and open an empty index.php.

Then here i am to report this bug to you
