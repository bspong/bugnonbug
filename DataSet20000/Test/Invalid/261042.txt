Check other URL extensions then ".com"

Wouldn't it be nice to have a list of extensions for the addressbar?
Like ".org", ".com", ".be"

I have 2 examples to illustrate this :

When I type "openoffice" and press CTRL+ENTER, Firefox always browses to
"openoffice.org" in stead of "openoffice.com"

When I type "stubru" and press CTRL+ENTER, Firefox always browses to
"stubru.com" in stead of "stubru.be"

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type "stubru" in the addressbar
2. Press CTRL+ENTER
Actual Results:  
Browses to "www.stubru.com"

Expected Results:  
Browse to "www.stubru.be"
