Google Translate requires Adobe Flashplayer

The behaviour was observed with Firefox 3.6 both Windows and Linux Version. And I noticed same kind with Firefox 4 with Windows.

If you start the translator widget with flashplayer installed you can select the target language with the drop down menu. If there is no flashplayer there is no drop down menu either.
 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. uninstall flashplayer
2. click on language selector on http://www.niki-boden.de
3. do same with flashplayer installed



This bug is discussed thoroughly under 
http://groups.google.com/group/google-translate-general/browse_thread/thread/1400a5dfe2d0b6dd/fcd0ec74c1ee0e16 

But I don't think that it is a Google issue.
