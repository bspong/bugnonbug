Firefox crashes on any version of firefox and flash I install
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/535.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/15.0.874.106 Safari/535.2

Steps to reproduce:

I wasn't sure, it was working fine. I'm not sure if its because I updated Mcafee, flash, placed an add-on or what. 


Actual results:

When I started using firefox again it keeps on crashing and at time opening new firefox windows and tabs on it with funny characters at times. So i went to mozilla and updated my old version into a new one, i also updated the flash. Still, it keep on crashing on whatever version i install both on firefox and flash. I also removed the add-ons.
