Drag object to new nonexistent tab (creates it) or another tab, but also changes current tab.

Every time I drag something (image, url, etc) to the tab bar to make a new tab, the new tab is created (which is good), but the current tab is also changed (which isn't what should happen).


Same happens with dragging something to an existing tab, but this only happens if you change the tab on another page (without going to the want-to-change tab)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Drag something (Image, Link, etc) to the tab bar to create a new tab.

(Other way)

1. Drag something (image, link, etc) to an existing tab (WITHOUT going to the actual tab)
Actual Results:  
The new tab is created (which is wanted), but the current tab is changed also.

--------
(Other way)

1. The existing tab is changed, but the current tab your on is changed also (only if you don't go to the existing tab)

Expected Results:  
The current tab should not change. Only the new/existing tab should be created/changed
