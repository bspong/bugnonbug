I have a drop down that I allow the user to select a download format for an
image.  When the user selects an option, I update a few text nodes to show some
details about that download format (ie. JPEG vs. TIFF, CMYK vs. RGB, etc.). 
When I click on a different option, the text is properly updated through the JS
call, however, when I then use the up/down arrow keys to move through the
different options, it does not work anymore.

There is a simple workaround, obviously only use the mouse, but, a web developer
(as myself) should not have to rely on the user knowing this.  As well, I do not
think it should be up to me to catch an onkeydown/onkeypress to determine
whether it has changed or not, although it would seem to be a fairly simple
workaround.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create page using sample code below.
2. Using the mouse, select an option in the dropdown.  A javascript popup should
alert you to the option you have selected.
3. With the <select> focused, use the up/down arrow keys to change to a
different option.  No popup shows up.

Actual Results:  
The onchange event does not seem to be fired after up/down changes the selection.

Expected Results:  
The onchange event should be fired whether it is changed by the mouse (clicking
on it) or a user pressing up/down.
