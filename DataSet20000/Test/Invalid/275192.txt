Firefox misunderstands '>' character in XML processing instructions in local files
Please see bug 258868 first.

The same bug appears when trying to read a local file; it does not appear (as
described in above mentioned bug) when using a document from a web server.

Firefox should see that the local file contains XML and handle it as if it was
served with application/xhtml+xml. Currently, it behaves as if the file
contained text/html. The XML declaration should be sufficient to find out that
the file does not contain text/html, but application/xhtml+xml.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>

header('Link: <styles>; rel="stylesheet"; type="text/css"; charset="UTF-8"', false);

-----END testcase-----

The problem is caused by the wrong handling of the '>' character in the Link
header (line 3) in this example.
