Firefox unable to reopen after closing.

Under both Windows XP SP2 and Slackware 10.1, I am encountering a problem where
I can load up Firefox 1.0.3 once, but if I close it during my logged in session,
I am unable to reopen it, no matter how many times it's selected from a menu, no
matter how many times an icon is clicked, and no matter (under Linux) I simply
enter the "firefox" command.  Under Linux it's even stranger because no error
message is given after entering the "firefox" command.  It just gives you the
command prompt back with no output.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open Firefox 1.0.3 in Windows XP or Linux
2.  Close Firefox
3.  Attempt to open Firefox again and watch it not load.

Actual Results:  
In previous versions up to 1.0.2 I never experienced this issue, and I've been
using Firefox since Phoenix 0.5 back in the day. :)

Expected Results:  
It should have opened like any other program.
