Using 2 way SSL - on cross domain requests that require a preflight the client certificate is not being sent to the server with the initial preflight request even though withCredentials = true was specified.  The server reports an SSL handshake exception saying that no_certificate was sent.  In FF 3.5 Firebug would show the preflight options request loading indefinitely, in FF 3.6.3 the request shows status Aborted. (non-preflight GETs/POSTs work, all preflighted requests do not POST/DELETE/PUT)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Need a two SSL environment 
2.  
3.
Actual Results:  
Received status aborted on the preflight request so actual request is never sent.

Expected Results:  
Should have sent the client certificate on the preflight because with-credentials was specified on the actual XHR request.  Preflight would have returned 200 and the actual request would have been sent.
