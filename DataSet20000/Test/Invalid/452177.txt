Session restore data is often corrupt, should use Session Manager
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1

Before I installed Session Manager, my tabs weren't being saved. I kept getting a corruption error. If Firefox used the session restore of Session Manager by default, it would be much more dependable. I also like the "Save Session" and Undo Close Tab options. Why don't you replace the Firefox session restore with this extension by default?

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a whole bunch of windows.
2. Kill Firefox.
3. Open Firefox; select to restore tabs.
Actual Results:  
I get a corrupt data error.

Expected Results:  
It should restore them in the same way as Session Manager.
