nsFilePicker.js is useless on gtk builds
While all this component does on a gtk build is register itself with an empty CID, it's also quite useless to have it around just for that.

I see two possibilities, here:
- Remove it on gtk builds, which would simplify the Makefile.in next to it, as nsFilePicker wouln't need to be preprocessed
- Allow it to be enabled instead of the Gtk file picker through a preference. Note this could possibly be done for all ports
