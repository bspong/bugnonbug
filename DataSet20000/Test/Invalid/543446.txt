Browser doesn't start with mouse gestures extensions
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; uk; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6

After upgrading to 3.6 browser failed to start in normal mode, but starts in safe mode. Excluding one-by-one, I've discovered that it happens only with mouse gestures extensions enabled (I've tried Fire Gestures and Mouse Gestures Redox - both of them cause browser not to start next time).

In fact it happens in next order:
1. Install/enable extension
2. Restart Firefox - browser starts.
3. Close browser (with Alt+F4/close button)
4. Try to start Firefox one more time - nothing happened.

Firefox gives no console output - process stops after a few milliseconds after start.

I've also discovered that browser starts well after next actions (with already installed extensions):

1. Start Firefox in safe mode, press Cancel, run Firefox in normal mode.
2. Delete compreg.dat and xpti.dat from profile folder, run browser.

If browser managed to start, everything goes fine - all extensions work properly (including mouse gestures).

p.s. sorry for my english

Reproducible: Always
