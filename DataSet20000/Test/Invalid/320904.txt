Firefox 1.5 using abnormal amount of memory under low usage
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

After opening Firefox and going only to 4-5 sites (seperat tabs or not) I can see the memory usage for firefox.exe grow quickly from 40MB to an average of 120-130MB.  The highest I have seen mine hit is over 250MB.  I am seeing the behavior on every PC that has it installed and is being used.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open firefox and go to www.yahoo.com
2.Open a new tab and goto www.yahoo.com and then go to email (regular or the new BETA email)
3.Open a 3rd tab and open www.msn.com
4.Read one story under Yahoo and MSN and check email for Yahoo
5.Close all tabs and leave one blank tab
6.Clear the cache

Actual Results:  
Once that is done the memory usage shoots to 110MB-125MB and drops to 100MB+ still after the cache is cleared.

Expected Results:  
I would expect the memory usage to be a max of about 65-75MB of usage and then drop once all tabs are closed and the cache it cleared.
