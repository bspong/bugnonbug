Value of submit buttons doesn't get POST'ed.
If I submit a form with a submit button as following:

<submit name="something" value="Click">

And the method of the said form is POST, Firefox doesn't post a variable
"something" which is set to "Click".

On the contrary, if the form method is GET, Firefox correctly sets a var
"&something=Click" in the url.

I haven't checked with other versions of Firefox than 1.0. Mozilla version 1.7.3
behaves correctly.
