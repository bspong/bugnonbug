Firefox freezing Vista when accessing SSL sites

When accessing SSL sites using Firefox 2.0.0.7 under Vista Home Premium (with all updates), Vista freezes up entirely (total lockup, with no keyboard/mouse control).  This happens with a brand new installation of Firefox (no plugins) with a brand new installation of Vista 32-bit, running on an Intel Quad Core with 4GB of RAM.  Oddly enough, this problem did NOT occur on another machine running the same version of Vista, but with a single core (Pentium 4 HT) and 2 GB of RAM.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to any SSL site
2. If Firefox hasn't frozen already, go to another SSL site, and continue navigating back and forth.  It won't take long.
Actual Results:  
Total lockup.  The machine has to be power cycled.

Expected Results:  
Pretty obvious.  ;)
