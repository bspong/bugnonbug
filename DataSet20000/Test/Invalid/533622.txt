Ctrl+D shows a "Page Bookmarked" dialog while it isn't bookmarked (yet)

When I press ctrl+d on an unbookmarked URL I get a dialog where I can specify a bookmark folder, tags, etc. I can click Cancel, I can click Done. If I click Cancel, or press Escape, the page is not bookmarked. In fact, the page never has been bookmarked. The dialogue shouldn't be titled "Page Bookmarked" when it isn't and never has been.
Some alternative titles:
"Bookmark Page"
"Add a Bookmark"
"Add Bookmark"

Nitpicking? Well yes, I prefer a fox free of nits. Marking this severity:trivial.
