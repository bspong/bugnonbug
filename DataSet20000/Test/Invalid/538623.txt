User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; .NET CLR 3.5.21022; .NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; .NET CLR 3.5.21022; .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When I place the mouse cursor over text, it flutters between being an arrow and vertical bar (I-beam). It will then stabilize on being an arrow unless moved when it will flutter again. When I place the mouse cursor over any hyperlink, it flutters between arrow and hand. It then stabilizes on being an arrow but flutters again when moved. This began when Firefox updated to 3.5.7. It happens even when Firefox 3.5.7 is run in safe mode. It did not happen before, and it does not happen in ie8.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Place mouse cursor over text or hyperlink.
2. Watch cursor flutter then always show only the arrow instead of what is supposed to be showing (i.e. hand or vertical bar).
3. Move cursor and it will flutter again.
Actual Results:  
Cursor flutters over text or hyperlink then becomes an arrow. When moved, it flutters again.

Expected Results:  
Cursor should simply change to vertical bar (I-beam) over text and change to hand over hyperlink.

This happens on all web pages. It even happens when running Firefox 3.5.7 in safe mode. It can make it difficult to determine when the mouse is over a hyperlink.
