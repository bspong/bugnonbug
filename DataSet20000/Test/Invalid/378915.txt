When a add-on is automatically updated, tabbed browsing prefs are lost

Whenever FF automatically updates an add-on at FF startup, I lose one preference in my tabbed browsing.  Under "Tabbed Browsing/User Interface/When loading new tabs, load the:" section of the options dialog, I always have "Browser Homepage" selected.  When FF does an add-on update, and it seems to be for any add-on, but today it happened specifically with firebug, that option is reset to "Blank Page."  This has been happening for several versions back of FF.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set Tabbed prefs "Tabbed Browsing/User Interface/When loading new tabs, load the:" to "Browser Homepage"
2. Have FF automatically update an add-on as it starts (I know it definitely has happened with Firebug and the Web Developer Toolkit).
3. Try opening a new tab when FF finally loads.
Actual Results:  
It does not go to the browser homepage, but opens a blank tab.

Expected Results:  
It should open the Browser Homepage as previously chosen.
