If I middle-click or ctrl-click on a bookmark it always opens on the foregound,
independently from the setting "Select new tabs opened from links" in the
Options window. The word "links" is key here. Apparently bookmarks are
considered to be different than links, but it's not a very clear difference. It
seems inconsistent that I can choose to open new tabs in the background for
links and not for bookmarks. This setting should be added to the Options window,
or create a unified "Select new tabs opened from links and bookmarks".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Unset the "Select new tabs opened from links" option in the Options windows.
2.Middle-click or ctrl-click on a bookmark.

Actual Results:  
The bookmark opens in the foreground. Middle-clicking or ctrl-clicking on links
open them in the background.

Expected Results:  
More consistent configuration settings or behavior.
