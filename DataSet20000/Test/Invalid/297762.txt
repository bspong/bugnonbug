I have tried several nightly builds over the last couplke of days. They all have
the same problem. This problem only affects Dear Park alpha 1 and not Firefox 1.0.4

It is not possible to use the "Report Broken Website" from the help menu because
 the "Website URL" section does not allow typing and only picks up the site that
currently is displayed in the active window. Since the rpmseek.com website
crashes Dearpark this function is useless.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. browse to www.rpmseek.com from dear park alpha 1 
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Dear park crashes and exits (Therefore it is not possible to use the "report
broken website) feature.

Expected Results:  
Not to crash.
