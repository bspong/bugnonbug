Some links do not work (not recognized as anchors)
When reading the linked document I noticed that the cursor failed to change into hand shape when I moused over the 'Britney Spears' medical records' link. That is was an actual link was indicated by the light blue colour and subsequently made clear by viewing the source (the link text is: <a http="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23640143">Britney Spears' medical records</a>). Right-clicking over the link show the context menu for unlinked text, middle-mouse-clicking does not work as expected (link was not opened, instead I get autoscroll as for unlinked content). When clicking on the link the colour changes to lighter blue - something is happening. Nothing useful though...
