upgrade clobbers previous install-time prefs
I was prompted to upgrade from Mozilla Firefox 1.0 to 1.0.1 by the automatic
update service.

Despite being an upgrade, it wanted to do all the annoying defaults for a fresh
install:
- create start menu icons (in the default location, after I'd already moved them
to a more sensible location after the first install)
- create a quick launch icon (which I had already said no to the previous time)
- perform a standard install (thus excluding all the optional components I had
selected on the last install: developer tools and problem reporting tool)
- clobber my home page

It is ridiculous that I should have to select "Custom" install and invert most
every check box to get the existing behavior.

If a completely separate installer must be used to perform the upgrade, then it
should at least read my previous settings and default to those.
