font-face not loaded after upgrade to FF 5.0 RC
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0

Using any other browser supporting @font-face or even Firefox 4, the webfont works just fine. This isn't the case when using FF 5.0 RC.

Since Tumblr provides hardlinks for static theme files pointing to the subdomain "www" instead of the one I chose for my own blog, I assumed it has something to do with the bug #656277 - but what has font-face to do with WebGL?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Using Firefox 4.0, go to firefoxfontface.tumblr.com and notice how font-face is used for the headlines.
2. Install Firefox 5.0 Release Candidate 1.
3. Visit the page again.

Actual Results:  
font-face is no longer effective.

Expected Results:  
Load the font specified in my css file.
