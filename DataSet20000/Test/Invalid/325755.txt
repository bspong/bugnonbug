Can't connect to any web site; firefox.exe refuses to die
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; fr; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; fr; rv:1.8) Gecko/???????? Firefox/1.5.0.1

When I launch FF 1.5.0.1 there are 2 problems :

- FF cannot access to any web site. When I try a web site, It seems that it search it indefinitely, and the page stay blank (nb : At the same time, Internet Explorer works perfectly).

- When I quit FF, the window disappear normally but the "firefox.exe" process stay alive on memory and I can't kill it, even with the task manager or taskkill.exe (more precisely, taskkill says me that it was sucessively killed, but there is always is a process in the task manager). More, WinXP cannot quit a session, reboot or switch off, because the OS can't kill the running process. So, I must switch off my computer with the power button.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:




- I fully uninstalled FF 1.5.0.1 (i.e. deleting also "Mozilla Firefox" folder, in case it would have been a problem with FF extensions or plugins), and installed it again. The same problem occured. Nb : It occur even with no extensions and themes installed.

- This problem do not occur with Firefox 1.5 (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; fr; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5). I installed 1.5 again and it works now perfectly. No doubt that the problem is coming from FF modifications between 1.5 and 1.5.0.1.

- I use a strange adsl internet connexion, so sometimes my operating system seems to not be completely "aware" of the fact that I am connected to the Internet (however I AM connected and I can surf the web). For example, sometimes for some particular web sites (and with all versions of FF), a useless window appear to require me to connect to the web. It's probably because I'm behind a hub, which is itself connected to the internet router, so I'm connected through a local network. So, I think it could be the origin of the problem.

- I'm using Windows XP Service Pack 1, on a AMD Athlon 3000+ with 512 MB RAM.
