Live.com Data and Feeds Do Not Load

When loading Windows Live at live.com, the feeds all hang on "Loading...". Similarly, when pressing "Add Stuff...," the box also hangs on loading. Pressing "Page 2" yields no data, even if there are supposed to be feeds there.

The problem does not occur in Firefox 1.5.0.6 nor Beta 2, but only in Minefield (3.0a1).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.live.com
2. Sign in to passport account
3. Wait at Windows Live Home Page

Actual Results:  
All feeds hang on "Loading..."

Clicking on Page 2 yields nothing.

Expected Results:  
In both cases, it should load appropriate feeds and information.
