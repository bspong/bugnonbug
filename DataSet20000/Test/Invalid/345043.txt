No websites load in Firefox. Only in Internet Explorer. Firefox keeps giving "Unable to Connect" pages.

This is probably a more specific problem to me than anyone else... I haven't found this problem happening to anyone else yet at least. I tried to go onto Firefox yesterday evening and it wouldn't connect... didn't think much about it, it has done that to me before... so I just restart like I always do to fix the problem... but the problem is... restarting didn't fix it this time. I keep getting Unable to Connect pages. It also won't let me use any Proxies to connect either. But Internet Explorer is fine... and is the only way I can get online right now, the only problem is I hate Internet Explorer...
