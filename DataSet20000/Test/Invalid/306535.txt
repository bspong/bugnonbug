Instance: History setting set to 0 days from prefs.

Now as you browse through the web you navigation bar has its left arrow greened
and the dropdown list shows the history.  But the 'Go' menu item does not show
any of these pages there.  So isn't there some inappropriateness? The question
is should the pages be shown in the Go menu?  As it is common practice even if
some one doesn't wish to keep history of web pages visited,it should be kept /
shown as the session is active (until the browser shuts down). 

If multiple tabs are open the Go menu list should also change accordingly?
(displaying the appropriate list for each tab as the use switches to it)
Currenlty it is not so.

Please consider.
