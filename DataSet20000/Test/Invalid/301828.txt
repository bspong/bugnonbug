This unwanted closure of ALL FIREFOX browers happens if I experiece a freeze up
of a single Firefox brower which can be due to an incompatible site or other
unspecified event.  This happens if I have 2 or more Firefox browers open.  And
it happens EVERY time I use Windows Task manager as a last resort to exit &
close the frozen browser.

I am quite sure than this is NOT a result of insufficient RAM as it happens if I
have 2 0r 3 Firefox open or 8 open.

My equipment is SONY VAIO PCV-RX650 - PIII - 1GIG RAM - OS = Windows XP

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open multiple Firefox browers and load different sites on each
2.Open an unfriendly site with an additional Firefox brower.
3.Try to shut down the single frozen Firefox browser using Windows Task Manager,
accessing WTM by pressing CONTROL, ALT, DELETE simultaneously to bring up WTM. 
 Highlight frozen (click on)Firefox browser and click END TASK.

Actual Results:  
All open Firefox browers close everytime.  This never happens when using
Internet Explorer on my hardware.   

Although I no longer use IE, I did go back and open multiple IE Windows and used
WTM to shut down just one brower sucsessfully.   So I don't believe that the
problem is hardware related.  My best guess is the OS interface is causing this
or Firefox is not currently coded to handle the single shut down of a Firefox
brower when more than one are open.

Expected Results:  
Shut down ONLY the single frozen Firefox brower when clicking END Task from
Windows Task Manager and leave the other open Firefox browsers open.

No Error Code or Program Link Code is described at each crash event.   All open
Firefox browers shut down simultaneously within 30 seconds of clicking END Task
from Windows Task Manager.
