Setting the location.href property of an iframe to an internal page in a subfolder on the same site causes an unhandled exception
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3

In Firefox 2.0.0.3, if I set the location.href property of an iframe to a page that is in a subfolder of the website, I get the error:
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x805e000a [nsIDOMLocation.href]" nsresult: "0x805e000a (<unknown>)" location: "JS frame :: (pagename here) :: changeLoc :: line 15" data: no]

However, setting the location.href of the iframe to an external site, such as http://www.google.com, works perfectly.
Also setting the location.href of the iframe to a page in the same also folder works as it should.  It would appear that setting the iframe to a page in a subfolder is the cause of the problem.

I've tried this under Windows Vista and Windows Server 2003, under ASP.NET 1.1, ASP.NET 2.0, and a straight HTML site.

Under Firefox 3.0a4pre, I do not get an unhandled exception, but the location of the iframe does not change.  Instead when I right-click on the page after the code has run, Firefox crashes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an html page with an iframe, src='':
2. Create a subfolder called Test
3. Create a basic html file in the subfolder, called TestPage.htm
4. Create a button on the page with the iframe to call a function
5. In the function, reference the iframe using this method:
frames['iframename'].location.href = './Test/TestPage.htm'
6. Open the page with the iframe in Firefox, click the button and verify that an unhanded exception occurs.
7. Copy the TestPage.htm to the same folder as the page with the iframe
8. Change the code to
frames['iframename'].location.href = 'TestPage.htm'
9. Open the page again in Firefox, click the button and see that the unhandled exception does NOT appear.
Actual Results:  
After step 6, an uncaught exception occurs:
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x805e000a [nsIDOMLocation.href]" nsresult: "0x805e000a (<unknown>)" location: "JS frame :: (pagename here) :: changeLoc :: line 15" data: no]

Expected Results:  
The iframe's location should have changed to ./Test/TestPage.htm
