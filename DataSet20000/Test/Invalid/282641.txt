Bookmarks and folders get deleted randomly.  Here is an e-mail I sent to my
collages who also use FireFox 1.0:

I have a lot of bookmarked sites, and they need to be organized in
folders.  Well, after awhile, i noticed some of my bookmarked Maddox
pages where gone, then more were gone.  Last week I bookmarked 2 new
sites, and put them in their own folder, after 2 days, they were gone.
This pissed me off, so I thought while logging in to my computer, "I
should ask the group about this."  I clicked on my bookmarks and now
about 1/8th of what I used to have bookmarked is gone.  The sites that
remain arn't sites that I frequent, this really pisses me off, for now
I have to try and find all of those lost sites, some of which I loved
to view, such as the Auschwitz photography site.  Has this happened to
anyone else?  What can be done to prevent it?

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start FireFox
2.Click on Bookmarks menu
3.See missing bookmarks

Actual Results:  
I saw that my bookmarks that I have had for about a month were gone.  Also
bookmarks I've had for 2 days were gone.

Expected Results:  
Not deleted my bookmarks randomly.
