Firefox 3 is not compatible with fingerprint readers on "log in" sites. It's predecessor was.

i updated to Firefox 3, and found out quickly that it did not support my fingerprint reader as the older version had. i have a fingerprint reader with the "protector suite" software

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.have a computer equipped with a reader and "protector suite" software
2.go to any site that has a user name and password input dialogue box. i.e. netflix.com 
3. attempt to register your fingerprint or replay registration (in other words, use print in place of user name and password)
Actual Results:  
an error message occurs entitled password bank.  the message reads:
"the window could not be registered for the following reasons:
internet explorer module: this is not an Internet Explorer window
Gecko browser module: this is not a supported browser window
Dialog module: window does not contain controls suitable for registration"

Expected Results:  
when registering a site, a small yellow pop up informs you of it's status in the upper left of the browser.
when replaying a registration (upon a finger swipe) the boarders of the window flash red twice, the boxes are filled automatically and the browser proceeds to enter the information, bringing you to the subsequent page.

the error message says something about internet explorer; however, the software worked with Firefox 2.
