When trying to download a RAR file from a web page presented dialog has extensionless name ("Setup" and the corect is "Setup.rar") and with that name is saved to disk (even if WinRar is instaled).
This starts to ocur i think in 3.5.x versions.
Other browsers works as espected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Go to http://sites.google.com/site/erefhome/datoteke
3. Try to download/save rar file

Presented dialog shows "Setup" to save.

Standard theme is used.
Safe mode has the same problem.
I also tryied firefox-3.6a1pre.en-US.win32 build and it has the same problem.
