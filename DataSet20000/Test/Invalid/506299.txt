Some virus test signatures are not caught

Configuring Firefox 3.5.1 to a proxy server configured with the above listed versions, the eicar.com and eicar.com.txt virus test signatures fail to detect.  The exact same test with other browsers, including Firefox 3.0.10, identifies the signatures.

This occurs with Firefox configured with a proxy server and with the proxy server running in transparent mode.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure for proxy server
2. Browse to http://www.eicar.org/anti_virus_test_file.htm
3. Click on eicar.com or eicar.com.txt via http
Actual Results:  
Virus passes straight through.

Expected Results:  
Proxy server with c-icap and clamav should identify the test signature and block it.

This appears to occur only with Firefox version 3.5.1.  Other versions of Firefox as well as other browsers do not have this problem.
