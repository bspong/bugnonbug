Sign On button does not repond when I type in username & password in pop-up window
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7

If you connect to the above URL, a pop up window will (need to be allowed to)
open.  After selecting 'Sign On' and filling in a userid and password, nothing
happens when you click the second Sign On button that appears.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Allow the pop up window to appear, click on Sign On.
2. In the two fields now displayed, enter an 8-digit ID (any) and any password
3. Click on the Sign On button at the bottom.

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
If you try this on Internet Explorer 6.0, you will get a window saying: "Sign on
details are incorrect, please re-enter".  This should also happen with Firebird.
 If the details were correct, the form should allow you to contine.  Even with a
valid ID/password, nothing happens in the Firebird browser.

The application doesn't crash in the above case, it simply doesn't do anything.
