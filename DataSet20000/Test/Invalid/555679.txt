When running the latest Minefield alpha 4, I noticed that closed tabs don't get listed in Recently closed tabs; that menu always is disabled.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a tab
2. Close the tab
3. Check "Recently closed tabs" menu
Actual Results:  
The menu remains disabled and nothing is added

Expected Results:  
The menu should become enabled and the closed tab's URI should be added
