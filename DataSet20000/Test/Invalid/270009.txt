If you have "New Tab" chosen as the behavior for external links (using the
Tabbed Browsing Preferences extension), opening a bookmark in a second window
opens a new tab in the first window.  It should open a new tab in the current
window.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. set "New Tab" as option for external links in Tabbed Browsing Options
2. start with one window that has multiple tabs open
3. open a second window
4. select a bookmark in this second window

Actual Results:  
new tab for the selected bookmark is created in the first window

Expected Results:  
open a new tab in the current window for the selected bookmark
