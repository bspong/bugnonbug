Just installed FF 2.0 3 days ago and have a problem. When opening up I believe 9 or more tabs the horizontal scroll bar now covers up the tabs almost entirely. Depending on which browser skin you use,and I've tried 3 so far,it either almost completely covers the tabs up or covers more than 3/4 of them up with the scroll bar. It doesn't help to move the scroll bar to the bottom either as the tabs move with it and you get the same problem. Can anybody help me here? Thanks

Reproducible: Always
