Favicons not shown in location bar after disabling 'browser.chrome.site_icons' (changing this pref seems to have no effect)

Disabling 'browser.chrome.site_icons' (set to 'false'), which should only
disable favicons in bookmarks, also disables favicons in the location bar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. set 'browser.chrome.favicons' to 'true' (favicons in location bar should be
enabled)
2. set 'browser.chrome.site_icons' to 'false' (favicons in bookmarks should be
disabled)

Actual Results:  
Favicons are not shown in the location bar.

Expected Results:  
Favicons shuld be diabled in bookmarks, but shown in location bar.

I'm using Preferential 0.5.3 extension and don't know if the description of the
pref (and so my expectation) is correct. However 'browser.chrome.site_icons'
seems to have no effect.
