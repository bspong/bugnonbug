Found an adware installed by Java program called "weather.exe" after I visited a
cracker website.  The "weather.exe" was auto load at Windows startup - i.e. 
registry also penetrated. Norton Antivirus reported following items:
MHTMLRedir.Exploit, BlackBox.class-6a88adec-7d05ef74.class,
Dummy.class-7b3d82c6-22cd3d8b.class, VerifierBug.class-407c3e1c-451c25da.class. 

Reproducible: Didn't try




Hope you can plug this security vulnerability. Potentially, it allows the
cracker to run code of choice on most XP computer.
