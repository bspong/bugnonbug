Error -12263 when accessing URL listed in HOSTS file

I use a HOSTS file to filter out ad servers, etc.  When I go to a page (adwords.google.com is the latest) that pulls something from one of the URLs listed in my HOSTS file, I get an error box with the error -12263.  Sometimes, but not always, when I go directly to one of the listed URLs, I also get this error.  Sometimes it just goes to a 404 error page.  This -12263 error message may be a valid error but it is annoying to keep getting this screen.
