When viewing the "What links here" page for the English Wikipedia article about neppis, and clicking on the "CinemaLog" link, FireFox doesn't just quit, it somehow logs the entire Linux session out. I have to log back in and restart FireFox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the English Wikipedia article about neppis.
2. Click "What links here".
3. Click on the CinemaLog link.
Actual Results:  
The entire Linux session is logged out.

Expected Results:  
FireFox should have displayed the Wikipedia page as normal.
