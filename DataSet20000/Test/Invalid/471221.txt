I have been baffled by search responses that lead to irrelevant data. When searching for a topic the response topic are correct but the search link lead to unrelated subjects.
For example I searched for T Boone Pickens. The first response reads:

T. Boone Pickens - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

www.couponmountain.com - 117k - Cached - Similar pages

couponmountain.com has nothing to do with the subject.

Other response sites include -
www.toseeka.com
freescan.antivirus.com/
online-antivirus.com
teens-searcher.com 
www.maxim.com/girls

If a search engine can be modified to provide erroneous data it can be very dangerous for the user.

Are there any hints on how to combat this problem?
