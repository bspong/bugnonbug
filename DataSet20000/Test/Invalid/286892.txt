Keyboard shortcut conflict with KDE (K Desktop Environment): Ctrl+Tab

There is a keyboard shortcut conflict between KDE and Mozilla Firefox when
typing Ctrl+Tab. In KDE, Ctrl+Tab walks through the desktop list while in
Mozilla Firefox Ctrl+Tab walks through tabs. When Mozilla Firefox is run under
KDE, the KDE action takes precedence (desktops are changed, but Firefox tabs are
not).

I have filed this bug with KDE eariler, but it seems unlikely that KDE
developers will change the Ctrl+Tab default action. (Please see
http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101932)

A workarond is to use Ctrl+PageUp and Ctrl+PageDown to walk through Firefox tabs
when using KDE. However, it is likely that Winodws/GNOME users who regularly use
Ctrl+Tab to walk through tabs will be confused when the same command has
different effects in KDE. 

I'm not sure what is the best way around this is. Perhaps Firefox should
encourage the use of Ctrl+PageUp and Ctrl+PageDown in all its documentation
and/or eventually do away with Ctrl+Tab in order to ease the transition of
Windows Firefox users to KDE.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox in KDE
2.Open up multiple tabs
3.Try to use Ctrl+Tab to walk through the Firefox tabs

Actual Results:  
The user will walk through KDE desktops.

Expected Results:  
The user should walk through Firefox tabs.
