If I open www.webshots.com all images are properly displayed, yet if I open
www.webshots.com/g/ none of the images are displayed. The bug is not unique to
this page, I can also see it at http://www.theanimalrescuesite.com. I have not
looked for it elsewhere. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.type in the URL
2.hit "enter"
3.

Actual Results:  
The page opens without the graphic images

Expected Results:  
graphics should display

If I perform the same steps with Beonex 0.8.2, Netscape 7.1, Mozilla 1.4, Opera
7.01, or IE 6.0 the graphics all display properly. When I have the page open
with Firebird, if I right click on the blank area where the image should be and
choose "view image" the image is displayed in a new window. I thought that
possible I was missing a needed plug-in so I copied and pasted all the plug-ins
from Mozilla 1.4 to Firebird with no changes resulting.
