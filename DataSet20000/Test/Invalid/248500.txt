problem with handling webpages with .jhtm file extension. Sometimes causes browser to freeze, often attempts to download
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040615 Firefox/0.9

Our company renders webpages using XMLC/Barracuda MVC. Output files are in .jhtm
format. Latest Firefox (.9) will not attempt to render those pages as web-pages,
but assumes a type BIN format and loads the File Download dialog when accessing
in https. Sometimes will cause entire browser to hang (usually when accessing
over ssl) and we must xkill.

Oddly you can save an html file to disk, rename the extension, and then Open the
file and rendering will perform as expected. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a website with .jhtm extension
2. Hit the site in Firefox and witness attempted download
3. Cannot select "Open with"
4. Must "Save to Disk"

Actual Results:  
Download Dialog appears saying:
welcome.jhtm
which is a: BIN file


Expected Results:  
Page should render as any other typical HTML page.
