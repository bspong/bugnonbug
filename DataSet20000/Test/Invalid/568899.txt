Closing Firefox problem
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3
Build Identifier: Firefox/3.6.3

The firefox.exe (or firefox.exe *32) process will fail to end when the browser is closed. It then will bring up a window stating that there can't be more than one instance of the process at a time. The user then either has to reboot or end the process through the task manager. It happens at seemingly random times and more often with one of our client's computer more often than our own. Our systems are 64 bit and our client's is a 32 bit operating system. There haven't been any complaints from our other customers. Could this be related to the recent Java update?

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open and close Mozilla over and over again until the it won't allow Mozilla to open again. 

Actual Results:  
If you open multiple browsers with Mozilla when the computer is first booting up and then close them before they get a chance to completely load it seems to happen more often. 

Expected Results:  
Many times it works fine. Sometimes it fails to close the process completely and then you can't open the browser until the user closes the process manually through the task manager or they restart their computer

It should always close the firefox.exe process on the computer when it shuts down. There were no themes installed on the computers when these problems happened. Although a Java update had recently been installed and on the client's computer there were multiple toolbars installed: Yahoo!, Limewire, and the AVG toolbar.
