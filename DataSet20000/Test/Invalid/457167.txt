URL doesn't show when Firefox starts with certain add-ons enabled.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.2) Gecko/2008091620 Firefox/3.0.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.2) Gecko/2008091620 Firefox/3.0.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

This seems only to occur with the three following add-ons installed and enabled (as best of my knowledge and testing):

DragNDrop Toolbars 0.0.0.7
StumbleUpon 3.27 (Beta)
Ubiquity 0.1.1

What happens is: When Firefox is started, the URL bar is empty regardless if it's a new session (while showing my home page) or if it has restarted (for example, after installing an add-on) while showing whatever page I was on previously. I am unsure which add-on(s) particularly causes this to occur in relation to the other(s) or if the combination of the three triggers a Firefox bug, so I assumed this would be the best place to report this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install said add-ons.
2. Restart Firefox.
Actual Results:  
Nothing shows in the URL bar.

Expected Results:  
The URL of the page I start with should appear in the URL bar.
