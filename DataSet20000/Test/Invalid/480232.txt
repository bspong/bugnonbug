User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011913 Firefox/3.0.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

If you click on links on a site that is in a protected tab the links should open in a new tab even if they don't normally. This way you can't go away from the site you wanted to keep by protecting the tab by accident when you click on a link.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open site A
2. Protect the tab
3. Site A has a link to site B
4. Click the link to site B

Actual Results:  
Site A is gone = the protecting of the tab was useless

Expected Results:  
Site B opens in a new tab, site A is still there.
