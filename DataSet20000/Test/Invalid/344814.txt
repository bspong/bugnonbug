Scrolling immediately after opening a new unfocused tab (with middle-clicking) affects the scroll position of the new tab, even though it was never focused.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ensure prefs are set so that middle-clicking a link opens it in a new unfocused tab in the same window
2. Middle-click on a link
3. Use scroll wheel to scroll down (or up)
4. Stop scrolling and go to the new tab (which has never had focus)
5. Observe scrollbar position
Actual Results:  
scroll position of new tab is affected (not at the default/top)

Expected Results:  
scroll position of new tab should be unaffected (at the top, usually), because it was never focused at any point
