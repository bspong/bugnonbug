Gents,

This omission seems purposeful. How can the en-us dictionary not be installed in the product by default? I noticed words like "favorite" coming up as mistakes, because it is a spelling error in en-NZ the default. I tried to switch but could not find it, and had to install an add on? I cannot believe that an enormous and #1 market could be ignored in favor of these smaller ones? 

It should be in the product and the default if I choose English.

Reproducible: Always
