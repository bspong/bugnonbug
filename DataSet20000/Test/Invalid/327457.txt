Star button not on default toolbars
Since the Star and Feed buttons became customizable (by bug 322989 ?), they do not appear on the default toolbar setup of a new profile (nor on existing profiles but that's less surprising) and must be added manually.

A related issue is that in the Customize Toolbars UI, the Star and Feed items have no icons (but they do appear when dragged to a toolbar).
