When I want to see a picture, or there is a picture there, I have to
Right-Click, and select View Picture to see the pictures, and it even sometimes
will not let me see any thumbnails also.  

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get on Mozilla Firefox
2. Goto any webpage that has pictures on it, like .gif files
3. When it loads, the picture will not show... But, it might on some pictures..

Actual Results:  
Shows some pictures, some pictures don't show...

Expected Results:  
Show all pictures, without relying on Right-clicking and View Picture, unless
there is a file-type that Mozilla Firefox does not reconize.

Other programs Browsers like Netscape load almost all the pictures with no problem.
