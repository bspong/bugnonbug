Lenovo X61 running 32 bit Vista, long time Firefox user, freshly installed 4.x beta. Has never worked at all. Hangs on startup. Tried many times. Not responsive to any input. When killed, is still actually running until killed from Task manager. Went back to using 3.6.x.

2. The window shows, up, but the browser never stops spinning the circle on the first tab, and never accepts any input.
3.
Actual Results:  
The window shows, up, but the browser never stops spinning the circle on the first tab, and never accepts any input.
