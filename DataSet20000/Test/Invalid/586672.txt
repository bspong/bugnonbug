nothing appears on bookmarks toolbar!!! bookmarks toolbar is enabled in firefox(orange button)> customize> bookmarks toolbar i first noticed this in firefox 4 b1 when i added a button beside the home button and then removed it and clicked done. all my bookmarks are now gone theres is an empty space where they should be. in Fx 4 b1 i noticed that as i was browsing, i looked up and saw that my bookmarks were on the toolbar. when i closed fx 4 b1 and opened it again after some time they were gone again! this happened about two times. then when i went to fx 4 b2 the problem was still not resolved. now in fx 4 b3 the problem is still there and it makes using fx very hard.
