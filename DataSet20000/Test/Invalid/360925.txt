The exit window (in the example opens when leaving the site) with some banners linked with target=_blank - they should usually open in a new (full / normal) window and not in the advertising window of the banners like links with target=_self.


A lot of links worldwide with settings resizable=no and scrollbars=no (fixed window size) now have these problems ...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
In this case it was necessary to set the window resizable=yes and scrollbars=yes to reduduce the effect and give visitors the chance to visit the sites.

Actual Results:  
Window is resizable by users - but only those, who know about how to do it.

Expected Results:  
The browser should easily 
1. create a new tab 
2. - or overwrite the active one, (but not the external advertising window )
3. - or open a second complete browser
