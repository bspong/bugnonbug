FF crashes when righthand mouse button is pressed after highlighting text with mouse

Crash caused by using the Compaq optical mouse to select (highlight) text to be
copied (from a web page), then pressing the righthand mouse button by mistake,
i.e., instead of pressing the lefthand mouse button to end the selection
process.  Several running applications were apparently not affected by the FF
crash.  However, FF would not run again, until I rebooted Windows XP.  There was
nothing produced by the Quality Agent, nor did Windows XP report any errors or
"events".  (This is possibly similar or related to Bug #294159)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use the mouse to select text that is on a web page.
2.Press the righthand mouse button (instead of the left one) to stop selecting
the text.
3.

Actual Results:  
FF disappeared from the display monitor screen and from the Windows task bar. 
There were no error messages or dialogs displayed either by FF or by Windows. 
FF would not reload (re-execute) until I rebooted Windows XP.

Expected Results:  
Pressing the "wrong" mouse button is such a common error that, in this case,
NOTHING should have happened -- unless someone wants to code an error message
informing the user that pressing the righthand mouse button doesn't do anything
(in the context).

Nothing was reported to disclose the module in which the software crashed.  I
was running the default theme.  I have installed a lot of extensions, but none
that I suspect would cause this malfunction.  (It just looks to me as though the
coder forgot that someone could press the righthand button instead of the left
one to end text selection with the mouse.)
