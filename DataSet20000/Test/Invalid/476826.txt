Those was the four that updated when I loaded up Firefox.
My URL bar no longer shows the URL when I load a page, even the back buttons/forward buttons are disabled.
Statusable (bottom 2nd status bar) no longer works
Tab Mix Plus messed up options not acting right. 
New tab button on Toolbar opens blank pages when I have open Google
