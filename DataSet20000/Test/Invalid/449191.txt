browser crashes on mouse button-wheel combo
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1

When I press and hold the right mouse button and then turn the mouse wheel, the browser window collapses and firefox is completely disabled. When I end the session in the task manager, I am asked whether I want to restore the session (tabs) on the next startup of firefox. However, when I choose this option, firefox opens with a blank page, and none of the tabs restored.
Unfortunately, this can happen accidentaly quite easily...
