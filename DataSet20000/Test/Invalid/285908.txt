my code is the problem
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: 

When this page is displayed in firefox as apposed to IE the slideshow images 
do not appear.

I APPOLOGISE for useing this form if incorrect but I have been looking for the 
correct avenue for days. And did not find it in the FAQ's

I am the developer for this page and would deeply appreciate the fix so I may 
help keep your users happy with the sites I produce


Thanks Sincerely
