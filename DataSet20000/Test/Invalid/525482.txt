"Never remember history" mode displays text to "stop" private browsing
If you set the history preference to "never remember history" or "custom settings", the text for private browsing option will gray out and say "Stop Private Browsing".   Graying out is fine, but it shouldn't say "Stop", as it never started PB mode anyway.  

See screenshot

Repro:
1) install Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2b1) Gecko/20091029 Firefox/3.6b1
2) open tools > options > privacy > and select the history dropdown to "never remember" or "custom"
3) save and open Tools menu
4) Verify the grayed out text says "Stop private browsing"

Expected:
- dont say "Stop".  it was never started.
