Currently the tabs in the browser are pretty productive but the tabs themselves
are very static. It is useful to ring up a lot of URLs in different tabs. But
after opening several tabs the only way to view the information in them is to
click around a lot. 

It will be good if the TABs can be organzied within the browser window just like
the windows can be organized on the desktop. Some of the enhancements that will
be useful are:

o make tabs rearrangeable with drag and drop(see bug 282404 )
o Make tabs moveable between different browser windows through drag and drop
o Allow for multi select of different tabs and do a group action on them like:
Close or Open in New Window for them
o Allow a options like: Tile Tabs Horizontally, Tile Tabs Vertically, Cascade
Tabs, etc. So that after open the tabs we can view the info in them in a single
window instead of clicking around.
