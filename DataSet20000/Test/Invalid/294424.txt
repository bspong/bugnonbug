Spyware called "PeopleOnPage.AproposMedia" repeatedly installs itself on my system

See above.  I'm not a computer genius, so I don't know what more to say.  I have
spyware detector software that repeatedly (i.e., almost daily)finds this spyware
has been installed -- and supposedly, according to the detector, it's a
"critical problem."  If you have some specific questions, I'll be happy to try
to answer.  thanks.
