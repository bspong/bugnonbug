I've put an exmaple page up at http://jasontamez.com/link_error.html

The first sentence should have a link in it, but Firebird won't show it. But if
you select the text and copy it, the link text gets copied.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make an HTML page with "?click" in the href of an anchor.
2. Try to display it.
Actual Results:  
The links become hidden.

Expected Results:  
The link should have been displayed.
