If you go to the test example I made (http://www.cs.umd.edu/~farrell/bug.html),
when you click on the + it will display some hidden text but SHOULD replace the
+ with a -.  Internet Explorer (YUCK!!) handles this same page the way I'm
expecting it to.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.cs.umd.edu/~farrell/bug.html
2. Click on the '+' image
3. Observe that the image doesn't change to a '-' as it should.

Actual Results:  
The '+' image remained.

Expected Results:  
The image should've changed to the '-'.
