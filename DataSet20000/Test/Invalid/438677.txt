In Firefox 2, clearing the history was simple - use the Clear Now button in Privacy options.  Firefox 3 doesn't clear out the history.  I have also tried this running FireFox 3 as Administrator with the same results: History is not cleared.

This also can be considered a security issue as well since clearing the history prevents people from seeing where you have been.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open Firefox 3 RC2
2.  Visit multiple websites
3.  View history via arrow on right side of address bar
4.  Clear history via Tools->Options->Privacy->"Clear Now" button
5.  Click on arrow on right side of address bar
Actual Results:  
History is not deleted as it should be. This history is persistent between invocations of Firefox 3. 

Expected Results:  
History is cleared.  This functionality can be seen in Firefox 2.

A side issue to this is that "Always clear my private data when Firefox closes" in Privacy doesn't work either. As said before, this could be construed as a security issue as well.

I have no extensions installed and I am using the default theme.
