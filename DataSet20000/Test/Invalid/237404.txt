Clicking the maximize button on the title bar does not fully maximize the window
on a widescreen display (I'm running a powerbook G4 15 inch).  It looks like
it's maximizing to the normal aspect ratio instead. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click the maximize button in the title bar (the green one with the plus)
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Firefox expanded to 100% of the vertical area, but only about 80-90% of the
horizontal area

Expected Results:  
expand to 100% of the vertical and horizonatl area

Using View->full screen from the application menu does, however, make firefox
take up the full screen.
