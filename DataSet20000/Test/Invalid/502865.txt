I have a table with four lines (TR) and the first line have a SELECT field. When the user changes the selected option of the SELECT field a javascript function is called.
This function  changes the style.display property of the other three lines between "block" (or inline, I tested both) and "none". If I change the selected option to hide and then show again the lines, the table is incorrectly draw after the lines are shown.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.In javascript, grab a reference to a TR field using getElementById
2.Assuming the reference variable is called "ref", call ref.style.display="none"
3.Now call ref.style.display="block" or ref.style.display="inline"
Actual Results:  
The table is drawn incorrectly, if misaligned cells.

Expected Results:  
The table should be drawn with all the cells aligned.

Attached is a small HTML file that can be used to test the problem.
