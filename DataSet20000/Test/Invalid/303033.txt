When searching for [Mi mamá], without brackets, using the toolbar search it
works correctly for Google but not for AltaVista.  When the Google search
results come up Google shows the sames hits it comes up with when I type the
query in a fresh Google page.  However for AltaVista the results are different.
 When I do it from the toolbar search function, I get the hits for [Mi mam]. 
That is, it ignores my accentuated "a".  A similar difference occurs with the
query [“this ain’t your mama’s”].  Note that the quotes and apostrophy used here
are not the keyboard " and '.  Rather, they are the ones generated by Microsoft
Word.  So for this query Google comes up with its normal results as if I copy
and pasted them into the Google page's query box, while AltaVista gives me the
result that it would if I typed [?this ain?t your mama?s?].  That is, the
special characters are replaced with question marks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In the toolbar search box type [Mi mamá], without the brackets and with an
accent on the last "a".
2. With the focus still in the query box, press ENTER.


Actual Results:  
AltaVista shows the results for the search [Mi mam]

Expected Results:  
AltaVista should have shown the results for the search [Mi mamá].  The Google
toolbar search does it correctly.

I suspect many of the toolbar search widgamagits have similar problems with
non-ASCII characters.
