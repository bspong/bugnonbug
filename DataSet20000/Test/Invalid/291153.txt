Computer locks up, cannot use keyboard or mouse, happens on various web pages. I
have the updated driver for my video adapter, only happens when running firefox.
I don't think the web page I go to makes any difference because it happens on a
variety of sites. I am running an IBM A22e laptop with 384Mb of ram with Windows
XP. Occurs at random cannot reproduce happen about 20 times in the last four months.
