After update 1.5.0.4 to 1.5.0.5 only get connection errors. "Problem loading page / Unable to connect"

This is NOT a firewall problem as I disabled it completely (stopped the service).

Reproducible: Always

1.Try any URL
2.
3.

Actual Results:

If I reinstall ANY previous version it works correctly.

Starting in "safe mode" dos not help any. 

I will post any data required to resolve this issue.
