For no apparent reason, only when doing middle-clicks, an about 1 cm wide grey stripe appears above the menu bar. Restarting the application will remove it, but it comes back any time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Search on Google
2. Open links with middle-click
3. Switch to the opeed tabs

Actual Results:  
The grey stripe comes above the menus

Expected Results:  
No grey stripe

It happens while using Aquatint and Noia 2.0 Extreme themes. I haven't tried it with the default theme.
