Hi,  I'm Jeff Relf, My web page is:  Cotse.NET/users/jeffrelf

After _Any_ .HTML file is loaded in FireFox, be it from my disk or the web, 
I can no longer copy anything to the clipboard or drag-and-drop anything, ever.

It happens everytime for me, exactly the same way.

It doesn't matter what I try to copy to the clipboard, FireFox won't do it.
Ctrl-C, Cntrl_Insert, and Right_Click_Copy all fail,
the clipboard remains unchanged.

My system must be different, but I don't know how.
I have MicroSoft Office, WiFi reception, CuteFTP_Pro and Visual_Studio_2005.

Mozilla's nightly does _Not_ have this problem, only FireFox.
Drag-and-drop and copying to the clipboard works for all other programs.

I've tried FireFox 1.0, 1.5, 1.5.0.2, 2.Alpha and 3.Nightly,
always in -safe-mode and with a clean profile.

I use Win_XP_Pro_SP2_Updated, 
and tried XP's Safe_Mode and a reinstallation of XP.

I don't recall doing anything special when this bug first appeared,
I was just browsing WikiPedia.ORG.

I've checked most bug reports that had the word clipboard
or drag/drop in them.

I've Googled for two days now, looking for answers,
and haven't found any solutions.

The latest SpyBot, with the latest updates, says I'm clean.
MicroSoft_Word's smart clipboard is turned off,
all it's extended clipboard functionality is turned off.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Be unfortunate enough to have my system, I imagine.
2. Open any version of FireFox with about:blank as the homepage.
3. Notice that you can copy to the clipboard and drag-and-drop stuff.
4. Open any .HTML page, either from your disk or the web.
5. Notice that you can no longer copy anything to the clipboard 
   by any methoud, or drag-and-drop anything.
6. Notice that you can copy to the clipboard 
   and drag and drop in Mozilla and all other apps.
Actual Results:  
FireFox couldn't alter the clipboard or drag anything.

Expected Results:  
FireFox can alter the clipboard and drag stuff.

Only workaround is to open page in Internet_Explorer.
