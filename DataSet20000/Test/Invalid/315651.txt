When chatting in Gay.com and you decide to send a private message to someone in a chat room, Firefox will freeze if that person has logged out of gay.com. This happens EVERY time, with no exception. The only way out is to force quit the program and relaunch Firefox. It is frustrating because someone may log off while you are in the process if sending a message and you don't always seem their name disappear from the room list and...you send and Firefox freezes.
