I don't know about other people, but I installed FireFox to get AWAY from having to use Internet Explorer, having an updated version installed to use FireFox correctly (i.e. allow me to download EXE files again), is surely exactly the opposite of the point of FireFox.

I tried the about:config method and that option wasn't even there.  I know it can be done via the registry, but as you note there that can be very dangerous and requiring the average user to go hacking about in there is not the best idea at all - and about:config, if it works, is almost as bad.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get FireFox (I'm on 3.0.15)
2. Don't get IE7
3. Download an EXE
Actual Results:  
Downloads are blocked.

Expected Results:  
Download.

I've put this as "A major feature is broken", I don't know about you but I consider downloading things a major feature of all browsers, and I consider replacing IE on Windows a major feature of FF.
