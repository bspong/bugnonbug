Going from 2006-06-22-04-trunk to 2006-06-29-04-trunk, two whole (LARGE) subtrees of my bookmarks vanished into the aether.  Previously, I have observed individual bookmarks vanishing but I haven't trusted my memory enough to be sure -- and I blamed my wife, anyway.  This time I'm sure it is neither my wife nor my own failing memory.

Because the new "Places" sqlite implementation is in its infancy, I'm expecting recovery to fall somewhere between horrible and impossible.

Reproducible: Always
