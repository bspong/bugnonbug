I don't really think this report is to give anybody anything, since I don't have
any idea on a) how to reproduce the problem or b) if it's caused by an
extension. However, since it's happened on several different Windows-machines
(both Windows 2000 and XP, XP is English and 2k to my believe Finnish), I
decided to report it. So, Firefox first works just normally. Then, after an
restart of _Firefox_ (not the computer), it stops updating the screen. It askes
the Software Security Device's password just as normally, but after the main
window has opened, it stops refreshing the screen. However when I click on some
of the toolbars, the menu pops up just like normal. Also, when I press ctrl+t it
opens new tabs. They don't show on the screen, but when I'm closing Firefox, it
askes if I really want to close all those [x] tabs, and the number in- and
decreses just as expected with ctrl+t and ctrl+f4. There's at least one common
extension, Adblock, naturally an English version. So in fact the guilty piece of
software could also be Adblock... The problem does disappear when I install the
same version of Firefox on the old install.
