Week ago I found out strange behavior in my Altap Salamander 2.5 ( http://www.altap.cz/download.html#sal25 ) - most of the commands stopped working, freezing system until I hit ctrl+alt+del - in addition, this combination worked only after some time, like 30 secs. That unfreezed Salamander and task was completed without problem. I was investigating this for some time and found out that uninstalling Firefox 2 stopped this behavior. After some experiments I found out there is strange process named firefox.exe, with very low memory consumtion (1-3 MB RAM and 3-5 MB virtual memory) but with 100% CPU usage. When I killed the process, it was back running in half a minute. I noticed there is a process named msmsrs.exe that started few seconds before this strange firefox.exe popped in and it ends as soon as strange firefox.exe is started. Registry scan revealed only one connection to msmsrs.exe - c:\program files\drivers\msmsrs.exe . When I killed strange firefox.exe again, I moved msmrsr.exe to another directory and deleted its registry values (msmsrs was constantly adding this registry again when it was left intact and in original directory). It seems thats all I needed to do to get my computer cleared again. As I am not the only one using my PC, I was unable to find out where this infection came from.

I found out this behavior:
1) After execution, this program coppies itself into c:\program files\drivers dir.
2) It adds itself into registry, registry values included in zip file.
3) It uses Firefox to secretly connect to internet (most probably IP 89.53.39.44), clearly to avoid firewall detection.
4) Task manager reports this program (or, firefox.exe that is started by this program) uses 100% of CPU.
5) When registry values are deleted, it adds them again.
6) If this program or firefox.exe is killed, it runs itself again in half a minute (aproximately).
7) c:\program files\drivers contained only two files - msmsrs.exe and klog.dat (sounds like keylogger, which, of course, can be quite dangereous). I am not adding this klog.dat file because I don't know what it contains and I fear it can contain private informations - if it will be needed for you to analyze this program, I will concider adding it on your demand.

I don't know what this program really does, but it clearly has dangerous behavior typical for spyware/malware - unfortunately my BitDefender Plus antivirus did not noticed it and its firewall was worthless because msmsrs.exe used Firefox to connect.

Hope it helps. I sent copy of this report to SOFTWIN company (creators of BitDefender) for their analysis as well.

P.S.: I don't see a way to include file in this bug report, as this is critical part of my bug report, I would like to be informed how to add it, if possible, via email or ICQ 299505018.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run msmsrs.exe (warning - dangerous software!!!)
2. Notice second firefox.exe process in task manager.
3.
