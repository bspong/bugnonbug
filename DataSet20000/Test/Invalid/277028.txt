Undo Close Tab is unintuitive and dangerous. It doesn't belong in the context
menu for a tab, or anywhere else for that matter. The time saved by the menu
option is in my experience not worth the frustration caused by hitting it
accidentally all the time. The lack of an easy way to undo this compounds the
problem, but that's a separate bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Decide that a particular unfocussed tab in unimportant.
2. Rather than clicking it and then hitting the X button on the tab bar, use the
handy "close tab" context menu item.
3. Miss by three pixels and hit "close other tabs" by mistake.

Actual Results:  
All of my other tabs (i.e. the ones I was actually interested in) close.

Expected Results:  
Not closed all the wrong tabs. (in an ideal world I might have accidentally hit
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=254021">Close Other
Tab</a> but that's currently still broken.)
