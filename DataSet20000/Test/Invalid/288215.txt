browser windows jiggle constantly with "feed me links" plug-in loaded

After I loaded the "feed me links" plug in, whether the toolbar was enabled or
not, anytime I would open a new browser window, or go to a different web site,
everything in the window under the toolbar would jiggle up and down annoyingly.
Once I figured out how to disable the program (not just uncheck the toolbar)
"feed me links", the problem disappeared.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download "feed me links" plugin
2.Open Firefox browser
3.Go to a website

Actual Results:  
window jiggles

Expected Results:  
the screen shouldn't act like its going through DTs

this problem occured with 3 different themes that I tried, and with every
combination of toolbars chosen, until I uninstalled feed me links.
