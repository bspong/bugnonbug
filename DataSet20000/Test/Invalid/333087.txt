I often leave my computer on all day, and after a few hours of being open, Firefox will be using as much as 150MB of my system RAM, with about 5 tabs open. I leave my computer on standby and dont close Firefox for as much as 3 or 4 days sometimes. By this time, I recieve a "Virtual Memory Too Low" error from Windows. Closing firefox fixes the problem. A side affect of using so much RAM is that the computer has to resort to storing temp. files on the hard drive, which is unacceptably slow. Please fix this problem!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox
2. Don't shut off computer or Firefox for extended periods of time
3. Watch your computer slow to a crawl

Actual Results:  
My computer slowed down. Alot. And Firefox was using an ungodly amount of RAM. Right now, after 3 hours, it is using 90MB, which is just too much.

Expected Results:  
It should... not use so much?
