The secure account pages of one of my banks occasionally show wrong account balances and wrong currencies. In my secure YAHOO/Overture account I occasionally see account information of other accounts. This only happens in Firefox. After updating to Version 1.5 the problem persists. I do have screenshots of the described problems.

Reproducible: Sometimes
