If a modal window is opened by using the DOM:window.open 
window.open('dialog.html','_blank','modal=yes')
it behaves like a normal window - a user is allowed to switch focus and return to the main window and can do anything in there (in the main/parent window).

According to your documentation (http://developer.mozilla.org/pl/docs/DOM:window.open#Window_functionality_features) if the "modal attribute is set to yes, the new window is said to be modal and the user cannot return to the main window until the modal window is closed".
Apart of that, by the definition, a modal window should not be allowed to lose focus and only a modeless window is allowed to lose focus.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a window using window.open specifying the modal=yes attribute.
2.Click on the parent window.
3.Do whatever you want in the parent window.

Actual Results:  
The modal window loses focus and the user can return to the main window despite the modal window is not closed.

Expected Results:  
The modal window should not lose focus so the user cannot return to the main window until the modal window is closed.
A modal window should behave like one created by the alert() function. A window created by the alert() function doesn't lose its focus.

Probably it happens on each of Windows version - on Windows 2000 for sure.
