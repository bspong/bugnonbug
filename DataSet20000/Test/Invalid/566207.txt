Download Nero 10 trial completes with corrupt file as verified with summermd5 and nero's checksum verification tool.  Repeated downloads of same file also fail check-sum test.  MD5Summer creates unique check-sum for each file downloaded and will create the same for a given file.

Reproduced on three separate PCs: one 7 and two XP machines.

Downloading same file with MS Internet explorer succeeds with check-sum test 

Download rate is DSL speed, about 1.5 Mbit/sec

Corrupt files check slower than clean files.  Also creating new check sums on corrupt files is slower.

Tested on a mix of Intel and AMD hardware, new and old, same results.
