The text is offset right out of the box.  Totally unusable.

This does not happen in IE, Chrome or Opera.  I am told that it does not happen on v3.5 or MacFF 3.6.  It did happen with v3.6

I can send a picture if needed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to page
2.click on small clock/calendar button next to "2010"
3.observe offset
