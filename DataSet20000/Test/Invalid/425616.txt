.jpg files are showing up but .JPG files are not.

When trying to add pictures and the file browser box appears only pictures that have the extension .jpg appear; any picture with .JPG does not. Renaming a file from orig.JPG to orig.jpg then causes it to appear. I have tried to modify chrome://global/locale/filepicker.properties line 10 to read imageFilter=*.JPG; *.jpg; *.jpeg; *.gif; *.png; *.bmp; *.xbm; *.ico but this did not fix the problem. I feel that since in Linux .jpg != .JPG this is what is causing the problem. But, I do not know enough about firefox to fix this issue. Please help.

Thanks,
Michael Sounhein
