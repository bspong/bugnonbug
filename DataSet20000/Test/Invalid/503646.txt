In the previous version of firefox, the transparent handling for flash showed no problems, default flash components like ComboBox and showing flash fullscreen worked.

A example of the combo problem is show here:

If your remove the wmode or set it to window it works correct again, see:

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the page 
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
The page with the flash is show, but the combobox component in the flash are missing when the wmode is set to transparent.

Expected Results:  
Show the combobox in flash in wmode transparent, and if chosen the flash fullscreen mode should be supported in wmode transparent

this worked properly in the previous version of firefox
