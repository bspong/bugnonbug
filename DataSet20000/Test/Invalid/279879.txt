When you apply a 1px border to a DIV layer that has a specific size, Firefox
renders the border on the OUTSIDE of the DIV.

For example, the following CSS actually generates a 102px box

theLayer {
	width: 100px;
	border: 1px solid #999999;
}

On Opera and IE, it displays properly. If this is an issue of one or the other
browser not properly adhering to standards, please let me know how I can
compensate such that all browsers will display the layer equally.
