Initially firefox 1.5 starts with 24Megs (appox), but as tabs are opened memory utilization keeps on increasing (which is normal). But EVEN after CLOSING all tabs the memory utilization does not drop (may be drops by 2-3 megs). 
Over the course of a day Firefox 1.5 is consuming around 178 megs of memory with only one tab.
Closing the browser does not kill the process neither dies memory utilization reduce. May be I'm not that patient but after a minute or two I usually go in task manager and kill the process manually and then restart FF.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run FF 1.5 --check the memory utilization in the task manger (I'll suggest keep it open with 'always on top')
2. Open a new tab (or a few new tabs), keep browsing as usual. Close the tabs once done 
3. Memory Utilization nearly stays the same as when all tabs were open. Usually after a couple of hours it consumes  more than 150 MB of RAM

Actual Results:  
started with 24 megs, at the time filing this bug (as I opened a few tabs ) now the memory utilization with only two tabs is 56888K (actual utilization)

Expected Results:  
Memory utilization should drop once tabs are closed
