the new preferences window (prefwindow v) has some ui glitches:
* header list for the 'tabs' entry has too many icons making the tab wider than
the rest
* when setting some preferences, like the 'select new tabs opened from links'
button has the opposite affect (the button is checked and they are not selected
on click, when un-checked, they are selected) - this may be more wide sweeping -
it appears as though i get more pop-ups with this build, even though i have it
set to block them
* the effect of changing between elements is horrendously slow
* the pref window has the close button disabled (command-w will close it though)
* are the tabs within elements supposed to look like the old seamonkey tabs?

see the attached screenshot for the look of the window (have tried with fresh
and older profiles, same effect)
