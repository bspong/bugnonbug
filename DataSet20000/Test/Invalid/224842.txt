I have a rather large list of bookmarks (75 or more).  When I use the Extension
Bookmark Links Checker 0.5.2 it appears that it only attempts to update the 1st
25 bookmarks then stops.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select Bookmarks
2. Select Manage Bookmarks
3. Select Check

Actual Results:  
The 1st 25 bookmarks were checked and updated where applicable.  Starting at
bookmark #26 and upward, no checking was attempted.  

Expected Results:  
Continued to check the remainder of the bookmark folder.
