I'm a developer. I'w trying to put a link in a page which will close the 
window. So i used self.close(). But its not closing the window and putting a 
message "Scripts may not close windows that were not opened by script." in 
JavaScript Console. Even i used window.close() and got the same . Same thing is 
working perfectly fine in Internet Explorer.

Reproducible: Always
