When I open flash videos, like youtube with firefox, my entire computer freezes.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 (BT-lookingforgroup) Firefox/3.6.8 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

So. I'm not sure how reproduceable this is outside my computer, but as of two updates ago, my computer started freezing any time an ad or video that used flash tried to open. My brother uninstalled and reinstalled flash and things were better, and then firefox updated yesterday, and the problem is back. A google search showed a number of other people having issues with flash now, and I just want to know why the program's interactions with flash were changed so that it causes my laptop to crash, and if there's a permanent way to fix this, or if I'll just have to stop updating firefox altogether.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any video on youtube, or a website with a flash ad.

3. Have to manually shut down my computer.

Expected Results:
