unquoted font-family names or fragments starting with digits break parsing

A font name starting with a digit, like “1font”, will cause the entire font-family declaration to be discarded with the error “Error in parsing value for property 'font-family'. Declaration dropped”.  A font name with a digit after a space, like “MPH 2B Damase” also prepends “Expected end of value for property but found '2B'.”  

In either case, quoting the font-family works around the problem.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a XHTML 1.0 web page which includes the CSS declarations “.foo { font-family: 1font, monospace; } .bar { font-family: MPH 2B Damase, serif; }”
2. load the page in Firefox

Actual Results:  
1. check the error console: 2 messages are generated
2. check the page rendering, the fallback fonts are not applied to the elements either

Expected Results:  
The fake font name “1font” should be ignored and the fallback “monospace” applied.  The real font “MPH 2B Damase” should be applied if present, otherwise the fallback “serif”.
