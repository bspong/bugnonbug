Useragent declaring non-existent browser!
User-Agent:       Opera/8.50 (Windows NT 5.1; U; en)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

The latest version of the Mozilla Suite is 1.7.12.  Mozilla 5.0 will probally not come in to existence until I'm old, fat, and balding (no offense intended to those who already are).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

Actual Results:  
The current useragent identifies itself as the Mozilla Suite.
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

Expected Results:  
Useragent should be fixed to not identify itself as Mozilla.
Firefox/1.5 (Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8 Gecko/20051111)

Detecting rv: in UA strings that are not populated by the two dozen or so other Gecko based browsers is not reliable method of dealing with browsers from many aspects of a Web Designer and Developer.

In example, when tracking browsers I lose data when an unknown Gecko based browser uses a non-standard UA (by declaring Mozilla, having rv:, and not knowing what new agent to look for (such as if you were unaware of Camino) and therefor by failing to properly declare the useragent I lose data in many ways including browser tracking.
