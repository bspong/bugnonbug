Search Engine ordering gets jumbled up when switching from Fx 3.5.5 to Fx 3.6 Beta 1

I have about 20 search engines installed and I have them organised in a paricular order. When I switch over to Fx 3.6. Beta 1 from Fx 3.5.5 the order of the search engines is all mixed up and some of them even disappear.  If I change the order of them while in Fx 3.6 Beta 1, this is not saved when switching back to Fx 3.5.5 and they are mixed up as before.  I have disabled all extensions to make sure they are not causing this, and it still occurs.  I have only tested this on Windows XP.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install a few search engines
2. Reorganise them to a particular order
3. Install Fx 3.6 Beta 1 and start up
4. Note that the order of the search engines has changed
5. Close Fx 3.6 Beta 1 and return to Fx 3.5.5 and the search engine ordering remains mixed up.
6. This will always happen no matter how many times you reorganise them.
Actual Results:  
Search engine order gets changed.

Expected Results:  
Should retain the order the search engines are set to across all versions of Firefox.
