In HTTP session, get popup dialog Secure Connection Failed
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1b99) Gecko/20090605 Firefox/3.5b99 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Occasionally while using FF 3.5 b99, I will browse to a site and receive a popup dialog "Secure Connection Failed" even though I am not using https.

The text I received when I went to bugzilla was:

"Secure Connection failed:

bts.turbolinux.co.jp:443 uses an invalid security certificate."

I was not visiting bts.turbolinux.co.jp and the site doesn't have any ads or anything that could explain this error.  Its happened a few times today (my first day with 3.5b) and I can't reproduce nor predict when it will happen.

I have a screenshot of the error with the url, but this tracker doesn't seem to allow attachments.  If you are interested, email me and I will send it to you.

However, its basically the same error that ff reports if you visit the site directly:  https://bts.turbolinux.co.jp/

The question is really why is this popping up to the user.  For a user, its confusing because I am using http (not https) and I am receiving a popup from a another site entirely.

I have noticed this with other sites.  As I run into them again, I will add to this ticket.
