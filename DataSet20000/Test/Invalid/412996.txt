XP reports firefox as crashed when fully loading some pages
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11

When loading news item pages listed on the main page, some pages cause XP to terminate pages after they are fully loaded, with the 'send error' dialog appearing. Stopping these pages from fully loading during a 'restore' session sometimes works.
I upgraded to latest version of firefox to overcome this problem on an earlier version. I also use firefox under linux without any apparent problem, so maybe a problem related to XP builds only ?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a news item page on the URL that causes 'crash'
2. Try restoring the session
3.
Actual Results:  
News item page appears to load, then firefox freezes momentarily before XP puts up the dialog box indicating that it has terminated firefox, and that an error could be sent.

Expected Results:  
When restoring a session, allow the html page to be decoded in stages, first display text, then static pictures, then 'moving' pictures, then ads from different URLs etc so that user can determine where problem occurs.

Message box reports:

AppName: firefox.exe	 AppVer: 1.8.20071.12718	 ModName: npswf32.dll
