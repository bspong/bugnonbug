firefox crashes after eating all available memory (2GB)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9b5) Gecko/2008032620 Firefox/3.0b5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9b5) Gecko/2008032620 Firefox/3.0b5

opening the before mentioned url causes firefox to gobble up all memory available (2GB)
the page contains 12 images with total size 6MB.
loading the same page in IE consumes about 120MB (safari about same)
the page is w3c checked and conformes to all standards.

note that the page uses css-sprites, that is one single big image as background
for all the spans on the page and only the background-position is changed.
firefox instead thinks that he has to download this single background image
thousand times.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open http://valamit.com/Top/TopPhotos.xml
2. watch memory consumption and rendering speed
3. compare with IE or Safari

Actual Results:  
memory consumed (2GB), very-very slow rendering

Expected Results:  
memory consumption should remain at least as with IE or safari
and rendering should be also way faster.

problem observed in firefox 3b5 for windows xp and firefox 2 for windows xp.
firefox 2 and 3b5 works fine on MAC OS X Tiger.
