can't login Google Plus with Permission Manager set to block all cookies by default
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:6.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0

Steps to reproduce:

A
1. I visited google.com
2. clicked Sign In
3. typed my e-mail and password
4. clicked Submit

B
1. go to Permission Manager
2. search for accounts.google.com

if this bug hits, it's a heavy hitter

is permission manager the most important feature of fx6?
is cookie blocking the most important part of the feature?
are we in the last fx 6 beta?
is google the most popular site?
is google plus the currently most imporant google product?

if this bug is a heavy hitter, then I wrote my coolest bug report


Actual results:

accounts.google.com flashed in the url bar
I found a tip saying click the icon to the left of the url bar to set the permission for the site that you're visiting and by the way shared it
the tip was rendered useless by the flashing
I went to the Permission Manager and accounts.google.com wasn't there
Once, I remember trying just like a monkey to make a site appear in the Permission Manager and it was add the site to favorites, bookmark the site with the star, bookmark the site the long way, bookmark the site with CTRL+D (I'm not sure if I tried this, but that's because I was in monkey mode), visit the site, visit the site a lot, finally the site appared, but I do NOT want to go monkey mode again
will the tracking ever end?


Expected results:

the tracking finally ends
