single clicking on bookmarks in the places organizer should not check for microsummaries
single clicking on bookmarks in the places organizer appears to be loading them (somewhere?)

I have a bm for amazon, and when I single click it, I see console errors (from css) that indicates we are trying to load it.

investigating...
