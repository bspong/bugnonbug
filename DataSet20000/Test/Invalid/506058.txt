If you have more than one open window, and you close all of them, only the last window closed will be restored if you have the "Show my windows and tabs from last time" setting on.

When you open Firefox, and you open more than one window, then close them all, only the last window that was closed will be restored when you restart Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
This will only work if you have the "Show my windows and tabs from last time" setting enabled. To enable this, click Tools > Options... > In the "Main" Tab, under Startup, in the drop down box next to "When Firefox Starts:" select "Show my windows and tabs from last time".

1. Open Firefox.
2. Go to any webpage in each window.
3. Open another window (or more).
4. Close all windows.
5. Reopen Firefox.
Actual Results:  
Only the last window closed was restored, and not the other ones.

Expected Results:  
Open all the windows closed.

I don't really think it's possible to fix it, but I'm hoping. I've lost lots of useful tabs and windows by this bug.
