Error console is always full of warnings - not a geek and don't know what they mean or how to fix them.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.2.18) Gecko/20110614 Firefox/3.6.18
Build ID: 20110614230723

Steps to reproduce:

Have updated Firefox software frequently, didn't fix problems. Am currently loading 3.6.22.  It's taking a long time, and I doubted it would fix the problems because other updates haven't.

Pages load very slowly, when I check Error Console: All, it's always loaded with Warnings and Messages, like the following:

developer.mozilla.org : server does not support RFC 5746, see CVE-2009-3555

Warning: Expected declaration but found '*'.  Skipped to next declaration.
Source File: https://developer.mozilla.org/skins/common/css.php
Line: 795




Actual results:

Page will likely load eventually, but if I clear the Error Console, it'll load back up again. Nothing happens when I highlight any one of the Warnings or Messages and click on Evaluate. The links to the Warnings do work when I click on them, but I've no idea what all the code means.


Expected results:

Pages should open faster with no Warnings or Messages.
