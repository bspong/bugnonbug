Program starts but no home page or any web page loads.  Also gets stuck in running processes.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: FIrefox 1.0.3

I recently updated to 1.0.3 of firefox and all of a sudden my homepage 
wouldn't load.  I tried other web pages but recieved the same result.  Also 
when I close out the program I hit ctrl alt del and I check the processes and 
it is stuck in there.  I try to end it but it just sits there.  When I try to 
reset my computer it freezes because it can't close out the program.  I am 
confused what do I do?


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I open the program and allow it to load the webpage.
2.No page int he address box shows up and all I get is a loading bar and a 
blank page with a blank address bar.
3.

Actual Results:  
Webpage doesn't load and program gets frozen in running processes.

Expected Results:  
It should immediately go to my homepage without delay.  Everything about 
firefox was default except maybe a couple extensions that i needed.  I also 
have norton internet security and I disabled that to see if it helped but it 
did not.

I am not sure how to rate the severity of this problem.
