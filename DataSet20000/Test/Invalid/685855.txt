Rapid Release compatibility issues making users switch back to explorer

Steps to reproduce:

Rapid release is making users all around me switch back to internet explorer, or chrome.

The major release number changing all the time makes them nervous; they feel as though there is something badly wrong with a product that has a new major rev every few weeks.

Releasing a "stable" update that disables all HP printers is just plain dumb. Yes, HP software is lousy, but we all have to live with it.



Expected results:

Put it back, please. This new philosophy RE updates is not helping anyone.
