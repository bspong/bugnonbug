Everytime I close firebird and I have multiple tabs open there is a dialog box
that asks whether to save the tabs or close tabs.  There is also a dialog box
asking to never ask again.  Evertime i check the dialog box and close all tabs,
Firebird crashes.  Note: I have tabbrowser extensions, but I don't think that is
the problem.

1.Open Mutiple tabs

3.check the box for never ask again
4.click close all tabs

Closed browser, not ask to save tab history again.
