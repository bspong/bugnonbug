I have downloaded and installed the gmail notifier for firefox 1.0 and ever
since I can't open more than one window at a time although the tab feature
works. If I close firefox completely then I have to kill the process in order to
open it up again. I have tried to reinstall the web browser but it doesn't have
an effect.
