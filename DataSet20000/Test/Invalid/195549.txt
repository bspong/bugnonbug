I cleared my profile before installing my latest build of Phoenix on my computer
(ref: http://pryan.org/phoenix/joshk/dist/phoenix_0.5-20030228_i386.deb) and
Phoenix does not seem to remember any cookies now. Tried to login to slashdot,
my own webmail service, every cookie seems to be rejected.

This is on Linux.
