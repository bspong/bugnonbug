I installed the UK nightly trunk and much of the chrome appears to be in another language, possibly Russian. Menues and dialogs are affected but tabs not.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. download http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk-l10n/firefox-3.0a9pre.uk.linux-i686.tar.bz2
2. extract as ~/firefox
3.
