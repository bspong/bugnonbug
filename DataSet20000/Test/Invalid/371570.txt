Firefox crashes as I browse and read different news stories. The program automatically installed yesterday and has had continuous problems.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20070219 Firefox/2.0.0.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20070219 Firefox/2.0.0.2

As I read and browse news stories and other websites, Firefox crashes repeatedly. It does not seem to matter which URL I'm in. More often than not, the program crashes with Windows asking if I want to report an error or not. Either way, Firefox closes and the session ends. It asks if I want to resume the session and whether I resume the session or not, the program continues to crash repeatedly. Definitely not an improvement over the previous version.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. All I need to do is browse the news. When I begin to read a story, it crashes not long after.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Windows displays a message indicating a fatal error has occurred and asks if I wish to send a report or not.

Expected Results:  
Firefox closes down and I must restart the program to try to browse again.

The software should work without displaying error messages or shutting down. If I am browsing and reading, I do not want interruptions. So far, the program does not distinguish between one URL or another when it displays the error message and shuts down.
