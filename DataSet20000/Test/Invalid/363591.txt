Two ways to bypass Add-ons whitelist check
I accidentally discovered two ways to bypass the Add-ons whitelist check this morning.

1) I was reading Myk's post (http://www.melez.com/mykzilla/2006/12/persistent-site-specific-prefs.html) in Vienna, an RSS Feed Reader for Mac.  I clicked the "Install Content Preferences" link in the Feed reader, which brought Firefox to the front and gave me the Add-on installation dialog (with the countdown button, etc).  I do not have Myk's site in my Add-ons whitelist, so it bypassed the whitelist check.

2) I copied the URL to Myk's extension's xpi and pasted it into the Location bar.  Same result -- the Add-on installation dialog was presented with the countdown button, etc., again bypassing the whitelist.

Clicking on the link in the post displayed in Firefox (ie: regular browsing), the extension installation was blocked as expected.
