rename nightly 1.8.0 branch builds to -firefox1.5.0.5 and other necessary changes for the next release
Not sure what is involved, but it is time to update the nightly 1.8.0 tinderboxes and get some 1.5.0.5 builds together.  I'll leave it up to Paul and/or Rob to do their thing.  I'm guessing we need to:

1. tag the new release branch
2. rename files on ftp
3. create the candidates directory in prep for rc1
