Firefox does this even with a fresh install.  (since 3.0.1beta)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a few tabs, doesn't matter of what.
2. Close one tab.
3. Complete the command by hitting Ctrl+Shift+t
Actual Results:  
NOTHING!

Expected Results:  
Firefox should re-open the closed tab.

No crashes this time, but its very frustrating whenyou close a tab accidentally and cant get it back without going to the History menu.
