"Send" button in yahoo mail does nothing in firefox for Linux,
whereas under windows the button does work, and it also works for the latest
version of mozilla under Linux, just not firefox.

Have found this to be true for: mandrake linux 10, fedora core 2.

Have entered this under OS integration since it only happens under Linux. Might
be GTK related?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. compose mail at myyahoo.com for some user account
2. press the "Send" button
3. 
Actual Results:  
nothing happens, although looking at the output in the javascript console shows
"Error: window.document.all has no properties".


Expected Results:  
Sent the email (process the javascript for sending the message).
