Firefox renders huge height on a colored div badly.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; sv-SE; rv:1.9.1b4) Gecko/20090423 Firefox/3.5b4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; sv-SE; rv:1.9.1b4) Gecko/20090423 Firefox/3.5b4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

So, I put together a test for huge height values and it seems both test fails in Firefox 3.0.10 and test 2 in 3.5 Beta 4. They both seem to pass in all other browsers. What I noticed about test one, and this might be computer/Windows specific was that it continued to show the colour from the page last visited before you entered "http://zirro.se/code/acid/test1.html". Try it out with different browsers and see what you get.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://zirro.se/code/acid/test1.html.
2. See if any of the tests fail, according to the description.
3. Compare with other browsers.
Actual Results:  
Test 1 isn't green all the way.
Test 2 isn't as long as the height suggests.

Expected Results:  
Test 1 should be green all the way (which it is in the latest BETA)
Test 2 should be as long as the height suggests, as it is in other browsers.
