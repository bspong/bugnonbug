always use my fonts, not always working
I've come across at least 3 sites where my font settings are being ignored or
overridden... suprnova.org (everything), freshmeat.net (form buttons), and
NetTracker 6 (form buttons)

Fonts & Colors:

Proportional: Sans Serif
Serif: Times
Sans-serif: Helvetica
Monospace: Courier

Always use my: Fonts

I've tried to create a testcase for all, but I was only able to make something
reproducable by using source from suprnova.org, specifically when the charset
meta tag is added.

gtk1 builds of Mozilla or Firefox don't exhibit this behavior, can't imagine
it's something that's gtk2-only/been around for a long while. Firefox 0.9rc is
my first real use of a gtk2 build.
