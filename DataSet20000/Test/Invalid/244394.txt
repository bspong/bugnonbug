The navigation bars on the sample page use onMouseOver events to call a simple
procedure which changes the table cell color and assign a style.cursor="pointer
type" basically making the cell appear like a hyperlink.   Mozilla however
doesn't reliably implement this model especially if the cursor is moved over a
text element (the default text select pointer seems to over-ride the onMouseOver
call which changes the cursor to a hand).

This bug is an eratic bug because after moving the mouse over the buttons a few
times Mozilla will start using expected behaviors.  If you hit reload the mouse
will appear as a pointer and text selector for several passes through the
navigation buttons.  Once the pointer finally does switch to a hand the browser
works as expected.

This is a non-critical but highly annoying bug.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. set up a table cell
2. in the TD element place an onMouseOver event to call a function
(functionCall(this))
3.  have the function call set x.style.cursor to "hand"
4. set an onMouseOut event to call another function and set x.style.cursor to
"pointer"
5. set some normal text in the table cell.
6. run page, move mouse over active cell a few times, at start it won't behave
as expected later it will, hit reload to get back to the broken state.
Actual Results:  
Cursor did not change until it passed over the active area several times.

Expected Results:  
Cursor should have immediately changed from a pointer to a hand, cursor should
not have changed to a text carret when passing over the neutral text.

Using default install of Mozilla.
