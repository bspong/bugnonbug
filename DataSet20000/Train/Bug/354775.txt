Moving Bookmark in Bookmarks sidebar causes the entire list of bookmarks to move.  This is visually jarring and makes it difficult to find the bookmark that was just moved.  If the bookmark is moved higher in the list, only the list below the new location of the bookmark should change, in so much as it shifts down one position to accomadate the moved bookmark.  If the bookmark is moved lower, only the portion of the list between the old location and the new location should shift up by one position.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Create at a list of bookmarks that is longer than can be shown on the screen.
2. Move a bookmark up or down in the list.

Actual Results:  
The list is refreshed and moved in an arbitrary way, such that the bookmark that was just moved is no longer under the location where it was moved to.  

Expected Results:  
The list would shift appropriately and the bookmark would remain under the pointer.
