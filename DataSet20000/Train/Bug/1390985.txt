Update Screenshots to version 16.1.0
This (finally!) merges GitHub master. Changelog:

https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-1600

Note that we've been using one version number for the server and add-on, so versions 11-15 have been server-only releases. (We'll separate the two eventually, but haven't yet.)

The changes aren't that easy to copy over, so it would be best to view them on the link, but for the record I'll put them down here:

Version 16.0.0

* Fix tests failing when run against photon-y Firefox without MOZ_PHOTON_THEME defined [beec56b](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/beec56b)

* Deal with lack of MOZ_PHOTON_THEME on 57+ [3e9eba3](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/3e9eba3)
* Make run-addon work with new legacy pref. Fixes [#3333](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3333) [b9a776b](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/b9a776b)
* Immediately exit when Firefox is exiting. Fixes [#3323](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3323) [916c353](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/916c353)
* Fix tests, enable legacy extensions via pref during tests ([#3324](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3324)) [c60fd37](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/c60fd37)
* Make tests resilient to a browserAction or pageAction ([#3317](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3317)) Fixes [#3306](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3306) [3c15014](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/3c15014)
* Replace the WebExtension browser action with a Photon page action. ([#3239](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3239))
  * Replace the WebExtension browser action with a Photon page action.
  This removes the browser action and adds a Photon page action,
  pursuant to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1366041.
  Right now Photon page actions are unrelated to WebExtension page
  actions unfortunately, which means that this patch has to do most
  of its work in bootstrap.js.  The WebExtension part passes
  messages to bootstrap.js to handle clicks and update the action's
  title and icon as necessary.
  * Test fix: Replace the WebExtension browser action with a Photon page action.
  Fix the test for the previous commit.
  * Update SHOOTER_BUTTON_ID in test.js.
  * Use the Photon page action when supported, the WebExtension browser action when not.
  Extend the Photon-related port used between bootstrap.js and the
  WebExtension so that bootstrap.js can tell the WebExtension
  whether it's OK to use the Photon page action.  The WebExtension
  should not attempt to use the browser action when Photon is
  enabled because bootstrap.js will have removed the browser
  action's navbar button.
  Modify the test so that it checks the Photon page action when
  Photon is enabled and the browser action when it's not.
  * Fix the expected button label in test.js for the Photon page action.
  * Maybe fix PageActions eslint errors. [4396250](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/4396250)
* remove high DPI shot capture for full page [fde181d](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/fde181d)
* Sets background highlight width to 100% [aee88eb](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/aee88eb)
* Remove duplicate drawWindow call for shot preview [2a5dd27](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/2a5dd27)
* Update shot preview save icon [735b3f9](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/735b3f9)
* Add reason to webExtension.startup and shutdown Will be useful when https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1372750 and
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1373749 are fixed [d97d4a7](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/d97d4a7)
* Protect against an empty IPC response ([#3037](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3037))This happened in some weird corner case while debugging [14df39d](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/14df39d)
* Guard access of this.save when un-disabling the save button ([#3030](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3030)). This can happen after the worker has been torn down, and this.save isn't defined [cf6e72a](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/cf6e72a)
* Set dimensions for icon and add to startup ([#3136](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3136)) [9959ede](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/9959ede)
* Disable Screenshots in private windows. Fixes [#3120](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3120) [aefc639](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/aefc639)
* about:home is not treated like about:newtab ([#3088](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3088)). Fixes [#3029](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3029) [4633694](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/4633694)
* preview shot before saving full page/visibleremove addToMyShots [c87db61](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/c87db61)
