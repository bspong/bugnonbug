I used to be able to drag a URL to a folder on the bookmarks bar and save into a folder. This behavior has stopped working for some reason. If I click the folder, I see my bookmarks but if I use the organize bookmarks function, the new bookmarks I added are not there. I tried closing and restarting the browser and the bookmarks I added are gone. Maybe a file permissions problem?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Drag bookmark into a folder on the bookmarks bar.
2. Go into Bookmarks -> Organize bookmarks...
3. Check for the new bookmarks that were just added.
Actual Results:  
No new bookmarks have been added so they dont show up in the organizer but they DO show up in the folder I added them to (unless I restart the browser, then they disappear).

Expected Results:  
I should see my bookmarks, I should be able to see them in the organizer and they should persist across browser restarts.

Im attaching screenshots, showing how my bookmarks folder looked like. And a second showing what's shown in the organizer during the same session.
