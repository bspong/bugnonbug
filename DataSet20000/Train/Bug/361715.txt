Hard crash on this site - data loss
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.0.8) Gecko/20061025 Firefox/1.5.0.8

I went to this site in Firefox 2.0 and it hardlocked my browser. I lost a lot of data in a blogpost I was typing up and I am very angry. The night before it hardlocked on another site. In contrast, FF 1.5.08 hardly ever hardcrashes on any site ever. FF 2.0 is a serious regression in terms of hardcrashes with data loss. 

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.ismaili.net/mirrors/pamir_001/index.html
2. Try to move the cursor on the page

Actual Results:  
1. Go to http://www.ismaili.net/mirrors/pamir_001/index.html
2. Cursor stops moving on page
3. Firefox locks up totally
4. All things that normally worked in FF 1.5x, including closing all other programs, fail
5. Browser must be hardclosed, resulting in possibly major data loss

Expected Results:  
1. Go to http://www.ismaili.net/mirrors/pamir_001/index.html
2. Page works fine.

I did not try to reproduce it. I got so angry at FF 2.0 that I grabbed 1.5.08 again and reinstalled it over the "new, improved" FF 2.0 REGRESSED browser. Last night, there was *another* hardlock with a different site with the exact same sequence as in actual results. In contrast, in 1.5x, hardcrashes were quite rare and Step 4 normally prevented them as the browser would eventually start responding again. In FF 2.0 the browser just hardfreezes and apparently will never come back to life. HTML Tidy analysis shows a mere 8 warnings about font tags, div tags and h1 tags, an unremarkable page. Examination of the page itself reveals an unremarkable page with some tables.

As Talkback CONSISTENTLY fails with the REGRESSED 2.0, I have no Talkback ID either! Talkback always works with 1.5x
