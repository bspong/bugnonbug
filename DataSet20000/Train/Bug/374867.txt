When you go on the above mentioned website and others using the Windows Media Player plug-in, the video does not appear. This has been a problem since the coming out of Firefox 2.0 but the problem wasn't there in the 1.5 release. Please go on the mentioned website, and load a news video. Nothing should appear. It works fine with Internet explorer and some friends and colleagues have also reported me the exact same problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles
2.Click on any icon to see a video from the news.
3.Wait and see, well, you will not see anything because the Media Player does not load.
4. Do the same thing with IE and it will work properly.
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens, I tried to find some info on the web, reinstalling the browser and so on but nothing.

Expected Results:  
The video should appear if I use Firefox 1.5 or IE.

I enjoy using Firefox but since the problem persists, when I want to see a video, I unfortunately switch to IE.
