Graphical interface problem - Memory related
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; es-ES; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; es-ES; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I run a lot of applications, for example:
 - Eclipse (IDE)
 - Apache Tomcat
 - DB2 9.5
 - DBVisualizer
 - Java applications
 - Microsoft Outlook
 - Sun IMQ
The memory usage of all this stuff is like 2.3 GB (My computer has 4GB RAM)
When i run Firefox 3.5 with all this stuff running, the visual controls (Browser toolbar buttons, tabs, etc) is displayed mmm how to say it... "in blank?" i mean, the has not the visual component, just like if an EMPTY theme was applied.
So, i think this is a memory problem. It's also important to say that this problem does not occur with Firefox 3.0.11, so i went back to this version.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a lot of programs (Eclipse, DB2, Tomcat, MS Outlook, DBVisualizer, Java apps, etc.)
2. Run Firefox.
Actual Results:  
Graphical interface without images on the buttons, tabs, etc... not only without images, but without the theme ... It's like applying an EMPTY Theme...

Expected Results:  
Regular Firefox behavior.

This problem occurs with any of the themes i have.
Addons: FoxyProxy, Personas, ABP, FireBug, FireFTP, IETab, FEBE, GooglePreview, GoogleRedesigned, ScrapBook, FireSizer, FoxMarks, Glasser, Local Install, ReadItLater, WebMail Notifier, etc.
IMPORTANT: This problem DOES NOT HAPPENS if i run Firefox 3.0.11.
So, it has to be a problem in Firefox 3.5.
