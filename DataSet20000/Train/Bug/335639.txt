Graphics & animations don't load on some web pages in Firefox

There are a number of web pages that just won't load graphics and animations in Firefox. The icon for QuickTime shows up, looking grayed-out, or just placemarkers appear. When the same page is loaded in Internet Explorer, it usually has no problems, but some of the same behaviors can show up there, too, on very rare occasions. The graphics could contain links that may be important to the user or contain information pertinent to a search or similar things.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a website either from Thunderbird, via e-mail message, or from Firefox
2. Upon noticing grayed-out graphics and/or animations, perform a reload function
3. Notice that this will not change anything

Actual Results:  
The web page or site didn't change.

Expected Results:  
It should have loaded all graphics and animations flawlessly.

I'd like to be able to use Firefox more of the time, or exclusively even, but things such as trying to login to a site or find a pertinent link are sometimes impossible in Firefox because they aren't recognized or some such thing. I appreciate any help, of course. Thank you.
