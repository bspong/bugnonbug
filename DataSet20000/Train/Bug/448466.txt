Inputting characters using a non-roman input method results in no characters or improper letters being put into the text field.  This is a new bug.  It does not exist in FireFox v2.0.0.16 or in Safari v3.1.2.

This is on Mac OS X v10.5.4.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to sample URL (http://www.tizag.com/pics/flash/form1easy.swf)
2. In FireFox v3 try to input characters in a Flash textfield using Japanese or Korean input methods
Actual Results:  
No text shows in the text fields

Expected Results:  
Appropriate Japanese/Korean characters show in the textfield.

This is *not* a bug in Adobe Flash. Using Flash 9 on FireFox v2.0.0.16 at the same website, this bug does not manifest. It seems that it was injected into FireFox code in the v3 development cycle.

Note that this looks like a duplicate of bug #357670, however I can reproduce this on the most recently posted (29 July, 2008) build of FireFox v3.

This may also be related to bug #442660.
