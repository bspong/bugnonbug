The drop down menu, "Allied Health Programs", at http://www.hoffmanslounge.com/pit/bios.html is 
using <ul>, CSS & JavaScript to be created. The menu works fine, but the the <div>, below the menu, 
has a style of overflow: scroll; and the scroll bar overlaps the menu when it's open. The menu also 
closes when you try to select an option that is over the div, making it impossible to make a selection 
from it.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a drop down menu using the <ul> tag, CSS and JavaScript.
2. Create a <div> under the menu.
3. See test code at: http://www.hoffmanslounge.com/bugtest.html (view source).
Actual Results:  
See problems listed in test DIV at: http://www.hoffmanslounge.com/bugtest.html

Expected Results:  
Menu should overlap <div> and scroll bars. You should be able to select a menu item over the <div> 
without the menu disappearing.
