On the inncenter.com site (and, after a google search for "firefox 3.5 blocks popups with popup blocker off" it occurs in other systems as well), firefox will cease allowing popups, even if the popup blocker is deactivated totally.  This causes severe problems with web programs which use popups to save data.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse for awhile on popup intensive sites, such as inncenter.com (a private hotel booking engine back-end).
2. After an indeterminate time (sometimes a few hours, sometimes a day or two) the popup blocker will begin blocking all popups from the site, even though the site is in the allow list.
3.
Actual Results:  
Popups blocked, must reset firefox to fix, causing loss of data entered up to the point of the failure.

Expected Results:  
Popups continuously allowed from permitted sites, without error. Also, a "show this popup" option if errantly disallowed. (I've seen this button in other contexts, I believe, but it's somehow missing here).
