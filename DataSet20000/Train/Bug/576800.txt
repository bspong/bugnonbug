vertical sizing is less than 1/2 a screen and when I try and drag it larger, it flashes the larger size during move and then snaps back to small vertical height, same thing with full screen button

for some reason, firefox shrank the vertical aspect (it was working fine yesterday and computer was never rebooted, so still running) for no apparent reason.  when trying to expand it either by dragging or maximize button, it stretches and flashes the larger screen and then snaps back to the 1/3 window height.  It will adjust width wise as normal, but not in height.

the only fix I have found was to uninstall and reinstall the software. reboots nor anything else works.

All other programs work fine including Internet Explorer.

This is extremely frustrating.
