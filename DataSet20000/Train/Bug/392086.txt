I can attempt to attach my Acrobat Pro CS3 latest .pdf file; but it does not get sent out.  JPEG files and Word files and all word processing files go out.  Only the .pdf files do not go out.  I have to resort to Apple Mail, which does send the files out.  I cannot tell if it is a bug in Gmail, Firefox, Safari or Opera [same problem with Gmail attachment of .pdf files], or if it is a bug in Adobe.  Nevertheless, the file DOES go out with Apple Mail.  Where is problem? Gmail or the other browsers, but not the Mail browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Attach Acrobat Pro .pdf file [current verion, CS3].
2.See it attached in the bar.
3.SEND
Actual Results:  
File goes out, the letter; but never the attached .pdf file

Expected Results:  
Sent fold shows email, but not the attachment.  Recipients ask, What was attached?

The attachment of a .pdf file should have gone out, or been sent out.  Same file does go out with Apple Mail.
