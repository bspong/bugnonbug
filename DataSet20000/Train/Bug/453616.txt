Kansas City Star http://www.kansascity.com/ all news stories, comment sections.  Bottom of comment pages have page numbers which should be preceded by a jump-to-beginning and a back button and trailed by a forward and a jump-to-end button.  Additionally the page numbers should be displayed in color (they were blue prior to update) with an underline and should show mouseover.  Mouseover feature does work.  Buttons are missing and page numbers are not underlined nor in color.
