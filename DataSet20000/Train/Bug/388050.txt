Firefox hangs at 100% CPU when idle

Sometimes, for no apparent reason Firefox hangs and I need to kill the process.
It just happened when I had openend a few pages from a Google search in tabs. The pages loaded and a few seconds after they were done loading Firefox stopped responding.

I investigated with Process Explorer and noticed 1 thread that hogged all the CPU cycles: firefox.exe!jpeg_fdct_islow+0x27b1f

I killed the process and started Firefox again. The crashed session was restored, so all pages I had open when the hang occured were loaded again, but this time no hang.

I found another report for a problem in bug #369759 (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=369759), but I never noticed any disappearance of icons and I wasn't using any javascript application actively. A javascript may have been running in the background from a website ofcourse, but I hadn't visited an obvious javascript heavy site like a Google Application or anything.
