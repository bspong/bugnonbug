Firefox freezes
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; nb-NO; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

After the latest update, firefox has a tendency for freezing a lot. Especially on sites like the one linked, but this issue seem to spread to every site I'm on, sporadically freezing and crashing. 

Best example would be when using sites such as OneManga, where you basically view "images". I don't know if it's the way such sites are constructed, but when I use such sites, it often happens that firefox just stops responding. It'll freeze (you know, that pale fading of "not responding") for like 4 seconds, then work again, freeze, work, freeze...

Other than freezing a lot, Firefox has now a higher tendency for taking insane amounts of RAM. I can run several gaming applications smoother now, than I can run Firefox to read a simple site.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit OneManga.com
2. View images
Actual Results:  
Firefox gets sluggish, and ends up freezing a lot. At times, it also takes huge amounts of RAM, requiring me to restart it.

Expected Results:  
Not get sluggish, use insane amounts of RAM and especially not freeze. 

Just being on the site, or having a tab open seems to be enough, to cause similar effect on other sites.


Before the update, I used to have 20-30 tabs up perfectly fine. Now I can barely have 5 tabs up.
