Any website when I attempt to bookmark a link the bookmark dialog comes up.
Click OK and nothing happens.  I can add to a sub folder but when I do that the bookmark title is blank.

I hope you reply soon, this is real annoying

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click ctrl-d
2. click OK
3. "nothing happens" bookmark dialog does not close.
Actual Results:  
"nothing happens" bookmark dialog does not close.

Expected Results:  
the bookmark is saved

I did something that turned my screen position sideways, i fixed that with the control arrow shift feature.  Also my bookmarks were lost except for the bookmark toolbar links.  i imported an old saved bookmark.

when i click the down arrow to browse for new sub folder that is not listed in the last few folders used, the down arrow turns into an up arrow. (odd...?)

uninstall does not remove the "complete record of firefox"

when I close Firefox with "full screen" mode and reopen it is not reopened to full screen mode.
