My html page has frames and one of the internal frame have an anchor tag having href="javascript:somefunc()" along with onclick="someAnotherFunc()". someFunc() internally submits the form and the form target is a newly opened window.
When user clicks on such link the browser's progress bar is shown which remains blank and the status "Done". The popup window loads properly but the opener window's progress bar remains blank.

This recreates even when running firefox in safe mode. Same is the case with Firefox 3.5.x version
