Errors in usage string
In trying to localise the string MSG_USAGE, found in browser/installer/installer.inc, we got convinced that there is an error in there.

It says
#define MSG_USAGE [...] -greShared: Forces GRE to be installed into a global, shared dir (normally)\n			c:\program files\common files\mozilla.org\GRE\n

Here the closing parenthesis after normally should come at the end, between GRE and the newline sign.  And when we are there, I very much doubt the correctness of the given path.  Isn’t this file XP?  And Program Files is written with capitals, usually (I know it is insensitive, but anyway).  And isn’t a period missing, too?

[...]  -greForce: Force 'Component GRE' to be downloaded, run, and installed.  This\n			bypasses GRE's logic of determining when to install by running its\n			installer with a '-f' flag.\n

Shouldn’t that be ‘an '-f' flag’?

[...]  -cleanupOnUpgrade: Tells Setup to check to see if user is upgrading (installing on top\n		of previous version of product).  If user is upgrading:\n			* NORMAL mode: prompt user on how to proceed\n			* All other modes: assume user wants to cleanup.\n	*

Here it is unclear what NORMAL mode is.  As localisers, we have no idea whether we should localise this word, leave it in caps, ...?  And is it the modes that assume, or is this assume an infinitive (not an error, but unclear, another debate in #mozilla.nl)

[...] -noCleanupOnUpgrade: Tells Setup to not check if user is upgrading (installing on top\n		of previous version of product).  This will disable the cleanup feature.\n\n	* means it will override config.ini

Either ‘means’ deserves a capital (it follows a period), or something else is wrong in this sentence.
