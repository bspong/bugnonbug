What happens is that when a password field has a value and the user goes to the
next field. When the user comes back to the password field using keyboard
navigation (SHIFT-TAB) and deletes the last character (navigate to the last
character using the arrow keys) the value of the field will be empty. From that
moment on, the characters that where already typed are inaccessible by script.

Example code:
<form target="_blank">
   <fieldset>
     <legend>Forms example</legend>
     <p>
       <input type="password" name="password"
         onchange="alert(this.value)"/>
       <label>Password</label>
     </p>
     <p>
       <input type="text" name="name"/>
       <label>Name</label>
     </p>
   </fieldset>
</form>

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enter the value 'abc' in the first password field
2.Leave the field using the TAB key
3.After clicking the alert with the value 'abc' away, navigate back to the first
field using 'SHIFT+TAB'
4.Press the RIGHT ARROW key to go to the last entry location
5.Delete the last character 
6.Press TAB again
Actual Results:  
The result is an empty alert

Expected Results:  
The alert should have displayed the password characters present at that time ('ab')
