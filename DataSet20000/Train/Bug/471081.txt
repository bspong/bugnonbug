This problem first occurred a few days ago after upgrading from Firefox 3.0.4 to Firefox 3.0.5. After upgrading to Firefox 3.0.5, if I open several windows and I click on the close button of one of those windows, Firefox closes all of my windows, instead of the one I wanted to close.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox and go to a website.
2. Open another window and go to a website.
3. If you want, open some more windows and tabs.
4. Close one of the windows or tabs using the close-button which is located in the title bar.
Actual Results:  
Firefox closes every open windows and tab.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should close only the window or tab you wanted to close.

On older version of Firefox the same behavior of closing all open windows and tabs occured when using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + W. For more information about that bug see:

The bug of Firefox closing all windows when pressing Ctrl + W has been in Firefox for a long time, but I only had this bug when using keyboard shortcuts. Because of this bug, I just didn't close my windows using the keyboard, but by closing the close button located in the title bar.

Now I've upgraded to Firefox 3.0.5 and now this same bug also occurs when closing the windows using the close button. This bug is getting really annoying.
