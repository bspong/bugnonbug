takes very long time (several minutes) to quit under all circumstances in Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard

Every time I try to quit Firefox, under any circumstances (such as number of open tabs), I get the "spinning beach ball" longer than I should. My window will close after a minute or two, but the dock shows that Firefox is still active and unresponsive. It can take over five minutes beyond that point to fully quit, with an absolute minimum of two or three minutes; sometimes, there is no indication at all that it will quit, and I have to force-quit. This has been happening since I upgraded my late-2006 model MacBook from Mac OS 10.4 Tiger to 10.6 Snow Leopard, skipping 10.5 Leopard in the process.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Quit Firefox from the Firefox > Quit Firefox menu bar dialogue.
Actual Results:  
Just what I described above: The window closed after about a minute and a half, but Firefox remained active and unresponsive. After waiting about four minutes, I put my laptop to sleep; upon waking it the next morning, Firefox was still active and unresponsive. I used force-quit to finally close it and reopen it.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have been able to quit within a minute or so, like it did before I upgraded my operating system. I cannot remember if the "Clear Private Data" dialogue box has not been appearing only since I upgraded Mac OS X, or if it had disappeared when I had previously upgraded to Firefox 3 (i.e. before this bug began occurring).
