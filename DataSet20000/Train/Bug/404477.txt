Hi

I use since a long time firefox under KDE with gtk-qt-engine
Until firefox 3.0 alpha the fonts are near identical to kde apllications
Especially after installing the windows-fonts rendering of pages is 100% like on windows - this is important for testing our work.

With the first firefox 3.0 alpha and also the beta from today this is changed
The fonts, espacially gui and menu looks much thinner than in other applications, on webpages the are thinner but summary a little larger.

I use in both cases the tarball from mozilla.org with an identical profile, to use empty profiles for both browsers makes no difference

Hopefully the final version will render this as known before


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Take a fedora linux 

Open a page with "font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif" by having installed the arial.ttf and look at the difference of font rendering on the page.

To see the difference in GUI on the same system take "dejavu" as defaul font on kde and gnome too and look what happens with the fonts from menubars
Actual Results:  
Different rendering in the gui and on pages

Expected Results:  
The same optical rendering as in other versions and thunderbird 2.x too
