Can't create a new bookmark pointing to file:///home/username/foldername/ as a normal clickable link, to display its content as a web page inside the main Firefox windows.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type /home/username/foldername/ (replace names accordingly) into the location bar. You should see "Index of" web page displaying the content of your local folder.

2. Bookmark This Page... either with mouse right click, from Bookmarks menu, or in Bookmarks Manager. The new bookmark should point to file:///home/username/foldername/ , notice the file:// protocol, you can't simply type /home/username/foldername/ as the location because Firefox will automatically append http:// at the begining.

3. Go back in Firefox main window, unfold the Bookmarks list and see how your new bookmark appears as folder tree. You can't click on it to go to the "Index of" web page.

Actual Results:  
The Bookmarks menu keep turning my bookmarked path into an expandable folder tree, which then only let me click individual files individually from within the Bookmarks list.


Expected Results:  
Bookmarking a directory path in Bookmarks Manager should make the link behaving the same way as when typing file:///home/username/foldername/ directly into the Firefox location bar.
