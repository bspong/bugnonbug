Live bookmarks do not pass persistent cookies when loading on startup
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1b1) Gecko/20060710 Firefox/2.0b1

This situation applies to a persistent cookie for a domain from which an live bookmark has been created, like a "logged-in" identifier.  When Firefox restarts, and loads the live bookmark, the cookie on file is not passed with the request for the live bookmark.

As a result, on some systems, the cookie on file will then be overwritten with a new session cookie from the domain since it considers the live bookmark visit to be from an new rather than return visitor.

This could impact sites with "remember me on this computer" options along with RSS feeds.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I've tested this on an internal environment, however it should happen on any cookie based session with an live bookmark.

1. Log into site - receive cookie
2. Create RSS Live Bookmark - we now have 1 cookie for that domain
3. Restart firefox and check the cookie after loading of live bookmarks.
Actual Results:  
The cookie will be replaced with a new one from the session based site.

Expected Results:  
the cookie will be remain the same and will not overwrite the existing cookie on file.
