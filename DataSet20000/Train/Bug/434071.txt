Adding innerHTML containing a <div> to a TT element in JavaScript creates additional TT elements.  Discovered while adding innerHTML to all TT elements in the page with a loop -- the result crashed the browser completely, without detecting the runaway JavaScript.  Code that initiates the bug can be found at http://www.deluxecode.com/mozillabug/index.html

WARNING: It may crash your browser outright.  View source before clicking on anything.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Traverse <tt> elements on the page.
2. Add innerHTML containing a <div> with text in it to each.  i.e.: <div>txt</div>
3. Profit!
Actual Results:  
Perpetual hang; total crash.  Entire system performance suffered for several minutes before killing the process.

Expected Results:  
Split the <tt> into two lines with a <div> element in the middle containing text.

The only tag I can reproduce this with so far is <tt>.  Also tried <cite> & undefined tags (i.e. <mytag>) without reproducing results.  However, other tags may still exist with the same properties.  Specifically, I haven't tested <pre> yet, which has a similar effect on formatting and may suffer from the same bug.
