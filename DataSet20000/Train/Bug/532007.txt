I clicked on the link, and the page proceeded to attempt to attack my computer. The attempt was blocked by Norton 360, which said that the application through which the attack came was (program path)\FIREFOX.EXE. There are detailed messages stored in my log about the attack, but I'm not sure how to submit them to you. The stupid Norton 360 program doesn't seem to have a copy and paste function. I'm submitting the exported file from the Norton 360 Security History. I have no idea how to read the file

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to that silly website
2. Let it attack your computer, and pray to your god that your firewall will handle it.
