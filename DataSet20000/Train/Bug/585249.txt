while browsing the site nseindia.com it takes too much time to come up and in the mean time the firefox as a whole hangs and only one option available is to kill using a terminal window. Some times it does not come up at all here also, the firefox get hanged and if we try to logout and login ie fresh restart of Xwindow, the system complains while clicking the firefox icon in the panel, that you have to first close the firefox for a restart.  This is a bug I think.  While checking the processes i have noticed that java is there in the zombie mode at that time.
Fresh reboot solves the problem.
I think the site, nseindia.com is java intensive site
