Steps to reproduce:

1) open responsive web view (just introduced in Aurora 26.0a2 ?), switch on touch event emulation, go to http://patrickhlauke.github.io/touch/tests/event-listener.html
2) move mouse pointer over the button without clicking
3) click the button


Actual results:

2) regular mouse events mouseover, mousemove, mouseout are being fired
3) correct sequence of touchstart > touchend > mousedown > (a single) mousemove > mouseup > click are being fired, but the 300ms delay between touchend and mousedown is not emulated


Expected results:

2) regular mouse events should be suppressed when touch emulation is turned on (additionally, perhaps scrolling should work similar to touch as well, i.e. user has to click and drag to scroll similar to finger scrolling on touch)
3) there should be a 300ms delay between touchend and the mouse events (unless it's optimised away, as on real mobile devices, when meta viewport has user-scalable=no or minimum-scale and maximum-scale are set to the same value)
