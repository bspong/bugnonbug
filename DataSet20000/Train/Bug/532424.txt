when trying to sell an item I am repeatedly asked for username and password when already logged in. is this Firefox or Ebay?

I can log into Ebay fine, but when I try to sell an item I am asked for login details (even though already logged in). I enter correct details and asked again for login details etc etc etc. I dont get this behaviour in Safari but prefer to use Firefox. So is this a Firefox bug or Ebay?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log into Ebay
2.Click Sell Item
3.Click 'Browse Categories' or any other option from this page
4. Presented with login screen
5. Enter valiid login details
6. Presented with login screen
7. Goto 5
Actual Results:  
Can never get to sell an item. Sometimes Ebay will let me through this and doesnt ask for the login at step 4, and sometimes it doesnt.

Expected Results:  
In Safari, no login screen is presented when I am already logged into Ebay and try to sell an item - it goes straight to either browsing categories or entering item details. This is how I expect Firefox to behave.

The only help I got from the Firefox forums was to try removing the Cookies file as this could be corrupted. I tried this (having shut down Firefox first) but it has made no difference.

I looked through the known bugs list but couldnt see anything like this.

I have been selling through Firefox/Ebay for about 8 weeks and had no problems until the last few weeks. Sorry I dont know exactly when.
