Firefox stored my entries, including unencrypted passwords, in the bash history of ubuntu.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:39.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/39.0
Build ID: 20150629114848

Steps to reproduce:

Working with Firefox, Eclipse Mars and maybe LibreOffice Writer under ubuntu 14.04.1 with kernel 3.16.0.
Generating a JavaDoc in Eclipse, doing nothing special in Firefox.
I switched from Eclipse to a nautilus window.
Nautilus/ unity crashed (all windows closed, unity bars disappeared);
Terminal login via Strg+Alt+F1 worked.
-> pkill nautilus -> sudo startX -> reboot via unity (root password required) -> login via lightDM didn't work -> removed .Xauthority, .xsession-errors, .x* in home dir -> login worked -> working with Firefox, Texmaker, evince, opening a terminal window under unity


Actual results:

After this trial to fix ubuntu, Pushing the up button in the terminal window showed the input of the last Firefox session, every chunk I ended with an Enter key appeared as a single command line.
At some places in these lines there was a tilde and deleted characters were shown, too.
Worse, passwords I typed into web forms, showed up and were unencrypted!

For security reasons, I deleted the terminal history via history -c and history -w.


Expected results:

I should not have had access to these data via the command line.
