OPEN WITH option and "opens with" file extensions fail

If I launch Firefox and use FILE -> Open file I can open an html or an image file directly.  HOWEVER, if I navigate to the file, say index.html, and I RIGHT CLICK and OPEN WITH and then select Firefox, I get the windows error "{pathname}\index.html is not a valid win32 application."  I get the same error when I use the Windows "tool/folder options/file types/opens with" option.   This happens 100% of the time for any file with which Firefox is the associated .exe

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.My Computer/My documents/my pictures
2.right click on gif or jpg file
3.select "Open With ...."
4.select Firefox
Actual Results:  
C:/my computer/my documents/my pictures/tree.gif is not a valid win32 application

Expected Results:  
opening the file would be good.

I have been told anecdotally that "something must be wrong" (oh, ya think?) and that what I should do is remove Firefox from my system and re-install it from scratch.   This seems a bit too "Windows 3.11" for my taste and a refuge for programmers who don't know how their product works or how it's broken.
