External files fail to load and cache will not clear through "Clear Private Data"

After browsing image-intensive web sites loading a new page/refreshing a page fails to load some or all images and style sheets.

At this point trying to clear the cache through Tools>Clear Private Data fails - the Clear Private Data menu does not appear. A very small rectangle appears on screen and the menu cannot be accessed. 

Pages will not load correctly again until the browser is restarted.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse/repeatedly refresh image intensive sites (fill cache?)
2. Try to access Clear Private Data options
Actual Results:  
1. Eventually images and styles fail to display 
2. Clear Private Data menu is not displayed and cannot be accessed

Expected Results:  
Refreshing pages/viewing new pages should display all images and style sheets. Clear Private Data options should display.

Although this seems like two separate issues they appear to be caused by the same problem. The Clear Private Data not displaying problem only occurs when the caching/image display problem occurs. 

I had this issue in earlier versions of Firefox but up until the latest release it seemed to be fixed.
