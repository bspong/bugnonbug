When Firefox is configured to "Show my windows and tabs from last time" at startup, I experience a freeze when opening Firefox under certain circumstances.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. With Firefox open, select Tools->Options->Main. Under "When Minefield starts", select "Show my windows and tabs from last time". Hit OK to accept the change.
2. Ensure that Firefox will not open with a dialog when it is restarted; i.e. disable updates, disable the default browser check, etc.
3. Go to the URL:

4. Close Firefox.
5. Open Firefox.
Actual Results:  
With JAWS 9.0.552 loaded, the system begins to lag, taking many seconds to respond to commands. I seem to be able to work around this by hitting ctrl+f repetitively to bring up the find dialog. I *think* Firefox starts consuming a lot of CPU cycles as well, though this is difficult to determine in this state.
With NVDA loaded, NVDA stops responding to commands. However, hitting tab appears to bring everything back to life.
With Narrator or no screen reader loaded, there is no problem.

Expected Results:  
There should be no freeze.

Unfortunately, the issue is rather difficult to isolate and is not consistent. The different behaviour with different screen readers is also somewhat puzzling. Also, I asked a Windows Vista user to try these steps, but the problem did not exhibit itself on this person's system. It is quite possible that this only occurs on my system, though I am unable to fathom why.
