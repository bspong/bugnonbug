Minefield severe failure. URL loading and much functionality is dead.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 Firefox/3.6.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; PPC Mac OS X 10.5; rv:2.0b5pre) Gecko/20100827 Minefield/4.0b5pre

For the last several minefield builds, most recently the one listed above (Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; PPC Mac OS X 10.5; rv:2.0b5pre) Gecko/20100827 Minefield/4.0b5pre) the software has been unusable on my PowerMac G5. URLs typed into the URL field do not attempt to load. Reload icon stays grayed out. Built-in Google search field does nothing when words are entered. Home page is reset to http://www.mozilla.org/projects/minefield/, which is not my home page. None of the remembered pages from the last load are loaded, however they are there when I return to the latest Firefox release. The history shows the proper history, and pages accessed through the History menu do load. The Bookmarks Tool Bar is not displayed, however the bookmarks are visible in the Bookmark menu. "Check for Updates" just searches and appears to never connect. When loading the Bugzilla page through the history, the page is loaded, but clicking Login does nothing (no access apparent). When returning to Firefox, all functionality is retained, with history, bookmarks and home page all exhibiting proper behavior. I have manually downloaded three or four nightly builds over the last two weeks and all of them have exhibited these problems. Nightly builds prior to a few weeks ago gave none of theses problems.
