User interface - history window is refreshed each time a page is loaded

Every time a page is loaded, the history window is refreshed, the view is going back to "Today".
It's annoying because History is used to find a link, but each time a link is opened to check if this is the link we are looking for, we are loosing the current history view, and we are unable to test immediatly the next link in the list without going back to the previous view (and potentially to set up back the sort order).

This bug does not exist if we write something in the search field... but it's useless if we know only a date interval.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click History, Show all history (it opens the History window)
2. select "Yesterday" (for example)
3. double click on a link (an history item)
Actual Results:  
after the page is loaded, the history windows is refreshed, you are no more in "Yesterday" but back in "Today"

Expected Results:  
after the page is loaded, the history windows should not be refreshed, the link clicked must be removed (because it is now in "Today"), but the view must stay in Yesterday (the current item)
