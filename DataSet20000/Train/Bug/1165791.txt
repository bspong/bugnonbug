Steps to reproduce:

I created a simple addon that uses CUI.jsm type view:

https://github.com/Noitidart/MiguelSaldivar

Can install the addon from the repo.

The default location is AREA_NAVBAR. I append an iframe to the panel and set its source to that of a html file in my addon folder. Now on view showing, after 1 sec it does an XHR and then updates the iframe's text to "xhr succesful". and on view hiding it updates the iframes text to "panel closed". So if you do this, then you click the button again, on open, during the initial 1sec, you will not see "panel closed", instead you see as if the src of the iframe was freshly loaded.

If you customize and drag the button to AREA_PANEL, (the tri strip menu panel), then click on the button, it opens the panel and then one sec later it updates to "xhr succesful". Then click back into the main panel arera, then click the button again, you will see for the first second it says "panel closed". This is the expected behavior, we see here it doesn't reload the iframe contents on every view slide open.

I think when opening panel from navbar it should be same, it should not reload the panel contents. 



Expected results:

attached is the repo made into xpi so you can easily install
