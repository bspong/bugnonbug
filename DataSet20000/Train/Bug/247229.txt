Mac OS X 10.3.4
Firebird 0.9.0 (previously running 0.8.0, which did the same thing)
Mozilla 0.6 does not exhibit this behavior.

Local web page served by Apache.  Page is just a simple title and 11 links to
stuff on my hard drive.  (Page can be provided upon request.)

This does not happen with any other browser I have tried (Mozilla, Netscape,
Opera, Omniweb, Safari, or iCab.  Disinclined to believe it is a problem with my
home page since is works correctly with all those other browsers, and if typed in.

Let me know what else you need to reproduce this problem.  (Is there a way to
attach the web page or should I just paste it in this info box.
