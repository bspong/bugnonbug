Having this page open slows down the speed of my computer in this and other applications considerably, making pages freeze, particularly in Entourage

Whenever i open this website it seems to work fine however after a few minutes i notice that my computer processor is making a lot of noise and having to work hard with something. This seems to be particularly bad in this page: http://www.squaremeal.co.uk/advertising/ . In the worst case scenario i have noticed that my other programs (particularly Entourgage) slow to almost 10% of their normal running speed. The only way i can resolve this issues is to shut down firefox. I am not an expert but could it be anything to do with the flash banner ads? Please advise. Thanks

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the webpage i suggest above
2.Open entourage on a mac and start working normally.
3.After around 5 minutes you will notice that entourage is having to work very hard indeed and is working very slowly.

Actual Results:  
As i say above.

Expected Results:  
Allowed all applications to run at normal speed.

I am using the default theme but i am tab browsing at the time each time. I usually have a number of windows open in entourage, at least 5.
