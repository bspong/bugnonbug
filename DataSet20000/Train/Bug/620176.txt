When FireFox starts, it's not loading last session tabs!
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13

This issue seems to be recent,
My general settings have (When Firefox starts, Show my windows and tabs from last time).
Previous versions worked well, even when I had 80 tabs!
Now with only less than 10 tabs, Firefox frequently (daily) forgets these tabs and starts with one tab only, to my default home page.

I have rechecked the settings, and they are still as I described above.
This is getting very annoying, as I have to open the History, and start loading these tabs one by one.
It's not bad when you have a few tabs, but it becomes very ugly when the tabs are many!

It seems to me that this happens when some of the plugins or addons are automatically updated by Firefox.
 
I have Chrome 8 also, and I have loaded it with 95 tabs. It always restored the previous session, with all the tabs. Never missed even once!

Thank you.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I think the answer is pretty obvious for this case. Just use a dozen or more tabs.
2. See text above regarding the plug-ins, add-on components
3.
