Crash when starting java on a particular website

I am seeing a consistently repeatable crash on visualthesaurus.com when looking up a word. Java is working on other websites such as http://www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml but seems to crash the browser on this one.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.visualthesaurus.com/
2. Type a word in the red box with the heading "Look up a Word:"
3. Click the button labeled "LOOK IT UP"
4. Observe the crashiness.
Actual Results:  
The Firefox window closes almost instantly. No dialog box or other message is displayed. When starting Firefox anew, I am invited to restore the session that crashed. That succeeds just fine, but if I try looking up a word again, I get this crash every time.

Expected Results:  
Expected the java applet to work, or at least fail without crashing the whole browser.

At http://www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml I get the following information about my java setup:

Vendor: Sun Microsystems Inc.
Version: 1.6.0_05
Operating System: Windows XP
OS version: 5.1

While writing this, I'm noticing that there are four java icons in the system notification area ("tray") in the bottom right of the screen; presumably one for each browser crash while I was testing and retesting this.
