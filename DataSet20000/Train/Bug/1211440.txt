Steps to reproduce:

Synchro doesn't work properly on my multiples mozilla firefox. I have reinstalled my different firefox on every computer, and created new synchro account, but no matter what synchro account I use, the trouble persist. Right now I am using "pierre.cauderay@romandie.com"
- On my Sony Vaio (windows8.1), it is ok at the moment.
- On my Surface 3 (windows10), when I click on the menu "Modules", firefox tells me "you have none moduled installed" (in french:"vous n'avez aucun module de ce type installé). But it is wrong because there is many and they are active on both firefox (cf printscreen joined bellow).

Before this, I had the same problem with the synchro account "pierre.cauderay@gmail.com". And after a week, I have lost all my add-on on both computers.


Actual results:

(1) during some days, the Menu "Modules" of one of my first computer Firefox tells me "you have none modules installed", even if they work properly. On my second computer firefox, everything is ok.
(2) After some days, the second firefox starts to erase the modules and then they desapear from both computer firefox.


Expected results:

I suspect (but I am not sure) that the problem started after installing the following module:

Which I have uninstalled now, because I didn't know of this version the Proxy-list module was a good one. But the trouble on my firefoxs persist.
How to do now? I have uninstalled both computers, recreated synchro account without succes..
