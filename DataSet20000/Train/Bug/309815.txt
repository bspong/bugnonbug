Firefox 1.0.7 with content negotiation does not go from / to /contact or from
/contact to /  where / initiates file index.php and /contact initiates file
/contact.php (directory must be root and web address with no prefix i.g.
www.site.com or bugs.site.com. site must be site.com) on http://nexuslite.org/ I
put a menu link on the side for bug reproduction. also
http://nexuslite.org/contact the main home link is the other link to try from
the contacts page. However nexuslite.org goes up and down frequently as its my
development site.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. turn on content negotiation on the server (using apache 2.0.45 Win32)
2. in the root directory create contact.php and index.php put the folowing line
in each ->  <a href="/">Home</a><a href="/contact">Contact</a>
3. go to the site in firefox and try and click on the links

Actual Results:  
Nothing! Firefox just keeps trying to load the page but never does

Expected Results:  
Load the page
