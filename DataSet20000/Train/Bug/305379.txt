Bookmarks file truncated in a full hard drive

After a rogue program completely filled my system partition, my bookmarks file
got truncated.

Couldn't say exactly when, I just suddenly saw half my bookmarks had
dissapeared.  Immediately browsed to my profile folder, just to find that the
autobackup was also truncated: I restarted Firefox after the file truncation, it
seems.

I supose this problem could also affect other file saving routines, too, not
only bookmarks.  Strangely, I didn't notice any other odd behavior, I could
browse unhindered.  Maybee Firefox does check free space when caching pages, and
deletes old ones if needed?

You will excuse me if I don't fill my system partition again to reproduce it,
but I got enough weird errors already. ;-)

It seems not a single program I use actually checks for free space: I got plenty
of weird errors because of the filled drive (mostly when programs tried to
create temp files), but no one actually correctly described the actual problem,
had to discover it for myself.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Fill your profile drive.
2. Modify your bookmarks.
3. Cry

Actual Results:  
My bookmarks file was truncated.

Expected Results:  
It should leave the bookmarks file untouched and cry about full drive.
