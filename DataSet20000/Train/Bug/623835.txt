When you go to the url I provided you will see rectangles, some with logos inside. When you click on a rectangle WITHOUT a logo you can see how the dashed focus mark is correctly layed out in the box. When you click one WITH a logo you see how the focus mark goes out of the box. If you visit the url with Google Chrome Browser you can see how the marking is layed out correctly, not depending on hot the logo is positioned. In Firefox the calculations are not correct because the absolute positioned logo is taken out of the normal flow of the page so also the focus should not consider it present in the normal flow. Thanks for reading this. 

Reproducible: Always

1. Please see details I provided, there are not really any steps to do.
Actual Results:  
The dashed marking for a element in focus is not layed out correctly.

Please see the behavior of Google Chrome Browser, which lays out the focus markings as expected.

Please see details, it is all explained there.
