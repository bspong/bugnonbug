Firefox 37 will not allow access to cached pages when offline
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_3) AppleWebKit/600.5.17 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/8.0.5 Safari/600.5.17

Steps to reproduce:

Visit http://m.kaon.com/c/ka/ using Firefox 37 and do the Desktop Install
Run the app
Wait for the "updating..." progress bar to complete
(this is reporting on application cache events)
Quit the app
Disconnect from the network
Run the app
Access different parts of the application such as 3D Product Tours or look at the PDF & Video assets in the bottom section


Actual results:

The results are very inconsistent. In general, loading a different page of the application is unlikely to work. The IFRAME used to display pdfjs for example, or the page change to view a 3D product tour, will often simply not work.


Expected results:

The entire application should be available offline. Note that this was working in Firefox 36, so something broke in the 37 release. We have several apps that work offline, and they are all impacted by this new problem:
m.kaon.com/c/ae
m.kaon.com/c/ib
m.kaon.com/c/sz
m.kaon.com/c/cs
m.kaon.com/c/fj

You can also get similar behavior in the browser. For example, visit:
https://apps.kaonadn.net/5117730592129024/ff_offline.html
and wait for the progress bar to complete. Disconnect from the network and refresh the page. Sometimes it will let you, sometimes it will not. But if it does, you will find that the rest of the application is broken without a network connection because it doesn't use the cache correctly.
