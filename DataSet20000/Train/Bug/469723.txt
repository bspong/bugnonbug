Live Bookmarks cause places.sqlite to grow out of control

I recently noticed my Firefox regularly becoming unresponsive with high disk activity. I investigated and found that the likely culprit was that my places.sqlite had grown to 170MB. I looked inside it and found that the moz_places table had about 280000 more entries than the moz_historyvisits did. Further investigation showed that almost all of these extras had hidden=1 and came from some Live Bookmarks that I forgot I still had (mostly Google News, which updates very frequently). After clearing out all entries with hidden=1 using SQLite Database Browser, my places.sqlite is down to 10MB.

I don't know what reason there is to keep the unvisited Live Bookmarks in Places at all, but if they are going to be kept there there should definitely be a shorter life span for them than normal history items.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. subscribe to some Live Bookmarks (Google News is a good one because it updates very often)
2. sit back and watch your places.sqlite grow and you Firefox speed and responsiveness shrink
