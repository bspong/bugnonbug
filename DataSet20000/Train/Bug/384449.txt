It is impossible to access http://www.el-nacional.com/
This is a newspaper, hence, contents change every day, however, I have never been able to open this page on Firefox. If you succeed one day, try again the next. System is Windows 2000. 

It may seem like the page just has problems loading, however, close Firefox and try to restart. You will be warned that Firefox is already running and it will not restart. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.access http://www.el-nacional.com/
2.when firefox seems stuck, close it
3.try opening firefox again, it will tell you that it is running in the background and will not let you open.
Actual Results:  
Loading of http://www.el-nacional.com/ seems to take forever. You may think it is a problem with the page and close Firefox, however, if you try to restart it you will not be able to. System reports Firefox running already.

Expected Results:  
Should open page. Try opening with Internet Explorer, will work.
