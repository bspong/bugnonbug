In bug 912121 comment 24, Alex mentioned we could move to using a new resource://devtools/:

:glandium has expressed some concerns about this, because as I understand it, implementing this would move all DevTools client files up to the top level omni.ja, increasing file size for other XUL app users.  In our own tree, we can avoid this by not building in the client directory, but someone using "firefox -app foo.ini" could be impacted.

Let's discuss the idea further here.
