Program takes too much time responding when switching back and forth from other programs

When I am moving back and forth from one program to another, Firefox seems to take up to 2 minutes doing something either the programs main cache or distributing memory before I can actually use the program. Before 3 updates ago, it didn't do this, but since this new generation, it does it all the time. In comparison, Safari doesn't do this and can be used in a matter of seconds not minutes. Have you changed how the program uses memory or caches itself before operation?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have a couple of programs open. I have Indesign and Adobe Reader
2. Switch from program to program and try to do anything.
3. One of the websites I was on was istockphotos.com and doing searches for images
Actual Results:  
Slow performance and usability. Must wait minutes until browser is ready for use.

Expected Results:  
Switching from program to Firefox, although I realize shouldn't be instantaneous, but should be ready to go at least in 10 to 20 seconds. Safari is faster.
