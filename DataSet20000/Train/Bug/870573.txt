(Better) compliance with "Designed for Windows" guidelines, less clutter in %ProgramFiles%
User Agent: Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 5.0; U; de) Presto/2.10.289 Version/12.02

Steps to reproduce:

Install Firefox and/or Thunderbird and/or SeaMonkey and/or other Mozilla products.


Actual results:

Every installation creates one or more directories "Mozilla <product>" directly in %ProgramFiles%, and Gecko is installed in each of them.


Expected results:

Use a base directory "Mozilla" in %ProgramFiles% and place the different Mozilla products in subdirectories "Mozilla\<product>".
This complies with the recommendation %ProgramFiles%\<vendor>\<product> of Microsofts "Designed for Windows" guidelines and reduces the number of directories in %ProgramFiles%.

And, if possible: install the common components (like Gecko) either in their own subdirectories below %ProgramFiles%\Mozilla\ or into their own directory in %CommonProgramFiles%\Mozilla\ (that's another requirement/recommendation of the "Designed for Windows" guidelines).

JFTR: please dont try to counter that with "but Microsoft (or another vendor) uses countless directories 'Microsoft <product> in %ProgramFiles%" too: even MSFT should follow its own guidelines!
