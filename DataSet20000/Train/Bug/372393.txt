This bug has rendered Firefox virtually useless to enter web forms, and this
for at least an entire country!!!

Let me explain:
On a Belgian keyboard you need to hit "Alt Gr" + "2", to get the "@"-sign. (To
fill out this email form, I actually had to cut and paste this character !!!)
So any time I want to enter my email address or an accented character in a
form, Firefox opens menus and becomes unresponsive.

For any web transaction, I have to resort to *pera now...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a web page containing a form field
2.On a Belgian keyboard, hit "Alt Gr" + "2" (not on the NumPad) or any other "Alt Gr" key combination
3.
Actual Results:  
A Firefox menu pops up.
Firefox becomes unresponsive, also in other Firefox windows or tabs.
All Firefox windows need to be closed and Firefox restarted in order to recover from this problem.

Expected Results:  
Print the corresponding "@"-character in the form field (or an accented letter in the case of a different "Alt Gr" key combination.
