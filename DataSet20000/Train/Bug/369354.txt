This is a weird bug I get on and off. Now and again, when I'm browsing with a few tabs open and navigate to a new page (clicking a link, submitting a form, whatever), the screen doesn't get redrawn, although I appear to be on the new page -- i.e., it finishes loading, the stop button is greyed, and the title bar updates. But I'm still looking at the last contents of the display buffer -- the scroll bar doesn't respond to clicks.

If I switch to another tab, that tab works fine. But switching back doesn't fix the problem -- it's still stuck showing the same junk.

This happens at various times, including, in some cases, on a new tab that I've just entered a URL into (it locks at a blank grey screen). This is all over X Windows with KDE.

Weirder still, if I close that tab and open a new one to navigate to the same page, the same thing happens. I tried five times to get to news.google.com -- it also happened while I was submitting this bug. Usually it's pretty infrequent.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse for awhile.
2. Open a new tab and navigate.
Actual Results:  
The browser window refused to be redrawn.

Expected Results:  
Draw the page I navigated to.
