After placing, an order online with pizzahut.com, the Printer Friendly link doesn't operate within Firefox 3.0. The function works correctly in Firefox 2.x, and Internet Explorer 7.x. This behavior is also in other websites that use the "Printer Friendly" type of link. One example is Capital One credit cards payment feature. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. On any website that uses a link to produce a "Printer Friendly" version.
2. Click "Printer Friendly" button and/or URL.
3.
Actual Results:  
Browser print interface attempts to launch, but hangs indefinitely. Waited for 10 minutes for pizza hut order to print, but was unable to get it to print. Tried the File/Print menu feature, still wouldn't print, but was different. 

Expected Results:  
Printer Friendly version of website should have opened in a popup window, and printer driver dialog box should have opened.

I was able to get a text only web page to print. Pizza Hut's order confirmation, and Capital One's payment confirmation are heavy on graphics and/or other media content.
