</OBJECT>


Will never render properly it always causes Firefox to either hang or possible to show that code and you can then here the embedded video

but in Safari for Windows and IE it will render the page just fine WMP embedded and all. I did not report it to a broken web site since It has the most current release of Gecko and also Firefox 2.0.0.16 also has this issue do it is not just 3.0.1

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to any website with the above code (there are lots of them)


Actual Results:  
Video plays audio only and sometimes firefox hangs

Expected Results:  
Video is embedded properly like in Safari or IE

Note this also occurs on Ubuntu 8.04 LTS with 3.0.1 and I have no extensions for it and the default theme In windows XP and Vista I have a ton of them and yet that code is the only one that it does not seem to like very much
