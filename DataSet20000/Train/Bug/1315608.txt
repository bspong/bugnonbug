[Note]:
- This is the same behavior as in bug 1194700 but with e10s disabled.

[Affected versions]:
- Firefox 45.5.0ESR
- Firefox 50.0 RC
- Latest Nightly 52.0a1
- Developer Edition 51.0a1

[Affected platforms]:
- Mac OS X 10.12
- Windows 7 64bit
- Windows 10 64bit
- Ubuntu 14.04 32bit

[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Start Firefox
2. Open any PDF (ex: http://www.cbu.edu.zm/downloads/pdf-sample.pdf)
3. Click on predefined zoom level button
4. Hit ESC button to close the dropdown but to keep the focus on it
5. Using left/right arrow keys go through the zoom levels
6. Hit Enter when the values are changed to activate the zoom level selected

[Expected result]:
- All the correct zoom levels are shown while navigating using keyboard.

[Actual result]:
- Between Page Width and 50% zoom levels there is a null value.

[Regression range]:
- This is NOT a recent regression. Not sure if this is an older regression though, I was able to reproduce it on old Nightly from 42.0a1 with e10s disabled, will investigate further ASAP.
