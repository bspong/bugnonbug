The e10s slow script notification bar keeps spontaneously disappearing and reappearing in cycles.
STR:

1. Navigate to infiniteloop2.html from bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1164286 .
2. Wait for several minutes and observe the UI visually.

Observed:

After some seconds, the slow script notification bar appears. When no response is given in some amount of time, the notification bar spontaneously disappears. Then, again after a few seconds, the notification bar appears again, and so on; i.e. the bar keeps appearing and disappearing in cycles.

Excepted:

After presented the first time, the slow script notification bar should be shown as long until a) the user has taken his time to respond to it.

A question is what should happen if the script "resolves" (completes execution and yields back to the event loop) itself before the user has had the time to  respond. E.g. if there is a requestAnimationFrame()-based animation that takes, say, 20 seconds to run through each cycle, then effectively the page is hung, but simply hiding the slow script notification bar after each rAF finishes might not be good user experience. Perhaps the slow script notification bar should autohide itself only if the browser has been idle from running user JS scripts for e.g. >1 seconds?
