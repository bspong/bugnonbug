Error page changes address (try again not working)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Sometimes when Firefox can't resolve a DNS webpage (because of a bad internet connection), it doesn't show the normal error page with the original address, but it changes the address to the error page.

For example, when accessing google reader, the address in the address bar changes to
about:neterror?e=dnsNotFound&u=http%3A//www.google.com/reader/view/&c=UTF-8&d=Firefox%20can't%20find%20the%20server%20at%20www.google.com.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a page on a bad internet connection so that the DNS reques doesn't resolve
2. Wait for the internet connection to get better
3. Click "Try again"
Actual Results:  
The *error page* is refreshed, instead of the original page (this can be simulated by loading the about:neterror url directly)

Expected Results:  
Clicking "Try again" refreshes the original url (opening the original URL in a new tab works).

To sum it up: The "about:neterror" address should never appear in the address bar directly. I never encountered this problem until FF3.5.
