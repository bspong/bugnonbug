I had only FF running. No other apps or windows open.
I accidentaly switchet with ALT+TAB to desktop, back to FF, back to desktop and finally back to FF. But the FF window did not show up anymore.
It is there, with size 0,0 in the upper left corner of the screen.
It responds ok (press alt and then cursor down to see the menus for example).
But the window does not show up. If you maximize it by right-clicking on the FF icon in the task bar it comes up, but if you 'restore' it, it disappears again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close all windows and applications
2. Launch just FF. Open any page. Do not maximize the window.
3. With ALT+TAB, switch to desktop.
4. Release ALT+TAB.
5. Re ALT+TAB to FF.

You have to repeat steps 3..5 a few times, depending how fast you do it.
Mostly it takes 2 switches, but sometimes 6.
Actual Results:  
Hidden FF window.

Expected Results:  
Nothing.
