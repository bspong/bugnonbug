A page served by mapserver doesn't open and instead closes the page and logs out of internal web based java application

We use a java /  web based application which relies on mapserver to read and render spatial information in the form of polygons, lines and points. To access the page, our application uses a tab to access the map. previously in Firefox 3.6.11 this worked fine. After the update to 3.6.12 it is now broken, and immediately logs out of the application completley (the apps own 'are you sure you wish to exit' dialog box) and returns to the internal apps login web page. If you cancel the login you are presented with a dialog box which contains the text 'Session Timeout' Your mapping session has timed out. To reconnect, press the button below' (button is labelled 'Reconnect') Pressing this button results in a blank window. This all happens instantly after each user interaction. There is no reason for any time out to occur. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Login to internal java application which uses mapserver to render a map in one part of the application
2. App immediatly asks if you are sure if you want to log out Either logs out if you hit OK, or returns the timeout error listed above if you hit cancel.
Actual Results:  
Exactly the same behaviour

Expected Results:  
Exactly the same (isn;t this the definition of insanity - doing the same thing and expecting a different result ;-)!)
