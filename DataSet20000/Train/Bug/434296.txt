Hi,

I use Lotus Notes as webmail at work [1].

Since beta5 (also checked wih recent RC1) there are some major problems using it. F.e. just after emails list is shown the [2] error dialog appears, same when trying to add file attachments and in many other times.

This makes me firefox 3beta5 (or 3rc1) inusable to work with.

This occurs in Firefox 3b5 and 3rc1, both under Fedora Linux 8 & 9 and Windows XP, independent of the theme. I tested Fedora 9 firefox 3b5 package and mozilla's web, it's the same again.
It worked ok in Firefox 3b4 in both platforms.
