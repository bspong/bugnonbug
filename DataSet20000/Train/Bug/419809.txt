Starting up Firefox with tabs from a previous session where one of the tabs requires digest authentication blocks the startup process with a login dialog half off screen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set option when Firefox starts: "show my windows and tabs from last session"
2.Browse to a site that requires digest authentication and login.
3.Quit Firefox
4.Start Firefox


Actual Results:  
Note that dialog for login/password is centered on the top left of the screen and half of it is off screen making it unusable.   Firefox main window is not yet visible.   If you click the cancel button (which is visible) Firefox continues the startup process.

Expected Results:  
Dialog should not appear until Firefox main window is visible so that the sheet has a window to attach to...  Alternatively the login dialog should be a standalone window instead of a sheet if it is invoked before the Firefox main window is visible.
