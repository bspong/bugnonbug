Clicking in a link opens a new browser window, then starts stuffing it with tabs--stuttering--as fast as it can. Close one window doing that, and it opens another and starts stuffing it with tabs.

Clicking on a link in a website I'm viewing in Firefox opens a new view window, then starts opening tabs, in it, something like three or seven or 12 per second. If I click the close-window x, it stops; it once opened 386 tabs before I got it stopped. Then it asks me if I want to close all 386 tabs, and allo I can do is close them all, including the original that I usually need to get back to.
   The last time this happened (ten minutes ago) I would close one browser window, and it would open another and start stuffing it with tabs. We went around that loop a dozen times before I gave up and just held down the power button on my computer to shut it down.
   This is big badness. I'm not computer savvy enough to give you more. If you need more, try phoning me at 503 251 4853.
