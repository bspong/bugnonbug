Dragging text from an extrnal editor like Notepad++ to Firefox does not work.

Dragging to anywhere in the page will result in a message that asks the users if they want to stop running a script.

Dragging the text to a textfield in a form makes Forefox hang, unable to quit, forces the user to kill the process.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open an text-editor that allows selected text to be dragged, like Notepad++
2. Type some text and try to drag it to a website in Firefox

Actual Results:  
Firefox gives a warning about scripts, continue running scripts will cause it to hang.

If the drop target is a text field Firefox will hang and no lnoger accept any events from the user.

Expected Results:  
When Dragging text to the website nothing should happen, or display it as a text file. Unless it is a URL, Firefox should attempt to open that page.

Dragging text to a textfield should set the text as the value for that field.
