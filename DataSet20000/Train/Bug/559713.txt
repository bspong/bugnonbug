I was using a bulletin board that I have visited very extensively on my old XP machine and on this Windows 7 machine previously.  Over the last week or so (perhaps a little more) when I right click on a link, most often the pop-up box that would let me "Open in a new Tab" (among other things) does not appear, but rather I can see only part of the outline of the drop-down menu.  If I then try to close Firefox, it won't close or minimize.  However, I am able to click on links and they will open in the same tab, and I am able to use the Back button, but I still cannot minimize or close the program, and the right-click still won't work.  As I said, I use this site extensively (www.cruisecritic.com) and this appears to be a newer problem than this computer (which is only a month or so old).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Join the "Boards" at www.cruisecritic.com
2. Visit any of the pages
3. Try to right-click on any of the links, it will work sometimes but it seems to be working less and less often.
Actual Results:  
Right-click does not work, and program will not minimize or close -- I have to use Task Manager to close the program.

If I am trying to minimize or close the program, the appropriate button brightens, but the program does nothing.

Expected Results:  
If you right-click a link a drop-down menu should appear.  Of if I try to minimize or close the program, it should minimize or close.
