Firefox replaces 404 page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; FreeBSD amd64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.16) Gecko/20110411 Firefox/3.6.16
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; FreeBSD amd64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.16) Gecko/20110411 Firefox/3.6.16

If you open the above url in firefox 3.6.16 instead of the correct page you see the firefox-specified 404 error page, which appears to have come from https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=482874. (That bug is not marked fixed, I was unable to figure out whether it was implemented or not.)

Opening the same url in opera displayed asrock's 404 error page, which is the expected behavior.

Setting network.error-pages.http404.override as mentioned in 482874 did not alter firefox's behavior.

I found browser.xul.error_pages.enabled pref, setting it to false produces an alert box (!) instead of showing the page as it was served by the web server.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.asrock.com/support/index.htm

Actual Results:  
See asrock's 404 error page.

Expected Results:  
See firefox's 404 message and/or alert box.

I wish you would stop turning firefox into an ie/chrome clone. Firefox has become the present day version of mozilla browser that phoenix was created from.
