pdf file not saved
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140806164912

Steps to reproduce:

1) Go to any web page (for example: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/).
2) Try to print to a PDF file:
File > Print... > Print to File > Print
(you must not change any value in the print dialog)


Actual results:

The file should be saved into: "/home/[username]/mozilla.pdf".


Expected results:

Instead of that, the file is not saved at all.
As a proof, you can try again the above steps and you will see that Firefox does not ask you for overwriting the file.
It means that the first file has not been saved at all.

Workaround:
Each time you need to print to a PDF, the workaround I found is to do:
File > Print... > Print to File > Save in Folder > Other...
Then here you select the same folder (/home/[username]) than the default folder.
Then you can click on "Print".
The file is saved into: "/home/[username]/mozilla.pdf".

Similar bug:
A similar bug is:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=526811
But there is a big difference with this bug: Firefox remembers all my printing settings.
They are correctly displayed in the user interface.
It is just the final result which is wrong: The file is not saved at all.

Remark:
Printing to a PS file works fine.
Probably because Firefox never remember the file name for a PS file, so I need to fill manually the value each time I need to print to a PS file.
