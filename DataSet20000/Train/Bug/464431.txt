 hi,
pl look into this scenario:

say i have my firefox window in workspace-1. and another application (say) pidgin in workspace-2.  whenever i receive some http links in IM windows, clicking them would cause my firefox to be pulled to workspace-2 and then firefox only lies there without focus. After i press 'alt+tab' it gets focus. It is the same issue when i click links from 'openoffice.org-documents' also.

This is causing me lot of inconvenience, as i usually work with multiple
workspaces.

hope this gets fixed asap for this would be having definite user impact.

regards.
