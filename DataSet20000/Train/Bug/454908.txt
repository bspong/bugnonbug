If browser.sessionstore.privacy_level is set to either 1 (default) or 0 some extra page details, including form data, are stored in sessionstore.js. This _includes_ fields whose type is marked "password," and this is done in plaintext.

This occurs regardless of a user's "remember password" settings, whether they have a master password set or not, or whether they have form autofill turned on or not.

While I agree that for many cases this is good behaviour (e.g. for large forms), and that setting privacy level to 1 reduces the chance of highly secure passwords becoming stored, I believe that an exception should be made for password fields in _all_ cases. This is especially important in a world where users often have the same password for https and other, less secure, protocols.

I in fact came accross this problem using the Remote PwdHash form (https://www.pwdhash.com) saved to a USB stick, so that the URL had a file:// prefix, so privacy level set to 1 issued me no protection. This problem is a significant threat to such a strategy since it can leave a user's master password, in plaintext, on disk.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to a page with a password field, that is not https://
2. Enter "testpassword" into the password field
3. Execute `cd ~/.mozilla/firefox`
4. Execute `grep -R testpassword *`
5. Observe.
Actual Results:  
sessionstore.js contains the string "testpassword"

Expected Results:  
No copy of the password string should be found (at least not in relation to the one just entered in the password field)

A workaround is to set browser.sessionstore.privacy_level to 2, and prevent _any_ form data being stored from any page. However this loses the advantages (mentioned above) of such a feature.
