Screen goes blank shortly after pages with videos load.

Everytime I attempt to load a page on certain websited that includes an area/screen playing a video (such as the page on the example above), the screen goes blank immediateliy after having loaded (but the sound/music still keeps playing), however if you enhance the video area to full screen (before it has loaded completely and started playing) it plays fine. This happens everytime with some webpages like Yahoo Music, but not others like Youtube. I have attempted using Internet Explorer instead and the page plays fine (like it is suppose to) as well as using Firefox on another computer, with the same problem occuring, so this is definitely a problem with Firefox rather than a hardware problem.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.simply start firefox and open any video on Yahoo music, like typing in the URL http://new.music.yahoo.com/green-day/videos/view/21-guns--217248964
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
the same happens everytime (blank screen unless you enhance screen til full size before it has finished loading)

Expected Results:  
see above

It should have played the video without the screen going blank
