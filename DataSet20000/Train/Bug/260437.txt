"Set as Wallpaper" changes wallpaper for all users (should not save in windows directory)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10

Because it appears that Firefox uses a single wallpaper file:
C:\Windows\Firefox Wallpaper.bmp

If a PC contains multiplul user accounts, and each user has used Firefox to
change their wallpaper. When one user changes their wallpaper using the "Set as
Wallpaper" option in Firefox, it will change the wallpaper for every other user.

Instead of having every user's wallpaper linked to "C:\Windows\Firefox
Wallpaper.bmp" it would be better to have a single wallpaper file specific to
each user account on the PC.

Occurs only if each user has used Firefox to set their wallpaper.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in to any user account on the system
2. Launch Firefox and use the "Set as Wallpaper" option
3. Use the Windows "Switch User" function to quickly go into another user account
4. Launch Firefox and use the "Set as Wallpaper" option
5. Log out of the second user account and log back into the original user account
6. The wallpaper will now be the same as the one set in the 2nd user account.

Actual Results:  
Wallpaper for all users who have used Firefox to set their wallpaper will be
changed.

Expected Results:  
Each individual user should retain their own wallpaper.

Would be beneficial to have this fixed by 1.0 because I imagne that its simple
things like this that would cause users to switch back to IE.
