Minimize, Resize and Close are missing when FF3 opens; Panels (top & bottom) covered (Ubuntu)
User-Agent:       Opera/9.27 (X11; Linux i686; U; en)

UBUNTU 8.04 w/all updates (as of 25 Sep), default theme, desktop effects enabled, FF3.0.2 with Multimedia enabled for FF as per UBUNTU Forum instructions to be able to watch YouTube. The Firefox part of the window that has the File, Edit, View, History, Bookmarks, Tools & Help is greyed out and the Minimize, Resize and Close buttons are missing (is that a Titlebar?) The upper right corner of the window shows the "wait a moment" symbol but it does not revolve and the symbol is greyed out. The upper and lower Panels for the UBUNTU desktop are covered over. When I click "Help", "About Mozilla Firefox" the "About Mozilla Firefox" window appears, the upper and lower Panels for UBUNTU Desktop reappear and the Titlebar with File, Edit...Help disappears. I used Synaptic to reinstall Firefox, but it is still the same behavior.

If I open a second tab, it still behaves the same.

If I select F11 for full-screen, then F11 for normal appearance the Minimize, Resize and Cose buttons reappear but the Tilebar is still greyed out.

The same behavior is reported on Ubuntu Form for FF3.0.1

Recently (3 days ago?) updated to FF3.0.2. Viewing YouTube when problem started.
