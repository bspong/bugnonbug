Firefox allows website to install Trojan just by visiting a particular webpage
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.9) Gecko/2009040821 Firefox/3.0.9
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.9) Gecko/2009040821 Firefox/3.0.9

NOTE: I understand that I am using a slightly older version of Firefox, however, for obvious reasons I don't want to upgrade Firefox just to try to visit the site again and see if I get infected again!

I visited the website: http://knowfree.net/2006/10/21/memory-optimizer-paul-sheele-paraliminals-full-9cds.kf and shortly thereafter I saw signs that I was being infected by a Trojan or virus: my anti-virus program was disabled, my Windows firewall was turned off, IE was opened with marketing sites popping up (had to close them via task manager), as well as an "incosnet.tmp" process taking up a lot of the processing cycles.

I also tried to download http://rapidshare.de/files/37281199/RapidUp_CD_1.rar on that page, but the request timed out (or maybe gave me a 404, I don't remember) so I don't think it was that -- it seems to be the knowfree site I visited which installed the Trojan.

The thing that sticks out to me now is that the extension on the page is not htm or html, but rather kf


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Note: don't try these steps unless you are in a controlled environment and are willing to be infected by a Trojan!

1. Visit http://knowfree.net/2006/10/21/memory-optimizer-paul-sheele-paraliminals-full-9cds.kf
2. Get infected by Trojan.

Note: I am not set up to have the luxury of being infected by a Trojan again, so I was not actually able to try these steps again.
Actual Results:  
Got infected by the "incosnet.tmp" Trojan (perhaps also known as Virtumonde) - installed several other files (including startup files) on my computer as well

Expected Results:  
Firefox should not allow a site to infect a user with a Trojan merely by visiting the site.
