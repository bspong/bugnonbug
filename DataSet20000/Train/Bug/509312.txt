It's valid HTML 5 to put any non-interactive element inside of a link.  So I can how wrap a link around an h1 and h2 together.

In Firefox (and Minefield) this works fine, until you nest a section element inside an a element.  If you use this markup, Firefox's parser rearranges the DOM breaking DOM layout the author intended (the result is similar to the Gecko bug where it couldn't parse unknown elements).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Nest a section element within an a element, eg:

<a href="#">
 <section>
  <p>p nested in a section wrapped in a link</p>
 </section>
</a>

Actual Results:  
Firefox rearranges the DOM as follows (from the above example):

<a href="#">
 <section></section>
</a>
<p>
 <a href="#">p nested in a section wrapped in a link</a>
</p>
<a href="#"></a>

It also closes an open elements upon encountering the section element (in the live example: http://jsbin.com/upiza - you'll see the article element has also been closesd).

Expected Results:  
It shouldn't rearrange the DOM and try to correct DOM.  

Using Minefield and html5.enable set to true, the parser correctly renders the layout.
