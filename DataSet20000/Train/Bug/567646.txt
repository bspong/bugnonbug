Warning: RDFItemUpdater:_parseV20UpdateInfo: No updates were found for:
chromeditplus@webdesigns.ms11.net
If you are an Extension developer and were expecting there to be
updates, this could mean any number of things, since the RDF system
doesn't give up much in the way of information when the load fails.
Try checking that:
 1. Your RDF File is correct - e.g. check that there is a top level
    RDF Resource with a URI urn:mozilla:extension:{GUID}, and that
    the <em:updates> listed all have matching GUIDs.
