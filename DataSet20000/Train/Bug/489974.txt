Drag-Scrolling (Command+Option) breaks keyboard shortcuts

With Swedish Keyboard layout the characters [ and ] are produced by pressing Option+8 and Option+9 respectively.

This means, in order to Navigate Back/Forward you have to press Command+Option+8 and Command+Option+9.

But on Mac OS X Command+Option triggers Drag-scrolling (the little hand appears), so the shortcuts for Back/forward navigation do not work.


While I am not 100% sure this is the cause of my problems, I have Backward/Forward Navigation working in other applications so this is my educated guess (Also have keyboard Navigation working with British keylayout in Firefox...).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press and Hold Command.
2. Press and Hold Option.
3. Press and release 8 (or 9 for Forward navigation).
4. Release Command and Option.
Actual Results:  
If Backward navigation is possible, the History menu flickers.
If Backward navigation is NOT possible (new session, no history) the Error sound will be heard.

Expected Results:  
It should have navigated Backwards one step. Just like pressing the Back-button.

This would have been fine if you only could turn off the drag-scrolling feature (because i dont personally use this. I'd rather have working Navigation!)

But i could not find any option for this in Settings/About:config (missed it?).
