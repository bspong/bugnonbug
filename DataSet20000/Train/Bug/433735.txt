Illegal Character ????? when reloading page after ajax submission
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404 Firefox/2.0.0.14

When I submit a form via an AJAX request, which reloads the entire contents of the browser window in this scenario, I am then unable to do a successful reload when viewing the destination page.  Instead, the reload results in the inability to load any external documents referenced by the page, even though the initial page visit loaded them just fine.

I have reproduced the problem in a very simple example at the URL above.  To reproduce the problem -- see the "Steps to Reproduce" below

Although no error is present regarding the stylesheet, I would guess that the same problem preventing the javascript file from reloading is also preventing the stylesheet from loading, evidenced by the red background switching to white.

If you instead click the "Works" link, which effectively loads the destination page without AJAX involvement, you will be able to reload the page without issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the URL http://www.nashnet.net/ScriptIssueWeb/start.jsf
2. Click "Fails"
3. Click Reload
Actual Results:  
You will notice that after the reload click the red background switches to white.  Additionaly, if you start the javascript console you will see the message:

Error: illegal character
Source File: http://www.nashnet.net/js/tools.js Line: 1
?????????????....

It would seem that upon reload, Firefox may believe the files have a different encoding type.

Expected Results:  
The background should remain red and no javascript error should occur.
