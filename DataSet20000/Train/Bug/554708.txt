Generally speaking, a lot of complaints against any software happens because people get set in their ways. Even though new ways of doing things might be better, there are rarely situations where the old behaviour cannot be supported.

Examples include:

(a) Control-shift delete. This behaviour used to clear the cache without a dialog. Now it prompts the user with a dialog to confirm. It would be great if the developers had included a "[ ] Remember this setting." checkbox so that the old behaviour could be retained.

(b) Open links in new tabs. The old behaviour used to be a new tab is opened at the end of the list of tabs. The new behaviour opens tabs beside the current tab. The Tools >> Options >> Tabs menu could have included a "[X] New tabs open beside current tab" checkbox.

Unless the underlying implementation is so horrid that it should be wiped off the planet, consider keeping the old behaviour around with a way to re-enable it.

Reproducible: Always
