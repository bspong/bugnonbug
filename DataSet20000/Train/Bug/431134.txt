In the demonstration file provided, an XSL Transformation is performed with very basic XML and XSL files.

What works:
Call the page http://sandbox.baseclip.com/test_xslt_problem_isolated.html
When you refresh the page the transformation still works. The output is "Node1Node2".

What does not work:
Call the page http://sandbox.baseclip.com/test_xslt_problem_isolated.html#hash
Then refresh the page. You get a blank page. The importStylesheet() call is failing with the following message:

[Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004001 (NS_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED) [nsIXSLTProcessor.importStylesheet]" nsresult: "0x80004001 (NS_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED)" location: "JS frame :: :: init :: line 1" data: no]

The XSL transformation does not work on Firefox 2.0.0.14 when refreshing a page with an anchor. It works on Firefox 3.0 beta 5.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Call the page http://sandbox.baseclip.com/test_xslt_problem_isolated.html#hash
2. Refresh the page
3. 
Actual Results:  
You get a blank page. The XSL transformation did not work.

Expected Results:  
Calling the page without any anchor you get the result of the XSL Transformation ("Node1Node2"). Calling the page with the anchor "hash" we should get the same result and not a blank page.

As explained above, calling the page with an anchor I get the following error from importStylesheet():

[Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004001 (NS_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED) [nsIXSLTProcessor.importStylesheet]" nsresult: "0x80004001 (NS_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED)" location: "JS frame :: :: init :: line 1" data: no]
