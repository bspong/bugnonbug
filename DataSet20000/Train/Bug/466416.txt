On pages without fixed-width, right side cut off if Firefox window width is below 1039 pixels and viewport below 1031.

This is *not* a code error. I notice it on many websites, and I was able to recreate it with almost *no* content in the page (it originally happened using CSS with left-div fluid width and right-div fixed).

I thought I could avoid this bug by reverting to old-fashioned (but simple) tables, but that does not solve it. It does not matter if the table is 100% width or less, the right column gets cut off.

It is only 2 columns, and the only content is a 330-px wide logo in the first cell/column. The other cells only have a single, non-breaking space. There is *no other content*.

I set all the margins (on page, table, image) to 0. I set cellpadding and cellspacing to 0 and border to 1. The first column is fluid and the 2nd is 200px.

Contrary to your wiki explanation on bug-posting that says you can upload files, I don't see that option, so to recreate this just use a comparable-size image. It seems like even though "vspace" and "hspace" are set to 0, Firefox is insisting on leaving space on either side of it equal to the image width...except it happens even if I remove the image tag.

Below is my HTML code. I did not alter it except to strip out personal information in title and meta-tags.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Copy and paste HTML above and save as HTML.
2. Include an image of about same size (or not, doesn't seem to matter).
3. Open in Firefox 2.0.0.18 (or other 2.0.x)
4. Resize the browser window (either by manually dragging or using Web Developer extension (either way has the same effect).
Actual Results:  
Below 1039-pixel browser window width and 1031-pixel viewport width, table will get cut off. Height does not affect the problem at all. Above those numbers, table adjusts the way it should upon resizing.

Expected Results:  
The table should fit within the window automatically.

Also happens on other sites with fluid layouts, though this sample is so simple there is no bug in it -- it is a simple table, I removed all margins, spacing, and padding from all elements.

I do not use any themes.

This has been a persistent problem on FF 2.0.x, I've just been too overwhelmed with school to report it before now.

Even on real websites with content, where the text continues off the screen, no horizontal scrollbar appears, which makes the problem worse -- there is *no way* to read the cut-off text.
