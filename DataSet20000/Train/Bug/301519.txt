If you customize your toolbar to have the url bar beside your personal bookmarks
(very common for people who has migrated from IE) and minimize the window to the
taskbar on Windows, every time a live bookmarks refresh occurs, the personal
bookmarks will disappear and you will have only the url bar and the chevron on
your Bookmarks Toolbar.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a new profile.
2.Customize your toolbar putting the urlbar and the go button on the left side
of your personal bookmarks on Bookmarks Toolbar. Please see the attached image
that describes the toolbar appearance.
3.Open a new window (Ctrl+N can do the job).
4.Go to the first window you've opened and minimize it to your taskbar.
5.On the second window, right click the "Latest Headlines" folder and choose
"Reload Live Bookmark".
6.Maximize the first window.
5.Go to the second window

Actual Results:  
The urlbar is expanded and the personal bookmarks "Getting Started" and "Latest
Headlines" disappear into the chevron. Please see attached image.
