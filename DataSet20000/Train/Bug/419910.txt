I have recently installed FF 2.0.0.12 on my new (less than a month-old) Compaq Presario B1200. Images downloaded are badly pixelated and low-res, stretched out in the placeholders. Properties on right-click shows the low-res versions of the image downloaded. 

IE downloads these images perfectly. Seems to happen only with .jpg files. 

I have tried deinstalling and reinstalling FF at least thrice. The same thing is happening on Apple's Safari browser too. 

I use a ZTE CDMA1X wireless dial-up modem to connect to the Internet, service provider is Reliance Communications, India. 

I am a regular user of FF same version on my office PC. Everything works perfectly there. Being forced to use IE7. Any solutions? 

Can provide screenshots and sysinfo if needed. 

thanks, regards, cordially,
