It seems Firefox running on PC with Windows XP PRO EN SP2 with 2 or more tabs
open doesn't restore normally after "hibernate". Every instance of Firefox loses
ability to make new connections. After closing all instances sometimes it
resurrects and starts working normally, but more frequent practice is that
reboot is required. When rebooting several 'XP-COM not responding' windows are
popped up, sometimes hanging up the system. In such cases 'firefox.exe' is seen
in task manager, but task manager is unable to terminate it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have firefox run with some different open tabs and pages loaded.
2. Go to hibernate.
3. Start the system up.
4. Try to open new tab in firefox.
5. Now see - connection attempt lasts forever.
6. Open new instance of firefox, try to browse.
7. same as (6)
8. Close all firefox instances.
9. After 5 minutes see - probably there is firefox.exe running in task manager.
10. Try to kill it. Explorer crashes.

Actual Results:  
same as described in details.

Expected Results:  
work after hibernate as expected.

XPCOM not responding windows is frequently popped up after performing steps
mentioned above.
