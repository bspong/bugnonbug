I have cookies disabled. You need cookies to log in to myspace. When I make an exception to allow myspace.com and nb.myspace.com to set cookies it still doesn't log me in. Well, actually I think it does, but it won't let me click on "home", it just keep taking me back to the main page. If I enabled cookies it works fine. When I view the saved cookies I can't see any other myspace related cookies that I should make exceptions for. Therefore I reckon it's a bug. 

p.s. the advanced tab in preferences - the nested tabs (general, network, update...) look strange in linux (ubuntu)

thanks!
