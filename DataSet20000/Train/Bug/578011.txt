After installing 4.0 Beta the first issue was speed.  It took about 3,000 ms to load.  I have a p8400 64 bit processor.   When searching on Google I opened the "everything" option to do a search for the last week.  It would not open.  3.6 works fine.   This seems to be a serious issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.close firefox - open   - Go to Google search "everything"  
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Date sensitive option would not opn

Expected Results:  
to view the list on the left which states:  ANYTIME, Latest, Past 24 hours, past week, past month, past years, custom range

This is a KEY feature of Google it may be a 64 bit issue.  The other computer (Netbook 32 bit Atom processor) does not have this issue but Firefox Beta 4.0 remains slower than 3.6   

Also, Having the TABS at the new location many not be the best solution.  Many of us prefer to have the tabs near the screen and not near the menu.  With the tabs out of the area of the screen one could forget about them.   It would be nice to have an option to place the tabs where the user wishes.
