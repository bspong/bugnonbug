When composing an email, the addresses and title line work fine, but you can't select or type in the area of the body of the text.

In my case I switched to a text only editor, which worked fine, added my attachment, which switches out of the compose screen to select the item, and then attach it, and once the attachment is completed, switches back to the compose screen.

At this point the box for he body of text shows my text from the text editor and would let me type and change the style of text as well.

I then did this 3 times to make sure that it would recover in this way, and that the error is in the initial opening of the compose page.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. login to the email account at rock.com
2. Press compose button
3. Click empty blank box under text formatting buttons, around middle of screen, and you will be unable to type there.
4. click "Plain text editor" window is accessible, type something.
5. Click attachment button, brings up a new screen
6. Put in name of a file
7  Click "attach" and screen returns to compose screen
8. Click in body of email and can type, format what text you typed previously.

This demonstrates the bug where it doesn't work, and that it can work if you use another feature of the email.
Actual Results:  
It repeatedly fails to let me enter anything in the body of the text until I do the other steps.

Expected Results:  
Allowed me to type in the box in order from entering the email address, to the title line, to the body of the email, before attachment.

None.
