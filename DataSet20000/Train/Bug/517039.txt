Open Browser hogs system memory usage and slows system down

Each time the browser is left open for any length of time the system memory usage continues to increase to the point that the Firefox browser slows down the entire Windows operating system. Forcing me to CLOSE the Firefox browser if I want to stop the system CPU memory from reaching and staying at 100% CPU Usage. Once I close the Firefox browser and restart it. It's fine for a while. This problem is consistent. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Firefox browser
2. Leave Firefox open for extended periods
3. Forced to close Firefox when I need to continue working with active tabs.
Actual Results:  
If I close the Firefox browser and restart it, it's fine for a while. However, if I leave the browser open for a length of time this problem repeats itself and becomes a real nuisance. 

The Firefox browser seems to reset and doesn't effect the operating system for a short time, but if left open for an extended period of time the system memory continues to climb and the higher it goes the slower the entire operating system becomes. 

Expected Results:  
The Firefox browser should not be interfering with the Windows operating system and slowing down all computer functions while open. 

Firefox should not consistently be building on system memory use and HOGGING the CPU's memory to the point that it slows down the entire operating system to the point it is not functional. If left unattended for any length of time it slows the operating system to the point that everything freezes and stops functioning for several minutes between keystroke or mouse clicks.
