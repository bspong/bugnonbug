Shopping cart now only holds one item at a time.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:34.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/34.0
Build ID: 20141126041045

Steps to reproduce:

Go to http://www.LeeAaron.com/store/
Click any item to Add To Cart.
Click another item to Add To Cart.


Actual results:

The first item is knocked out of the Cart and replaced by the second item. This appears to go on infinitely, as every time a new item is added to the Cart, the last item is removed. Not just in the display, but also at the Checkout, the total price reflects items knocked out of the Cart. (Cart can be viewed simultaneously with the Store page by clicking the Menu icon in the top left corner.)


Expected results:

All items clicked on should be listed in the Shopping Cart.
This works as it should in Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera. And it worked in Firefox up until this week, when Firefox updated itself. For this reason, I believe this is a valid bug in Firefox.
I am the webmaster for this site, so I can tell you it is a WordPress-based site (latest version of WordPress being used) and the Store is using a slightly modified version of MarketPress Lite plugin. I removed the modifications and had the same results, so put them back. This problem also happens in Firefox's Safe Mode.
