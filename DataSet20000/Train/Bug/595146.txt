"Single window" mode for Firefox
This bug suggests implementing a "single window" mode for Firefox, where every web page was a tab in the same top-level window. Turning it on would change the behaviour as follows:

- Ctrl-N instead does a Ctrl-T, and equivalent for other access points
- All JS-invoked new windows become new tabs (this is, I believe, currently 
  true in some cases anyway)

This suggestion was provoked by the news that the "all windows" version of Panorama is not going to ship in Firefox 4. I think such a mode - which solves the problem of making Panorama cover "all windows" by having only one window - would be a useful substitute and possibly much easier to implement. 

I'll _want_ Panorama to include all my tabs - and so multiple windows becomes an inconvenience rather than a method of organization. I now have a new, better method of organization. And yet sites, and my own muscle memory, will sometimes create new windows when I'd rather they/it didn't. This feature would prevent that, thereby making Panorama work much more smoothly and reliably for me.

I am not familiar with the code, but I know we already have code and prefs to determine when a new window is created and when a new tab, and perhaps it would not be hard to make that code choose "new tab" every time.

Would this be a significant amount of work?
