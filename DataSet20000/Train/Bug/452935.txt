the repeated navigation toolbar problem has been reported but the thing is when i try to reinstall firefox goes back to normal. but after shut down and reboot the next day, same problem arises. after reinstalling latest version thrice, the excess toolbar is still there. in addition, the dropdown menu for tools is blank but for the other menus like file, bookmarks history etc, they're intact. same for right click button. ( see attached image file. repeated toolbar does not look like those reported. this takes up more space and takes up 1/3 of the screen. )

in addition, unable to open links in new window but able to open in new tab. (via Ctrl+T but unable to open new window via Ctrl+W since unable to use right-click menu) shows the vista loading page circular mouse icon but page does not show up.

1. reinstall, reboot, problem solved
2. reboot system, same problem, reinstall, reboot, problem solved
3. reboot system, same problem, reinstall, reboot, problem solved
