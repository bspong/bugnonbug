Search suggestions prompt breaks accessibility of location bar suggestions
(Spun off bug 1190368 comment 27.)

STR:
1. In about:config, ensure that browser.urlbar.userMadeSearchSuggestionsChoice is false.
2. Focus the location bar.
3. Type anything that will cause search suggestions to appear.
4. Press down arrow to focus a suggestion.
5. Observe that an accessibility focus event is fired.
6. Retrieve the accessible for this event.
Expected: The accessible for the suggestion list item focused in step 4.
Actual: A broken oleacc client accessible.

The list appears in a separate MozillaDropShadowWindowClass HWND. However, when the search suggestions prompt is displayed, WM_GETOBJECT returns the label for the search suggestions prompt and accChild for the search list items fails on this label accessible.

When the search suggestions prompt is *not* displayed, the list works as expected. In that case, WM_GETOBJECT on the MozillaDropShadowWindowClass returns the list (as expected) and therefore accChild works.

:Gijs noted, "The prompt is inside the listbox because that makes visual sense." As far as accessibility is concerned, the label isn't inside the richlistbox; it is a sibling of it. It certainly makes sense that accChild on this label would fail for the list items.

The question is why WM_GETOBJECT is returning the label; i.e. why the label is considered the root accessible for this HWND. I'm guessing there should really be a parent of both the label and the list which is considered the root accessible for the HWND. accChild on this parent should work to retrieve any of its descendants.

Marking as a regression because although this search suggestions stuff is new functionality, it effectively breaks the location bar autocomplete for users who haven't dismissed the search suggestions prompt.
