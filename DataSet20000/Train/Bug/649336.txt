menu bar disappears when switching between full-screen windows (ion3)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

There is a regression between Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 4, which makes Firefox 4 difficult to use in full screen under ion3 (and other tab/keyboard based window managers, probably).

The menu bar vanishes when the window manager toggles back into a full-screen firefox 4. 

The menu bar can be restored by toggling the firefox into a window, and then issuing 'F11' to force the firefox to recognize that it's back in a window.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

It seems that the menu bar disappears under following circumstances (Tested on ion3 window manager):

1) A Firefox Window is made full-screen (either via F11 or via ion3-specific Mod1+Enter) 

So far - so good. The tabs autohide, but reappear together with the menu bar when cursor reaches top of the screen. 

2) The ion3-specific workspace change command is issued [Mod1+,, Mod1+., Mod1+1 etc] (I would test and comment later tonight if it's reproducible in gnome or kde in a similar manner), to a non-firefox window/workspace.

3) The workspace is changed back to firefox. The autohide now restores only the tab-bar and the navigation toolbar, the menu bar.. vanishes. 

3a)Corollary - if the about:config browser.fullscreen.autohide is disabled, the menu bar is still missing after toggling back into full-screen firefox 4
Actual Results:  
The menu bar vanished. 

Expected Results:  
The menu bar should have stayed as a part of the window interface
