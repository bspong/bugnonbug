I use backconnect socks proxies from fastsocks.ru. When I change proxies several times (10-100 times) through Tools->Options->Advanced->Network->Settings->Manual proxy configuration, the proxy changes stops taking effect. I tried several other proxies when problem appears, but it doesn't work unless I restart Firefox. The problem does not appear in Internet Explorer and Opera. I also use shortcuts to get to the Manual proxy configuration (ALT+T, alt+o, alt+s). 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Tools->Options->Advanced->Network->Settings->Manual proxy configuration
2. Go to http://linkworlds.net/displayer.php. The REMOTE_ADDR: shows the current IP
3. Change proxy server and repeat the actions 1 and 2

The proxy changes usually stop taking effect within 100 times of repeating the action. Sometimes more repeated actions are required
Actual Results:  
Proxy changes stop taking effect after repeated action

Expected Results:  
The proxy changes should continually take effect
