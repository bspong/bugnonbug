"Lost" bookmarks falling into the unsorted bookmarks blackhole

This has been a change in Firefox 3 that I believe to be missing functionality that is causing me some minor inconvenience and many "normal" users a big headache with bookmarks.

When bookmarking a new website, particularly via the yellow star, the new bookmark does NOT appear in the bookmarks list anymore.  It disappears into the magic "Unsorted Bookmarks" folder, which is not listed on the "bookmarks" menu dropdown by default.  So essentially, all new bookmarks are falling off the radar and confusing users.

The only way (by default installation) to find them is to go into the unsorted folder under "organize bookmarks".  Of course one can always search from the new bar, but I have found many people still prefer ye olde click ye bookmark in ye menu list.  

I realize that there are many ways around this, but this really needs a default fix of at minimum putting the unsorted folder onto the bookmarks dropdown menu by default.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Uninstall Firefox, remove all settings, etc.
2. ???
3.  Profit.  By which I mean, reinstall Firefox with all default settings.
4.  Bookmark a few sites and watch the wonderment of the bookmarking black hole.
Actual Results:  
Bookmarks end up in the "Unsorted Bookmarks" folder, available from "Organize Bookmarks" under the "Bookmarks" Menu

Expected Results:  
The "Unsorted Bookmarks" folder should be linked by default from the Bookmarks menu, perhaps in the same area as "Recently Bookmarked".  Or at a minimum, new Bookmarks should be added to the bookmarks menu Firefox 2 style so that they do not simply fall off the radar.
