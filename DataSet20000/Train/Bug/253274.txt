menus and tooltips are unaware of xinerama

On http://slicks.ulyssis.org/firefox-xinerama.png a desktop is displayed with 2
heads using Xinerama. The borders of the heads are shown in red. As there are
two different screen resolution, there's a blind rectangle in the lower-left
corner. That area isn't mapped to a physical screen.
Applications using GNOME or KDE libs use information from Xinerama to avoid
menus being split over several heads. By doing this, they also avoid showing
anything on that blind area. 
Firefox doesn't seem to do that. On that screenshot you can see that a part of
the popup will be invisible to the user. Same thing for tooltips.
This screenshot has been taken with fluxbox, but the problem also occurs in KDE.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Put firefox near the border of a head which is not a border of the whole desktop.
2. Open the context menu/tooltip near that border.

Actual Results:  
The menu/tooltip is split over several heads, or is only partially shown.

Expected Results:  
The menu/tooltip should be repositioned to fit inside the current head.

Tested with Fluxbox CVS 20040726 and KDE 3.1.2
