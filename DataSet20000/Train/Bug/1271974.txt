One or two "Highlights" tiles are not displayed after importing history from Chrome profile
[Affected versions]:
- Firefox 45.0 and up
- Activity Stream 1.0.16

[Affected Platforms]:
- All Windows
- All Linux
- All Mac OS

[Notes]:
- Attached a Chrome profile data as history dataset to reproduce the issue. I have added in the attachment the steps for how to create the Chrome profile with the attached data. 
- I have reproduced this issue with several different Chrome profiles, the one attached was a new Chrome profile on which I created some history in the last 2-3 days.
- Attached a screen recording of the issue.
- The issue is reproducible on the New Tab page as well. 

[Prerequisites]:
- Latest Activity Stream add-on version (1.0.16) was previously installed on a clean profile.  

[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Open the browser with the profile from prerequisites.
2. Click the Activity Stream button from the browser toolbar.
3. Press the "Ctrl+Shift+B" key combination.
4. After the "Library" window is opened, click "Import and Backup" button form the top of the window.
5. From the displayed context menu, click on the "Import data from another browser..." button.
6. Choose to import history from Chrome and select the profile from the provided attachment. 
7. Wait until the history is imported and after close the "Library" window.
8. Refresh the Timeline page.

[Expected result]:
- All 3 "Highlights" tiles are correctly populated with history from Chrome profile.

[Actual result]:
- Only two of the 3 tiles are displayed and populated with history from Chrome profile.

[Additional Notes]:
- If the all three "Highlights" tiles are displayed, remove the first "Highlight" tile from history. This will leave the "Timeline" with just 2 of the 3 tiles displayed.
