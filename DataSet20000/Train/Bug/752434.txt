Stop hiding toolbars for about:addons & Co.

Steps to reproduce:

Open about:addons.


Actual results:

Navigation bar (awesome bar) is hidden. 


Expected results:

Navigation bar is visible with meaningful URL. 

Chrome does this very cleverly: They provide an actual URL for any of their special pages (e. g. preferences). This helps orientate yourself where you are as well as provides direct access to certain configuration pages. With this direct access, you can send anyone a direct link to specific configuration pages thus eliminating the need to explain how to get to a configuration option when you need someone to change it. 

Also, I often find myself navigating to about:addons (e. g. enable/disable an extension or plugin), then navigating to a Website requires me to close the current tab and open another one and then typing in the address, instead of just being able to input the address directly inside the navigation bar. 

As a security consideration, you could prevent Interweb Referrers thus only allowing typing in "about:addons/extensions/Firebug" or "about:settings/advanced/encryption" et al. directly into the navigation bar (instead of allowing direct links form Websites to the special pages). 
Furthermore, the awesome bar could by painted with a Firefox-y orange/blue background to distinguish fake phishing special sites from the real special sites.
