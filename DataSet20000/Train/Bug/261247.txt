When I maximise the program maximises about 50 pixels off the top of my screen...

This means I cannot click on the minimize or close buttons at the very top right
of the window because they are off the top of the screen... Also the Status Bar
is drawn *twice* at the bottom of the screen.

I am running a Matrox Parhelia over three screens... this does NOT happen when I
set the screen resolution to just one screen (approx 1024x768)... but as soon as
I set the screen res to anything that spreads it over three screens, this draw
error occurs.

I really hope you can fix this as it seems like an excellent browser.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Get a Matrox Parhelia 256MB graphics card...
2.Set Screen res to anything over 2400x600 (so that the desktop goes over all
three monitors...
3.Then run Firefox and hit maximize... 

Actual Results:  
the window will then maximize off the top of the screen (by the number of pixels
of the titlebars height... approx 50 pixels)... and the Status bar is drawn
twice at the bottom (in the space left because the titlebar has gone off the top
of the screen).

The only way to fix it is to set the browser to full screen mode then press the
"minimize" or "close" button that appears in the top right... unacceptable
basically.

Expected Results:  
Maximized as normally (so that you can see the titlebar including the
minimize/maximize and close buttons).

The 

I consider this to be a fairly Major problem as it *really* gets in the way of
my use of the software... I need my windows maximized.

I am tempted to go back to lousy Internet Explorer until this is fixed.  :o(

Otherwise Firefox is an *excellent* browser
