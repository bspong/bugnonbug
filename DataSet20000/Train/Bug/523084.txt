firefox resets every time it switches off (don't remember user ID)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Firefox 3 (in English) used to work fine, since using firefox 3.5 (which I downloaded first in French), firefox doesn't remember any customer ID (on this url, hotmail and others) like if it was a different computer I was using every time I use it.
Also on that url in particular, when I enter my ID, the 'ENTER' key doesn't work straight away, I have to push it several times and sometimes have to use the mouse several times before moving onto the next page.
Before loging this bug, I looked on your website to see if it was a configuration problem but not, I followed your lead on remembering passwords (Option, Security, Remember Password), firefox will ask to remember passwords on certain sites only.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. download firefox 3.5.3 in french
2. use firefox
3. tell firefox to remember me on this computer
4. close firefox
5. use firefox on the same website you asked to remember
6. firefox has forgotten you
Actual Results:  
not being remembered

Expected Results:  
being remembered, not having to type in your customer ID everytime you want to log on
