temporarily freezes on startup and every couple hours

On startup of Firefox 3b5, and subsequent hours (possibly?), Firefox appears to freeze, and I am certain that it is checking for new entries in my RSS feeds.  I have about 45 feeds stored in an "RSS" folder.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have at least 10-20 RSS feeds stored, sites like Slashdot, Techcrunch, but it doesn't matter (I am uncertain whether a low amount of rss feeds would work)
2. Shut down firefox, wait for the process to stop.
3. Start firefox, and especially if it has to download data, it should temporarily freeze.
4. Use for around 4-5 hours, and just browse around; it may or may not freeze for about half a minute to a minute
Actual Results:  
Firefox becomes unresponsive while it downloads RSS feeds.
It's also possible that it may be doing something else, but I am uncertain.

Expected Results:  
It should have done it in a background process (or thread?) making the browser more reliable to the end user.
