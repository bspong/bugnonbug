Back button displays history menu inappropriately
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:37.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/37.0

Steps to reproduce:

Browse to some sites so there is some browsing history to different sites.

Click on back button and quickly move the mouse back to the body of the browser (the website content).


Actual results:

Doing this results in the browsing history menu being displayed, which must then be explicitly hidden by clicking somewhere in the body of the browser window.  Until this is done, the menu continues to be displayed, obscuring the website content.

Some testing revealed that if I clicked on the back button and then DID NOT MOVE the mouse immediately back into the body of the browser the menu would not appear.


Expected results:

Here's how the back button in FF used to work, and should continue to work:

1) Left click on the back (or forward) button.

2) The browser navigates one site forward (or backward, as the case may be).

The history menu should ONLY be displayed if I left click and hold the button for at least one second.  Better yet, the history menu display logic should be decoupled entirely from the back/forward buttons and be made accessible by a separate button, as was the case years ago.

I first noticed this in the latest update to 37.0.2, provided / packaged by Ubuntu.  Not sure if they're screwing with this or you are but it needs to change.
