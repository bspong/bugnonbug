Youtube videos won't play in Firefox 11.0
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686 on x86_64; rv:11.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/11.0
Build ID: 20120312181643

Steps to reproduce:

Try this on SuSE 11.4:

firefox -safe-mode
open www.youtube.com
wait 30-60 seconds until FF decides to start responding again
click on a random video



Actual results:

The Flash player window is blank (black).  There is no video preview, and there is no "play" button visible.  It looks like the flash player isn't communicating with FF correctly.


Expected results:

First, it shouldn't take so long for FF to become responsive after opening a new site.  This isn't just a problem with YouTube; many sites cause FF to pause for 30 seconds or more after opening them.  During that time, all threads are stopped: it won't refresh the screen if a window is uncovered, you can't scroll, you can't close tabs or even hover over the close button, the cursor won't change when you move over different areas, etc.

During the hang, there is no significant CPU, disk, or network activity.  (I didn't investigate to see whether it was banging on the file system cache.)

Second, the video should play.

This happened after I upgraded to FF 11.0.  FF 10 (I think I had 10.0.2) worked.  The only change made was the FF upgrade and some extension upgrades, but the extensions shouldn't affect safe mode.  This happens on two different computers.

Things I've tried, none of which worked:

1. Running in safe mode
2. Upgrading SuSE 11.4 to the latest patches
3. Creating and using a brand-new profile with no extensions or any such thing

Possibly related info: when I run FF from the command line, I get an interesting shared-library complaint:

/h/src/utils/firefox-4.0/plugin-container: /usr/lib/libssl3.so: version `NSS_3.13.2' not found (required by /h/src/utils/firefox-4.0/libxul.so)

This seems to be related to ths slowness, though I'm not certain.  So maybe it's busily searching for this NSS_3.13.2 version.

This page claims that it's an IPV6 problem: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=11776449
but I already had IPV6 disabled in FF on one of my machines, and that setting doesn't actually help.

In the meantime, I'm using Opera, which makes me very unhappy.
