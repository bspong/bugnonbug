[Unity Desktop Integration 3.0.2] Some addons.mozilla.org search plugins fail to install with "Sorry, you need a Mozilla-based browser (such as Firefox) to install a search plugin" error message
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0
Build ID: 20150511103818

Steps to reproduce:

Initially it appeared almost as if *all* plugins failed to install. However it turns out that it's only the ones I actually want. For instance, all of the below three:

https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/latest/271853/addon-271853-latest.xml?src=search

https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/latest/11973/addon-11973-latest.xml?src=search

https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/latest/363990/addon-363990-latest.xml?src=search


Actual results:

Instead of the browser's confirmation dialog, I see a JavaScript dialog from the website with the hilarious error message "Sorry, you need a Mozilla-based browser (such as Firefox) to install a search plugin."

I'm assuming it's a JavaScript dialog based solely on the fact that the "Prevent this page from creating additional dialogs" checkbox appears after the second time.

And of course it's hilarious because I am using Firefox without any modifications of my User-Agent string which http://whatsmyuseragent.com/ reports as "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0", as expected.


Expected results:

Any of the below:

1) The plugin should be installed without any fuss

2) Otherwise, an error message that isn't braindead should appear
