Audio tag: audio streaming doesn't work without "autobuffer"
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091215 Ubuntu/9.10 (karmic) Firefox/3.5.6

If an audio tag contains the option "controls" and doesn't contain the option "autobuffer", the streaming doesn't work - it stops after a few seconds and nothing happens. Please see the reference page.

Remarks:
- only with an ogg file tested
- the web server returns the mime type "application/ogg"
- if you store the reference page locally and opens as a file, both cases work
- firefox 3.5 in safe mode is affected too
- firefox 3.6 beta from December 17th is affected too 

P.S. in cases it works (with autobuffer or locally as a file): if you press pause (during playback) and then press play again - it doesn't work any more, only after a page refresh.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the reference page http://frolo.de/mku/test.html
2. Try the first test case "With autobuffer:" - the playback works
3. Try the second test case "Without autobuffer:" - the playback doesn't work
Actual Results:  
a) the playback doesn't work without autobuffer.
b) Play/Pause/Play/... doesn't work (see P.S.)

Expected Results:  
a) The playback should works without autobuffer too.
b) Play/Pause/Play/... should work (see P.S.)
