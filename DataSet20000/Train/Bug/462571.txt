Idle process with no tabs open consuming 15% to 70% CPU and frequent UI freezes with any UI visible
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1b2pre) Gecko/20081021 Minefield/3.1b2pre

I was starting a long session of opening up lots of links into new tabs.  Shortly after I got started, I noticed frequent UI freezes of about one second in duration.  This happened both in chrome (i.e. trying to click an entry in a context menu) or in the webpage (i.e. trying to click a link or scroll).

I eventually had as many as 30 tabs open. I did not notice any change in the frequency or duration of freezes.  I worked through all the tabs, eventually closing the last one.  My MBP was still running hot and I opened Activity Monitor to look at the CPU.  Minefield was still oscillating between 15% and 70% CPU usage, even with no tabs open.  When I opened a tab, I would see the UI freezes.

I took a series of Activity Monitor sampling traces during high and low CPU periods to try to get some additional data on what the app was doing.

All of the samplings show a large percentage of time being spent in the following tree:

JSD_GetValueForObject
 GetSecurityContext
    CRMF_EncodeCertReqMessages

and in mach_msg

I eventually closed the application and the problem went away, but I'm hoping that maybe something in these sampling traces might give someone an idea of a place to look for something that is spinning unnecessarily.
