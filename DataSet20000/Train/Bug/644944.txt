"work offline" persistently enabled after logging off / on to Windows.

After logging on and opening Firefox with saved tabs, all tabs appear with "Problem loading page", telling me that Firefox is in offline mode and I should uncheck "work offline". 
Following these instructions and clicking "Try again" results in another failed page load and "work offline" menu option being automatically reselected. This is persistent.
I discovered that any tabs with history can be "unlocked" by unchecking "work offline", then clicking the back button. Following this, it's possible to go forwards / browse as usual.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. With several tabs open, close Firefox (say "yes" to save tabs if asked)
2. Log off Windows
3. Log back on and reopen Firefox.
Actual Results:  
As in summary, all tabs failed to load, unchecking "work offline" doesn't allow tabs to be refreshed, and refreshing a tab reselects "work offline".

Expected Results:  
Loaded all of the tabs, like a good little browser!

Default theme.
It's just occurred to me that the only "unusual" page that I have in current tabs is http://www.ajaxdaddy.com/demo-jquery-autocomplete.html, which has a pile of crazy jQuery in it and sometimes fails to load properly after a restart even when other tabs succeed. Maybe that spooked the beast, maybe not. If I hadn't spent so long creating this bug report I'd get rid of that tab and check again. Sorry.
