After a while of surfing (most likely triggered by a specific site, although i have not found which one) all input fields, especially the location bar and the search field, no longer accept Enter to start an action, i.e.: i can enter a URL in the location bar, but i can not get the browser to actually load that page.
Access pages through bookmarks or the history works fine.

All extension and plugins have been disabled, error console show multiple errors:

lots of:
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE) [nsISupports.QueryInterface]"  nsresult: "0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE)"  location: "native frame :: <unknown filename> :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 0"  data: no]

about three:
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [mozIStorageStatementWrapper.step]"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: file:///test/bin32/firefox-nightly/components/nsSearchService.js :: epsGetAttr :: line 3175"  data: no]

Reproducible: Sometimes
