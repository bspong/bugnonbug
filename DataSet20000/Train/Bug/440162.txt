Many tabs lost and replaced by blank Untitled tabs upon Session Restore

I had many (~120) tabs open, as I often do, carrying them across sessions. In the recent upgrade from the latest RC to FF3, I lost ~96% of my tabs. Half a dozen of my tabs appeared correctly at the start, then ~100 tabs appeared only as blank "Untitled" tabs, then I had one tab appear as normal right at the end. Subsequent closing and restoring only brings back the session with the few real tabs and the many Untitled tabs.

If there was meant to be a Welcome to FF3 screen upon upgrade, I never got it.

I had build 2008052906 prior to the upgrade, and seem to have retained that, with only the version number changing to 3.0 as my upgrade. With such a minor change to my system, I should not have lost all my tabs.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have MANY (>100) tabs open
2.Upgrade from FF3RC2(?) (The one immediately prior to the official upgrade to FF3
3. Choose Restore Previous Session
Actual Results:  
Many of my previous tabs become blank, and appear as "Untitled" only.

Expected Results:  
No "Untitled" tabs, instead just the tabs as they were, full of content.

The problem is probably pretty easily to imagine, but see URL for a pic as verification.

It'd be great if we could go back into History and be able to select and restore a session from amongst NUMEROUS previous sessions, rather than just the Previous session. ie retain session data historically, for as long as the user determines. Being able to do that would probably have enabled me to go back and pick out a session that wasn't borked.


I have had other problems with general FF stability when MANY tabs are open. I have also submitted:
438955     nor     --     Wind     nobody@mozilla.org     UNCO         Navigation Toolbar Buttons UI borked when many multiple tabs are restored in new session
438972     nor     --     Wind     nobody@mozilla.org     UNCO         Bookmark All Tabs fails with "Assertion Failed" when trying to bookmark many tabs
