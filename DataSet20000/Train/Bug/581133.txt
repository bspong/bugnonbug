Page Print Dialog Box Disables Popup Blocker When Open

At work, I need to be logged into a website that constantly tries pushing popup windows.  Luckily, Firefox's popup blocker blocks the windows.

Each time I go to print a page (CMD+P), Firefox allows the popup window to launch behind the print dialog box.  Also, because the print dialog box is the window in focus, I cannot close the popup until I close the print dialog box.

This has been an ongoing annoyance that I have been dealing with thorough many many Firefox updates.  It is exceptionally disturbing because a lot of times I need to move the print dialog box to see the page I am printing (for naming purposes when printing PDF files) but the popup window gets in the way and I cannot move it until I close the print box.

Sorry, I could not search for this in reported bugs because I did not know which section it would be categorized under.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Unfortunately the Popup windows are coming from a Content Management System that my work uses called "Footprints."  You would need login credentials to use it, which I cannot give out.  I imagine that any website that launched popups would work to replicate the problem.
