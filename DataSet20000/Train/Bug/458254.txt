From your bug system and almost endless list of already reported bugs on the system, you apparently do not want your browser to allow or attenuate MSN Hotmail traffic.  When logging on using your browser (Mozilla Firefox) it aperiodically replies with a "Redirect Loop Firefox has detected that the server is redirecting the request . . ."  you know the drill. This does not happen every time, just on a random basis. When I go to my hotmail account via going first to MSN.com I get this bogus "security warning about traffic on the internet . . " just to down slow the sign on process.  If you want me to use MSN explorer as a browser, not yours just tell me. Please stop the specious rerouting ploy, it is just silly on your part. 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.have my home page set to my hotmail.com login page
2.Use your browser instead of Explorer
3.
Actual Results:  
aperiodically get a "Redirect Loop" error message

Expected Results:  
Go directly to my home page of hotmail.com login
