http://www.svenskabio.se/fileadmin/Bio/nyhetsblad/BO.pdf renders surprisingly slowly

Steps to reproduce:

I loaded the following PDF into Firefox Nightly, running on Linux (Debian): http://www.svenskabio.se/fileadmin/Bio/nyhetsblad/BO.pdf


Actual results:

It took a surprisingly long time to render it at 100% zoom. To eliminate network delays, I downloaded the file and pointed Firefox to my copy of it. It took about a minute from the time a white rectangle appeared for the page contents to even start appearing, and another ten seconds or so for it to finish rendering. Admittedly, my computer is a few years old now.


Expected results:

It's all subjective, of course, but it would have been nice if it had been a bit quicker about it. By comparison, "evince" took less than 5 seconds to do the same thing (plus another few seconds to generate a thumbnail). I noticed that the document contains some fairly high-resolution images, so maybe they're what's slowing things down?

Since the PDF changes every week (it shows what movies are playing at my local cinema), I've archived a copy of this particular PDF at http://www.update.uu.se/~d91tan/BO.pdf but I imagine that the one at the original URL will keep behaving more or less the same, even when it's replaced.
