Cannot attach Yahoo email attachments using Firefox but can using Explorer

Hi,

For about a week or maybe longer I have not been able to send any email attachments while using Yahoo Mail if I used Firefox. I have the latest update (2.0.0.3). When I logon to my Yahoo Mail account, I attach the file and it appears that the attachment is ok. However, I send the email and the recipient (I've tried to email myself and several other people with various different email accounts from Yahoo, Gmail, Comcast, Brighthouse, etc.) does not receive the attachment. Yahoo Mail shows the correct size for the attachment and evens shows the paper clip symbol for an attachment but there's no attachment.

I then tried using Explorer and lo and behold I can send attachments. 

Any ideas? I do not like to use Explorer but will be forced to if I cannot send attachments using Firefox.

Please help.
