In Manage Bookmarks>File>Import>File, attempt to import bookmarkbackup file results in a Microsoft Redirect URL as follows: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/default.mspx
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6

My bookmarks toolbar file mysteriously became empty.  I am trying to import the most recent bookmarkbackup html file to recover the bookmarks that are still there. When I imported the IE Favorites, that worked fine and showed up on the Manage Bookmarks file list. When I tried to import from "File"  all I get is the following:  http://www.microsoft.com/windows/default.mspx.  Multiple deletions and repetitions have not resolved the problem.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Manage Bookmarks
2.Click on File
3.Click on import
4.Click on File
5.Go to Owner/Applications/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/bookmarkbackup
6.Highlight the one you want and click Open.
7.Return to Bookmark manager and highlight Bookmarks (not bookmark toolbar) and the previously mentioned URL is there and the Bookmark Toolbar File is still empty. 

Actual Results:  
as above.

Expected Results:  
Bookmarkbackup file contents should have appeared in the bookmark toolbar file.
