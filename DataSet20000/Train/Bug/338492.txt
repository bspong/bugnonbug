Serial connection slows down and crawls on 26.4 kbps dialup

See steps to reproduce, then return here.  Problem occurs in Windows XP with
the free ZoneAlarm running along with the latest Firefox browser, or any other
version you have been supplying during the last three months before each update.
I keep updated regularly.  Dialup is on an external modem which used to run
at 56 kbps until the rate dropped by one-half after I added AT&T DSL (was SBC)
to my residential service here. Problem does NOT occur with IE 6.  What happens is that after I connect to a complicated Web page, the rate at which packets flow over the PPP connection start slowing down.  Eventually everything gets
so slow that it all appears stalled.  ZoneAlarm's icon and the little two-computer icon in the system tray report no data flowing.  If I wiggle my mouse over one of those two icons, pretty soon data starts flowing again. I used to blame this on my ISP, but before I got fed up enough to call them, I tried
IE 6 again (groan) and guess what?  IE 6 does not slow down!  This is during
the SAME DIALUP CONNECTION with NO CHANGE in assigned IP address nor any
change in baud rate. All I have to do is kill FireFox and start IE 6 and the
problem stops.  The two little icons start playing again and data flows.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Dial into my ISP CoreComm at 26.4 kbps
2. Switch to almost any web page (most noticeable on CoreComm Webmail)
3. Ask some complicated Web page (such as CoreComm's Webmail)

Actual Results:  
Data slows down and stops.

Expected Results:  
Dialup data flow continues.

I have to wiggle mouse over ZoneAlarm and the two-computer icon (both) in
the system tray to give Firefox a kick and get it started again.
