Notifications are incorrectly removed by subframe navigation
We got a report in bug 844556 comments 67-69 for a page where Mixed Content is blocked by the MCB but the Shield Icon is missing.  This occurs on a university page that requires login and I have a test account.  Note that this means that there is no way for the user to "disable protection" and load the content.

I can reproduce this on various versions of Firefox and the most recent Nightly.  Note that if I open a new tab and then return to the university webpage tab, the shield shows up as it should.

When you go to the specific page, a youtube HTTP iframe attempts to load.  MCB blocks the load, reports the blocked load to webconsole and properly updates the security state.  Then browser.js reads the security state and calls PopupNotifications.show()
https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser.js#6618

PopupNotifications.show() then calls PopupNotifications._update:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/modules/PopupNotifications.jsm#275

This is when things get a little confusing.  While reproducing, I've come across two scenarios:
1) PopupNotifications.show continues to execute and _updates is called later.  When it is called, the notifications have disappeared:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/modules/PopupNotifications.jsm#615

and we end up here:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/modules/PopupNotifications.jsm#654

2) _update is called within PopupNotifications.show.  The notifications are found.  But then _update is called again with no notifications found and the UI has no shield.


The last/second call to _update is always after a terminal warning:
WARNING: NS_ENSURE_SUCCESS(rv, rv) failed with result 0x805E0006: file /home/mozilla/dev/mozilla-central/content/base/src/nsFrameLoader.cpp, line 510
++DOMWINDOW == 35 (0x7fc9052a88b8) [serial = 40] [outer = 0x7fc904d830b8]

Which is a return value for a LoadURI - http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/content/base/src/nsFrameLoader.cpp#510

Do any of the folks I've cc'ed have a clue as to what might be going on here?  I can't reproduce this on my own test cases (or any of the other websites that have mixed content).  Perhaps it is something specific that this site is doing that is causing the nsFrameLoader warning and somehow interfering with the call to _updates.  Any help/ideas/thoughts would be helpful.

Thanks!
