Page scroll (up/down) when I change tab with Ctrl+Page up/down

When I search something in a webpage with the "Find" function (Ctrl+F), and then I switch from tab to the next one with Ctrl+Page up, I get the next/previous tab.
However, when I return on my previous tab (the tab where I searched something), the position of the page has changed.

In fact, I think the page scrolls up when I do "Ctrl+Page up".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a first tab
2. Open a second tab with a long webpage ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Canada#British_North_America_1837-1867 )
3. Search something in this page (Ctrl+F then search "In 1837" in the Wikipedia Article)
4. Remember the position of the webpage
5. Change tab with "Ctrl+Page Up"
6. Return to the previous tab (click on the wikipedia tab, or use "Ctrl+Page down"
7. The webpage has scrolled up
Actual Results:  
The page scroll up.

Expected Results:  
Tge page should not change its position.

I get the same bug with "quick search" (press "/" instead of "Ctrl+F").
I get the same bug with "Ctrl+Page down".
