The deletion of previous search entries with shift+del doesn't work if search suggest shows some options. Using shift+del deletes the current entry, but the next time the entry is back again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clear your search history.
2. Search for "test" using the search bar.
3. Enter "test" again in the search bar, select the previous entry "test" from the drop-down and hit shift+del in order to delete it from the search history.
4. The entry "test" is apparently deleted.
5. Enter "test" again in the search bar, notice that "test" is still shown in the drop-down box.

Actual Results:  
The search entry "test" ist not deleted.

Expected Results:  
The search entry should be deleted after the first time I hit shift+delete.

I don't know whether this bug should be in the component "Form Manager" instead. 

Using a search engine with no auto-suggest feature, deleting old search entries works without problems.

Workaround: Klick in the search bar and don't enter any text, use the cursor (down) to see the previous searches and delete them with shift+delete.
