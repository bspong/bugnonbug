all cookies deleted each time firefox closes

Everytime I close Firefox, none of my cookies are present the next time I open it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Get a cookie (Yahoo login to remember you or something)
2.Close Firefox
3.Open firefox and go to the login page.

Actual Results:  
The Yahoo page would ask me each time to relogin, though I have checked the remember me for 2 weeks box. I checked my cookies, and the cookie was not present (It was present when I checked before I last closed it; it wa there the last time I had closed it because I had relogined at that time)

This problem is not confined to Yahoo, since I get the same problem with all sites that offer to remember me. ALL cookies are not present at time of opening as well.

Expected Results:  
The cookies should have been present, allowing me to view my pages without logigging in again.
