Unloaded tab//sessione restore tab get turned to blank
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0
Build ID: 20160407164938

Steps to reproduce:

I'm using firefox 45.0.2, in conjunction with a few addons (really stuff like flash, etc).. the only uncommon plugin i use is unloadtabs..
Simply during usage OR after restore of the previous session, unloaded tabs get turned to "blank" new tab..
Suspecting that it was due to the addon, i tried a different tab unloader called tab utilities, and i could replicate the issue.. After some time or after system restore some unloaded  tabs will gradually turn into "blank" new tab.. They have the "icon" related to the site they were displaying, but if you open the tab the address bar is empty and they will not load any page.
Never noticed this before firefox 45.. My work pc is using the same addon (unload tab) with a previous version of firefox (43.x iirc, anyway <45) and the problem is not there.
Apparently other people are experiencing this issue with the same firefox version addons combo..

I'm quite hesitant to assume it's an addon issue, but rather some change of implementation of firefox, as it's quite strange that two different addon doing the same thing, are now NOT working correctly in the same way...


Actual results:

I tried to uninstall the addon, and install a similar addon called tab utilities and the result was the same..
Some unloaded "loose" the information of the address or something along those lines, and as a result they get turned into "blank" pages with the icon of the page but they loose the address AND the name of the tab instead of being "name of the webpage" is "New Tab"..

Expected results:

Normally unloaded tabs stay unloaded, and when you open them they reload the actual page,
