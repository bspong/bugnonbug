Firefox will not display the back buttons or allow users to post bookmarks.  We maintain a network home environment.  We have an Active Directory environment with SMB homes.  Our Macs are joined using Thursby's ADmitMac client.  some users are fine, but others (many/most??) have this problem.  

We have created ~/.MacOSX folders for each user in an attempt to work through this problem.  That has helped for some, but users could still be left with "places.*" files after app exits -which means at next launch they're faced with a "broken app" (from their perspective).  

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. launch application
2. quit application
3. launch application
Actual Results:  
you might not get back buttons, etc. right away, or you might have to quit and re-launch the app more then once during the same console session to get corrupted places.* files

Expected Results:  
back buttons that work and bookmarks that can be saved.
