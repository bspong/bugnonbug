Plugins can open a web page without the user's permission

Almost every time I install a addon, after Firefox restarts, the addon opens a web page to congratulate me for installing the addon.

This is a violation of my privacy and a violation of my rights as user.

Maybe I didn't want to open that web page.  Maybe I have metered bandwidth and opening that web page just cost me some money or meant I can spend a little less time on the web this month.  Or maybe I don't want to open that addon's web page and give the company that made it forced ad impressions.

Additionally, this is a security risk.  Any plug-in developer can force my browser to open any web page without asking first.

No software should ever be allowed to force my browser to open a web page without asking for my permission.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Example plugins include Firefox Sync, Adblock Plus and Greasemonkey.


Expected Results:  
Any time some addon or other mechanism attempts to open a web page without my permission, present a dialog asking if I want to open the web page instead of assuming I want to open the web page.

Software should never be allowed to open a web page without asking permission first.
