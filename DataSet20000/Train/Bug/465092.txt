Cannot access and/or delete email messages on Yahoo mail under ...18 Firefox build
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.18) Gecko/20081029 Firefox/2.0.0.18

I can enter my inbox and it will display a list of current messages.  However, once in my inbox display I cannot display messages, move them, or delete them.  In build 2.0 .. .17 I could do these things.  I can do them in I'net Explorer but would rather use Firefox.  However, since one of my main uses is to read this mail, I will have to discontinue using Firefox unless this bug is fixed.  I checked and all my settings are as they were before the upgrade.  I also just noticed that G-mail will not load messages, i expect as a result of the same bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to My Yahoo.com
2.  Log on, if required
3.  Go to mail function
4.  Log on, if required
5.  Go to inbox (or spam inbox)
6.  Highlight a message to be read deleted or moved 
Actual Results:  
Steps thru logon will work.  Once in message box, can do nothing more. 

Expected Results:  
Read, move, or delete any marked message

Site does not crash, but it does fail to complete operations. I have also noted that while I could perform basic operations in Yahoo mail before build .18, I could not show messages in full window to print correctly, something I could do prior to build .17 (or whatever previous build was).
