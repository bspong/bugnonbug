firefox is reliably crashing in mozjs.dll when trying to render any webpage on latest win nightly without launching breakpad
Created attachment 481846
application.ini file with license header.

Two concerns:

1. Without safe mode, minefield cannot show anything other than the 'Restore Session' window.  This is making minefield 100% unusable as a browser.

2. It is crashing without using our crash reporter, thus, making this invisible unless you are actually hitting the crash.

This has happened with both tonight's and last nights nightly, but never before for me.  Looking at my Application.ini file, I have BuildID=20100914041908.  I do notice that this file has the MPL/GPL/LGPL header text which I haven't seen in an application.ini file before.  It is also seemingly using unix line endings

Steps To Reproduce
==================================
1. launch minefield
2. notice that session restore page works
3. press 'start new session'
4. crash

Safe mode works fine.  I have tried using a new profile.  I haven't yet tried installing from scratch.  With 100% reliability, this is *not* triggering our crash reporter.  I noticed that the first run from upgrade also triggered the crash.  It seems like anything that loads a real webpage causes the crash immediately.  It is only using the windows crash reporter and this is the message:

I doubt that it is useful, but my video card is an Nvidia Geforce GTX 260 Core 216 running driver version 258.96.

I have to leave now so as not to miss the train.  I can remote into my system if needed.  I can try reinstalling from scratch if that is desired.
