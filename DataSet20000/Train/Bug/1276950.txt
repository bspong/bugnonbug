when sync ON 46.0.1 will stutter/freeze out of sleep, FF restart fixes, other apps work fine
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:46.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/46.0
Build ID: 20160502172042

Steps to reproduce:

this was an issue for several (a lot) FF releases (several years now). I put computer to sleep via autohotkey app, via command

DllCall("PowrProf\SetSuspendState", "int", 0, "int", 0, "int", 0)

(supposed to be regular windows shell command)

and FF SYNC is ON
FF 46.0.1


Actual results:

PC goes to sleep,
depending on unknown, when unsleep, 

PC wakes-up either immediately (like a good configured laptop) no boot beep restore of previous screen, or, 

most of the time when long sleep, wakes up with boot BIOS check, beep and ‘resume’ screen.

Firefox now ‘stutters’, freezes, not responding, slow responding etc, bad resume, MY OTHER Apps work FINE

I can restore FF operation by 
Restart of FF 
(and/or Session Manger restore session)




Expected results:

I now already think I found the solution, 
have FF sync OFF
FF now seems to restore fine after sleep

I have a hunch this is created by the total of my hardware setup, since I only see some rare report(s) of somewhat likewise, but a. on a MAC, b. with other circumstances added

motherboard ASUS P8P67, Intel 2500K, 16 GB RAM, AMD Sapphire 7970, Samsung SSD 257GB boot, 5 additional HDD Samsung/WesternD 1TB-3TB, windows 7 x64, 8 USB ports (inc 2 USB 3) (for flight simulator)

same problem/symptoms also occurred under Windows 8.1 (I went back to 7)

Though as mentioned I found a workaround with Sync OFF, or by rebooting, these are still workarounds, so I thought I report this as a bug.

Perhaps FF can look at the way Sync ON, bugs the way FF is restored after PC Resume
