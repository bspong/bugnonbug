I cannot edit text or create new threads in the program called "blackboard" on the page www.govhs.org  when I click on "reply" or "edit" or "create new thread" it quits, taking all my other tabs with it. This also happens when I try to play the online games on www.popcap.com  It doesn't have any other problems downloading things, I can surf the web and download files just fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to www.govhs.org and log in (I don't know if you guys can do this without a username)
2.go to the "discussions" link and click to get into one of the threads
3.click the "Reply" button under the message shown (it doesn't matter which discussion thread you go into nor which message you try to respond to) and the page will start to load.  
Actual Results:  
You get half of an outline of the text editing  box, but it stays that way for about a second and promptly quits, exiting out of all of my Firefox tabs


Expected Results:  
The page should have kept loading, and the page would have a box for typing text in, and about fifteen buttons for editing- text color, font, check spelling, etc. After you finish with your text, there should be buttons at the bottom for saving, exiting, and posting your comment. 

I didn't touch anything with the controls, the window still looks the same as it did when I first installed it.  No matter where I am, what internet server I am using, the problem still happens.  I have tried re-downloading Firefox and it still quits.  If I use Safari, the page loads just fine.
