Blocking cookies from sites that were accepted by previous versions of Firefox; does not allow exceptions even when exceptions are entered and show in the allowed window.

This is a bug I became aware of only two days ago, when I tried to log on to Westlaw. This morning I also found out that my Earthlink sign-on cookies are blocked and that entering an exception in tools/options does not fix the problem. Other sites that require a log-in may also be affected, but I haven't discovered them yet.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to website and try to log in (so far happens with Westlaw and Earthlink.
2.Get message that says cookies blocked or something similar.
3. Add exception for site in Tools/Options/Privacy/Allow exceptions
4. Try site again. Cookies still blocked, even after reboot.
Actual Results:  
same as above. Sites remained unavailable for sign-on, even after entered as allow cookie exceptions.

Expected Results:  
Once allow cookie exception has been entered in privacy options, I expect to be able to log on to the site.
