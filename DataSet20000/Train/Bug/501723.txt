If attempting to scroll (long) web pages, the page seems to freeze (not scroll) using the PageUp and the PageDown buttons if "Always use the cursor keys to navigate within pages" is selected (in the Options > Advanced > General > Accesibility window, or turned on with F7). I tested this with either the "Use smooth scrolling" turned on and turned off; in both cases the page freezes scrolling with the Up/Down buttons if "Always use the cursor keys to navigate within pages" is selected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select "Always use the cursor keys to navigate within pages" in Options > Advanced > General > Accesibility window or turn it on with F7.
2. Navigate to a (long) page that displays in 3 or 4 screen-lengths.
3. Click on the text so the cursor shows.
4. Click the PageUp and PageDown several times so you can see the page "freeze" and not scroll correctly.
Actual Results:  
Page freezes and not scrolls with the PageUp and PageDown buttons.

Expected Results:  
Page should scroll.

I am using the Firefox 3.5 build described above downloaded from PortableApps.com: http://portableapps.com/news/2009-06-30_-_firefox_portable_3.5

I have not tested this with a "regular" (not portable) version of Firefox.
