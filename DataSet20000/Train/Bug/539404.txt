Hi, 
Since last two days firefox is being crashed. it has been crashed minimum 25-30 times. Actually i didn't find any exact area where its being crashed. but i find that when i type in address bar of new tab then it happens. Its very very annoying for me.  I can't go ahead and please help me. 

It gets crashed and then closed. If again i try to restore session then immediately it opens all previous tabs and then i click any where in browser area its gets crashed.

I tried uninstalling some Add-ons but still it continues. Its started happening like this after updating latest firefox update few days before.
