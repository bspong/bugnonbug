When trying to sell an item on Ebay motors using Mozilla, It will ONLY let me enter my description via HTML.  There should be another tab by the description box that says "STANDARD" to not use HTML.  There should actually be two tabs, one says standard, one says HTML, neither are present, and it is stuck on HTML only.  It works properly on other browsers, and I contacted e-bay to make sure it was not a problem with them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Sign in to ebay
2.click sell item
3.pick a category under ebay motors
4.select your selling format
5.at the bottom of the title/description page look at the description box.  
Actual Results:  
I was missing information on the page, and missing an option to use the standard selling format.

Expected Results:  
It should have gave me other options around the item description box

Did clear all cookies, and cache.  Used e-bay live help to try to figure out the problem, but all was ok on their end, works properly with other browser.
