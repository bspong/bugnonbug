Bookmarks don't update after changes in Bookmark Organizer

I ran into this problem in the Beta versions of Firefox 3 and I have also run into it in the final release several times.

When I change something with my bookmarks in the Bookmarks Organizer, the change is often not reflected in either the Bookmarks menu or toolbar. I can restart Firefox or my computer as many times as I want and it never updates the menu or toolbar. The changes are always there in the Bookmarks Organizer however, so I know it is saving them.

The specific changes I am doing is moving bookmarks from the Bookmarks menu into a folder on the Bookmarks toolbar.

When Firefox does this, the bookmarks act strangely and I have to reinstall Firefox entirely for them to work correctly again. When I add a new bookmark, it will show up on the toolbar or the menu, but doesn't show up in the Bookmarks Organizer. These new bookmarks are lost when Firefox is restarted, thus effectively eliminating the bookmarks feature of Firefox.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new bookmark and put it in the bookmark menu
2. Open the Bookmarks Organizer and create a folder on the bookmarks toolbar
3. In the Bookmarks Organizer, drag the bookmark from the menu to the folder in the toolbar
Actual Results:  
The bookmarks menu and toolbar will now be unsynchronized with the Bookmarks Organizer.

Expected Results:  
The bookmarks menu and toolbar should reflect the changes made in the Bookmarks Organizer.
