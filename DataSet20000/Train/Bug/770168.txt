Firefox shows a blank page when loading multiple PDFs in a terminal server environment
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:13.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/13.0.1

Steps to reproduce:

When loading multiple PDFs in a browser, one after the other, in Firefox 3.6 we see a sporadic issue where sometimes the Adobe Reader plugin does not get loaded, and Firefox just displays a blank page (white/grey/black).  The browser status bar shows "Done" and nothing else is loaded even if the browser window is left for a long time.

The employees work with PDFs in Firefox all day long, and cannot use standalone Adobe Reader.  The issue occur sporadically during the day and does not follow any pattern.

After research from Adobe engineering it was found that in some instances Firefox sends an NPP_DestroyStream event with a reason of 1.  This will cause the Adobe Reader plugin to exit, which results in the issue.  If the Adobe Reader plugin is modified to ignore this event, then everything seems to work.

After testing with Mozilla Firefox 10, the problem was not reproducible, so we assume that the issue has somehow been fixed by changes in Firefox.

Can someone confirm if this is a known issue that was fixed with later versions of Firefox (3.6+)?


Actual results:

Blank browser window, Adobe Reader plugin is closed


Expected results:

Reader plugin to display PDF in the browser window
