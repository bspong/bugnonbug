Sometimes parts of the File menu are grayed out
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.7; rv:37.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/37.0
Build ID: 20150415140819

Steps to reproduce:

I am using Firefox 37.0.2 (and I think this happened in other recent previous versions as well). Sometimes when I click the File menu, the following items are grayed out:
Save Page as... , Email link..., Page Setup..., and Print... .  (I can't remember for sure, but I don't think Work Offline is grayed out.) This is very annoying, because it occurs when I am trying to save or print the page.  


Actual results:

As I said above, the lower parts of the File menu are grayed out, so that I am unable to save or print the page.

Oddly, sometimes eventually the file menu will be restored, such that items are not grayed out, and I can then save or print.  I cannot figure out what restores the file menu to operational status.  I have tried refreshing the page, switching to another tab and then back to the affected tab, and emptying the cache, but I am not sure what, if anything, works to make the file menu functional again, or if it's just random.  I cannot reproduce either the problem or the solution on demand.  If I figure out what make it happen, or what fixes it, I will post back.  Sorry, I don't happen to have a screen shot on hand.


Expected results:

The menu items should not have been grayed out.  So I should have been able to save or print the page.
