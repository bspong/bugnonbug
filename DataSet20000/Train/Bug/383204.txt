Sidebar has wrong label after restoring browser to a new session

The sidebar label always opens to history data, but does not update the label to reflect this.  So, you get the history items in the sidebar window, but the label still says "Bookmarks".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start the browser, open bookmarks in the sidebar
2. kill -9 the browswer
3. Start the browser, choose "Start a New Session"
4. Note that the sidebar's label does not match its data.


Actual Results:  
Label == Bookmarks while the Data == History.

Expected Results:  
The label and the data will agree, AND whichever window was opened before the crash will be restored after the crash.  For example, if the Bookmarks sidebar was opened, then the Bookmarks sidebar should be opened on restart.

This does not happen if you choose "Restore Session".  Also, this cannot be tested on windows or linux because the browser does NOT reopen the sidebar on windows and linux when "starting a new session" from a crash (which is a different bug).
