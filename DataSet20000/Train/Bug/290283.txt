flash wmode=transparent property causes cursor to not display in text fields and multiselect to not work in lists/trees

If you open both http://www.surrealsolutions.com/wmode/window.html and
http://www.surrealsolutions.com/wmode/transparent.html in IE, you will not see
any issues with the cursor in the textfield.  However, in Firefox, a cursor is
only visible in window.html page and will never become visible in the
transparent.html page.

My application has a mixture of flash and DHTML content, and I require the flash
movie to be displayed in the transparent mode.  However, once this setting is
changed, no cursors appear in any of the v1 and v2 text and input fields. 
Additionally, although less of a priority, multi-select within lists and tree
controls no longer function.  Basically, this problem prevents us from being
able to present HTML content above and/or below the flash movie for Firefox
users without jeopardizing the usability of our application.

I am unclear if this is a Firefox issue or a MM plugin issue, but any input
would be appreciated.
