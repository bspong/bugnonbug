(With smooth-scrolling off) In Firefox 2, scrolling pages was snap and the page was updated in a snap.

In Firefox 3, when scrolling pages, as in the URL provided, if you're quick enough so see, the bits after 500px from the tab bar get updated first, so it overlaps with the first 500px, then the top 500px get updated. (and that makes me think of Firefox being a worm : a worm shrinks itself, then expands itself to go forward, and a worm as in slow)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open task manager, WLMessenger, Windows Media Player and a few useless programs open (jusched.exe, itunesHelper.exe, realsched.exe, ipodservice, qttray) (no offence)
2. open any URL that has graphics and text. (best with backgrounds, the lagging is more significant)
3. SCROLL down
Actual Results:  
It lags

Expected Results:  
It scrolls in the blink of an eye, no lagging.

For those who don't know what 'lag' means,
