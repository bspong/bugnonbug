Having a Form with onsubmit event associated with it and a onkeyup event
associated with an input type text object to validate the user input.
The function associated with the input object check if the user press Return key
and in that case return "false", but the onsubmit event and\or the form itself
take precedence in the detect of the Return key and execute the POST.
The beavhior is different in IE where the function associated with the objects
in the form takes the precedence over The Form.
 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. function checkInt(ObjectName,e) {
if(ie) {
  key = event.keyCode;
 } else key = e.which;

 if (( key < 48 || key > 58 ) && (key != 8 && key != 9)) {
    if(!ie) {
      ObjectName.value = ObjectName.value.substr(0, ObjectName.value.length-1);
    }
 return false;
 }
}

2. <form name="MyForm" action="main.html" method="post" target="_self"
onsubmit="return verifyBlank();" >
---
<input name="Number" type="text" value="" onkeyup="return checkInt(this, event);" >
---
<input type="submit" value="Send" name="submit"  >

3. Type some numeric and char in the input field, then press return

Actual Results:  
The function verifyBlank() will be execute and the form submited 

Expected Results:  
The Form will not be submited if the focus is in the text field and the key
pressed was Return
