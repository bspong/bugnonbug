Please note that the URL provided contains ADULT (XXX) content.  I do apologize, but I could not seem to find a G-rated site that would reproduce the bug.  But considering the popularity of internet pornography, I'm sure this would cause a major outcry if it were to slip into the final release.  ;)

More details on the bug:  After clicking a link to a .mpg movie, Firefox (3.0b2) will pause momentarily and then start opening blank tabs in rapid succession.  (About two per second)  I have never let this go on long enough for it to crash the browser, but it seems to be an infinite loop.  Hitting 'Stop' will usually stop the tab opening, but the video is never shown.  The same sites present no problem when viewed in FF2.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to URL
2. Click on any thumbnail that links to an .mpg movie
3. Watch a series of tabs open as fast as your computer will allow
Actual Results:  
...tabs will keep opening unless you hit stop or close Firefox.

Expected Results:  
Video should be shown using the Quicktime plugin.
