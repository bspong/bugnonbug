This is a followup with detailed screenshots describing the corrupt Japanese
bitmap problem in Firefox. Sometimes Japanese text is completely corrupted at a
pixel level in html pane, title within tab ear itself, and source browser.
More detailed explanations are in the 3 screenshots themselves. Running redhat 9
on pentium 3, usually in Japanese mode but today in American English - LANG is
en UTF-8. I think this also happens when in ja_JP too though. The only security
problems I can imagine are 1) something bad going on that might be dangerous, 2)
not being able to read security alerts.  There is an url of one page that shows
problem (in tab title) and some source of an email is included to try. Haven't
tried in Mozilla or other fonts. Using basic install fonts for Japanese
(sans-serif, Kochi Mincho, Kochi Gothic) usually I don't use Kochi fonts though,
jus firefox seems to do so.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to url of the digista site provided (see screenshot location field)
2. the tab should be corrupted, try mouse dragging over it
3. font of "TOKYO 2004" (TOKYO is two double-byte characters) is corrupted
sometimes, and tends to temporarily "fix" itself depending on mouse/window event
based refresh requests. Really annoying and definitely a show-stopper for Firefox.

Actual Results:  
Less readable than entrails of frog in blender, even if you can read Japanese.
Makes Firefox unusable in Japan and gives open source a bad name unfortunately
if it can't be fixed. I've been promoting firefox actually to people.. I expect
this is a linux only problem though?

Expected Results:  
Display text correctly. As it is the bitmap representation of the text seems to
be  from a corrupt memory buffer.
