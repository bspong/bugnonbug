When I go to certain sites, especially financial sites (my banks), the page
comes up saying I have an "error Code 500" and that it is an internal server
problem. It also occurs when I go to sites where I need to log into get get int
that particular website. to view my accounts or purchase products (ie:
amazon.com, DVD planet.com, etc).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. logged onto my isp server (Earthlink) where Firefox 1.0.01 is my default
web-browser
2.Go to favorites and try to log onto vaious sites ie: usaa.com, amazon.com, etc
3.When browsers go to those pages, a white page shows up saying that I have an
error code 500 which could be an internal server problem

Actual Results:  
Same as step number#3.

Expected Results:  
Should have gone to home page where it will ask that I use my user name and
password to log onto that site to have personal information or preferences for
myself. 

In firefox, I had been using the password manager to store and remember my logon
information. I am back using Mozilla 1.7 regular browser and e-mail and these
sites are working fine when I go to them and logon.
