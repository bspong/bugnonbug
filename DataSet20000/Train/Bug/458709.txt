Supporting images and files failed to be replaced on force reload from the server. Using <Ctrl><F5> to reload the latest page from the browser the _.css and _.js were not replaced. There were images, _.jpg, with the same name and same size, however with different content that were not replaced.
Also favicons seem to be too persistent and failed to reload.
The resident page was reloaded.
Using the cache/buffer flush did not correct the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a secondary page first. Supporting _.css, _.js, and _image.jpg are loaded.
2. Visit primary served page calling identically named files of same size.
3. Does not look correct. Force a refresh <Crtl><F5> and no change.
Actual Results:  
The image looked very distorted. Examined the images using Tools /page info / media. Found name and size to be identical, however the files were actually the same image but flipped 90 degrees for different pages.

Expected Results:  
Expected a reload from the server of supporting files.

The software should have reloaded from the server all linked, reference, images. It appears that only the page.html was reloaded from the server, and the others found in local machine cache were reloaded from the PC.
Oops, MSIE version 7 wins on this one.
--This also occurred on one of my sites, and was reproducible on my XP Pro in house server. Safari, Opera and Amaya all handled the challenge.
A reboot of the PC did not solve the problem, however a formal shutdown and wait did solve the problem temporarily. The reload failure was still reproduced later.
