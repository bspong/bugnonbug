If I click to any place in TinyMCE input area or textarea field, text cursor remain visible from previous position and is created new on click position - all next click is created new vertical bar after text cursor. I think field is not completelly refreshed, same problem with image input. But this was repeated in search input in FF - small vertical bar. Soory for my English, better look on cutted screenshots on http://ssis.cz/chyba/errors-tinymce.jpg and http://ssis.cz/chyba/error-form.jpg . This bugzilla forms are OK, sometime wrong with javascript (onchange action)? This is used on TinyMCE and search field in FF too (show result on the fly).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open search in page panel.
2. Input any character
3. Text cursor is blinking, but your lower part is inverse - change focus and this lower part remain visible in input field. This not selectable.
