tabbed browsing causes web page load to wait forever
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.2.1) Gecko/20021209
Build Identifier: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firebird/releases/0.6.1/MozillaFirebird-0.6.1-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz

When I use tabbed browsing in Firebird 0.6.1, web pages stop loading; the status
bar says "Waiting for www.whatever.com", but nothing is transmitted across the
modem.  It only happens when I use tabs.

If I use only the man window, pages load at an acceptable rate (33.6K modem, you
understand); but if I middle click a link, both the new tab and the original one
stop loading pages and begin waiting forever (or at least longer than 10 mins).
 If I close all tabs but one, surfing resumes at a normal rate -- unless I have
selected the option to always keep the tab-bar visible, in which case even just
having only the original tab open causes this problem.

It might happen only with dialup; file lookup from my hard drive appears to
function normally, and I don't have broadband.  I am using an external US
Robotics 33.6 K modem and kppp to dail my isp.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Run Firebird to your hears content.
2.  Open another tab, or set "always display tab bar".
3.  Wait forever.

Actual Results:  
Modem statistics viewed with "kppp - details" shows little or no activity across
the modem if tabs are visible.  Other internet applications (irc chat, gaim) are
unaffected.

the tarball or with addons/user preferences.
