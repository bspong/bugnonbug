Ctrl+F doesn't focus filter field in ruleview in some cases
>>>   My Info:   Win7_64, Nightly 49, 32bit, ID 20160511030221
STR_1 (bad):
1. Open data:text/html,<style>body{color:black}
2. Open devtools -> ruleview, select string "color: black;" in ruleview with mouse, starting from ";"
3. Press Ctrl+F

STR_2 (good):
1. Open data:text/html,<style>body{color:black}
2. Open devtools -> ruleview, select "olo" in string "color: black;" in ruleview with mouse
3. Press Ctrl+F

AR:  STR_1 - field "Search HTML" is focused. STR_2 - field "Filter styles" is focused
ER:  The same action in both cases. Preferably, search field "Filter styles" should become focused
