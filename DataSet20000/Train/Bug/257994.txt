crash if I use javascript to set display to none on a div that contains an iframe [@ nsCSSFrameConstructor::RecreateFramesForContent ]
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.40607)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3

The page (http://www.carlsonfamilypage.com/poptest.html) uses DHTML to display 
a pop-up "window" and load a url into an iframe.  The problem occurs when I 
try to hide the window - I set the "display" property of the containing div 
tag to "none".  This works fine unless there is an iframe in the container.  
When I try to set the display property, the browser crashes.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit http://www.carlsonfamilypage.com
2.Click "Google!" button - a DHTML window will pop-up.  This is a <div> tag 
that contains a table that contains an iframe that loads Google.
3.Click on the x in the upper right corner of the pop-up.

Actual Results:  
The browser crashes, I get a windows dialog that says "We're sorry but 
firefox.exe has encountered a probelm and needs to close."

Expected Results:  
div is hidden; iframe does not display.

Works correctly under latest firefox build for Mac OS X.
