Investigate UITelemetry searchbar position reporting
During analysis of the Shield study report, some users that should have had the search removed from the toolbars (unified branch) had UITelemetry reporting it being in the default position (or multiple).

We must investigate why this happened, cause it may also be useful for future reference, and we should probably understand it before doing further studies.
This indicates a bug in either:
- The Study add-on
- UITelemetry
- The telemetry collection/analysis
- Interaction of the add-on with something else (another add-on, a specific setting?)

Extract from David Zeber analysis:

"There is a record in Telemetry of whether the searchbar is showing during the subsession. According to that measure, less than half of profiles on the unified branch had the searchbar removed for every subsession during the study. The majority reported the searchbar as being alternatively kept and removed over the course of the study period, and a small percentage of profiles reported the searchbar was kept for every subsession."

"We expect the Awesomebar to always be in the default position, and the searchbar to be in the expected position for all but a small group who may have modified it manually.

    The Awesomebar is in default position for all but a couple of profiles
    The searchbar is as expected for the control and oneoff branches
    The searchbar appears not be getting removed for many on the unified branch"
