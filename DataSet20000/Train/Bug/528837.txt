I closed Fiefox, had 2 tabs open, it said I had 30+ (and asked if I wanted to continue)

Just that, I had 2 tabs open (I'm sure of that) but when I closed Firefox normally, I got a window saying I had 30 something and asking I wanted to continue. Task Manager reported I then had no Firefox process running, as expected. I haven't been able to reproduce. [I have the option set to warn me if I have multlple tabs open[ 

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Actual Results:  
Wasn't able to reproduce but try what I had, 2 tabs open and then close normally (with the red close button in upper right of Firefox) and see if it reports having more than 2 tabs open

Expected Results:  
I got a window saying I had 30 something tabs open, I continued to close, saw nothing odd except the 30 something tabs report (instead of 2 tabs)

It should have put up s window reporting I had 2 tabs open.

I've never seen a report before of anything other than the number of windows I actually had open, made me wonder if I had somehow been hacked into.
