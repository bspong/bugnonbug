Adobe pdf file opened from a cgi script is being named after the cgi script and not recognized as pdf.

When I try to download a bank statement in Adobe PDF format from Wells Fargo's website, the file is called from a .cgi script. When I click the link, Firefox sees the name of the cgi script instead of the filename being requested by the script... e.g. I click "statement_9-10-2008.pdf", and Firefox asks, "You have chosen to open Session.CGI which is a Portable Document Format." When I choose to download it, it saves the file as "Session.CGI" and is not recognized as a PDF until I add the PDF extension. If I instruct Firefox to open the file with Preview instead of downloading it, nothing happens. I saw a similar bug reported with ASPX pages. Both Safari and Internet Explorer handle the link perfectly every time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click a link intended to download a PDF file using a .cgi script
2. Choose to save file, and file will be named after the .cgi script without the .pdf extension OR...
3. Attempt to open the file with Preview, and file doesn't open... nothing happens
Actual Results:  
File doesn't open or file is downloaded without it's proper extension, even though Firefox seems to recognize the filetype.

Expected Results:  
File should download with the proper extension or open in Preview.

I have only encountered this problem on the Wells Fargo website, but so far it's the only site that I knowingly am trying to download a .pdf file from a link which calls a cgiScript. I can't give a link since it is a secured site with bank login information.
