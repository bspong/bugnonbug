When logging into Gmail in normal browsing mode the first time, the user is required to submit the user name and password. However, even after selecting the Firefox option (when prompted) to never remember login information for the site  and also disabling the ability to "Remember me on this computer" on the sign in page, Firefox will open the email account directly after closing the browser and reopening.
