When dynamically adding new stylesheets which contain @font-face rules to the page, all hosted fonts are re-requested and potentially downloaded again.

In other words, Firefox won't download a new font file without re-requesting all previously downloaded font files.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the specified URL above.
2. Notice that on initial page load a CSS file containing 1 @font-face rule is downloaded.
3. Notice that this font is required to render an h1 so the font file (Woff) is downloaded.
4. Click 'Show Linear Ultra Bold Oblique' and notice a link to a new stylesheet is added to the DOM.
5. Notice that this new stylesheet containing a new @font-face rule is downloaded.
6. Notice that this font is required to render an h2 so the new font file is downloaded.
7. Notice that the original Woff downloaded in step 3 is requested again and potentially downloaded again.

This behaviour can be repeated when clicking 'Show Egyptienne URW Extra Light'. In this case the previous 2 fonts will both be requested again.
Actual Results:  
Fonts that have already been downloaded and shown on the page, are re-requested for no clear reason. 

Expected Results:  
Fonts that have already been downloaded and rendered to the page should NOT be re-requested.

The example page is using a font hosting service called Fontdeck which does not allow for caching in the browser. Aggressively caching the fonts would help mitigate this issue, but this is still a behaviour that seems undesirable and is not exhibited in the latest versions of other browsers.
