Whenever I close the Firefox window without quitting the application (press the red X instead of Cmd+Q), if I then open Firefox again by clicking the application icon in the dock, it will crash within a few seconds. This is particularly prevalent if, after opening the window, you immediately try and search in the search box.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse around for a while in Firefox 3 beta 5
2. Close the browsing window by pressing the red X
3. Open a new Firefox window (by clicking the application icon in the dock)
4. Try and search in the Google search box
5. About 6 characters will get typed, the 'beach ball' will start spinning then Firefox will crash.
Actual Results:  
Firefox crashed

Expected Results:  
Carried on working as normal
