Yahoo web based mail cookie error, related to "Insert addresses"
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.8

I am not able to insert addresses from the pop up address book in Yahoo web
based e-mail.  Furthermore, selecting the "insert selected contacts" button
messes up the Yahoo mail session....

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Logon to Yahoo Web Based e-mail
2.  Hit reply on an e-mail and click the "insert address" link.
    A "Yahoo address book" pops up like normal.  
3.  Select any number of contacts(To check boxes).
4.  Click "Insert checked contacts"
  
Actual Results:  
The window forwards to "Yourlogin session has expired.".
The colors on my yahoo mail theme return to default for only this link(and my
username is blank, presumably yahoo has no idea how I got there).  If I ignore
the window and go back to the message, any and all messages I attempt to send
from then on send to the contacts I had selected.  If(alternatively) I click the
"re-login" it automatically makes that popped window the e-mail message with the
people I checked and I can no longer navigate to messages.  So at this point I
click off the new window and go back to my original window and it reverts to the
same unusable state.  To go back to a usable state I must clear the cookies and
relogin.  There are no other problems I have noticed with Yahoo mail and Firefox.

Expected Results:  
I expect that the window will close and my contacts will be added to the
underlying(originating) window.

It affects Firefox .8 as well as .9.  This is on Windows XP, home edition
version 2002 service pack 1.  Dell P4 2.5ghz, 256M Ram.
