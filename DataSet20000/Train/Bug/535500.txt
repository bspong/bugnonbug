I have been running Firefox 3.5.5 and on 12/14/09 there was an update for read later. Installed it and also an update for “Definition Update for Windows Defender - KB915597 (Definition 1.71.833.0)”. The update says “Install this update to revise the definition files used to detect spyware and other potentially unwanted software. Once you have installed this item, it cannot be removed.”Know Firefox will not start. I get a pop up that says "Firefox has stopped working". I followed the different options that are talked about on the Firefox help web site. In Safe mode it opens. I have uninstalled it including the profiles, restarted the computer and installed Firefox 3.5.6. It still will not open but I do not receive any error notices. In the event viewer the error is

I loaded Google gears 12/12/09 and have had no troubles until 12/14/09. I am using the defualt theme and dissabled all extensions and add-ons before resulting to uninstalling firefox. When I installed Firefox 3.5.6 I imported bookmarks from IE.
