“Browser Debugger” breakpoints are ignored in extension scripts

Steps to reproduce:

Hi, I'm unable to utilize the "Browser Debugger" (referenced here: http://campd.wordpress.com/2012/11/12/firefox-and-addon-developers-should-set-devtools-chrome-enabled/) for browser extensions.

For years, I've been using chromebug.. having to revert back to firefox v5, but it worked well. Recently, I came across the remote debugger loopback method - url referenced above. With high hopes, but no success, i've tried utilizing this debugger in the past few firefox versions.

The "browser debugger" loads, can see chrome scripts, and set breakpoints.. but, breakpoints are never triggered.

I've tried on my normal dev profile - with and without firebug/chromebug enabled.. also tried on a new OS install with no dev extensions loaded.

To reproduce, install extension: http://download.smudgelab.com/smudgelab.xpi; enable two preference keys as described in above referenced url; restart browser; open "browser debugger" from tools menu; set a breakpoint within smudgelab.js line 107 (first step within init function); click the blue smudgelab icon to disable - then enable.. init gets called, but breakpoint is ignored.

Just for kicks, i tried another extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/redirect-cleaner/. Same issue - breakpoints ignored.

I'd really like to see a usable extension debugger.. I feel chromebug's UI and functionality is superior, but it's age and abandonment makes life more difficult with each new version of firefox. Please let me know of any questions..
Thnx!
