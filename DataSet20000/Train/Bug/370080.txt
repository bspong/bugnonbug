I was on a forum *rohitab.com/discuss/*, IPB forum to be exact. I was trying to edit my post, I hadn't used the 'Quick Edit' button on Firefox under debian before, and all of a sudden, Firefox dissappears.
Okay, so I tried it again, Exact same thing, It dissappeared.
Replicated the steps upto the crash, still crashed.

What I had done:
I had tried to post an image using the image tag, using the following text:
[img]http://host-a.net/xsnidalx/02.05.07.Screeny.jpg[/img]

That link doesn't actually hotlink to the picture, so it was giving me text which replaced where the picture was supposed to be. so I clicked "Edit", a javascript menu poped up, I selected "Quick Edit", I highlighted the first image tag, [img], and hit the backspace key, and then it crashed.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Post a post on an IPB based forum, in which it has to contain a picture, [img]http://www.somesite.com/somepicture.jpg[/img]
2.Select the "Edit" button below the post, then "Quick Edit".
3.Highlight the first [img] tag, and hit backspace. Crash.
Actual Results:  
Firefox Dissappeared

Expected Results:  
It should have erased the [img] tag, and let me continue on editing the post.

Firefox Version 1.0.4
