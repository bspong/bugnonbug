It varies but sometimes images do not appear in my browser. The login gif aat
http://ulogin.bcentral.com/en-US/centralsignin.aspx?cobrand=600204 does not
appear for e.g., yet if I mouse-hold and View Image I can see the image in a
separate window. I have javascript on but JAVA off. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://ulogin.bcentral.com/en-US/centralsignin.aspx?cobrand=600204
2. The Sign In graphic before "with .NET passport" does not appear
3. Mouse-hold where the graphic is supposed to be and View Image and it appears
in a separate window



Expected Results:  
The image should appear on the page
http://ulogin.bcentral.com/en-US/centralsignin.aspx?cobrand=600204

I have the same result when I look at a yahoo photo album and other pages. Most
of the time I can see all images, so I am not sure why this happens on only some
pages.

I notice that the image is a class <img class="uihf_HimgTitleIcon" align="left"
height="22" width="21" src="/images/shell/icon_signin.gif" alt="">  ...that may
have something to do with it?? 

btw. I am trying to submit this as MacIntosh OSX and it will not go. I am going
to change it to something else to see if that works.
