If I leave the window alone (or in a VirtueDesktop) some text grows.

I have a picture of it, but the server doesn't have a very good connection:

The problem occurs when I leave a window with GMail open on my inbox with no messages.
The text "if you're looking for something to read." starts 'growing' as if the font smoothing gets out of control. It gradually thickens until it reaches the thickness of bold text.
I have only discovered this when the window was in an inactive VirtueDesktop (because I never left my inbox open without causing a repaint for an hour).

I remember seeing this same problem on other systems and platforms, but I no longer have them so I cannot say for sure.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox to an empty GMail inbox.
2. Change the current VirtueDesktop so that window is no longer visible
3. Wait a while (1 hour tops) and go back to it
Actual Results:  
Usually, but not always the text will have grown.

Expected Results:  
The text should have grown.

This is a painting problem, if I cause firefox to repaint (switch tabs, etc.) the text returns to normal.
