Windows Media Player doesn't  work with Radio Stations in my copy of Firefox 4.0

Problem with Windows Media Player in Firefox 4.0.
Windows Media Player (WMP) doesn't work when connecting to Radio Stations in my copy of Firefox 4.0 but works fine using  Firefox 3.6.16. I use this application a lot and am reverting to Firefox 3.6.16 until hopefully this can be fixed. I will illustrate the problem using two Radio stations as they each seem to treat the opening of WMP somewhat differently. I will try first to detail how things work using Firefox 3.6.16 and then indicate where differences occur using Firefox 4.0.

NOTE: I am running Windows XP with service pack 3 on a Dell Dimension 8300. The version of WMP I have is 11.0.5721.5280 which I think is the latest version.

First Radio Station (this is the station I use most).
Using Firefox 3.6.16 .
(1) Go to:
	http://www.wksu.org/classical/classicalchannel/
	Tab shows:
		WKSU-News, Classical, other smart stuff.
	Page shows:
		General information about current programming.

(2) Below “Listen” Click on:
	“Windows Media” 
	(2.1) Address bar shows:
		http://www.wksu.org/listen/classical.asx
	(2.2)Tab shows:
		Classical.asx (video/x-ms-asf Object)
	(2.3)Page shows:
		Solid Black

(3)	Shortly WMP appears in the Page (but separate from it in the sense that if you click the WMP minimize button WMP goes to the tray while the black screen remains in tact) and
		(3.1) WMP shows: “Connecting to …:
		(3.2) then shows: “Buffering”
		(3.3) then begins the current feed and random multicolored display.
(4) As a point of curiosity if you click in the Black Page nothing happens.

Now same Radio station using Firefox 4.0
Repeat (1) through (2.1) above.
Instead of (2.2) above, the Tab now shows the same as the Address bar, namely:
		http://www.wksu.org/listen/classical.asx
	This is followed by (same as (2.3) above):
		Screen turns Solid Black.
	If you click in the screen, the screen turns from Black to White.
	WMP never starts.

Now for the second Radio Station
Using Firefox 3.6.16
(A) Go to:
	http://www.wkhr.org/information/liveonline.aspx
	Tab shows:
		WHKR-91.5 FM
(B) A page of general information appears.
	Below “Select your player to Listen Now: “
	Click on: WMP
	(B1) Address bar shows:
		http://www.wkhr.org/live/wkhr.asx
	(B2) Tab shows:
		whkr.asx (video/x-ms-asf Object)
	(B3) Page turns Black simultaneous with the appearance of WMP and WMP begins to load and play the current streaming along with a random multicolored display.
(C)As a matter of curiosity if you click in the black Page, nothing happens.

Now same Radio station using Firefox 4.0
Go to:
	The same address as in (A) above
There is no Tab this time, only the page of general information as appeared in (B) above.
Below “Select your player to Listen Now: “
	Click on WMP.
The address line shows:
	http://www.wkhr.org/live/wkhr.asx
which is the same as in (B1) above.
The page turns all Black as in (B3) above.
There is some blinking of the cursor.
Nothing else happens
If you move or click the cursor, the Black page changes to all White.

WMP never starts.

An observation:
What seems to be an obvious part of the Trouble with Firefox 4.0 is that the module identified by
Classical.asx (video/x-ms-asf Object) in the first Radio station, and
whkr.asx (video/x-ms-asf Object) in the second Radio station
doesn't seem to get loaded.

I hope someone can fix this whatever the trouble is.
Please let me know if the trouble has been corrected so I can return to the newest version of Firefox.
Thank you in advance.
