QuestionPoint is a browser based chat service that allows librarians to chat
with their patrons via an JavaScript based 'qwidget'. The qwidget is using
textarea to post the messages from the user (patron) to the librarian. 

We have reports of patrons having problems typing messages while in chat using Firefox and our qwidget


Feel free to contact me via email to arrange a time to test.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. User visits a page containing the qwidget. 
2. User submits a question to a librarian
3. Librarian picks up the session
4. The user attempts to reply when they experience the symptoms. 

Actual Results:  
Symptoms:
- The user is unable to type in the qwidget’s message box even after clicking
the cursor in that box repeatedly. 
- The use’s chat messages will ‘drop’ characters as they type in the Qwidget’s
message box
- The user’s chat messages will ‘cache’ in the qwidget’s message box. That is
the patron will be typing but won’t see what they typed until it appears in a
burst. 



Expected Results:  
Patron is able to type in the box and the characters appeared as they are typed
