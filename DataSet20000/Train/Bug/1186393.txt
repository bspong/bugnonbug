Some search add-ons don't perform searches from awesome bar
Reproduced with Firefox 42.0a1 2015-07-21 under Win 7 x64 and Mac OSX 10.9.5.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open Search Preferences and select the option to add more search engines
2. From https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search/?atype=4 page select the first engine (Google Default) and make it the default search engine
3. Go to url bar and start typing
4. Select any of the search suggestions with mouse click
5. Delete everything from location bar and start typing again
6. Select an entry with Down arrow and press Enter

Expected results:
After steps 4 and 6, search results of the entered terms should open

Actual results:
The following error is thrown in the browser's console and the search is not performed:
TypeError: engine is null urlbarBindings.xml:341:19

Notes: 1. Typing a search term and then pressing Enter doesn't reproduce the issue.

2. Not every AMO add-on reproduce this. Here are some others that can be used to reproduce:
 - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ixquick-https-privacy-search-e/?src=search
 - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/internet-search-facebook/?src=search
 - Firefox Add-ons offered while on AMO page
 - YouTube Video Search that can be added using the "+" icon on youtube.com page

3. This seems to be regressed by bug 1168811 (cc'ing :mak). I didn't find any other possible culprits in the pushlog:
