IBM CCK extension causes folder duplication in Bookmarks Toolbar on application start
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 (CK-IBM) Firefox/3.0.1

I have a folder containing some 5 bookmarks as the first bookmark in the Bookmarks toolbar. When I close Firefox and re-open it, the original folder is still there, but there is a duplicate of it placed after my last bookmark in the Bookmarks toolbar, complete with 5 bookmarks in it. This happens every time I close and re-open Firefox. I usually delete that duplicate folder, but it always reappears. But I noticed that if I don't delete it, it is not duplicated any further. Firefox seems to think that 2 copies of the folder is enough :)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Put folder as 1st bookmark in Bookmarks toolbar, preferably containing some bookmarks in it.
2. Close Firefox, then open it again.
3. There should be a duplicate folder after your last bookmark in the Bookmarks toolbar.
Actual Results:  
Folder was duplicated.

Expected Results:  
Software should not have duplicated the folder.
