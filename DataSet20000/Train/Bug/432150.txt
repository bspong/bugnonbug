When I am using Firefox for relatively short periods, I experience a "Ghosting" of sorts, where the image of whatever was before the current view  is still existing on top of the current page. For example, If i were viewing the Firefox Home Page (provided by Google) and committed a search, I would still see the Home Page until I scrolled away from it (down) and "wiped" the old image off the screen. This also happens with tool bars and windows. the Download Manager does not exhibit this problem. This problem occurs no matter what size the window is on my screen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.View Web Pages
2.Change Web site viewing, Window Size (larger), or Alt-Tab into Firefox.
(I alt-Tabbed into Firefox viewing three tabs (Bugzilla, Gmail, and Firefox Home Page, Bugzilla was selected)
Actual Results:  
Ghosting of images on the Firefox UI and Web Page

Expected Results:  
View new page or Firefox instead of Remnants of Microsoft Word 2003

Using a Firefox 2 Theme, Same problem occurs with Default.
