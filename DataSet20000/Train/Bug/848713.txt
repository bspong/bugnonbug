Not all kinds of PDF can be displayed! (especialy Corel-Draw created)[TODO: graphic state operator SMask]

Steps to reproduce:

I just opend a usual PDF.


Actual results:

There is a massive problem with the integrated pdf viewer of firefox 19. I just wondered why ALL my pdf's i ever uploaded (and there are many, i am webdesigner) was shown as hieroglyphs, while the pdf's itself are alright.

For this i can show an example:
http://messe-fsg.de/wp/wp-content/uploads/Ausstellerliste-PAN-2012.pdf
(created with Corel Draw pdf creator)

Should be displayed like this:
http://messe-fsg.de/wp/wp-content/uploads/Ausstellerliste-EGG-2013.pdf
(Created with Adobe Acrobat Distiller)

I tryed some things out and the integrated viewer works if i create the pdf with Adobe Acrobat. But if i use Corel Draw X6 for example there are only hieroglyphs...
In case of other PDF creating programms the viewer shows the PDFs extremly slow.
(dont know if that is important, but its german language and there are "umlaute" included)


Expected results:

Just display the pdf like the adbe reader or another pdf viewer.
