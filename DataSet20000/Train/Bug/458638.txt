After updating Firefox 3.0 to 3.03, Some search engines (Flickr, Live.com, Technorati) were missing. Then I went to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browse/type:4/cat:all?sort=name and I tried to reinstal them, but couldn't complete the operation because I got the following message (Live.com example):

"Firefox could not install the search plugin from "http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/downloads/file/25767/live.com.xml" because an engine with the same name already exists." 

Despite these messages stating that the engines already exist, the missing search engines don't appear in the "Manage Search Engines List". I was unable to re-install the missing search engines.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 3.0/3.01 and add some search engines from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browse/type:4/cat:all?sort=name
2. Update to Firefox 3.03 (notice the missing search engines).
3. Go back to the aforementioned page and try to re-install the missing search engines.
4. Notice the error messages. Notice that the search engines are not listed in the "Manage Search Engines List".
Actual Results:  
User is unable to re-install missing search engines after updating Firefox. 

Expected Results:  
User should be able to re-install missing search engines after updating Firefox.

Verified on several Windows XP/Vista computers when updating from 3.0/3.01 to 3.03.
