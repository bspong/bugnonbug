company private networks secured by software like webwasher on one hand, and sites re-configuring a different set of allowed certificate signers make it difficult to update firefox as it is not allowed to connect to ssl secured update sites.

it would be beneficial to show the update urls so one can click on it and then add an exception for these certificates to make the later update run through without problem.

the same would apply for the firefox update itself.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. try to update all add-ons via tools add-ons 
2. "an error occurred while trying to find updates for <extension>"
3. no more details are there, no url to click

1. try to update firefox via help - check for updates
2. "AUS: Update XML File Malformed (200)"
3. no further hint what is going on, no update url to click and analyse



Expected Results:  
the update url should be shown so one can click on it and analyse the problem or add a security exception.
