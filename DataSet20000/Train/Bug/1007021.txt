Reflow actor should observe reflows in all frames
The reflow actor (bug 997198) only observes reflows in the tabActor's window, but reflows from child windows don't seem to bubble, so we'll need to go through them (via the docshell tree) and list for reflows there too, also listening to frames loaded and unloaded.

There are at least 3 places in our actors that have this kind of window management process:

- the inspector actor:
https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/inspector.js#834
listens to frame load/unload to update the markup-view

- the stylesheets actor:
https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/stylesheets.js#121
lists the stylesheets in the main document and recursively looks for <iframe> nodes in it to list their stylesheets too
https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/styleeditor/StyleEditorUI.jsm#117
On the client side, listens to navigation events to list stylesheets again.

- the newly introduced storage actor:
https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/storage.js#1501
listens to window created and removed
https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/storage.js#1528
listens to pageshow and pagehide events
https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/storage.js#1455
lists all windows and inner windows

Bug 977043 is cleaning this up a bit, so let's wait for this one to be fixed first.

I like the pool management code in the storage actor, I think it should be part of the tab actor.
The tab actor could provide a method to any child actor that needs to know the list of windows, and events to notify of windows being added and removed.
