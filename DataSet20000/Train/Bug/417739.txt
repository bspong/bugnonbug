Flex App (swf) fails to load in SSL environment.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080201 Firefox/2.0.0.12

My application was working before February 7. Now I get an empty Flash container and a "Movie Not Loaded" message when I right-click on the screen. The plugin is working fine, and other flash movies load. It also works in a non-SSL environment. Here's what's different about this Flex App:

I compile this movie to work with AMF-SECURE endpoints. My services-config file uses this entry:

<channel-definition id="my-secure-amf" class="mx.messaging.channels.SecureAMFChannel"> 
		<endpoint uri="https://{server.name}:{server.port}{context.root}/flex2gateway/" 		class="flex.messaging.endpoints.SecureAMFEndpoint"/> 
	</channel-definition> 

This works in Internet Explorer and Firefox 3 Beta. It used to work in the last version of Firefox 2, but now it seems to be broken since the last upgrade.

Other behaviors I've noticed:

If I delete the cache, the movie will load correctly and work fine.

If I clear my authenticated session, or close the browser window, then go back to the page, it won't load.

By the way, Firefox is awesome!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Compile a Flex 2 app in an SSL environment using SecureAMF endpoints (CF7 server).
2.Go to the page (should start with https://)

Actual Results:  
View empty flash container. when you right click, it will say "movie not loaded"
Delete your cache, then watch the movie load.

Expected Results:  
Load the SWF when the page loads.

Our company is about to roll out code that uses this ssl configuration, so for us, this is a pretty big bug.
