cookie blocking does not work anymore

I recently checked my cookie list and I was horrified to see that I had hundreds of them, from many web site I had never ever allowed. After deleting all of them and deleting all my cookie site list, I was still amazed to see that any web site that was not in the "block" list was allowed, and that Firefox was not anymore asking me if I wanted to allow/block the web site from setting a cookie.

After an hour of ggogling, I found that what is broken is the setting "network.cookie.lifetimePolicy" and the corresponding interface menu "Keep cookies". According to the knoledge base:
http://kb.mozillazine.org/About:config_entries#Network..2A
this is the description of the setting:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Determines how browser sets  cookie lifetimes.
0 (default): Use supplied lifetime
1: Ask before accepting
2: Accept for session only
3: Cookies last for the number of days specified in network.cookie.lifetime.days
Note: In Firefox, this can be changed via "Tools &#8594; Options &#8594; Privacy &#8594; Cookies &#8594; Keep Cookies"
------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two huge obvious bugs in this:
1- The "lifetime" policy should not decide of the policy to set cookies. They are two orthogonal choices. How can I decide if I want a cookie to be set or not and at the same time if I want its lifetime to be limited or not ?

2- The default of Firefox should not disable all possibilities to allow or block cookies. There is a really nice framework in Firefox to choose cookies based on the website, it is one of the main features and the new default is to disable the feature and allow all cookies ? This is insane !

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1- set the lifetime of cookies to "until they expire"
2- go to a website that is not already in the block/allow list and register cookies
Actual Results:  
no window pops up for asking the user if he wants to allow/block cookies. It looks like the web site does not have any cookie. But a cookie is silently written.

Expected Results:  
setting the lifetime should not invalidate the possibility to allow/block cookies based on the website. The window allow/block should always popup like it used to be.
