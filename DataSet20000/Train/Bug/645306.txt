conflict with screen hover utilities (xScope, uPointer) results non responsive hover
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_6; en-us) AppleWebKit/533.20.25 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0.4 Safari/533.20.27

When another program that uses global screen hovering such as xScope, is launched with Firefox 4, Firefox's hovers are non responsive to html (links, pseudo class), css or javascript, and cursor stays as ibeam, rather than pointer. Links still work, but there's no visual activation.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch xScope with Firefox 4
2. Firefox 4's hover states are visually non responsive
3. Quit xScope
4. Firefox 4's hover states function normally
Actual Results:  
Firefox 4's hover states are visually non responsive

Expected Results:  
Firefox 4's hover states function normally

Shared reports at https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/questions/793586. I reported this to xScope's iconfactory also, but now suspect it may be Firefox's bug, since it started with a new version of FF, not xScope, and a post from the above link reported similar on Windows, where that couldn't involve xScope, a Mac only app. I suspect a similar type of app is open when this is triggered, that has to do with global screen hovering. I asked for other evidence of a reproducible conflict with another program.
