When I set my default web page colors to light on dark and/or use a high-dpi
monitor half of the web (including some mozilla.org pages) breaks.

My suggestion is to put a features into Mozilla that would show the broken pages
as such.

The most common problems are sizes in pixels and wrong colors afaik.

For sizes in pixels, anything that is sized in pixels should be reduced to size
zero (or one pixel so that people are aware there is some contetnt). This
particular misfeature does not affect Mozilla too much as one can increase text
size manually.

For colors, Mozilla should track if a color was set (or inherited from) the
default color preferences or it was set from the web page.

When an object has background-color specified by the page and color inherited
from the defaults, the color should be reset to background-color, rendering the
text or drawing invisible. The same when it is the other way around.

This should be default on (with a big fat warning in the release notes which are
hardly ever read by anybody).

Since the errors were already detected there could be a button in the ui that
turns on counter-bad-design mode temporarily so that the page can be read easily.

Reproducible: Always
