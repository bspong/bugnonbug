Tab bar hangs when waking from standby
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:12.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/12.0

Steps to reproduce:

This happens when my (windows XP) machine wakes from standby. This happens when waking from standby on both my laptops. It does not happen every time (probably about 50%). It has happened at least 50 times now, although I still can't work out exactly what triggers it. I usually have around 3 or 4 tabs open when it happens.

It does not happen on older versions of firefox, although I cannot say when exactly it first started happening. It definitely does not happen on firefox 3.6. I do not remember it happening on firefox 11.


Actual results:

The tab bar becomes completely unresponsive. Clicking on tabs does nothing, but they do highlight when the mouse hovers over them. 

Pressing Ctrl+T will open a new tab but the tab bar won't update or display that it exists. Pressing Ctrl+tab will cycle through the tabs as expected but the tab bar doesn't show which tab is active. 

The keyboard can no longer be used to scroll pages - pressing up/down or pageup/pagedown stops working.

Pressing Ctrl+W will close the tab, but the tab bar will continue to display a blank tab (no text, no favicon, no X to close) where it was.

This happens even in safe mode. Closing and reopening firefox fixes it. 

If I leave it, after a few minutes it will 'jump' back to normal, suddenly displaying the new tabs I've opened and the currently active tab will change to the tab that was furthest right when the tab bar hanged. Pages then respond to pageup/pagedown as normal.


Expected results:

The tab bar should respond to clicking, and show new tabs.
