Unable to view Web Console for pop-up windows during creation

I sometimes use a javascript chat web-app on a members-only site. It is IRC-based with a small Flash IRC connector and then all the IRC client activity done in Javascript.

The app opens new pop-up windows for each chat channel. The windows do not have a menu bar or tool-bars.

Whilst trying to debug a minor problem with the app when running on Firefox 4 beta I discovered a problem with the Web Console. My previous experience was with Firefox 3.6.x where the Console is a singleton.

Because the Web Console appears to be bound to each window it is not possible to view problems of new pop-up windows as they are created.

I enabled the Console in the 'Channel List' window (Ctrl+Shift+K) which runs the code that creates the new pop-up 'channel chat' expecting to see logging from the new window but nothing appears.

Once the new pop-up window is created I can enable the Console (Ctrl+Shift+K) but it is empty.

There doesn't appear to be a way to log problems or messages during pop-up window creation.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a pop-up window to a Javascript page that generates console log output during creation.
2. Try to view log output using Web Console

Actual Results:  
Apparently no way to view the creation-time log messages from the pop-up window.

Expected Results:  
Be able to view the creation-time log messages of the pop-up window.
