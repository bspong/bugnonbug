When I begin to type in a URL, if it begins with "ch", Firefox fills in a possible URL for me:  some page from Target about furniture.  I have tried everything I can think ofto get rid of this, including, obviously, deleting browsing history and deleting cookies.  I deleted all Internet Explorer cookies, thinking Firefox was somehow looking there.  I don't know where this comes from.  It's not a big deal -- it doesn't affect the Firefox's functionality, but it's weird!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Type "ch" in the URL bar
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Firefox offers the following potential URL:
"http://www.target.com/s/ref=sr_items_90?ie=UTF8&searchView=grid5&keywords=desk&field_browse=1038614&searchSize=90&field_availability=-2&searchBinNameList=subjectbin%2Cprice%2Ctarget_com_age%2Ctarget_com_gender-bin%2Ctarget_com_character-bin%2Ctarget_com_primary_color-bin%2Ctarget_com_size-bin%2Ctarget_com_brand-bin&refinementHistory=subjectbin%2Cprice%2Ctarget_com_age%2Ctarget_com_gender-bin%2Ctarget_com_character-bin%2Ctarget_com_primary_color-bin%2Ctarget_com_size-bin%2Ctarget_com_brand-bin&field_price=5000-9999&searchNodeID=1038614&field_launch-date=-1y&searchRank=relevancerank&field_subjectbin=4035681&searchPage=1&field_keywords=desk&pf_rd_r=04MW9VJ2GSPHBD6VYM7C&pf_rd_m=A1VC38T7YXB528&pf_rd_t=301&pf_rd_i=0&pf_rd_p=489944911&pf_rd_s=center-3"

Expected Results:  
I expect options such as "Chicago Tribune", but not this weird Target page.
