support a full share panel

a simple recommend button is not sufficient for all use cases.  In particular it is not enough to support privacy config even for facebook.  This is a quick brain dump outlining this feature, along with images and prototype code.

The definition of this feature is pending agreement in product and ux.

goals of our share panel are simple; 

we provide an iframe in a panel that allows a social provider to load their own share ui.  This works essentially like all the other social panels

we send opengraph data to the provider when the user clicks on share.  this allows the provider to so some work without fetching and parsing a webpage somewhere.  we do not send actual images (on the page or otherwise generated views of the page) since that could cause privacy issues.

we do not require the share page to use any other socialapi functionality.  We do this so we can support oexchange share endpoints.

we support three use cases:

- vendor share ui is in a panel
- vendor share ui is in the sidebar, button is "one-click" which sends opengraph data to the sidebar
- vendor has one-click no-ui recommend support (what we already have in socialapi)

We do not support more than one of the above use-case at a time.

We may support quick-switching the panel to a different share provider.
