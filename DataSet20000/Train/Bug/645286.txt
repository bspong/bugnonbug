Firefox 4.0 will not start after download. Occasionally get message that another application is using Firefox and that restart of computer may be necessary. When get lucky enough to get Firefox to open, Mozilla tab is on and in lower left corner of page note says its trying to transfer data from Google. Tired to restore computer to earlier setting -- old version will not play. In past week or so it was starting to take forever to open up. Other brosers (Explorer/Google work fine -- but I like Firefox!!!) HELP!!!

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Problem is non-reproducible to the extent that I could never get the download to work and computer restore efforts to an earlier configuration did not respolve problem. Firefox is "frozen" and simply will not work!


I have uninstalled and re-installed Firefox 4.0 -- same problem .... Seems to be trying to transfer information fromn google and is hung up in some kind of an unending loop. After first "upgrade" I tried to fix problem by restoring the configuration to an earlier date (tried three) -- did not work.
