Hi, I've experienced the same behavior on my fully configured (29 ext. incl Tab
Mix) FF 1.0.6 
and also 
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050818
Firefox/1.0+ - Build ID: 2005081821
which only has 1 extension installed, Local Install 3.0.1 (and a separate
profile, of course). 
My homepage is about:blank. browser.tabs.autoHide=true. Local Install has
"About:? Window Settings / Select Window Target: / New Tab" . Selecting
about:config causes 2 tabs to be opened. The 1st is untitled and the 2nd is
about:config.

I originally suspected this was a MrTLI problem and tried to get an answer in
the Mozillazine MrTLI thread but then recreated the same bug with Scrapbook
0.16.0 (scrapbook.usetab.open=true).  This made me wonder if it's actually a bug
in tabbrowser and addtab when the tab bar is hidden and no tab is open yet.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
2 tabs opened when one requested.  1st tab is Untitled and extraneous. 2nd tab
is intended. 

Expected Results:  
Display the next winning Lotto combination?   No, seriously folks :-)
