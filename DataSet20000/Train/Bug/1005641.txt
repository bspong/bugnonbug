Steps to reproduce:

1.Have latest FF browser and Latest ESR version 24.5.0 on OEL 6.
2.Set FF as default browser when it prompts.
3. And open the ESR latest version and it prompts for set default , just select OK(Now FF ESR is default)
4.Again make FF as default, now latest FF becomes default.
5. Now I am unable to set the FF ESR 24.5.0 as default browser, It prompts a warning message.
NOTE : I need to have the two versions of FF to test my application compatibility on both the versions.


Actual results:

warning message:
