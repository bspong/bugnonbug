password not accepted anymore after updating to Firefox 3.5.1

I recently updated to Firefox 3.5.1 (from 3.0.something) and immediately at startup the Xmarks-addon starts asking me my PIN (master password) in it's popup window, as it probably failed trying to connect to xmarks' server.
I reseted the password manually a few times, using their page for forgotten passwords. However, the original, over 10-digit PIN just wouldn't do, so I tried one without periods, colons and hyphens. This one worked immediately.
So I'm guessing that something in the password translation has changed between FF-versions and now all the not-so-common password marks, like periods, colons and hyphens don't translate the same.
Xmarks-addon uses a popup interface, in which the password is written and their homepage uses a normal type-in box.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
Just a guess, but here goes,
1.Install Xmarks
2.Create an account, making a password full of periods, hyphens and colons
3.Observe how it's impossible use the xmarks-addon, as it can't accept those marks in a password.
Actual Results:  
I already had Xmarks installed through the Firefox update to 3.5.1, and the result was that it wouldn't accept the stored PIN code and tried to get it from me.

Expected Results:  
The software(s) should have continued without a popup window, asking me to fill in the PIN code it already knew. Everything should have gone smooth, without a pasword problem.
