Pheonix overwrites bookmarks file on quit - possibly overwriting external changes

Just after installing phoenix 0.5 I decided to symbolicly link to my mozilla
bookmarks file so they could share the same bookmarks file. I quit phoenix and
then my mozilla bookmarks were overwriten with the bookmarks that phoenix was
currently using.

The bug is not specific to symbolic links... that was just my first experience
with the bug.

This bug only occured to me in linux but I never tested it anywhere else and
expect that since bookmarks shouldnt be platform specific the bug occurs on
other platforms as well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
While phoenix is running:
1. Backup bookmarks file
2. Add 1 or 2 new bookmarks
3. Remove bookmarks.html and replace with the backed up file
4. Quit phoenix
5. Start phoenix
6. Look at bookmarks menu and see that the bookmarks that were added to the
non-backup copy now exist in the backed up (now put back into place) copy

Actual Results:  
New bookmarks file was overwritten with bookmarks currently in use.

Expected Results:  
Left the bookmarks alone.

Maybe I am just anoyed that I lost ALL my bookmarks but I think that the
bookmarks file should be written to disk every time a change is made. This isnt
a huge cost because bookmarks arent modified so often that it needs to be cached
for later.

This would also ensure that any bookmarks that were created and then if phoenix
crashed, would have been saved still.

However, if despite my thoughts, it was implemented this way for some reason,
just mark this bug as resolved.
