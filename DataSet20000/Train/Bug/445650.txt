...When you begin to load a game at games.myspace.com, first it loads the advertisement and you can see the AD for about 10 seconds, then the game begins to load, however about 2 seconds after the game begins to load, the browser crashes...its happened about 4-5 times with me because i wanted to test to see if it was only a one time thing or if it was going to reoccur...

6.After the AD goes away, the game will begin to load, and it will load for about 2 seconds then before the game can be played, the browser will crash...
Actual Results:  
The browser crashed like i said it would...

Expected Results:
