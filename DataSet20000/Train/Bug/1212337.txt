Search term with empty suggestions breaks future valid suggestions from displaying
Occurs on 41 and 44, OSX 10.11, Google as default search, suggestions are on.

Searching for a term that does not have any results in the response array, for example:

https://www.google.com/complete/search?client=firefox&q=ç©

responds with:

["ç©",[]]

Will stop future valid suggestions from displaying in the suggestions list, even though the response to those searches contains an array of suggestions. A restart of Firefox will fix this, but that shouldn't be needed.

Steps:

1. Perform a search for a known good search (such as "a") to verify search suggestions are on and working, 10 suggestions should be returned in the network response as expected, and those 10 suggestions should be displayed in the suggestion list.

2. Perform a search with a term that doesn't return results (such as the above example, "ç©"), note that no suggestions are returned in the network response and nothing is displayed in the suggestion list (perhaps a message should be shown in the suggestion list? Like "No suggestions for search <search term>").

3. Perform a search again for a known good search (such as "a"), 10 suggestions are returned in the network response as expected, however they are not displayed in the suggestion list.

No future search suggestions will display until firefox is restarted.
