Lately it seems i am always getting redirected away from the web page i am on. At first i thought it was the site but it happens on almost every other site i go to including yahoo mail. The main site i go to is www.fanfiction.net and yahoo mail. When i am on fanfiction.net i could spend 10 min reading and the next thing i know i am being redirected to Candystand.com , facebook andothers. Is there a way to fix this?

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to a site like www.fanfiction.net or yahoo mail
2.wait for 5 to 10 min
3.redirect occurs 3 out of 5 times
Actual Results:  
after i go to a site after about 5 - 10 min redirect may occur.

Expected Results:  
stayed on the site i went to.

I am not sure what else i need to say or do so please fill free to contact me with any questions on this report. I may not know a lot about computers but i know that if i go to a web site i should stay on it until i decide to change it.
thank you
