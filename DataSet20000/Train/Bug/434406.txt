BACKGROUND:

"If you enter text into the Location bar that is not a valid Internet address (URL), Firefox will try to direct you to the location you intended."

For text that is non-ambiguous, such as metro-north (a train system in the United State), Firefox will direct you to its correct URL (http://www.mta.info/mnr/index.html). For text that is ambiguous, such as Cambridge (could be US, UK, or University) Firefox will direct you to a Google search of that item.

PROBLEM:

The problem arises because these searches are recorded in the history as http://metro-north and http://cambridge. Thus, when I try to enter the same search terms again in the address bar, URL Autofill suggests these two, and Domain Guessing will send me to http://www.metro-north.com and http://www.cambridge.com, which are NOT what the original searches gave me. Frequently, Domain Guessing leads to a different URL a Keyword Search, usually due to squatter sites.

Note: It seems that this only applies to single-string searches like metro-north and cambridge. For example, location bar searching "cambridge university" will not save the search in history and autofill will not suggest http://cambridge_university.
