Visiting a secure website with an untrusted issuer, I am able to launch the Add Security Exception dialog, and retrieve the certificate, but the Certificate Status panel reports that "This site provides valid, verified identification. There is no need to add an exception." and the "Confirm Security Exception" button is disabled, preventing me from confirming the exception and accessing the site.

This happens with both self-signed and non-self-signed certificates.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a secure site with an untrusted issuer (https://www.brianpmearns.com/ has a cert signed by StartCom Ltd., you can use that if you don't have the StartCom CA certs installed)
2. Expand the "Technical Details" section and confirm that the Error code is sec_error_unknown_issuer.
3. Expand the "I Understand the Risks" section.
4. Click the "Add Exception..." button.
5. Click the "Get Certificate" button.

You should now be able to confirm the security exception, but the button to do so is disabled.
Actual Results:  
The "Confirm Security Exception" button is disabled, preventing the exception from being added.

Expected Results:  
The "Confirm Security Exception" button should be enabled, allowing the exception to be added.

The only work around I know of us to install the issuer's cert as a trusted CA. Without doing so, you are unable to visit the website, but doing so could be a security issue.
