The following javascript code, run on a window opened by script, crashes Firefox
(tested on Linux and Windows with several releases, including latests nightly
build) :

window.setTimeout("window.close()", 100);
alert('Testcase Message');
window.stop();

Testcase attached.

Marked security to reduce short-term annoyance (it is easy to use script
injection techniques to trigger the bug).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open http://julien.plissonneau.duquene.net/mozilla_crash_testcase_20050826.html
2. click [crash]

Actual Results:  
The alert dialog is shown, disappears almost immediately, and Firefox crashes.

Does not crash when any of the three lines is commented out.
When removing window.stop(), the window closes, but also removes the alert box
before the user clicks on OK.

Expected Results:  
Keep running.

Wait until the user clicks "OK" on the alert box (MSIE does this with similar
code) to close the child window.
