I uploaded Mozilla Firefox 4, and Yahoo, Cox e-mail, and Match.com keeps crashing or the websites are not loading to see the main pages. Everything would be scrunched over to the left going straight down the page, and the print would be over itself.  Also, I have the fingerprint log in with scanning my fingerprint, and Firefox 4 no longer recognized the websites to open them anymore.  It would tell me that the website is no longer good for netflix, yahoo, cox e-mail, match.com, and so on.  So,  I had to go back to Firefox 3.whatever the last one was, and everything is loading just fine.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. reopen the websites
2. had to redownload firefox 3.???
3. kept closing and opening the websites and did not help

Actual Results:  
Screens would crash and not open, or be scrunched over to the left, my fingerprint scan with all the websites would no longer open and tell me they were not actual websites.  

Expected Results:  
firefox 4 kept crashing

usually it opens the websites with a new tab
