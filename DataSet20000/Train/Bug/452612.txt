Fails to login to sites it knows the password for after restart

I wanted to download several files from a site.

This site requires login credentials which i have, and they are stored in Firefox's save passwords.

I went through several files, selecting "Save link as"

A lot of files were piling up in "Downloads".

I realized it would be too late to wait for them to complete, so i wanted to go to bed - i don't like the computer to run all night so i started a program to initialize a shutdown in 2 hours. I assume that Firefox would stop downloading if it hadn't finished and then close, and i could resume next day.

The next day i check the downloads window and see that several items had "failed" - i assumed that meant they hadn't download.

So I select "Retry" on an item, assuming it would download.

It downloads something in 1-2 seconds. This file had the same name as one in the queue, but when i looked at it, i see its a tiny html file saying essentially "You must login to access this"

Ie. Firefox did NOT login - even though the login details for this site are in the password manager.

And the retry option disappears, so now i have to copy the url and paste it into the url bar to download each and every file.

Very annoying.
