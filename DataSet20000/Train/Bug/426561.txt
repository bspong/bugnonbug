(JS) Selection objects do not provide a way to restore 'upside-down' selections (where the anchor is below the focus)

The focusNode and anchorNode interface to Selection objects (window.getSelection) makes it possible to see whether a selection was selected from top to bottom or from bottom to top. When getting a Range object from the selection, this information is lost (Ranges always go top to bottom), and consequently, when restoring a selection using Selection.addRange, the selection will always be top-to-bottom. This causes problems in systems that, for some reason, want to muck with the DOM tree at unpredictable times -- when the mucking happens while the user is selecting something, the restored selection will not match the actual selection, and continuing to drag will not have the effect the user intended. I guess this is a basic problem with the DOM standard, but some work-around (second argument to addRange? writable anchor/focus properties?) would be much appreciated.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/codemirror-moz-bug/htmltest.html
2. Put your mouse somewhere at the bottom of the code iframe
3. Slowly drag upwards, watch your selection behave badly
Actual Results:  
Selection anchor and focus are swapped every time the editor updates itself (done by JS timeout).

Expected Results:  
Well, the same, until I can change the code to somehow create upside-down selections.
