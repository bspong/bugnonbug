History and Bookmarks showing in URL Address Window even after clearing all Private Data
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

I closed all the TABS, went into tools/clear private data and cleared cookies, cache, history and offline web data and then closed Firefox completely.

My History under tools/options/privacy is also set to ZERO days.

But if I open a new Firefox browser and when I click on the down arrow in the Address Bar, I get this:

the ones in red are the pages I visited previously and this shouldn't be showing because I cleared all private data.

the ones in blue are pages under my bookmarks that shouldn't even show because I haven't visited them in a while.

if I highlight each one of them in blue with my mouse and keep pressing the DELETE button, they will go away but as soon as I click on the down arrow again, they are there again.

How do you make them disappear permanently?

This means I can clear everything, close Firefox and if someone were to open it, they can STILL see where I been and what's under my bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.just open Firefox and click on the upside down triangle in the URL History and it shows
2.
3.



not show anything in there after clearing all private data and especially not show any bookmark website addresses
