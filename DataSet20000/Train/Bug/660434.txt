Discovered am 27th May 2011.

Firefox 5 had been performing OK for a few days.
Logged in to BT Yahoo Mail - saw e-mail contents fine - as usual, and as per the previous days on FF 5.
On trying to forward a message all the e-mail content disappeared.
Checking on other messages titles only visible, no content - not on 'preview pane' or on full message.
Logged on via Explorer - no problem.
Logged on via FF 5 on another e-mail account and exactly the same problem.
Something happened to FF 5 on Friday morning.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Tried another browser - Fine
2.Tried another e-mail account on the same url on FF 5- same problem
3.

Actual Results:  
Explorer OK
Firefox 5 not OK


This problem occured 'in front of my eyes' - one minute I could see the e-mail message content, then it was gone - and it has now stayed gone.
New messages have arrived and I can see the headers, but not the message content.
Yahoo Mail would appear to be OK as it works fine on Explorer and via my Mobile on Opera.
