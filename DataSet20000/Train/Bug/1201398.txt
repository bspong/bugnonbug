There is currently no way for the user to quickly and easily change the permissions related to Push Notifications in FF to permanently or temporarily turn them off. Each message that appears from each different web page must be clicked on, then the user must know enough about FF to navigate to the lock on the url bar to access Control Center. There is no way for the user to see in one place all the sites that are allowed or the ability to change the permission of multiple sites in one interface. The Control Center is first and foremost a per-site interface. 

A simple centralized management interface for Push in the browser can be made as part of the Content Preferences Pane, alongside Pop-up blocking (see attachment).

How would this interface be discovered and accessed in FF 43? A settings cog in each message on FF Windows  (see Bug 1201397) would take the user to the detail list view of a new Push Notifications setting in the Content prefs pane (see attachment for example of view). 

For FF 42 this centralized interface would not be available, but a settings cog could take the user to a the Control Center view of the Push permissions (see attachment), thus allowing at least a one-click way to change the permission for the one site at a time.
