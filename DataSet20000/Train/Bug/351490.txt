In options - privacy - checkbox "ask me before clearing private data" there's a button "clear now".
When the checkbox is checked the button gets ellipses "Clear Now..." indicating a dialog will appear after clicking, if unchecked ellipses disappear.

But, when clicking "Clear Now" or "Clear Now..." the state of the checkbox is ignored! Instead the setting gets used which was active when opening the dialog (privacy.sanitize.promptOnSanitize).

Thus:
privacy.sanitize.promptOnSanitize=true, checkbox=unchecked, "Clear Now", shows dialog
privacy.sanitize.promptOnSanitize=false, checkbox=checked, "Clear Now", doesn't show dialog

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open - tools - options, select privacy
2. change checkbox "ask me before clearing private data" !important!
3. click "clear now/..."
4. click ok (saves preferences)
5. repeat step 1-4


Actual Results:  
if "clear now...": no dialog is shown
if "clear now": dialog is shown

Expected Results:  
"Clear Now..." should always show dialog
"Clear Now" should never show dialog
Clear Now button should show dialog according to checkbox


Maybe it's a critical bug, because one might think to be able click on "clear now..." then deselect something (e.g. browsing history). Browsing history is the lost immediately, without further notice!
