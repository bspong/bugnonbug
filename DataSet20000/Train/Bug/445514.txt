Firefox 3 shows proxy authentication window when (other) https page loaded in https website
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1a1pre) Gecko/2008071603 Minefield/3.1a1pre
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1a1pre) Gecko/2008071603 Minefield/3.1a1pre

I am experiencing this problem since the begin of Firefox 3 and older releases too. I have tested the newest Minefield version to see if the bug still existed.

We run a (Bluecoat) Proxy. The authentication is handled with NTLM. This works fine so far but it seems that on https sites there is a problem with authentication. I found out, that the https site gets loaded fine until a second (or multiple other) https sites are loaded in the background. Then a authentication prompt popup appears.

In the proxy log it shows the following information:
TCP_ACCELERATED/200 39 CONNECT tcp://mail.google.com:443/ - NONE/- -
TCP_ACCELERATED/200 39 CONNECT tcp://mail.google.com:443/ - NONE/- -

***At this point the authentication popup appears. And then:***

TCP_DENIED/407 322 CONNECT tcp://ssl.google-analytics.com:443/ - NONE/- -
TCP_DENIED/407 579 CONNECT tcp://ssl.google-analytics.com:443/ - NONE/- -
TCP_ACCELERATED/200 39 CONNECT tcp://ssl.google-analytics.com:443/ SG01\a.username NONE/- -
TCP_DENIED/407 268 CONNECT tcp://ssl.google-analytics.com:443/ - NONE/- -
TCP_DENIED/407 322 CONNECT tcp://www.blogger.com:443/ - NONE/- -
TCP_DENIED/407 579 CONNECT tcp://www.blogger.com:443/ - NONE/- -
TCP_ACCELERATED/200 39 CONNECT tcp://www.blogger.com:443/ SG01\a.username NONE/- -

My guess is that there Firefox does not forward the already known NTLM data when a https site is loaded within a https site. Check the source code on gmail.com, you will see the google-analytics and blogger inputs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use a (Bluecoat) Proxy server with NTLM authentication
2. Surf to a https website which includes other https pages
Actual Results:  
A popup window for proxy authentication appears with the following content and two input fields for username and password:

"The proxy xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8080 is requesting a user name and password. The site says: ""

Expected Results:  
Firefox should already know the NTLM user data and access the other https sites without asking for username and password again.

- The user/password information you type into this authentication popup are not saved. The next time you reproduce this bug, the popup still appears (although with your already given informations).
