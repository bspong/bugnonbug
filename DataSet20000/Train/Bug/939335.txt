Text on browser tabs is pixelated / corrupted when OMTC enabled (DirectX 11)

I noticed when I forced DirectX 11 and OTMC, the text on the browser tabs is pixelated/corrupted when I scroll left/right. When I scroll to the far right or far left, it takes about 5 seconds for the text to return to normal unless I hover over the tab with my mouse pointer. I've attached a screenshot of the issue. Here are the about:config flags I have set to TRUE for OMTC:

layers.acceleration.force-enabled
layers.async-video.enabled
layers.offmainthreadcomposition.animate-opacity
layers.offmainthreadcomposition.animate-transform
layers.offmainthreadcomposition.enabled

The last time I played around with OTMC was about a week ago and I did not see this behavior. I don't have a better regression window at this time though.
