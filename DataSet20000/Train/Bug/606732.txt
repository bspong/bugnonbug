Guys

My laptop (6 months old) did an update this week to 3.6.11, from what older version I am not sure but f it helps it has been on auto update.

Since the update I have not been able to login to my interent bank, (Page won't load) Link above!! and to my horror I had to use IE. (old Netscape lover).

I then went to my wifes laptop which had also update to 3.6.11, it also has the same problem. Please help as I really hate IE with a passion.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Got to http://www.suncorp.com.au/
2.Got to drop down (red)on the top RH side and click on internet banking!
3.It wiill call the secure page and will just sit there and hang, and han with no result.

Thanks Russell

Expected Results:  
Loads page so you can enter your passwords to access my accounts

The only other thing I suspect was the Auto update for AVG2011 virus scanner but as my wifes computer runs Nortons and had the same problem I have put it down to version 3.6.11 auto update. I had an old version of 3.5.6 and installed that and everything is working like it should.
