Something about this website forces Fox to return a dialog box requesting permission to open/save the file as "application-trash".  This is not a consistent behavior, but is something that has happened a few times in the last week.

This conduct does not happen every day I go to the webpage, but when it does happen, the dialog box will appear many times in a row.  Then, at some point, the behavior relents, and it will return as the expected web page. [today, it took 3 tries]  When it does happen, it persists both as a "click" and "control-click" into a new tab.

I have no idea whether it is a fault in the Fox process, or if there is something about the document as served up.

I do note that the message bar, in the faulted mode or with a normal return, both show the correct URL in the lower left message bar.

I request the URL from a local web-page on my laptop, which has been unchanged for years.   A few days ago, typing the URL in manually, also returned the odd dialog box.

Reproducible: Sometimes
