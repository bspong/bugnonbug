I had Firefox v0.8, everything was fine, then I download MSN Messenger and
everytime I tried open firefox after I installed MSN crashed. The Firefox
software didnt work anymore. I downloaded the new Firefox version. But now Id
seen popups windows with publicity in some pages. As long as Im using firefox
the screen "jumps" as a unstable voltage. I can see how many mails I have on my
hotmail account. I dont know, maybe MSN messed with my firefox. But MSN just can
mess with a new version of firefox, thats why the old one stopped working.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Firefox v0.8
2.Install MSN Messenger (new version)
3.Try to open Firefox

Actual Results:  
The firefox window automatically close "Firefox has a problem and it has to
close report this error with microsoft"

Expected Results:  
To keep open and working

I never used MSN before, I had trillian instead. The software was fine (firefox
v8.0) then I install for the first time MSN Messenger and firefox stop working.
The new version of firefox works but I saw popup advices. And the behavior when
is open is weird (jumping screen in an instant sometimes)
