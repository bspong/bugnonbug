On starting and showing tabs from previous session, last active tab loads as "untitled" blank page.

I noticed this a while ago, but thought it was a gmail issue (since that is the tab I usually close out on).  After several weeks, I noticed that when I close on other tabs, the same thing occurs.  

I have ff load my windows and tabs from last time.  This was working fine until recently (I believe with the latest update, but I can't be certain).  Now all my tabs load fine, but my last active tab will not load.

As a temporary workaround, I can load an extra tab with nothing on it before closing, so I won't lose the information.  The "untitled" tab does not give me the option to go back to the page I was on.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use FF as usual, with multiple tabs.
2. Close browser.
3. Start FF with option "show windows and tabs from last time" activated.

Actual Results:  
As described above, all tabs load except the tab that was active when FF was closed.

Expected Results:  
All tabs should load, including the last active tab.
