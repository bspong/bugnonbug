I was using Firefox browser from the first version released. But I feel after getting the latest updates performance went down on tabbed browsing. When I am opening around 10 pages ( mostly technical pages/articles related to computers, pages won't take much size ) CPU utilization gone more than 80% and all my programs became slow. I opened task manager and checked the individual processor utilization by the programs. I was amazed to see that Firefox uses 75% !!. This problem stops me from using the program.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox browser and open several tabbed pages
2. Open codeproject.com, 4guysfromrolla.com, windows live mail, gmail, wikipedia and ASP.NET forums in these tabs
3. Check the CPU usage meter comes with windows.
4. Open all these in other browser
Actual Results:  
Processor utilization went more than 75%
Step4 : Will maintain normal CPU utilization

Expected Results:  
It should be in a reasonable manner and should not disturb other programs
