In general Applets do not get resized by FireFox 3 properly. Specifically when loading an image of a specific size in the ChartNotes applet from www.stockcharts.com the displayed PNG is distorted. The colors will be off and the location of the image will be off.

Is there anyway to programmatically prevent the resizing of an Applet within a browser window? I understand you can turn off auto resizing/zooming of images as an option under the view drop down window, but it would be nice not to have to relate this information to non-technical users, and just have it occur silently in the background.
