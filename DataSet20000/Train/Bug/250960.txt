Firefox "cements" the default dial-up connection, and prevents the default from being changed.

We have a number of ISP dial-up connections.  WITHOUT Firefox installed the
default Network Connection can be readily changed (Start/Setting/Network
Connections/ <right click> and either "Cancel as default connection" or "Set as
default connection" respectively.  Also, where MSIE/OE use a "Dial Up
Connection" dialogue with selectable Dial Up, Firefox uses the default Network
Connection with no selectability of connection.  Uninstalling Firefox restores
this functionality.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Firefox 0.9.2 installed on WinXP Prof
2. Multiple Network Connections available - one set as default 


Actual Results:
