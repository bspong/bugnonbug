wrong url can be show when navigating history from the back and forward buttons

When I browse to a page using a custom protocol handler, the navigation bar displays the absolute file path to the chrome url which handles the protocol handler, rather than the proper URI.  Refreshing corrects the url in the nav bar, but browsing forward and back brings back the jar:file:/// path.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a protocol handler where the channel redirects to a chrome url
2. browse to protocolname:foo
3. hit back and then forward.

Actual Results:  
the address bar shows jar:file:///path/to/plugin/uuid/path/to/chromefile

Expected Results:  
the address bar will show protocolname:foo

I'm not sure that the way I implemented newChannel is proper, but I'm fairly sure that showing file paths to chrome files is not a good idea, and that if refreshing fixes the problem that it's a bug!

It's an issue on at least linux and windows, and several versions of firefox.

happy to hand my procol handler off, and to help track down the bug.
