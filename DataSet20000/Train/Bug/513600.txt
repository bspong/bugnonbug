If I try to open up Internet Explorer 8.0, home page for internet explorer automatically opens in firefox

I recently downloaded firefox version 3.5. It automatically was set to be my default browser without my consent. When I try to open up internet explorer 8.0, it automatically opens up in firefox. I am extremely distressed by this being some websites I view will not work with just firefox. An exmaple website is http://www.hauntingechoes.com/index.php. When one tries to log in, the user is not truly logged in. The problem is firefox being it works on other internet browsers.

I need internet explorer for some school projects. Firefox just won't cut it with the current settings. I have tried about all ways to get Firefox to STOP being the default browser, but it refuses to not be the default browser. This is a major issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on the button to open up internet explorer with Firefox version 3.5 previously installed
2. Whatever the homepage set for internet explorer will appear in Firefox and NOT in an internet explorer window
Actual Results:  
When I attempt to open up internet explorer, firefox automatically popped up instead of internet explorer window

Expected Results:  
The default browser should be internet explorer NOT Firefox when the computer is set to have Internet Explorer as its default browser
