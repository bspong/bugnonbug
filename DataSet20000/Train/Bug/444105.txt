In some Firefox & Thunderbird Option panels, text runs outside of
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.15) Gecko/20080623 Firefox/2.0.0.15

: In some Firefox/Thunderbird windows that can be resized, the text 
sometimes is wider/longer than the window so we can't read the end of line and/or 
see the button's completely. Does not occur when using Tahoma as System wide 
font.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

1. In Windows XP, go to Pref Panel Display  -> Appearance

2. In Font size, choose Lucida Grande, click Apply.

3. In Firefox, go to Options -> Main -> Systems Defaults (this part does not 

appear completely, and we only see the top half of the 'Check Now' button, cf 

attached screencap firefox_option1.gif)

4. In Firefox, go to Options -> Content -> Colors (the sentence 'Allow pages...' 

does not appear completely, cf attached screencap firefox_option1.gif)

5. In Thunderbird, french version, go to Outils -> Options -> General. The last box 'Quand un message arrive' does not display completely and we only see the top half of the button (cf attached screencap Tbird_FR_option1.gif)

6. In Thunderbird, french version, go to Outils -> Options -> Affichage -> Formatage. The 'Polices et encodage' box does not display completely and we only see the top half of the button (cf attached screencap Tbird_FR_option2.gif)


Actual Results:  
The messages/buttons do NOT appear completely.

Expected Results:  
The messages/buttons SHOULD appear completely.

this is not a problem when using Tahoma as System wide font.
