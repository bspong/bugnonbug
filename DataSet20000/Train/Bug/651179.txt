In the process of bookmarking new pages, bogus entries are inserted into the "most recently used" list.  It's not clear whether the names of these bogus entries correspond to Windows file system folders of Firefox bookmark folders. Regardless they were not been selected in the process of saving any bookmark thus they should not be displacing existing valid entries in the already pathetically inadequately short "most recently used" list.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Happens frequently but it's not clear what triggers it.  Perhaps selecting a bookmark folder from the long list of folders also causes the bogus entry to be inserted.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Useless to spend time summarizing separately from above description.  Either you understand or you don't.

This problem immediately emerged when I updated from 3.5.3 to 3.6.12.  I thought for sure that when I updated to 3.6.16 that something as obvious as this would go away but clearly I expect too much considering the rate at which you folks create new bugs and the rate at which you fix old ones.  

It's too bad you folks are so committed to relegating Firefox to the browser scrap heap by the poor support you give to fixing bugs.  I guess it's just not glamorous enough to fix existing bugs when you can have the glory of creating new ones instead in the process of adding unnecessary bells and whistles.
