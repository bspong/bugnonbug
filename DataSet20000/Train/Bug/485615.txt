Set-Cookie header in POST response for long URI path is discarded or ignored

When the path component of the URI is very long (in my case, 1270 characters) and the POST response would set a cookie (Set-Cookie response header), the cookie is not actually saved by Firefox.

If the URI parameters are very long and the URI path is short, then there is no problem.

Hasn't been tested with shorter URI to see where the problem starts to show up.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. POST data to a page with a very long URI path that responds with a Set-Cookie header.
2. Send a GET request to the same domain / URI.
Actual Results:  
The Cookie header will not be present in this request.  If the URI path is shorter, Cookie will have been saved.

Expected Results:  
The Cookie should have been saved and sent with the GET request.

1. See attached file 'info.php' used for testing this bug.  The path where 'info.php' is stored should be very long, such that the total URI length is >= 1270 characters.  It may also happen with shorter URIs; I didn't find the limit.  With a much shorter URI (100 characters), there is no problem.

2. No installed Add-ons, using defaul theme.
