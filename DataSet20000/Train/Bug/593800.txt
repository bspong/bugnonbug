Firefox spellcheck feature has begun to underline almost all words, regardless of whether words are spelled correctly.

This happens when typing text into text fields on various web pages, including Mozilla at the time this bug report was entered.

Sometimes some paragraphs are not underlined but generally almost every word is underlined with a red zigzag.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I visit a web page or forum using Firefox 3.6.8 (even after downloading and reinstalling it fresh).
2. I enter text in text fields, for example the one used to enter these steps.
3. Almost all words as I type them are underlined and remain underlined.
Actual Results:  
The spell checker does not work in the way it is expected to. 

Expected Results:  
The spell checker should only underline words that are not spelled correctly according to the dictionaries I have installed (which are British English Dictionary 1.19, and German Dictionary extended for Austria 2.0.1 - both enabled).

The spell checker has worked in the past for both of these dictionaries. 

The same thing happened even after I downloaded and reinstalled Firefox 3.6.8.

I also made a note in a Firefox support forum in case anyone else has experienced the same thing: https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/questions/751023

Firefox's spellcheka is one fo my favorite feechures and I wish it wasa wroking (seriously though, do miss it).
