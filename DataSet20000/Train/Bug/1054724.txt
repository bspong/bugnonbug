Commandline option to open URL in private window fails in Firefox 31 on linux mint 17, resulting in URL opening in non-private window.

Steps to reproduce:

Started firefox from the commandline with the command 'firefox -private-window 2014-08-07.html'. The html file listed exists in the current directory, and is a valid html file. Tried same thing with a http URL and experienced the same result.

Tested with both a firefox non-private and private window already open, and also with only a non-private window open.


Actual results:

The page opened as a new tab in the existing non-private window. Using the switch ' -private-window' without an URL specified correctly opens a new private window with


Expected results:

The page should have opened in a new private window if no private windows were opened. I do not know whether the page should have opened in a new or an existing private window if a private window was opened prior to the command being given - to my mind either response would be sensible, although perhaps creating a new private window in either case would make more sense.
