User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:34.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/34.0
Build ID: 20141201111703

Steps to reproduce:

Write a simple web worker in coffeescript, for example, 

```coffee
throwError = -> throw new Error('hello world')
throwError()
```
Install coffeescript via npm, 

```shell
npm install coffee-script
```

Compile that code via the coffescript compiler with source maps turned on.

```shell
./node_modules/coffee-script/bin/coffee -m -c test.coffee
```

Build a simple html page to load that web worker, 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title></title>
    <script>
      var worker = new Worker('test.js');
      worker.onerror = function(e) { console.log(e); };
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>

```

And load that page in firefox. 


Actual results:

The error message is correctly logged in the console, but is shows a refrence to the javascript source, not the source map. Attached is an screen shot of the console output. 


Expected results:

Actually I am not sure what _should_ happen. Ideal Firefox would support source maps in web workers. Should maybe this is a feature request not a bug report. 

Please let me know if you need anymore information, or if this is simply not supported and Firefox does not plan on supporting this. 

Thanks.
