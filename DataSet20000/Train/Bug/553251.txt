not possible to customize the toolbar via the suggested standard procedure im 3.6
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 GTB6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Nearly same Problem:
It is not possible to customize the toolbar via the suggested standard procedure: 

1.	On the menu bar, click View, go to Toolbars, and then select Customize.... The Customize Toolbar window will appear. 
2.	Drag and drop items
3.	When you are finished making changes, click Done to close the Customize Toolbar window. 

As soon as the selection “Customize” at the toolbars is being selected, the Firefox browser menus become grayish and cannot be used (clicked on) any more. It is still possible to drag and drop items and clicking “done” to finish. However, after a restart of Firefox the changes does not appear - but browser menus can be used again.

For troubleshooting, Firefox has been restarted in Safe Mode and toolbars and controls have been reset. Yet, the problem still remains: it is not possible to customize the toolbar.

Also, it has been tried to overwrite the localstore.rdf-file by an older localstore.rdf-backup-file, but this did not work either, except of reinstating status quo.

So I wonder: how can I make changes to my toolbars?


Reproducible: Always
