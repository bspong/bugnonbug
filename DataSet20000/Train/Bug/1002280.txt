ID starting with numeric value crashes the devtools DOM inspector
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; rv:29.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/29.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140421221237

Steps to reproduce:

1./ Create a simple HTML file (test.html) with the following content:
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
<div id="1"></div>
</body>
</html>

2./ Open test.html in FF then press F12 (opens the dev tools)
3./ Expand the DOM tree and select the div with id="1"
4./ Press F5 to refresh the page


Actual results:

After selection of the element starting with a numeric value and refreshing the page, the inspector window goes blank (the DOM tree is hidden).

The browser console displays:

DOMException {code: 12, message: "An invalid or illegal string was specified", result: 2152923148, name: "SyntaxError", filename: "resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource://gre/modules/devtools/server/actors/inspector.js", lineNumber: 1398, columnNumber: 0, inner: null, data: null, location: XPCWrappedNative_NoHelper} protocol.js:817
10:48:47.058 "unknownError" protocol.js:20


Expected results:

The DOM Tree should still be there. Non-HTML 5 ids shouldn't start with a number but HTML 5 is more permissive and this id should be allowed. In any case it shouldn't crash.
