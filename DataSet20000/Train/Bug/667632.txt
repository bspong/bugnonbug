Consistency bug: link mouseover works for all browsers except for Firefox 5
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.18) Gecko/20110614 Firefox/3.6.18 GTB7.1
Build ID: 20110614230723

Steps to reproduce:

1.  Go to a site created with eSite Builder (many fulfilled by AT&T and SuperPages)
ex.1  http://blueeagleroofing.onyellowpages.com
ex.2  http://bw3pg.onyellowpages.com
2.  click on one of the navigation buttons located at top (the link shows correctly)


Actual results:

Nothing, the page does not load.


Expected results:

When clicking on the navigation button, it should load 
(as it does with previous versions of FF and other popular browsers).

Notes:  
-  This happens only in Firefox 5.
-  I've tried the page on FF3.6, FF4, IE8, IE9, Safari 5 and Chrome12, and the links work as expected.
-  While troubleshooting, I restarted in safe mode with all add-ons disabled and set my preferences back to default.  This did not correct the problem. 
-  After a lot of trial and error, it comes down to this line at the bottom of the page that's causing problems 
<a id="TGLink" style="display:none;" href="#">lnk</a>
While looking through the javascript, I found various functions using TGLink. I think something in Firefox 5 is not interpreting the javascript associated with links using TG_doLink (what's used in mouseovers) the same way as other browsers do.
