i have been able to reproduce this in two or three ways in FF3.5, 
1) merely add two images with contenteditable attribute inside the tag, both images can now be clicked then manipulated, follow the sequence of open page,click on one image and then perform a double-click outside of it.

2) with javascript add one image to the doc and set its content editable to true, it works without problems, and then add a second img in the same manner, both images are no longer editable as much as you click, add a third and all are fixed for eternity...

Reproducible: Always
