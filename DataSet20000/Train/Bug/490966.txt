Strange scrolling behaviour when loading page

I noticed a strange difference within the behaviour of scrolling (the only accurate example I have is about reader.google.com).

When I'm using MacOSX : If I scroll the list of news - let say I reached the news #42 -, if the news #32 has images non completely loaded, the size of the "page" is increasing while images are loading, but scrolling system is not following the part of the page you were before.
Consequence: I have to scroll - again - to reach my news #42.

When I'm using Windows, there is a "normal" behaviour. Even if images were not completely loaded on news #32, I can read my news #42 without scrolling again and again (ie: the scoller is always at the position it was).

Actually thisi s not a new bug, it happened since the launch of FF3.0

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://reader.google.com
2.Subscribe to at least one RSS wich has "large" images (I use  http://abduzeedo.com/)
3.Refresh your item list, and try to read a news while images are loading.
Actual Results:  
Size of page is increasing, but the "scoller" is not following the point you were.

Expected Results:  
Scrolling system should follow the point you were
