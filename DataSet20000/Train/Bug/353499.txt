Regression: Financial institution site...
When using the Return key to answer a sheet
("Please enter a password between 4 and 8 characters long. [OK]"),
the same sheet keeps returning. It never goes away.

At this point, using the mouse to click on the sheet's button
does not help.

Using the mouse to click on the sheet's button the first time,
the sheet does go away.

Impacts:
- Regression from Firefox 1.0.x and 1.5.x.x.
- Cannot log in to financial institution site.

Minefield, firefox-3.0a1.en-US.mac.dmg, 19 SEP 2006:
