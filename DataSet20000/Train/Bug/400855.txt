Occasionally, when I have multiple web pages open in tabs and I close a tab, Firefox freezes. The freeze happens to all Firefox windows and tabs. The only way to recover from it is to open up Task Manager and end all Firefox tasks. Then, I can restart Firefox without any problems until the next time it occurs. When I open the same pages immediately after fixing the freeze, the pages open just fine with no freezing. So the problem only happens occasionally and to different web pages and sites.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox and several web sites in several tabs.
2.Keep closing and opening tabs until it freezes.
3.It only happens occasionally, so to reproduce it is difficult sometimes.
Actual Results:  
I couldn't reproduce the problems but I know it will happen again, it's just a matter of time. It happens about once a day. It might happen more often when trying to close a tab that contains a web page that is still trying to load.

Expected Results:  
Everything worked normally.
