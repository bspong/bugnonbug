Implement "FrameWorker" component to handle persistent connections to social providers
See these links for details of the component already implemented as part of the Social API addon (https://github.com/mozilla/socialapi-dev/blob/develop/modules/frameworker.js):

The requirements are to be able to maintain a persistent connection to the social provider, and allow message passing to implement functionality such as notifications, chat, "share" buttons, etc.

The current approach is to create an empty JS sandbox/worker, and "import" desired APIs into it. A possibly simpler alternative we were considering was to just use an iframe, since some social provider utility libraries depend on the presence of a DOM. That might be simpler implementation-wise, but exposes a much larger API, making it almost certainly impossible to ever revert to a more restricted one.

BrowserID has a similar setup which they call a "Sandbox":

That takes the "use an iframe" approach, so we might be able to factor that code out and use it for this, if we decide to go that way.
