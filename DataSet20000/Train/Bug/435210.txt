Firefox crashes immediately after accessing www.ancestry.ca

This happens every time. I had no problems until I installed Norton Internet Security 2008. It had worked with my previous version of NIS(2007, I believe...).  The site is functional with Internet Explorer 7.  Ancestry.ca help tells me that other clients are having this difficulty, and it has something to do with Norton Confidential. The site would crash with IE 7 under certain conditions until I was able to deactivate Norton Confidential within IE 7.  I can't find a way to deactivate it within Firefox, nor within NIS 2008.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Access site, no need to sign in or navigate.
2.Wait a few seconds.
3.Message comes on that Firefox has encountered an error and needs to close.
Actual Results:  
Firefox crashed as above.

Expected Results:  
Accessed the site, with Firefox remaining open, allowing me to sign in, then continued with my browsing experience.

After Talkback or Quality Feedback Agent was activated, it fails to send the reports relevant to the crashes.
