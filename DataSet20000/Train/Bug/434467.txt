Hi!

 When viewing http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/5day.shtml?id=1418 (and other
pages in the past that I don't have the URLs for at the moment) the
degree signs are replaced by micro signs.

 A clipped screenshot of this is available here:

 The degree sign displays correctly in the View Source window:

 My font settings are like this:

 however the bug still occurs in safe-mode with PANGO disabled, so I
don't think it's purely a font settings-related issue.
