Firefox failed to open a browser window on launch, and changed process IDs 1-2 times per second
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

This problem occured after I installed the latest set of Windows XP security
updates AND upgraded to the latest version of the IEView extension through the
extensions manager.  Upon launching firefox, the browser did not open.  1-2
firefox processes appeared in my task manager.  One of the processes changed its
PID (process ID) 1-2 times per second - behavior similar to a shell fork bomb on
Linux.  The process could not be killed from the task manager, and could only be
killed by running the command taskkill /f /im firefox.exe from the command line.
 Restarting the browser did not help.  Running the browser with a clean profile
from a new account did not help.  I was able to fix the problem by uninstalling
firefox, removing the Mozilla Firefox folder from Application Data, removing the
Firefox install folder, and reinstalling Firefox.  Performing a system restore
to remove the updates to Windows had no effect.  (I created a restore point
before installation of the security patches.)  Extensions that were installed
previously included linky, ieview, and adblock.  (Also, DOM inspector, I
believe.)  I was able to reinstall all three extensions with no problem after
reinstallation.  DOM inspector does not seem to have been included in 1.04. 
Installing IEView on firefox on another machine did not cause a problem.  It is
not clear that the ieview update caused the problem, however I noticed it at
that point since I restarted the browser.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Take working firefox 1.04 configured with linky, ieview, and adblock
2.  Update to latest ieview (or possibly hit malicious website?  or...?)
2a. Possibly install latest XP security fixes.
3.  Quit firefox
4.  Open task manager.  Display PID column.
5.  Launch firefox.

Actual Results:  
Firefox takes about 9200 K in memory.  The PID for firefox changes continuously.
 Firefox must be killed with taskkill /f /im firefox.exe.  Task manager kills
fail, because hte PID does not stay constant.

d:\Desktop>tasklist

Image Name                   PID Session Name     Session#    Mem Usage
========================= ====== ================ ======== ============
<other processes deleted>
firefox.exe                 1676 Console                 0      9,316 K
d:\Desktop>taskkill /f /im firefox.exe
SUCCESS: The process "firefox.exe" with PID 1520 has been terminated.

Note the different PID between the two commands executed back to back.

Expected Results:  
Browser launches happily.
