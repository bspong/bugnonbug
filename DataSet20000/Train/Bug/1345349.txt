Bookmark keywords cannot be used or updated if a keyword points to an invalid url
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0

Steps to reproduce:

Updated to Firefox 52.0 (64-bit) (Ubuntu 12.04 edition)


Actual results:

I attempted to use a keyword-triggered quicksearch, and got a regular search for the keyword.  In other words, typing "g firefox" to search for firefox with the keyword 'g' forwarding to google, I instead was brought to the default search page, searching for the entire string "g firefox".

I went into bookmarks to investigate, and found that all of my quick-searches had no keyword any more.

Furthermore, attempting to enter a value for the keyword did not help.  Instead, every single bookmark shows the same value for the keyword field (as if the text box isn't even connected to anything).

Attempting to restore my bookmarks via the 'import and backup' dialog to a backup from today simply returns "Unable to process backup file".


Expected results:

1. Quick searches should quick-search.
2. Setting a keyword for a quick-search should actually set the keyword.
2a. Setting a keyword for one bookmark should only affect that bookmark's keyword
3. Restoring the bookmark settings should restore them.
