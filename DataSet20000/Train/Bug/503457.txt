== My request ==

One of the Safe Mode startup screen checkboxes says "Reset bookmarks to Firefox defaults".  Please change it to instead say "Erase all bookmarks except for backups".

== Why I chose the wording that I chose ==

*  The word "erase" is very important.  It makes it clear to inexperienced users that the bookmarks will be erased.  This helps stop them from accidentally losing them.

*  The words "except for backups" are to help users who have already used the checkbox and erased their bookmarks, and now want them back.  It tells them that their bookmarks are not really lost.  It points them towards the next step towards getting back their bookmarks.

*  You don't need to spend words to say the Firefox default bookmarks will be installed.  Just install them without telling users you're going to.  But if you insist, then feel free to make the dialog box wider, the string longer, and tell users you're going to install them.
