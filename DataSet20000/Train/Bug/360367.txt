Bookmark's keyword search has character encoding problems with a POST form

To ease the searching of some terms, I added a bookmark-based keyword search through the use of the right-click "Add a Keyword for this Search..." facility. I found that searches performed this way would not work for text containing accented characters.

Since the wrong search result shows a page with interrogation marks instead of some characters, I assume that there is some characters encoding problem about. Given that the search fails, it is probably related to the POST method that is used to perform the search.

Since keyword searches for POST methods are not as straightforward to edit as GET ones, I don't know of a workaround for this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the URL <http://atilf.atilf.fr/dendien/scripts/generic/form.exe?12;s=2690634540;> which should show as an ISO-8859-1 encoded page.
2. Right click on the first text box ("Vedette (se lisant comme un mot donné)") and "Add a Keyword for this Search..."
3. Search for "journée" using the keyword just created.

Actual Results:  
No word was found. The resulting page is interpreted as a UTF-8 one, and it would seem that the encoding used for the submission was also UTF-8.

Expected Results:  
The word's definition should appear, as when submitting the search directly through the web page. The page shows as an ISO-8859-1.

I wonder whether this has to do with the referring page not having any encoding information available (neither through HTTP headers nor through the HTML HEAD). Whether this is the case or not, the page properly defaults to ISO-8859-1. Since the keyword is added using that instance of the page, the proper character encoding should be embedded in the search.
