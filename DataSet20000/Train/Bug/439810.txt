Submit button stays disabled if javascript disables it before submitting and user presses the Back button on form action page

If the submit button on a form is disabled by javascript and then the form is submitted, the submit button will remain disabled if the Back button is pressed.  Many web designers will disable a submit button on a form after submitting to avoid users from clicking it too many times.

See the included website for an example.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a submit button on a page
2. Have the submit button disabled after the page has been submitted (javascript)
3. Have the form submit to another page
4. Press back button
Actual Results:  
Submit button will stay disabled, but text WILL change back to its original state.

Expected Results:  
Submit button should be enabled.

Try this in another browser to confirm.

Some may ask, "Why would you need the button enabled?"  Such a scenario would be if form action page detected missing items in the form, such as a missing name, and directed users to press the Back button and make changes.  With this bug, no changes to the form can be resubmitted.

Not too major, but is something that should be fixed to avoid loss of functionality.
