If I log into Google Calendar, and choose the monthly view, clicking on either the forward [next month] or backward [previous month button link] crashes the browser.
Also, recovering from the crash, the browser will keep crashing if you choose "Restore previous sessions" if one of the tabs to be restored was that original Google Calendar page that previously crashed. Starting a new session fixes it, though going back into Google Calendar and navigating between month starts the cycle again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start FF Beta 5
2. Log into Google Calendar
3. Choose Monthly view if it is not already set
4. Go back or forth to any month by clicking on the navigation buttons
5. Browser will not respond and then crash
Actual Results:  
FF stopped responding for about a minute and then crashed.

Expected Results:  
FF should have navigated and loaded the different months based on which navigation button was being clicked on in Google Calendar.

On Intel Pentium Dual Core, FF 3 Beta 5, Windows Vista SP1.
