Consider using ThreeDShadow instead of ThreeDDarkShadow for the border for the location bar and search box in Windows Classic
Created attachment 532545
Before and after

In bug 560755, the border for the location bar and search box was changed to ThreeDDarkShadow because the previous setting, a partially transparent black border, did not show up on a black background.

The downside of using ThreeDDarkShadow is that in most classic color schemes, it produces a completely black border, which is very jarring and inconsistent with the rest of the style of that upper region of the browser: no other border is nearly that dark, and it really stands out like a sore thumbs (especially when it is juxtaposed with the borders of the adjacent toolbar buttons).

As a compromise, I think we should use ThreeDShadow instead.  Its color more closely matches that of the original partially transparent black, and it is still visible in a black high-contrast scheme.  It doesn't stand out as much in HC, but none of the other borders do either (e.g., look at the border of tabs in black high-contrast), and most importantly, it still remains visible.

Attached is a screenshot showing the before-and-after of this proposed change:

* Normal classic: Note how incongruous the black border looks when juxtaposed with the nearby toolbar button borders and tab borders.

* High-contrast classic: The border is still visible, and although it does not stand out as much as before, none of the other borders in that region of the interface--tabs, buttons, etc.--do either.

* Themed: Just a sanity check to show that this is indeed a classic-only change.
