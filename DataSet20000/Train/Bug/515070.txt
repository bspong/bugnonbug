Sirs;

Saw many issues with Drag-N-Drop in 3.5 KB, but not this one.

In older version, could open a blank tab in "new" session, and drag a tab from the "original" session into the "new" session blank tab.

Now when you attempt that it does not transfer to the "new" session but does the equivelent of "Open in New Window".

I really hate the new version, and plan to go back to the old, until this one stabilizes.

Also since I run 20 machines I keep getting the "Install New Version" pop-ups and the "Never Install" is not working, so keep getting annoyed by this BS.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open 2 sessions,
2.  Open 3 or more tabs in session 1,
3.  Open 2 or more tabs in session 2, with first tab to URL and last tab blank,
4.  Go to one of the tabs in session 1 and attempt to drag it into the blank tab in session 2. 
Actual Results:  
You will not get the tab to drag-n-drop, but will instead get a new session window (session 3).

Expected Results:  
Tab being dragged is to appear in blank tab in session 2 as it did in previous FF versions.

To get your tab transferred you now have to go to the brower command/URL line, copy the URL and paste into the command/URL line in the new blank tab.
