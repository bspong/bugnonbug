When having a form (input text and input submit) with an onsubmit handler, trying to submit the same input without losing the focus on the input text, makes event.target be the form the first time, the input the next time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to http://oasi.upc.es/~kiusap/resourcetype/newResource.html
2.on the add functionality text box, write something (e.g. "bug"), then press enter
3.write the same thing again ("bug"), and press enter again (note you never touch the mouse nor the tab key, the input text always retain the focus)
4.If you look at the debug zone at the bottom and look for lines beginning with "addToList() started.", first time it is:
addToList() started. this = [object HTMLFormElement]. e.target = [object HTMLFormElement]
and the next time you wrote the same and pressed enter, it changes to:
 addToList() started. this = [object HTMLFormElement]. e.target = [object HTMLInputElement]

yes! e.target has mutated somehow.

5.without doing anything, try to enter one letter more and press enter again. now e.target has become again the FORMElement.
Actual Results:  
Sorry, the actual results are mixed in the steps to reproduce

Expected Results:  
e.target should not change depending on the input (therefore, should be HTML FORMElement always)
