'Restore Default Set' breaks Location Bar's drag and drop replace text and auto-submit feature
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9b2pre) Gecko/2007112605 Minefield/3.0b2pre

After going into 'Customize(Toolbar)' and clicking 'Restore Default Set', dragging and dropping URLs or text onto the Location Bar no longer replaces the existing text (also auto-submitting it in the case of a URL-link) as it does before doing this, rather it now just adds it to the existing Location Bar text, inserting it whereever the I-beam is when the mouse-click is released.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Confirm drag and drop of a URL-link or text from a webpage into the Location Bar works correctly (ie: replaces the current text, submits it in the case of a link)
2. If it works as expected, now right-click a toolbar and choose 'Customize'.
3. Click the 'Restore Default Set' button
4. Retest step#1



I discovered this while testing the latest Minefield(trunk) build and initially thought this was a recent regression on the Trunk only. However, I just tested it in Firefox 2.0.0.9 (20071025) and it is present there too so it may well have always been broken. I will test some old release builds and see if there was a regression window.
