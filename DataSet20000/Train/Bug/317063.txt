Everytime I am on Mozilla Firefox, whether actively using it or if Mozilla Firefox is running and I am doing something else, ie., playing a game, checking mail, playing music, my computer quits responding - hangs up, locks up.  If I am playing music, my music sounds like a stuck record.  I cannot move the mouse, ctl-alt-delete, or anything for a few seconds.  This happens everytime I am on Mozilla Firefox and all the time I have Mozilla Firefox running.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Mozilla Firefox
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
My computer locks up.  I can do nothing either in Mozilla Firefox or any other application I am using.  This situation does not happen when Microsoft Internet Explorer is being used.  It does not happen when I am logged onto AOL.  Only when  Mozilla Firefox has been started.


Never cease responding unless there  is a problem.  The best I can tell, it happens about every 5 minutes.  I have timed it several times.  I don't know if it happens after 20 minutes and more though.
