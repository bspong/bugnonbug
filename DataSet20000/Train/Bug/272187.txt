print to pdf (have adobe 5.05 pro installed) causes disk-full, then file deletes

Tried printing a page to a pdf format.  Works in IE though width is chopped.  
I decided to let the process run and see if it ever finished -- it did by 
filling my home dir partition, then FF seemed to catch the error and delete 
the file though acrobat was launched anyway and came up with error "file not 
found".   I tried it again printing the pdf to a known dirname and just 
watched it grow and grow....the URL saved in zip format takes 60kb.  Hmph.
Earlier I told FF to print the background for this file when it did print out 
successfully to an HP-paper printer -- I just wanted to save a copy of 
the "statement" on disk.  A copy of the saved webpage with personal details 
removed duplicates the problem and is appended and saved via uuencode in 
base64.

---oops---  Apparently I cannot attach the uuencoded file as I'm only allowed
64K of details and uuencoded, it is ~84k.

Is there some way to attach the file as a test case?  I don't see an attach
file option.  I'll try attaching it under additional information.  If that 
works, it will be there, if not...?

Well that doesn't work either....how does one attach a test case?  It's not 
like I can point you to an https site where the page was generated...:-(



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. display above encoded web page
2. try to print to pdf (may be related to specific Acrobat version, I have 
v5.05) 
3.

Actual Results:  
file length of pdf increases until diskspace is exhausted

Expected Results:  
print normal size pdf?

major severity due to it essentially appearing to hang (if you had a 
sufficiently large hard disk) or temporarily filling entire disk, then
not producing the pdf file.
