when I install Firefox 2.0.0.18 my gmail won't load properly

Firefox has just released version 2.0.0.18 which was downloaded to my computer automatically. When I install it, then my regular gmail, which has always worked with previous versions of Firefox, won't load. If I press the button on gmail for loading for slow connections, it will load and that doesn't give me my regular gmail with all functions intact. In order to get my regular gmail to work properly, I have to use system restore to move my computer to a previous date, previous to my installing Firefox 2.0.0.18.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox version 2.0.0.18
2. Regular gmail will not load properly
3. Use system restore to move my computer back to date previous to install
4. Then my gmail loads properly again
Actual Results:  
As described above

Expected Results:  
After I install Firefox 2.0.0.18, my gmail should load properly in the normal way.
