Scrolling and Some Rendering Unresponsive After Mac Wakeup
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0
Build ID: 20120129021758

Steps to reproduce:

1) Macbook Pro 8,2 running OS X 10.6.8 in clamshell mode, external monitor running at 1680x1050.

2) Firefox can run on any page and problem will occur.  Problem reproduces in safe mode.

3) Force Mac to sleep with Firefox active.

4) Wake Mac up (I just scribble on a USB wireless mouse to force wakeup).


Actual results:

Following wakeup, the following behavior persists for greater than one minute:

1) Page rendering area won't scroll using scroll wheel on mouse, arrow keys, or on-screen line-by-line scrolling controls.  However, dragging the elevator does successfully scroll the page.

2) Clicking through links on the page or selecting a bookmark does cause a new page to be successfully rendered.  However, the new page has the same scrolling problems.

3) Moving to the gmail page won't render in full mode but **will** render in HTML mode.

4) Typing in text boxes works OK, arrow keys work to scroll OK, elevator in a scrolling text box is OK, but line-by-line scroll control or mouse scroll wheel doesn't work.

5) Problem goes away after a few minutes with no ill effects.

6) Problem was first noticed in the 9 branch.  10 branch didn't fix it.  Problem appears to be 100% reproducible.
