Preferences/Applications dialog is non-functional.  Shows message in error console at start.

Superficial symptoms, while I can bring up the Apps dialog, no filetype/helper apps are shown, and I can't create any entries.  After doing so, the following appears in the error console:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80570016 (NS_ERROR_XPC_GS_RETURNED_FAILURE) [nsIJSCID.getService]"  nsresult: "0x80570016 (NS_ERROR_XPC_GS_RETURNED_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/preferences/applications.js :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 478"  data: no]

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox 3
2. Brink up the Preferences window
3. Click on "Applications."
Actual Results:  
Dialog is completely non-functional.

Expected Results:  
Being able to edit filetype helper app associations.

It looks like the JS code to run the applications dialog is either incorrect or makes assuptions that are wrong for my system, a heavily customized Slackware 12.1.  In any case, if I'm at fault, this error message does not lead me towards anything I can fix.
