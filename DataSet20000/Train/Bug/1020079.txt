Windows Store opens automatically when visiting website
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64; rv:32.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/32.0 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:

I performed a google query:

https://www.google.com.au/search?q=windows+8+home+automation&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial&client=firefox-nightly&channel=sb&gfe_rd=cr&ei=TpOOU7SnFMTC8gfi44D4BQ

I clicked on the "ISY Home Automation app for Windows in the Windows St" link (http://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CDMQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapps.microsoft.com%2Fwindows%2Fen-us%2Fapp%2Fisy-home-automation%2F3eed4150-45ab-4103-b29c-0d95910f10fc&ei=TpOOU7DaLofUkQWQ7YC4AQ&usg=AFQjCNG7k0z-a_5syujD2theLdsy9xYWNg&bvm=bv.68235269,d.dGI&cad=rja) search result



Actual results:

When I clicked on that search result, the Windows Store application automatically opened.


Expected results:

I understand if this happened in Internet Explorer. But I am surprised that Windows Store is opened automatically when visited in Firefox, with no way for me to control this. I think I should have been taken to the actual Website (which opens anyway in the background, apparent when you close the Windows Store app that takes over the screen).
