When invoked from Lotus Notes, firefox doesn´t handle links with leading special characters consistently. Sometimes, the message appears: "server not found" - it´s OK. But firefox opens it´s installation directory, when invoked with Link "#<any string>"

6. Type: URL
7. Value: PASTE <special character><any string> here
8. save memo as draft
