After last Automatic Update Firefox3.08 crashes on startip

Build Identifier: mozilla 3.08

 AFTER LAST AUTOMATIC UPDATE, MOZILLA 3.08 WON'T OPEN OR START AT ALL. THE ONLY WINDOW THAT OPENS UP SAYS MOZILLA HAS CRASHED. CLICK HERE TO SEND CRASH REPORT. AFTER I SEND THE REPORT IT STOPS. I HAVE REMOVED MOZILLA AND REINSTALLED IT AND THE PROBLEM STILL REMAINS. MY OPERATING SYSTEM IS: WINDOWS VISTA HOME PREMIUM AMD ATHLON 64 X 2. IT WAS WORKING UNTIL 4 DAYS AGO WHEN THE LAST AUTOMATIC UPDATE RAN. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO OPEN MOZILLA. IT CRASHES IMMEDIATELY. IT'S A SHAME BECAUSE MOZILLA IS MORE USER FRIENDLY THAN INTERNET EXPLORER. I HOPE YOU GET IT FIXED SOON.

GOD BLESS YOU AND THANKS!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.OPEN MOZILLA BROWSER.
2. IMMEDIATELY CRASHES AND REQUESTS A CRASH REPORT BE SENT BY CLICKING SEND.
3.I CLICK ON SEND AND I GET THE MESSAGE MOZILLA CRASHED AGAIN. IT STILL WILL NOT OPEN. THIS HAS HAPPENED OVER 50 TIMES IN THE LAST 4 DAYS. UNINSTALLING AND REINSTALLING AFTER A COMPUTER RESTART RESULTS IN THE THE RESPONSES OF AN IMMEDIATE CRASH WHEN OPENING.
Actual Results:  
BROWSER WON'T OPEN EXCEPT TO SEND A CRASH REPORT.

Expected Results:  
UNINSTALLING AND REINSTALLING AFTER COMPUTER REBOOT RESULTS IN SAME RESPONSE. WON'T OPEN AND SEND A CRASH REPORT. I HAVE SENT NUMEROUS CRASH REPORTS VIA THE SEND BUTTON IN THE CRASH WINDOW.

MOZILLA USED TO OPEN AND RUN BEAUTIFULLY. IF IT DOESN'T GET REPAIRED SOON, I WILL FORGET ABOUT MOZILLA.
