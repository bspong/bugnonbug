Firefox non-responsive after being open over time on site with flash

If I keep firefox open over days, I, starting after I patched to 3.0.6, see firefox become unresponsive. The title bar says, Not Responding. After about a minute, firefox window minimizes and a debug window opens related to flash. The debug window states:
Error: Error #1502: A script has executed for longer than the default timeout period of 15 seconds.

I have to close the tab, open new tab then log in again.
