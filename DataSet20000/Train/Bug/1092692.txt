Firefox show error messages "Firefox(plugin name) has stopped working" when shutdown Firefox Under Win8.1 Update, adopted Windows Update 2014-10
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; Trident/7.0; Touch; .NET4.0E; .NET4.0C; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Tablet PC 2.0; MASPJS; rv:11.0) like Gecko

Steps to reproduce:

Install 2014-10 Windows Update 


Actual results:

After Install Windows Update, firefox show clash error messages "Firefox was clashed" or "Flash Player -(Plugin name is shown here) was clashed".
(literally, My Japanese Windows 8.1 Update PC shown "(app name) was stopped" )

To verify this issue, I recovery PC and re-installed, got following data.
>Use Win8 or Vista, Older Windows, Will not shown messages and move collectly
>Win8.1(Not updated) will move as the same as above
>Win8.1 Updated (Not adopted 2014-10 Windows Update)will move collectly,
but after adopt 2014-10 Update, Firefox will clash and show error messages.

I also installed Older version Firefox(ex:Firefox31, 32 etc.),but it also shown error messages and clashed.


Expected results:

Firefox will not shown clash errors and exit gracefully
Optimized for not only supported OS and PC, but also Windows 8.1 Update and upcoming new OS like other browsers
