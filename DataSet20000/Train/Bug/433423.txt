MDL Chime plug-in invocation breaks after accessing specific URL

After selecting a link to download the text of a PDB (.pdb) file from the PDB website and saving the file to disk (without choosing to make this the default behavior), Firefox changes its behavior for handling locally-opened PDB files such that it now gives the "how would you like to handle this kind of file" dialog rather than invoking the MDL Chime plug-in as it used to.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Step 1: install the popular MDL Chime plug-in that the biochemistry community uses like all the time...

After attempting to download a PDB file from the PDB website (http://pdb.org/), the MDL Chime plug-in which was previously associated with viewing .pdb files is
 no longer invoked to display local .pdb files.  An example of such a download URL:

http://www.pdb.org/pdb/download/downloadFile.do?fileFormat=pdb&compression=NO&structureId=1A0Z

On selecting this URL as a link the user is prompted to (defaulted option) "open with Internet Explorer (default)", or (not selected) "save to disk".  After saving to disk, further Firefox handling of this kind of file changes, even though the "automatically perform" checkbox was not selected.  (The file was successfully saved to disk, if it matters.)

Accessing a .pdb _URL_ still results in invocation of the plug-in and successful display.  Good.

Accessing a local file is now different, however.  Either invoking Firefox and the MDL Chime plug-in via Windows Explorer association or opening the file via the Firefox File->Open File option results in a dialog asking how to handle the file.  This dialog now has "open with Internet Explorer (default)" not selected, and "save to disk" as the default.  But disk is where I got the file, and opening with IE, I think, really means use Windows's file association, which for .pdb files is Firefox, so that up pops another Firefox tab and yet another one of these dialogs.  Thus broken.
Actual Results:  
File handling for PDB (.pdb) files changed.

Expected Results:  
Not change handling.

E3Joking aside, I imagine there's a substantial userbase out there with MDL Chime and I'd love for them all to be able to use Firefox.  I'm surprised I couldn'
t find a report for this bug.  It's been around for If it's too much hassle to download the plug-in for testing (which I'm not sure is necessary to fix this bug
), email me please.

Here's what the server was sending for the download link:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

And here are my Windows associations for this file and type, if it's relevant at all:

C:\>assoc .pdb
.pdb=pdbFile

C:\>ftype pdbFile
pdbFile="C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\Iexplore.exe" %1

I don't know why it says Iexplore.exe here, as executing a .pdb from command shell or Explorer still invokes Firefox.
