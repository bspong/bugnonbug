When typing in one tab and loading or refreshing another tab, the typing bar continuously disapears, requiring me to click on the area I want to type in again.

This has existed in Firefox 1.0PR-1.0.7, but I just learned about the Bug
submittal site, so I'm only just now submitting it (I apologize for not doing so
prior).  I already tried this in Safe Mode and it does the same thing. 
Basically, when typing in an online form, chat window, etc. within the Firefox
browser, and loading another tab typing continuously stops and I have to click
on the field I want to type in again.  This is very annoying.  The worst site
for this appears to be the Yahoo Groups Chat windows, but that may be bacause I
spend more time there.  It has happened to me on online ordering forms, E-Mail
(Hotmail, GMail, Yahoo), on Ebay, and on various other sites.  If anyone has any
additional questions, feel free to ask.

Thanks,

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log onto Yahoo Goups (As an example).
2.Click on the Group Chat Window.
3.Now reload another tab and try to type in the chat window...  It will
continuously stop allowing you to type so you have to reclick on the chat window.

Actual Results:  
I don't know where the typing cursor goes, but it leaves the tab I'm working on
and (I'm guesing) goes to the tab that is reloading, though what I've typed does
not show up on the tab that is reloading.

Expected Results:  
Allow me to continue typing in the tab that I am using.
