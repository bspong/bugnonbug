I'm not very good at this so please forgive my naivety.

In previous releases of Firefox this setting was remembered every time I visited the site, but now every time I do a search I have to change the option.

To see what I am talking about you can sign up for a free account at ancestry.com- unless you are a paying subscriber.

You can search for an individual.  You'll get some results in different categories.  Census Records, Birth Death and Marriage Records, Family Histories.. etc.  Once you click on say in this example Census Records.  You have the option of displaying 10 results, 20 results or 50.  Now every page and every result I have to update the option to 50 results- when before Firefox remembered that I wanted 50 and I only had to do it once.  So now every time I get a search result I have to change it from the default ten results to 50 resulting in the page having to completely reload.  This is costing me a lot of time.  I hope I have explained this well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Search
2. Search
3. Search
Actual Results:  
Always results in the default 10 results making me have to select 50 every time I search and having to wait for the page to result with the updated 50 results rather than the default ten.

Expected Results:  
Same thing over and over and over.

It should have remembered 50 every time I visited the site.... at least that's what previous versions of Firefox have done.

I'm going to check normal below because no data is lost- but it does waste a lot of time and it is driving me crazy.  So while you would say it's a minor bug- it's enough of a bug for me to look for another browser that can remember my settings when I visit the site.
