on Pogo.com games wont load, had error saying the browser is out of Memory. They explained how to clear cache on Fox then disable add-ons ( disabled about of 90% of the add-ons I have on here ) then they gave some instructions on how to change the Java and change the memory  on Windows computers which i cant do because iMac doesnt have these settings. Also wanted to let you know that I have iMac 10.6.4 and I am using Java SE 6 - 32 and 64 bit. Since contacting Pogo I no longer get this warning, what happens now is when i click on a game and it takes you to a listing of game rooms and then you choose a room and a new window opens and the game never starts.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. choose game to play
2. window will open with the name of game rooms
3. click on a room & window will open and game will never start
Actual Results:  
window opens and says the name of the game you are playing but game never starts

Expected Results:  
it should say the name of the game and then on the right hand side of the window it tells you who the players are in the room and also has a chat box below that.  On the rest of the box it will show the game and then you start playing it.

when window opens after you enter game room it says,  the name of the game ex. Boggle Bash and on that window on the right side a box appears that tells you what players are in that room and there is a chat box underneath this and on the left side  of this the game comes on and you start playing it by clicking on the letters in the box to make words
