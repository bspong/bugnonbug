Gmail keyboard commands don't work after switching tabs without reclicking the page
Pages like gmail that use key(press?) event listeners don't work if you switch tabs away after clicking links.

See testcase (url)

1. Click the page
2. Hit stuff on the keyboard
3. Ctrl/cmd click this link
4. Ctrl/cmd-2 to switch to next tab
5. Ctrl/cmd-1 to return to this tab
6. Hit stuff on the keyboard

Note: after step 3, hitting the keyboard still does things correctly
Only after switching tabs and returning does things not work.

This is one of the top complaints I've heard about Firefox 3 where you have to click somewhere on the page before keyboard shortcuts work again.

I don't think this is a regression, but it's pretty annoying for advanced gmail users. Any idea if websites can work around this issue? blocking-firefox3? but it's probably too late unless there's an easy fix.
