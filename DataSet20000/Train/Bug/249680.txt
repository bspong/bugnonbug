Location bar text not visible with yellow background for secure sites

The recently-added yellow background for the location bar when a secure site is
accessed does not take into account the system's theme colours. WindowBlinds
themes Blackcomb Dark and Furcadia (in development) do not use black, or even
dark button or window text. The yellow background assumes this and thus causes
the URL to become unreadable.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a theme that includes light-coloured text
2. Load a site in Firefox that is secure
3. . . . there's no step 3

Actual Results:  
The background was applied without regard to the system (and previous)
background colours, and without considering the fact that text may not be dark.
This resulted in unreadable URL text.

Expected Results:  
This should be handled in a way that works with all themes. In general, if you
are going to force a non-themed background colour, you should force a non-themed
foreground as well. Perhaps it could change the foreground text to be black, or
use the selected foreground and background colours when on a secure site and
switch back to non-selected colours when selecting text.

Using latest BlueFyre build from burning edge forums, latest versions of
WindowBlinds available, with skins Blackcomb Dark and Furcadia (latter is in
development and currently uses yellow text)
