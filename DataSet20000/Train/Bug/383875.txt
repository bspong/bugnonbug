This is after bug 383742 eating the storage for the tinderbox VM, and rhelmer disabling BreadkPad for bug 383861. The build does pass MozillaAliveTest on fx-win32-tbox.

When I try to run the 2007060904 build on Win XP then the crash reporter comes up but fails to submit a report. If I disable BreakPad using MOZ_CRASHREPORTER_DISABLE=1 then the Windows crash reporter appears but not Talkback. However, there are several reports from nightly testers that the build is fine on Vista, and single reports it's ok on XP & 2000.

I tried the previous build,

and that starts up fine. Which gives a regression window of

We (wildly??) speculating on IRC that this might be similar to bug 331404.
