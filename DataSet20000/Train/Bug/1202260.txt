screenshot - Last event listener entry in event listeners tooltip have unnecessary border-bottom.png

STR:   (Win7_64, Nightly 43, 32bit, ID 20150901030226, new profile, safe mode)
1. Open this "data:" url or click URL in the field above
data:text/html,<body onload="var str=''; for (i=1;i<999;i++)str+='L'; for (i of ['oncut','onpaste','oncopy'] ) document.body.setAttribute(i,str); ">
2. Open devtools->Options, select Light devtools theme
2. Open devtools->Inspector, click (ev) button near <body> element

Result:       In tooltip with event listeners you can see bottom border after each event listener button, even after the last one
Expectations: There should be no border after the last tooltip

Note: I actually use Dark devtools theme, and that border in dark devtools theme makes it look like there's additional indent, which looks like a misaligned button.

Suggestion:   Currently, CSS declares the bottom border of 1px width for every event listeners button. I suggest to change CSS so that there was a border ABOVE every button (border-top), except the 1st one - using ":not(:first-child)" selector.
> ":not(:last-child)" can't be used here for "border-bottom", because all odd elements in that tooltip are buttons, and even elements are code areas, so the last element is code area)
BUT I can see that the border may have been added to separate code area from the button. Therefore, I suggest to make additional border-top with the same color for code area, if it's visible.
