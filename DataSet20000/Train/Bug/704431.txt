Firefox and plugins freeze for some time when other plugin fails to load due to unresolved domain of resource
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:7.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0.1
Build ID: 20110928134238

Steps to reproduce:

note: this may seem related to bug #253117 but that seems to be strictly about load time of plugins. In my case, the plugin loads almost instantly.

When clicking on a link to a PDF file to open it on a new tab, the Foxit pdf plugin starts loading but due to dns not resolving for the server hosting the pdf file, Firefox and everything in tabs freezes for about 10-15s, after the tab shows "plugin crashed" message.


Actual results:

 So, I click on the link with the scroll wheel which means open in new tab. New tab loads, in the status bar, the messages "Connecting to domain.com" and "Looking up domain.com" appear and soon after (2-3 seconds) Firefox freezes and all the other plugins seem to stop responding. Video playing on Youtube in another tab is either paused or muted, all I know now is there's no sound.

This is i believe caused by the DNS server of the website containing the PDF not responding or some other DNS related issue.
After about 10-15 seconds Firefox unfreezes, video resumes playing, the tab says the plugin crashed and shows offer to send crash report.


Expected results:

The very least it shouldn't freeze other tabs. I can understand plugins not replying in timely manner due to various reasons but this shouldn't freeze all tabs, especially since now plugins are supposed to be external or something like that.
