When saving a file from a page that has been visited before, and files saved
before via opening with [WinMimeTypeAction-type-function] the requester stays up
and Firefox seems to be busywaiting.  (Threadwonking app info not avail, mea culpa.)

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a VM for Firefox, use crufty ol' 1.0.2 icon by mistake.
2. Find Anime Wallpaper site, marvel and start savin' by jpeg handler deferred
to Windows' OS frobbables.
3. Change patterns by picking SAVE in requester, select non- /tmp directory,
save, click back at least once, save something new, watch the Athlon thermometer
go up.  mmmm.


Actual Results:  
Laggy filesaving happens.  Is this a UI feature?

Expected Results:  
Laggy filesaving or less-laggy filesaving should still happen rather than a
lockup/contention that Windows Task Manager can attribute to FireFox! :)

replacement silent happy Seagates.  (Send a box of either, etc. etc.)
