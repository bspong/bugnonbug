Changing document.domain doesn't affect XMLHttpRequest
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; nl; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1

My script are running from two subdomains, lets say:

dynamic.domain.tld
static.domain.tld

Now I'd like to use XMLHttpRequest to exchange some data. Because they're both on the domain.tld-server,  they should be able to interact to eachother because of the document.domain I added to every script. This according to the Mozilla documentation:

'JavaScript Security: Same Origin'
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/components/same-origin.html

This is not working properly as described at the URL

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set the document.domain var
2. Place scripts on differents subdomains
3. Let them query
Actual Results:  
Access Denied Error:

Fout: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Access to restricted URI denied"  code: "1012" nsresult: "0x805303f4 (NS_ERROR_DOM_BAD_URI)"  location: "http://static.domain.tld/js/class.xmlmessage.js Line: 49"]

Expected Results:  
Just loading the request file.

Example file
http:// service . sove . nl / index
will change after getting a resolution for the bug (so it's not static).
