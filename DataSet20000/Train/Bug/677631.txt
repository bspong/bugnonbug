Firefox "hangs" with a white window when restoring a minimized window after sleeping
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build ID: 20110517192056

Steps to reproduce:

1) Open Firefox, maximized, and have some tabs open.  (The number doesn't seem to matter; in my current instance, I have 4 open.  It also seems independent of safe mode.)
2) Minimize Firefox.
3) Put the laptop to sleep
4) Wake up the laptop, and restore the Firefox window


Actual results:

Firefox displays a completely white screen -- neither the Firefox title/tabbar with the Firefox menu and min/max/close buttons, nor the Win7 default titlebar -- for several seconds.  It seemed stuck that way, and when I wiggled my mouse I think I moved it over a link (I couldn't tell, because it was all white...).  the mouse cursor changed shape, and a moment or two later, the Firefox UI and the web content came back.


Expected results:

Firefox shouldn't hang or white-out the screen.

I think this definitely has to do with how Windows handles minimized windows differently than non-minimized ones -- the live preview, for instance, doesn't stay live for minimized windows.  It's possible that because Firefox has some custom painting logic for the titlebar, Windows doesn't cache the previous contents of the window, especially after a sleep/wakeup.
