Performance impacts linked to FF version.docx

Steps to reproduce:

Hello,

We are a software vendor developping a web application (seerver side is Java, but an importnat part is clietn side iin Javascript). We used to recommend for hisrotical reason the use of Firefox. 
As we are delivering the application in SaaS mode, we exactly know all the sides of the infrastructure. We know that neither our applciation nor the infrastructrue side has been updated recently (last minor was on 27th oct). We also use NewRelic (http://www.newrelic.com) to monitor our Saas service. 



Actual results:

We have seen an overall performance issue on the client side (DOM) has "exploded" since the end of last week. See attached file Graph "Performance impacts linked to FF version" (lower scetion).
This is confirmed by a measure also taken out of NewRelic regarding backend (hosting service +network) and duration (client side complete time (adding DOM and rendering to the previous). See attached file table "Zoom on FF version performances (6h) ".
This is clearly linked to transition form FF32 to FF33.



Expected results:

Same performances at least, better performances hopefully.

With response time above 4 seconds in average (versus less than 2 previously), the situation is becoming difficult for our clients. Should we consider it a FF bug, fall back to a previous version or chnage our client base to another browser ?
