Dialog for POSTDATA resubmission confirmation is ambiguous when Session Store restores many tabs

The "Confirm" dialog that appears, when POSTDATA is to be resent, is no longer adequate for current and future incarnation of Firefox (esp. since the introduction of session resuming).

The dialog should be enhanced to indicate what site (name and URL) the dialog applies to.

Ever since the ability to reload a prior session, whether after a crash or as per routine preference, there are many instances whereby several tabs being restored trigger the POSTDATA confirmation.  While this is happening, it is difficult to know what website is at issue and, therefore, what type of data is potentially going to be resubmitted.  It is ambiguous.  Say I get three POSTDATA dialog boxes, which is going where?  This is particularly difficult -- even with just one dialog -- when restoring a session having many tabs.

All the current dialog states is: "The page you are trying to view contains POSTDATA that has expired from cache.  If you resend the data, any action the form carried out (such as a search or online purchase) will be repeated.  To resend the data, click OK.  Otherwise, click Cancel."  <-- This is ambiguous.

An enhancement that includes both the title and URL of the web page, at a minimum, would be most welcome.  If the web URL is very long, ellipses could be used in the manner, "https:\\www.anecommercesite.tld\...\confirmpurchase.asp"

Thanks
