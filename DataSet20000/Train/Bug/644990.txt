lost open tabs after update to ff4
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0
Build Identifier: update from latest FF 3.6 to FF 4

problem when updating from 3.6.xx to FF4.
Users that are used to end their firefox 3.6 and choosing "save & exit" everytime will see only one tab with their startpage after updating to ff4 and starting it for the first time. 
If they don't know 'Show my windows and tabs from last time' under Tools -> Options -> General -> Start-up they lose their open tabs from 3.6 once they restarted ff4.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open several tabs in latest 3.6. version Win XP not having 'save tabs and exit' as standard and configure a startpage other than default
2. use 'help' -> 'get latest version' to get ff4
3. let ff4 install and restart
4. after restart you will see only one open tab with your configured startpage
Actual Results:  
If you know 'Show my windows and tabs from last time' under Tools -> Options -> General -> Start-up you can recover your last tab-session. If you don't and you restart you ff4 for some reason you lost your tab-session 

Expected Results:  
you should show the open tabs from 3.6 in 4 if you start for the first time. Or you should use 'Show my windows and tabs from last time' as default
