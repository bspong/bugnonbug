Firefox/OSX Doesnt correctly handle 'display: table-column' possibly more from the 'display: table-*' family

I found while doing some studies around the CSS 'display: table' and related display options and found that only on the OS X Firefox does the problem occur.

What I've found is when using DIV's and assigining the main DIV 'display: table' and its two(or more) nested DIV's 'display: table-column'. When viewing these div tags in Safari, the div's act like table columns. Firefox on the other hand, doesnt display the nested div's beside eachother like they should, but rather one above the other.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a div that uses 'display: table'
2.Add two or more nested div tags within the first div tag with 'display: table-column'
3.Make all 3 div tags show a border for better clarification
Actual Results:  
The two nested div tags display on top of each other.

Expected Results:  
The two nested div tags SHOULD display beside each other.
