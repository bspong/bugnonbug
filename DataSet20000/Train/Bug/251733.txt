If I log in to the content management system 'Reddot' using an administrator account, i get logged in as an author.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.9

Doing the same thing in IE (same account) it works fine and i can access the
restricted modules.
I tried it on different machines (XP, Win2000, Win2000 Server) but it never
worked. I thought that couldn't be a browser mistake because the login is on the
server side but as soon as realized that IE doesn't have this problems, i'm
quite sure that it _is_ a browser bug.

I'm sorry for not being able to give you a testing url because I'm talking about
my companies software.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Calling Reddot Login Page
2. Entering administrator's login datas
3. Hitting submit button

Actual Results:  
I'm getting redirected to the main menu but as soon as i select a project,
I'm getting redirected to the "Smart Edit" mode with no access to "Smart Tree"
mode (only admins have access to the Tree mode) (Account information says: "Your
are logged in with username: admin [administrator account].
Your current rights: author)

Expected Results:  
Should let me choose between Tree or Edit mode after selecting a project and
give me a link to access tree mode and display the correct rights of the admin
account.

I tried it with some extensions (one machine) and without any extensions (clean,
first-time installation) on another machine using different OS (see above)
