Crash in firefox@0x1c69c
This bug was filed from the Socorro interface and is 
report bp-89e5f6a5-3af9-4d81-be4f-3c8001170713.
=============================================================

Hello,
For some days, firefox crashes on some particular webpages : it has begun with the 53 release, and now with the 54.
I am under the up-to-date rolling release archlinux.

Firefox crashes always on the same pages.
Sometimes that could be pages with too much ads, and I don't care too much about the crash.

But now, I cannot acces to my Yahoo-email login page :
There is no problem to access to the first step to write my email address, and then the next page is about password : I cannot write my password because the tab is not responding and crashes.

This beahavior is critical because access of emails are necessary (for now, i use another browser than FF)

I tried to come back to the 53 version, including :
libevent-2.0.22-4 + firefox-53.0.2-1 + firefox-i18n-fr-53.0.2-1 packages 

That was the same message :

I also tried to go back to 52 version, but at that time I faced problems with some libraries, and I should be back to 54.


If you want to do some tests, do not hesitate,
Thank you for your help.
