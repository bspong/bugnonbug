Create a "New window in separate process" menu option in Nightly
This idea started when we were talking about how to turn electrolysis on in nightly. Doing it in the near future would really anger a lot of people because basic stuff like printing still doesn't work. However, we do want to make it available to more people. A good middle ground would be to add a new menu option "New window in separate process" (name could be improved). It would be sort of like private browsing mode.

Currently electrolysis is enabled/disabled on startup based on the browser.tabs.remote pref. Perhaps we could make that a tristate value, with the third value meaning "only in windows where specifically requested". That would be the default in Nightly, whereas in other releases it would be completely disabled. To make the new option work, we would need (1) some UI work to add the menu item and track its value, (2) to refactor all the code that currently checks the pref.

It's pretty easy to search for all the code that checks the pref.

The only troublesome stuff that I see is in graphics, and Vlad is optimistic that we'll have OMTC enabled everywhere pretty soon. Besides that, OMTC is a per-window option, so we still have options if that work isn't finished in time.
