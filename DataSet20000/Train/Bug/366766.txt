JS variable not resetted going back on this page (ie7 has different behaviour)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; InfoPath.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: 

At javascript , when i put in Var sVar = false;
this should be everytime post back the page & initial set the value to false.
This is working fine everytime i post back to Web, However, if i click on "Back" button from Navigation toolbox, & click post again, it not reset the sVar = false (keep my variable before click on "Back"!)
This is not reproduce In IE 7 & Netscape 8.1. please make it standard as other browser!



1. When i run my code below with FireFox, & click the "Click Me" button 
, the sVar Return "False". 
2. If i click again, it still return "False" for sVar.(which is 
correct, because value has been reset back to "False"). 
3. However, if i click on "Back" button on Navigation Toolbox there & 
click the "Click Me" button, sVar return "True", which is not right! ( 
it should initial the sVar = "False") 

For others browser like IE 7 , Netscape 8.1, it will reinitial 
sVar="false" on step 3 if i follow the steps above. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
