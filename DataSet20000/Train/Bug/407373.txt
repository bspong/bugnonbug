if ExpireItems() fails, don't fire the timer again.
if ExpireItems() fails, don't keep going

after running over night, in my console, I was seeing:

WARNING: NS_ENSURE_SUCCESS(rv, rv) failed with result 0x8000FFFF: file c:/builds
/trunk/mozilla/toolkit/components/places/src/nsNavHistoryExpire.cpp, line 483
WARNING: NS_ENSURE_SUCCESS(rv, rv) failed with result 0x8000FFFF: file c:/builds
/trunk/mozilla/toolkit/components/places/src/nsNavHistoryExpire.cpp, line 335
WARNING: ExpireItems failed.: file c:/builds/trunk/mozilla/toolkit/components/pl
aces/src/nsNavHistoryExpire.cpp, line 292

even when no longer idle, every 3.5 seconds, I'd get those messages.

Dietrich's fix for bug #407018 should fix the error, as the problem is caused by using selectStatement instead of selectMinStatement.

But I think we should consider either changing the logic in ExpireItems (which sets keepGoing), or fix DoPartialExpiration.

Dietrich, what do you think about this:

nsresult
nsNavHistoryExpire::DoPartialExpiration()
{
  // expire history items
  PRBool keepGoing;
  nsresult rv = ExpireItems(EXPIRATION_COUNT_PER_RUN, &keepGoing);
  if (NS_FAILED(rv))
    NS_WARNING("ExpireItems failed.");
  else if (keepGoing)
    StartTimer(SUBSEQUENT_EXPIRATION_TIMEOUT);
  return NS_OK;
}
