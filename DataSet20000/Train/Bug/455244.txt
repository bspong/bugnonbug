With Firefox set as the default browser Expression Web states it isn't the default html editor
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When opening the MSFT Program "Expression Web" it continuously told me it was not the default HTML Editor.
After checking numerous registry settings, one user at that forum discovered it was an issue with Firefox's "check if default" browser mechanism, which he said set an improper value in the registry.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have Expression Web, Firefox 3, IE7 and Vista installed (Adobe Contribute is also installed, but assumed unrelated as it is not opened after EW)
2. During FF 3 install, have it set itself as the default browser.
3. Open EW
Actual Results:  
Expression Web continuously asks to be set as the default HTML editor, even after setting it so several times. 

Expected Results:  
It should be the default HTML editor.
