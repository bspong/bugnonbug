I am running a Dell Dimensions E310 system (6 years old) and have d/l'd and ran, as well as tried to run from the website, and each time I get a DOS window loaded for 3-5 seconds, and then nothing.  The software doesn't load and no messages sent.  The website has NO technical support for "so new we're not yet customers" group.  I have been told by lots of people how your browser software is so much better than the windows product in preventing bugs and that is why I am looking to your product.  PLEASE HELP ASAP as this system is frustrating the HE|| out of me.  Thanks, Kent

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I click on D/L and have choosen both RUN and SAVE then ran.
2. Wait for something to happen.  DOS window appears, but I do nothing.
3. Get frustrated that it isn't loading.
Actual Results:  
I did that in steps to reproduce.....ugggggggghhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!

Expected Results:  
Get the load screen, have it load, have it work, be happy, no more bugs or mall ware getting past my AVG via microsoft products....

Worked would be great!  When it didn't work, having a "trouble installing" web page that may provide me with help in fixing it so I wouldn't have to bug you guys.  That would have been great!
