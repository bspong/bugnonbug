[Mockup] New Windows Theme (Windows 7)

For the Windows theme revamp many elements will need to move, merge and/or hide in the default configuration:

* The Menu Bar will be hidden by default
* Tabs above the navigation bar will be default (Bug #544815)
* The Home button will not be needed on the toolbar because of the addition of the Home Tab (Bug #544819)
* The Bookmarks Bar will be hidden by default for new profiles and profiles that have never modified the default contents (Bug #544817)
* A Bookmarks Widget that replicates the Bookmarks Menu will be placed to the right of the Search Bar (Bug #544817)
* The Refresh and Stop buttons will merge with the Go button attached to the Location Bar (Bug #544816)
* The Bookmarks Star will move to the left of the Location Bar
* Site Identity will move to an element inside the Location Bar (Details are still in progress)
* Introduce an App Button in the titlebar and an App Menu containing the streamlined contents of the Menu Bar (Still in progress)

In addition there will be all new visuals. Many mockups covering various system themes and configurations can be found on the Wiki: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/4.0_Windows_Theme_Mockups
				
Notable design considerations:
				
-- Windows Themes --
I have tried to design around the variable nature of the environment by making the items fit into many different styles. Even so there will likely be theme and version specific graphics required for optimal appearance. Not sure how this will work out exactly since a lot of the details will be in the implementation.

On Windows Vista/7 this will likely be less of a problem since it should accommodate glass variables and when Aero Glass isn't enabled. This is much more of a problem on XP.

-- Specific Design Concerns --
* On Windows Vista/7 the UI elements and the viewport are overlaying the glass visually with a drop shadow vs. the default etched look

* With tabs underneath the Navigation Bar and the Bookmarks Bar enabled there is a backdrop so that the bookmarks text is readable (This doesn't apply to non-Glass variations)
