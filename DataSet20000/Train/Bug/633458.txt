When you open a new window and right click the scrollbars, move you mouse down to the very bottom of the screen, and release, a whole bunch of incorrect options come up into the context menu, perhaps even all of them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a new firefox window.
2. Navigate to a webpage that is long enough to cause the vertical scroll bars to appears
3. Right click on the scroll bar and move the mouse down to the very bottom right corner of the screen.
4. Release the right mouse button, and a huge context menu will appear, with dozens of options that shouldn't be there and that do nothing when clicked.
Actual Results:  
A huge context menu will appear, with dozens of options that shouldn't be there and that do nothing when clicked.

Expected Results:  
Either not displaying the context menu(I think this is the expected result for right-clicking a scrollbar), or displaying a smaller, more sensible list with options that actually do something.
