Firefox checks to see if it default and returns always false, even when true.

I built firefox 3.0.10 from source on windows XP.  This bug is not present in XP installations but is in Vista.

The problem lies in chrome://browser/content/preferences/advanced.js's gAdvancedPane.checkNow function.

This function makes a call to shellSvc.isDefaultBrowser , which always returns false, regardless of if firefox is the default browser.  This will cause the advanced.[js|xul] duo to make a popup alert asking you if you would like to make firefox the default browser, despite the fact that it already is the default browser.  Bug becomes very noticeable when the configuration is set for firefox to check at startup.

Most likely cause: the isDefaultBrowser function is probably poorly written.  In the context of checkNow, it is used in an if statement as "!shellSvc.isDefaultBrowser(false)".  This is needlessly complicated for what should be a simple function, and the function's design probably reflects this.  The name implies a simple truth value, but counter-intuitively it receives a boolean parameter whose value in this case is the opposite of the expected outcome, and the resulting value is further reversed by a '!', by this time the function is less reliable simply for the fact that is hard to use.  Hard to use functions are rarely the result of elegantly written code.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Build firefox on an XP system.
2.Make an installer and install on a Vista system
3.Go to preferences>advanced and set firefox to always check to see if it is the default browser at startup.
4.Restart firefox and opt to make firefox the default browser.  Repeat this step continuously.
Actual Results:  
 Firefox checks to see if it is the default browser and always indicates that it is not.

Expected Results:  
Firefox checks to see if it is the default browser and indicates the proper result.
