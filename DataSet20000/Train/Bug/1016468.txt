UX regression caused by Bug 865826
The browser.tabs.closeButtons pref was removed. It provided an opportunity to place tab-closing button in the end of the tab strip, instead of placing small close button on every tab.

There is no telemetry data based on which you can know how many users used this pref. But for whose it broke some user cases in UX:
1) I have 20 tabs open and want quickly close five of them from the middle. I select first one to delete and click mouse to the static-placed close button right of the tab strip as much times as I want. Each tab width at this moment could stretch and shrink, it doesn't matter as long as the close button stays stock-still. 
Now if tab width are changing when tabs count reducing the close button jumping over tab strip.
2) Then I have 100+ tabs open tab width are 30px, when browser hang (goes unresponsive) I sometimes click two times to change it, now accidentally I could press close button then selecting the tab, it's unacceptable, as user have to reopen tab.
3) If I have 100+ tabs and want to close some specific tabs (based on favicons, like only Google searches tabs), I could move them using Ctrl+Tab by left hand, and by right hand clicking close button in the right. It was easy. Now I can't do that. 

The pref provided a three ways of closing tabs:
0-1: Display close buttons on each tabs
2: Don’t display any close buttons. So user can use keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl-W or Ctrl-F4) or middle click. Note that there was very old bug 78414, so keyboard shortcuts not working if page containing Flash (like youtube player) and it selected. So closing curtain tabs by keyboard is not an option. Middle click is a different UX either. 
3: Display a single close button at the end of the tab strip (Firefox 1.x behavior) 
So I think patch on Bug 865826 can be reverted.
