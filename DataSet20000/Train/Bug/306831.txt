Firefox takes about up to 700 MB RAM (when mozilla have allocated cca 700MB, i usually close it and open new session, but system goes unstable and laggy)

When i have one Firefox session running more than a 5, sometimes 8 days, it have
allocated cca 700MB. And i have opened something around 20 pages, but when i
close some, it never goes beter. Only solution is kill firefox with signal 15,
because when i close it by menu, the processes are still running. This will be
some king of memory lake, or too much 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox, browse many and many websites for 5 days :]

Actual Results:  
I lost my patience and kill firefox :]

Expected Results:  
Free some unneeded memory

Ok, this is happening with any theme and without any plugins. Just fresh merge
of firefox.

My system is running Gentoo, kernel 2.6.13-rc6 (but it is happening with many
other 2.6 kernel (both, stable and -rc). PC's HW is A2000+ with 1.5GB RAM,
without swap space (i don't need it and linux is always trying to use it - and
that's slow for me :]). I'm using newest stable X.org and fluxbox. 

If you need some more informations, ask me. Or i can grant you some ssh account
for look around my system - but i think that's not necessary.
