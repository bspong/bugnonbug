When using the launch dialouge (alt+f2) in KDE to run phoenix, the "Launch
Feedback" will not go away until it times out.  It is a problem exclusive to
Phoenix.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure you have "busy cursor" and/or "taskbar notification" turned on in
KDE control center.
  a: to turn them on get to the control center, under Launch Feedback > check  
                appropriate boxes, put timeout up high.
2.in KDE (possibly other desktop Environments, no others installed for me to
test with) press alt+f2, which brings up a "run command" dialouge.
3. point it at the script which launches phoenix ($install directory/phoenix)

Actual Results:  
Phoenix launches, but the busy cursor and taskbar notification don't go away
until they time out.

Expected Results:  
Once Phoenix launches, they should stop.  Possibly the script not terminating
properly?

I'm running Mandrake 9.0, have not tested this with any other distribution. 
This is not a problem with launching scripts in general with alt+f2, I tested
other scripts, the cursor and taskbar went away at the appropriate time.
