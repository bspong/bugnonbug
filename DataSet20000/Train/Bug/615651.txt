Text in Flash applications is extremely blurry. I have found many reports of blurry text in other parts of FF, but I do not see this problem anywhere else except in Flash applications. Using Flash player 10.1 and 10.2, the same problem exists. This has been an issue for a couple of weeks now.

Using the same Flash player and FF 4.0 B7, Flash looks fine. Hardware Acceleration is enabled in B7 and causes no problems, but disabling it in the nightly builds makes the text look fine. So, it seems this is related to Hardware Acceleration, but has to do with something that changed between B7 and the nighties to follow shortly thereafter.

Note: Cannot use "Report Broken Website" as per instructions, because this menu item seems to have been removed a while ago, and isn't present in recent betas or the nightly builds.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure Hardware Acceleration is enabled.
2. Load up one of the chat rooms at the URL above.
3. Text is blurry and virtually unreadable.
4. Disable Hardware Acceleration and restart FF.
5. Going to same URL and opening a chat room, the text is fine.



I upgraded to the latest nVidia drivers, version 260.99, and problem persists.
