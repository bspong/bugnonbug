If you leave the import bookmark dialogue box open it is imposable to auto scroll.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a page that has vertical scroll bars
2. Open the bookmark manager
3. Open the import bookmark dialogue but leave it open
4. Go back to the page with vertical scroll bars and middle click

Actual Results:  
Middle clicking did nothing, however the scroll wheel still works.

Expected Results:  
Either the browser should force me to finish importing bookmarks before I go
back to browsing. Or I should be able to middle click to auto-scroll. 

You can use any dialogue box that is generated by the bookmark manager. 
password manager 
searching for bookmarks 
download manager
creating a new bookmark
switching profiles

Preforming the steps to reproduce and middle clicking on a link preforms the
correct function loading the link in a new window or tab.

I was able to produce this behavior in FireFox 0.8 and Mozilla 1.6.
