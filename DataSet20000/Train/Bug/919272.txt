third party installs unwanted addon on firefox
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:24.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/24.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130910160258

Steps to reproduce:

installed latest kmplayer on my pc (version3,7) which includes also an app named "web site recomendation" with no option to avoid it.


Actual results:

KMplayer instalation program has installed in reality a "web site recommendation" addon. Same thing happened also for Chrome and not sure for Internet Explorer. 


Expected results:

Firefox should have asked me and verify later (when I opened firefox) that I trust and really wanted this addon to be installed. It's a security hole as browser behavior might be altered without user knowledge and approval by a third party. Actually by any third party. Kmplayer can not be blamed but Firefox should prevent this behavior by signaling to the user for a third party addon instalation and should look for approval from the user (like it does when installing from official firefox addon site). Maybe also a somewhat log file should be possible with all addon instalation history as a third might app may induce a fast start of firefox and a fast close, so the user may not realise a warning and verification request from a firefox window. Thank you very much and keep up the good work.
