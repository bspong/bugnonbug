[EME] Implement master pref for playing DRM content.
See user story in bug 1089876.

We want a master pref in Preferences -> Content to allow disabling all EME/CDM/DRM/BBQ support. It should be enabled by default, but allow a user to opt-out of DRM support.

Basically, a checkbox and link:

  [X] Play DRM Content   _Learn More_

Bug 1089876 comment 1 indicates this should basically be checkbox UI for the media.eme.enabled pref.

In support of the user stories in bug 1089873 and bug 1089882, the "Learn More" link provides an opportunity for the user to learn about what DRM is. (SUMO page TBD, initial wordsmithing in bug 1095734.)

Depending on the order in which pieces land, we'll also want the Addon Manager side to honor this pref (to inhibit CDM installs/updates and indicate any CDMs as disabled).

I believe we also want to use this pref to be used by users who are fundamentally opposed to DRM, so that any already-installed CDMs will be removed from their system. The exact way that functions is TBD -- we could immediately uninstall when clearing the checkbox, but it might be less of a footgun to uninstall at the next browser restart. [Again, depending on the order of this bug and the Addon Manager work, this part could be spun out into a followup.]
