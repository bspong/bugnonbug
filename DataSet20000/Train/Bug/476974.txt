After installing 3.1b2 attempts to launch previous 3.0 install only launches 3.1b2
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1b2) Gecko/20081201 Firefox/3.1b2

I installed Firefox 3.1b2 but did not uninstall my current 3.0.5 version. I had shortcuts to each browser (firefox.exe) version but both launched the 3.1b2 version of the browser. I even tried going directly to the firefox.exe file for 3.0.5 directory in the Program Files and launching the application from there but still got the 3.1b2 browser. Both versions of the browser show up using the Control Panel 'Add Remove Applications'. I cannnot find a way to launch the older version of the browser that still seems to be installed on my system.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Double-click shortcut or directly click Firefox.exe of 3.0.5
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Firefox 3.1b2 launches

Expected Results:  
Firefox 3.0.5 launches

I was trying to use the older version of the browser because add-ons were not yet available for the 3.1b2 (google notebook specifically) Since I cannot open the older browser I cannot use that add on and all my information I stored there is inaccessible. Inconvenient but I HOPE a simple reinstall of the older version will fix this issue - have not tried that yet.
