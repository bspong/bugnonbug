Hi: To whom it may concern. I am Robert, I have a web site that I make premade tournament pages for people to use in cases/myleague tournaments. When I make/build the page I use IE, and the pages look great. But if I or anyone uses firefox to view the pages they are displayed differently ( table border colors are not the same ). example: http://www.nocheatin.com/ABSENCEOFFEAR.html  if you open this web page with IE it is a very pretty page to view, if you open this page with firefox the colors change and are ( no punn ) rather ugly. ( as does netscape,and opera ) I was wondering why this is and how to fix it. If you  could e-mail me back explaining this I would appreciate. willyatakemehome@yahoo.com TYVM, Robert.
