Becoming unresponsive and showing a SPOD (spinning pizza of death) during import is unfortunate.  SPOD generally means an app is hanging, not just busy.  A progress bar would be nice.  At least a "working" indicator (a spinning progress dial like the one used while loading a page), or the arrow-with-spinning-disk cursor.  Staying responsive (allowing browsing) while importing would be even better, of course, but it may not be worth the trouble.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Safari and create some profile information to import: save a few bookmarks, browse to a few pages, fill in a few fields, save some passwords
2. Quit Safari
3. Launch Firefox
4. Select File:Import...
5. Choose "Safari" to import from
6. Proceed through the dialog boxes, choosing the default button at each step
7. After hitting the last "Continue", notice that nothing at all appears to happen for a few seconds, then the cursor changes to the SPOD until the import completes
8. Try to switch back to the browser window during import
Actual Results:  
Application becomes unresponsive to input during import.  UI indication is more typical of a hanging app than a busy one.

Expected Results:  
Application presents a progress bar or more typical "busy" indicator.  Ideally, app remains responsive during import.
