The University of Wisconsin-Green Bay is changing its e-mail font.

For years, the university has used Arial. But during spring break last week, it switched to Century Gothic, which uses roughly 30 percent less ink when printed on paper. Director of Computing and Information Technology Diane Blohowiak told Wisconsin Public Radio that the new font uses even less ink than a widely touted "Eco Font."

With printer ink costing around $10,000 a gallon, the university is hoping the font change will help departments save some money. Plus, the change fits with the university's five-year plan to go green. So far, Blohowiak told WPR, she hasn't received any complaints about the change.
