Firefox generates continuous Operating System page faults when only this page is loaded: http://www.deccanherald.com.
I could see within 20 minutes of keeping this page open, the page faults which appear in the Windows Task manager against Firefox was around 208,000.

Also the "IO Writes Bytes" for the above 20 minutes was at 138,700,000 bytes.
This seems too abnormal and high.

The Windows machine is a Windows XP on a IBM Lenovo Core2Duo system, 1 GB RAM, 60 GB HDD. Processes running at this time were 65, CPU USAGE was 5%, commit charge was 1024M/2441M.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bring up Windows Task manager, in View->Select Columns, select "Page Faults", "I/O Write Bytes" parameters.
2. Bring up Firefox 3.1a2 (installed on 18-Jan-2009)
3. Visit the URL http://www.deccanherald.com
4. Locate the Firefox.exe in Windows task manager and Observe the Page Fault and I/O Write bytes parameters.

Actual Results:  
The page faults and I/O write bytes parameters keep increasing. 
I could see within 20 minutes of keeping this page open, the page faults which appear in the Windows Task manager against Firefox was around 208,000.


Expected Results:  
1. The page faults should not keep on increasing. 
2. Page faults should be fairly small number for the time the Firefox is open
3. The I/O write bytes should be fairly small number. The Outlook which has been kept open for 3 hours has only 11 MB I/O write, where as Firefox within 20 minutes was highest and registered 138 MB.
