E-mails (in Horde) are not sent, and are lost, in Firefox 3.6 when the address is in the form NAME <ADDRESS>
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6

Since upgrading to Firefox 3.6, e-mails I send through webmail (using Horde) are not sent and their content irretrievably lost when I reply to a message in which the e-mail address has a name followed by the address enclosed in < and > symbols.

If I instead delete the <, >, and name, (in other words, if the e-mail address is just a simple e-mail address), everything works regularly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Reply to a message in Horde webmail where the e-mail address takes the form NAME <ADDRESS; ex.: Mr. XXX <xxx@hotmail.com>
Actual Results:  
The entire content of the message (including the address, subject header, and body content) goes blank.  The message is not sent (and does not show up in the Sent folder).  Trying to go back to the message using ALT-{Left Arrow) does not bring back the body content.



Expected Results:  
The e-mail should have been sent normally upon pressing Send.

If, instead, the e-mail address is changed from Mr. XXX <xxx@hotmail.com> to simply xxx@hotmail.com, everything works normally.

This has never happened before upgrading to Firefox 3.6, and I have made no other changes recently.
