The theme in Firefox 3 beta 3 was the best I've seen from any browser.  It was beautiful.  It blended in perfectly with the standard Mac interface.  I sometimes mistook it for Safari, but it actually looked niceer than Safari.  Beta 4's theme is not nearly as attractive.  The huge back button is ugly.  The tabs that blend in with the bookmarks bar above them makes it look like the bookmarks are part of the tab, and are associated with that specific tab.  (This breaks the interface standards used on OS X applications.)  The new theme doesn't look nearly as clean and smooth, and is rather chunky.  Please bring the old one back!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Run Firefox 3 beta 3. 
2.  Fall in love.
3.  Install Firefox 3 beta 4.
4.  Question your superficial relationship with your favorite browser.  Looks don't really matter, right?  :-)
Actual Results:  
Firefox Beta 4 is not as attractive than Beta 3

Expected Results:  
Beta 4 would keep the same theme, or have a more attractive one.

It would be great to have the Beta 3 theme as an option from the themes download site, at the very least.
