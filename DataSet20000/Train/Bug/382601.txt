Filemaker data base is displayed with maximum 25 records per page.   Navigation buttons allows switching between multiple layouts.  When changing layouts only a few of the records will display correct content.  Most records continue to display content from original layout.  This applies only to records with images.  Text updates correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to site referenced above
2.  Note CPU layout with only most three most  recent records is displayed by default
3.Click on memory button - note not all records update to memory display
4. Clicking on record navigation book at leaft will introduce new records, some of which display correct, other do not
Actual Results:  
As noted above each layout displays a specific data type CPU, Memory, Internal Traffic, ect.  However rendered display will mix images from other other layouts

Expected Results:  
Each layout should display images of one data type

Display rendered correctly in previous version of FireFox as well as all current versions of Safari and Explorer on Windows machines.
