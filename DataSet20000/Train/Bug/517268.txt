I have FireFox configured to pop up ProfileManager automatically when I start up FireFox.  That creates a small 20MB (as per Windows Task Manager) process.  I then select my profile and start it, which creates another FireFox.exe process that is clearly handling my browsing.  The original ProfileManager firefox.exe process does not go away and does not go away when I quit the browser windows.  I can start FireFox again with one of these invisible FireFox.exe processes still running, and a new FireFox.exe ProfileManager process begins and asks me for a profile.  I can start a profile, which starts a browser firefox.exe process, but that second ProfileManager.exe process sticks around.  It will stick around even after I shut down the browser windows (and the browser firefox.exe process ends).   I can keep on accumulating invisible 20MB FireFox.exe processes. -- Rebooting doesn't change the behavior.  Killing processes doesn't stop it.  Changing what profile I start doesn't alter the behavior. -- The problem does go away if I tell profile manager not to start automatically when firefox starts. -- I only noticed this problem recently.  I don't know how long I've had it.  I know I had it for 3.5.1 as well as my current 3.5.2.   It might have started a few days ago after an odd crash of Firefox when it said I should tell it what page not to load.  It might have started when I recently installed Thunderbird or it might have been around for months.  -- I'd be happy to run test code, but I can't devote time to debugging Firefox source code.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Quit all firefox.exe processes how ever you'd like to do that.
2. Start FireFox.exe -P once
3. Configure FireFox ProfileManager to always start before the browser starts.
4. Quit firefox.exe
5. Start firefox
6. select and start a profile.  Notice that the first firefox.exe process has not gone away.
Actual Results:  
an invisible firefox.exe process is listed in task manager and never goes away even after you quit the browser windows

Expected Results:  
The process should go away as soon as the browser windows appear.
