After browsing, closing the browser and starting it again later, selecting Tools->Clear Private Data sometimes does not clear browsing history, cache and cookies. Previously-visited sites appear in the browsing history (to be clear: I am referring to non-bookmarked sites!), the cache directory is unchanged, and site preferences that are stored in cookies persist.

I noticed the bug occurs especially right after the browser has started. If I wait for, say, 20 seconds, private data is usually cleared as expected.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Surf the web, visit sites that you do not have bookmarked.
2. Close the browser.
3. Start the browser and immediately after it starts up, select Tools->Clear Private Data
Actual Results:  
Visited sites still appear in the browsing history pull-down, even though they are not bookmarked. Cached data and cookies from previous surfing are preserved.

Expected Results:  
Only bookmarked sites should appear. No cached data or cookies should be preserved.

Similar bugs have been reported in the past and have all been eventually merged into Bug 423507, which was subsequently claimed to have been fixed. I have been asked to open a new bug report. Whether it is or it is not the same bug, I have witnessed this bug continuously since I first installed a Firefox 3.* version and it is still not fixed as of Firefox 3.0.7 and may compromise the privacy of the browser's users.
