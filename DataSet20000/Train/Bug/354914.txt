Make about and other generated pages more easily stylable

The browser needs to assign a unique ID to the html tag of each generated page. This ID would then be available for use to style the page (e.g. through a theme, userContent.css, extension, etc). If confirmed as an RFE, this will be a tracking bug to the changes for the individual pages.

Reasoning: It is difficult to style most of the about:* pages (and others) that are generated internally by Firefox. These pages are not chrome, but are instead usually rendered as html content. This, and the fact that the pages are not uniquely identified, makes it hard to style the page according to the current theme being used in Firefox. 

Reproducible: Always




The most obvious pages that need to be addressed are those most commonly used by users. This includes about:blank, about:plugins, and about:. Hopefully, all generated content will eventually have its own unique ID. For the purpose of clarity, the IDs should all start with a similar prefix; preferrably "about-".

Below is a tentative list of pages that need to be addressed. Some pages already have subelements with their own IDs, but are not fully stylable since their html element still has no ID.

about:   
> html -
> div "#aboutPageContainer"

about:blank
> html -

about:buildconfig
> html -

about:cache
> html -

about:cache-entry
> html -

about:credits
> html -

about:license
> html -
> body "#lic-info"

about:mozilla
> html -
> p "#moztext"
> p "#from"

about:plugins
> html -
> div "#outside"

view-source:
> html -
> body "#viewsource"

about:config is a special case that renders as chrome and already has a usable ID (#config); so it does not need to be modified.
