Removing Bookmark Toolbar is hard/unintuitive

To maximise useful window area I wanted to remove the bookmarks toolbar.  I knew this was possible because I've done it before, but it took me a long time to find out how to do it.  This bug is to suggest improving the context menus to make this easier.

It seems that the context menu on parts of the navigation toolbar includes options to enable/disable both the navigation toolbar and the bookmarks toolbar.  Right-clicking on the navigation toolbar is not the intuitive thing to do when you want to remove the bookmarks toolbar.  Right clicking on the bookmarks toolbar itself shows a menu that is entirely related to bookmarks and doesn't have a "remove" option.

I'd like to suggest that the option to enable/disable the bookmarks toolbar is either moved from the navigation toolbar to the bookmarks toolbar, or is shown on both context menus.  (There is an obvious issue about how to get a toolbar back once you have removed it...)

Cheers,  Phil.
