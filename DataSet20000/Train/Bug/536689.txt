Latest Firefox 3.6b6pre (since 20091223): With a clean profile, once I applied localhost (or 127.0.0.1):8080 in the Manual Proxy Configuration area entry boxes, Namoroka will crash as soon as I click on a link in the Latest Headlines feed. Afterwards, the browser will continue to crash when launched. 

Tried to bypass Proxomitron (that is where the 127.0.0.1:8080 local proxy comes in)...The pages loaded without further crashing. It seems like the Namoroka 3.6b6pre build since 20091223 is not playing nice with the filter sets I use in the Proxomitron (Sidki filter set 2009-02-13 (06-06 Updates)

Rolling back to previous nightly from 20091222 also clear this crash problem.
