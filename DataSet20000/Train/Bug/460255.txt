Firefox 3 crashes when I go to CNet TV. It happens most of the times.

I frequently see CNet TV. This site is mostly okay, but many a time it crashes badly and happens with all the Firefox windows opened. IE7 and IE8, it is fine. It does show 'Not Responding' and many times it does go away for a few seconds and to save all my open windows and tabs, I have to close this one before that annoying message comes up again.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to the CNet TV Home Page.
2.For that, go to one of CNet's main sites, like http://www.download.com/ or http://www.cnet.com/ and click the tablike hyperlink at the top for CNet TV.
3.Should happen most of the time.
Actual Results:  
The home page comes and half of the Flash part appears, but the main part, including the video and the video browser doesn't appear. Then it's gone - poof!

Expected Results:  
The video part and the right hand sidebar should've appeared. Then automatically, the daily update video starts to play.

I was using the default theme. It does happen with all the themes I have used at that time.

I have an HP Pavilion Tablet PC (tx2001au). It has an AMD Turion TL-58, 1.98 GHz. The GPU is a 128 MB GeForce 6150 Go.

I don't know the crash module. It never shows up. Just hangs.
