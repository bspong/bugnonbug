Anchor Chat Windows to Bottom of Browser and Allow for Tear-off
The interaction that SocialAPI, as well as Facebook's sidebar, is designed for is passive social browsing.  This means that users can browse the web while still being linked to their social network and conversations.  Rather than needing to interrupt their current task to check Facebook, users can carry social interactions with them as they browse.

For users to seamlessly shift between their browsing task and conversations, chat conversations need to be a part of the browser window itself.  Conversations cannot be separate windows only, as these must be managed and may be lost, defeating the purpose of keeping social interactions passive and simple.

The UX team has had the goal of eliminating these separate "floating" windows throughout Firefox for a long time.  We're gradually moving many parts of the browser, such as Bookmarks, Add-ons, and Preferences, into the content area.  There are a few reasons we're doing this, including the ability to display Firefox in fullscreen mode and across devices.  For chat, this is even more vital, because conversations must be something the user does not need to manage explicitly, but can carry with them.

The attached mockup shows chat windows as opening in the bottom of the browser window, to the left of the social sidebar.  The user can minimize or tear off the conversations by using the icons in the top right.
