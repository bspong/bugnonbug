Browser starts loading images before DOMContentLoaded is triggered
User-Agent:       Opera/9.63 (Windows NT 6.0; U; en) Presto/2.1.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; fr; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5

I'm using a Greasemonkey user script that hides ads on web pages on the DOMContentLoaded event. I read the Greasemonkey documentation that states that Greasemonkey scripts are executed on the DOMContentLoaded event (http://wiki.greasespot.net/DOMContentLoaded), which means when the HTML document is fully loaded but before the images (https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Gecko-Specific_DOM_Events#DOMContentLoaded). The web browser currently doesn't respect these guidelines and trigger DOMContentLoaded when the HTML and some images are loaded. As a result, user scripts that block ads are executed after the ads are displayed, and this is not the way the application should behave. First, the browser should load the HTML content, then execute the Greasemonkey scripts (triggering DOMContentLoaded), and then load images.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable user scripts
2. Install a user script that blocks ads (e.g. AdSweep)
3. Open a popular web site that has ads (e.g. TechCrunch)
Actual Results:  
Some ads appear for a few seconds (even with an empty cache).

Expected Results:  
Ads should be hidden right away.
