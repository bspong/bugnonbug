When I create an alert using the DHTML accessibility techniques at www.mozilla.org/access/dhtml, it is not spoken by WindowEyes (WE) when it is repeated. 
I will attach a sample file once this bug is submitted. 
When I press the display a single dhtml alert via a button, the alert will be spoken by the WindowEyes screen reader (if it isn't, restart both WE and FF - that is also a problem I need to file). The alert is programmed to be automatically hidden after a few seconds.  If I press the show single alert button again, the alert will not be spoken. If I change focus on the page and then press the button again, it WILL be spoken.
The example also has a button to create a repeating alert. The alert will we displayed and removed in an infinite loop. The first alert will be spoken but subsequent alerts will not be spoken.  Again, if I change the focus on the page between alerts, then each alert will be spoken. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Using attached alertex.html file
2.Start WindowEyes 5.5
3.Start Firefox and load alertex.html
3a.press ctrl-shift-a to toggle WE into browse off mode.
4.press the "Create Single Alert" button
5.The alert should be displayed and spoken by WE
6.After the alert disappears, press the "Create Single Alert" button again
7.The alert will display but will not be spoken by WE



Expected Results:  
The alert should be spoken each time it is displayed as long as WindowEyes remains in browse-off mode.
