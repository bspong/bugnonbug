if prefs.js in program files is read only, prefs.js in new profile folder is read only too, unlike firefox 2
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; fr; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; fr; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3

Tested with French Firefox 3.0.3 on french Windows 2000.

In C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\defaults\profile\, when prefs.js has "read only" permission ; for first opening of Firefox, prefs.js of the profile folder has "read only" permission.

In firefox 2.0.0.17 or Thunderbird 2.0.0.17, for first opening, the prefs.js of the profile folder dont't have restrictions.

Is it the new policy ?


It's the same problem with bookmarks.html, but it's less important for firefox 3 ; unless if about:config/browser.bookmarks.autoExportHTML is enabled.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go in C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\defaults\profile\
2. Create an empty file with the name prefs.js.
3. Give read only permission to prefs.js.
4. Delete the Firefox profile folder in C:\Documents and Settings\xxxmynamexxx\Application Data\Mozilla. Or use Firefox.exe -profilemanager to create a new Firefox profile.
5. Launch Firefox.
6. In C:\Documents and Settings\xxxmynamexxx\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\aaaaa.bbbbb\, prefs.js is read only.

Actual Results:  
In firefox 3

In C:\Documents and Settings\xxxmynamexxx\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\aaaaa.bbbbb\, prefs.js is read only.

Settings can't be saved.


Expected Results:  
In firefox 2

In C:\Documents and Settings\xxxmynamexxx\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\aaaaa.bbbbb\, prefs.js don't have restrictions.

PS :

How I found this problem.
I make custom install of firefox and thunderbird for my company.
I unpack "firefox setup.exe" with 7-zip to firefoxUnpackFolder.
In firefoxUnpackFolder\localized\defaults\profile\, I add bookmarks.html and prefs.js.
I burn the firefoxUnpackFolder on a CD.
I launch the installation by clicking setup.exe on the CD.

Files in the CD are always "read only".

Actually, I use Firefox 2.0.0.17.
Maybe I should try an other way to install my custom install of firefox 3.0.3. I think about self extracting with 7-zip but I don't know how to do.
