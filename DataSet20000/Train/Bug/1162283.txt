Add support for limited hard-coded localizations to Pocket
The in-product Pocket code is currently shipping hard-coded en-US strings, outside of the usual localizable places. We'd like to extend this to include Russian, Japanese, Spanish, and German. Also outside of the normal L10N flow, since this is an exceptional/special situation with a short timeframe.

Specifically, we currently have:

  browser/base/content/browser-pocket.dtd
  browser/base/content/browser-pocket.properties
  browser/components/pocket/panels/js/dictionary.js

(Note that these are not under the usual /browser/locales/en-US/... tree.)

The short-tem fix here, as I understand it, will be to do the following:

1) Add browser-pocket-$LOCALE.properties files for ru/jp/es/de.

2) Add run-time detection (similar to the browser.pocket.useLocaleList check in CustomizableWidgets.jsm) to pick the correct .properties file to use.

3) Figure out a solution for doing effectively the same thing for the .dtd strings. I suspect it will be easiest to move these strings to the .properties files, and do runtime DOM manipulation to jam them into the right places (menuitem labels in the context menu / bookmarks menu).

4) The dictionary.js file comes from Pocket, but we probably need to suggest how to use the solution in #2 here so they can do the same.

The actual strings for ru/jp/es/de are being localized in dependent bugs. We'll need to take care of landing the localized strings into the right files.
