WebEQ viewer control applet crashes Firefox when typing into any text field
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

The presence of the WebEQ viewer control applet on a page causes text input to
any element on that page to crash the browser. The crash occurs on the first
key-stroke when the focus is in a field that accepts input.

I can repeat this problem at will on:

OS      : Mac OS X 10.4.2
Browser : Firefox 1.0.6
Java    : 1.3.1_15

Problem and System Information from OS is attached.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to this page:
http://www.dessci.com/en/products/webeq/interactive/viewerctrlex.htm
2.Wait for the applet to finish loading and then try to type something in the
search text input field on the left menu. 
3.

Actual Results:  
The first key-stroke crashes the browser.

Expected Results:  
The presence of the WebEQ Viewer control applet on a page should not affect text
input fields.
