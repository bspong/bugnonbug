When viewing images, generally gradients, sometimes they have extremely bad banding. It effects all gradients, including the ones in the theme I use.

You can see in IE it looks normal, but in FF the quality is poor, I have not been able to do any testing yet as to if this only happens with a certain format or color profile. I generally have firefox open for weeks on end and I've found no pattern, it seems to come and go randomly. It may only be gifs, with srgb, I'm not sure....

Last night it was doing it, this morning it was gone, I just got home and now it's back again. Firefox was never closed / restarted.

The problem can happen with srgb gifs, both normal and interlaced. I had all my gifs interlaced and it was happening so I switched to normal and it fixed it, but now it's back again. It can happen on Windows Xp, Windows XP X64, and can also happen in firefox on a mac (not sure about the os or firefox version).

One more thing, I use iFox Metal 2.5.1 as my theme and when the image issue occurs all of the gradients in the theme are also effected, so it isn't just what's in the browser window.
