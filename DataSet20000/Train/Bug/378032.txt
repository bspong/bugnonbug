Firefox display from 2 different servers over X11 forwarding are merged to one process on the first server and no new window is created (tab is added to existing window)

I recently noticed something strange with X11 forwarding Firefox over SSH. I was running X11 on my Mac (OS X Server 10.4.8) and had two separate SSH sessions open to two different Linux boxes (I used the -X flag). I started Firefox on the first box and then subsequently started Firefox on the second box. But instead of starting a new process on the second box a new process was spawned on the first box - I ran top to verify this and there was no Firefox process running on the second box, while there were two on the first ! I tried this a bunch of times and still
the same thing happened. I've also tested this on a Windows box using putty and Xming(or any other X windows client) and still the same result. I have also tried connecting to the Linux boxes using the SSH -Y flag and still the same result.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. SSH -X (or Y) to any linux box that has Firefox installed
2. SSH -X (or Y) to any second linux box that has Firefox installed (while still running firefox on the first box)
3. Notice that the new process that should have fired up on the second box has actually just jumped to the first box as another tab.  No new process actually starts on the first box.
Actual Results:  
Firefox opened a new tab on the firefox window from the first box

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have started a new process on the second box with a seperate window being displayed back to the user. 

It appears to have something to do with X forwarding
