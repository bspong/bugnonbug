Firefox 3 hangs on startup since beta4 [libaoss.so and libetc.so]
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080222 Epiphany/2.20 Firefox/2.0.0.4
Build Identifier: http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/3.0b4/linux-i686/en-US/firefox-3.0b4.tar.bz2

While beta3 and earlier were working flawlessy, beta4 hangs on startup. Strace stops on "futex(0xb7f171c4, FUTEX_WAIT_PRIVATE, 2, NULL" and waits infinitely (full strace output included as attachment).

In addition to released beta4, I have checked also nightlies from 2008-02-14-04-trunk (the oldest after release of 3.0b3 I have found) to 2008-03-16-04-trunk; all exhibit the same behaviour.

Removing profile directory and all plugins has shown no improvement. Also building locally from source changes nothing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download anything older than beta3
2. Try to start Firefox
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens, Firefox just sits and waits.

Expected Results:  
Running Firefox
