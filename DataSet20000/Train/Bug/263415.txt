windows are moved and resized when the preference "web features:advanced:move or
resize windows" is disabled 

The web site moves and resizes windows even if the preference is disabled.

If you use about:config 
dom.disable_window_move_resize is set to false even though the checkbox
in the preference "web features:advanced:move or resize windows" is disabled 

setting dom.disable_window_move_resize, dom.disable_window_flip and
dom.disable_window_open_feature.location all to true prevents the 
windows being resized and moved
