Hi outa there,

while programming for ff 1.501 i discovered two bugs which are still
present in bon echo alpha 1 so i thought it´s time to tell you something
about it.

The problem occurs when using css page-break-after or before on a table
which has tds or ths with background color enabled. If you print the
table with colors enabled (in this case it´s a telephone list where
every 2. row is background colored gray) the second page of the print
preview and the print and all further pages are totally grayed. Here is
a very simple example of the bug: www.riewel.de/ff
Open the page. Enable printing of background colors and images. Open the
print preview and step to page two and you´ll see a totally grayed page.

The second bug concerncs F5 reload in the print preview dialog. Open the
print preview dialog. Step to page two and press F5. The dialog will
render a normal HTML site within the preview. The buttons are getting
funtionless and you can only close the whole window.

If someone needs to get into contact for further details simply add a
jan to the websites adress to get my emailadress.

P.S. All bugs occured onto a windows-xp sp2 machine.
