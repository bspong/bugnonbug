Firefox is causing frequent Windows Explorer crashes under the RTM version of Windows 7 Ultimate x64.

The Windows Error Reports always point to either 'explorer.exe', 'msvcrt.dll', 'ntdll.dll' or 'comctl32.dll'.

The problem seems to always occur when you either right-click on the desktop, right-click the Recycle Bin, it also happens just as Firefox is closed or when browsing Control Panel

Originally I thought it was Microsoft Security Essentials beta causing the issue, but it was not.
Following advice from a forum I used ShellExView to disable any 3rd party entries, and remove any suspect software.

After several weeks of trying everything possible including re-downloading Windows from Technet and a complete fresh install, somebody suggested that it was Firefox 3.5.2 causing the problem.

Having removed Firefox 3.5.2 the problem stopped.
I decided to try Firefox 3.5.3 to see if the problem was resolved.
As soon as I installed it I started getting the issue again, I have tried Firefox with Add-ons and without and created a new profile, the issue still persists.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close Firefox
2. Right-click the desktop or Recycle Bin
Actual Results:  
The issue generally occurs once or twice a day and once it starts Windows will crash on right-click around four times then revert to normal behaviour.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should not make Windows unstable.
