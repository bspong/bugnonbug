FF 3.6.13 page loading hangs with multiple windows/tabs - FIN-WAIT, CLOSE-WAIT, TIME-WAIT etc
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

After upgrading to 3.6.13 session restores hang on most pages. Note that this is a heavily loaded restore - 20 windows, up to 8/10 tabs in some windows. I realize that this is a heavy load situation, but it should be handled more gracefully. netstat tells me that these are going to FIN-WAIT-[1|2] and CLOSE-WAIT. Most eventually fall through to TIME-WAIT, continuing with the connection hung until the ten minutes or so expire. Essentially I end up with many, many tabs just spinning the "loading" indicator. Sometimes clicking refresh reloads; sometimes a CR in the URL reloads; mostly no effect. Been awhile since I fired up Wireshark and I'm willing to try if it will help someone. This seems similar to Bug 606719 which is marked as resolved. Any help is appreciated. tnx, JD

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Restart Firefox 3.6.13 with saved session
2. Watch tabs go into "loading" - and most stay there
3. run netstat -a | grep WAIT and watch all the hung connections
Actual Results:  
see above

Expected Results:  
clean page loads - or error message(s)

DSL 1/2 Mbs internet connection to router/firewall, 192.168 local net, WiFi to laptop. No problems noticed prior to 3.6.13. I leave it to developers judgment if Major bug should be reduced to Normal; but it sure is ugly, and will not be understood by many users.
