Either connecting to a VPN with an active browser session or using remote desktop causes Firefox to crash

  I am fairly sure it's VPN, not remote desktop, but all 3 times the crash has occurred I was using both VPN and remote desktop at the same time.

  Last night is when the first two crashes occurred.  The 2nd time FF asked if I wanted to submit a report, so some details on the 2nd crash should've been received last night.  The MAC addresses that may be associated with that crash report are:

00-16-CE-52-18-3A
00-05-9A-3C-78-00

  The first is my wireless card, the 2nd is the MAC associated with the Cisco VPN software.

  I have about 15-20 tabs open in firefox, but the only one I suspect may have something to do with it is gmail.  I was already logged into G-Mail when I connected to my VPN, and I'm guessing the ajax stuff that tries to stay connected to the gmail service had problems.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start firefox, open ~20 tabs to various sites (gmail, dice.com, monster.com), especially any pages that use ajax (or something similar) to update the page dynamically
2. Connect to a remote VPN, and initiate a remote desktop connection to a computer on the remote network.
3. Unsure what may or may not help reproduce the problem from here.
Actual Results:  
FF crashes

Expected Results:  
No crash.
