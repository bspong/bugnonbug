I have two Firefox windows open (one in my main desktop and one in another desktop). I use the browser in my "primary" desktop 99.999% of the time.

I work with an online tool that monitors a list of tasks. When I click one of the task links it opens a new browser window (not a tab). Below is an example of one of these links:

javascript:open_window('http://mytool.example.com/?task=2871')

This new window has a link inside of it that opens a new tab. This link inside the new window is not a Javascript link (instead it's just a normal link). However, when I click this link, the new page is loaded inside of my *secondary* browser window (located on my secondary desktop), as opposed to the primary main browser window.

This was not the behavior found in Firefox v2. It doesn't make much sense to have this "new" tab open in a browser window that hasn't been used.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have two browsers open in Linux on seperate desktops
2. Click a Javascript link that opens a new window, such as javascript:open_window('http://mytool.example.com/?task=2871')
3. Click a link inside of that new window that results in opening a new tab.
Actual Results:  
The new tab opens in an "inactive" browser window, as opposed to the one which originally was used to open the Javascript link.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should open the tab in the "active" browser window (i.e., the one that was originally used to open the Javascript link)

The "new pages should be opened in: a new tab" setting is selected.
