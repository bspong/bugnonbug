Happens frequently when playing online games in-bedded into firefox. Most of the time the game will load but in the middle of playing the game firefox will freeze. My computer is fine and still open documents and work on other stuff, but am unable to do anything with fire fix besides killing it on task manager. 

Also happens sometimes when playing a video online. I will hit play or pause in the middle of a video and it will freeze. 

This started happening after I downloaded the updated firefox. Never had a problem before. 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I go to www.Kongregate.com 
2.Click on any game
3.Wait for load and start playing, sometimes freezes immanently, other times in a min 
Actual Results:  
Firefox froze, mouse icon would lock to what it looked like. I cant click on anything or type. Have to kill firefox and restart via task manager.

Expected Results:
