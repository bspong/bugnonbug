I am unsure if this is a bug or more just a symptom of memory leak. Firefox 2 nearly immediately causes a 50 degree increase in temperature on the Macbook. I had been plagued by the random shutdowns that Apple recently released a firmware update to address this. 4 days later and no shutdowns. I have a temp monitor app running in the menubar and after upgrading to Firefox 2, Firefox is nearly unusable after about an hour of useage. It runs slow, it opens pages slow and the temp of the machine reaches 180-190 degrees. If run SMCFanControl wide open at 6200 RPM it still runs that hot. However, if I shut down Firefox, the temp plummets to 130-140 degrees using Safari. That is the range Firefox 1.5 operated at. If I run SMCFanControl, the temp will fall even further.  At first, I thought it was the new firmware from Apple, but the temp only goes that high with Firefox 2.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use a temp monitor application in MacOSX 10.4 on Macbook
2. Launch Firefox 2
3. After about 1 minute, temp jumps to 180+ without surfing or any other applications open
4. Close Firefox 2 and about 1 minute later, drops back to 125-130 degree range.




I assume this is a memory leak problem or perhaps related to problems with the Macbook the are already well documented. Never encountered this with Firefox 1.5, but this happens everytime and without any other applications open in Firefox 2.
