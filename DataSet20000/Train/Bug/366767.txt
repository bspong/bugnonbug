Authorization required pops up continually.

This didn't start happening until I updated Firefox from 1.5 to 2.0.  as with bug 345164. Multiple windows are open, Yahoo, Gmail, in addition, it doesn't really matter where I navigate to, the 'Authorization required' screen pops up.  It seems to not pop up as often when I enter the name and password at the Linksys screen.  Clearing the Private Data doesn't do much.  It also happens when I am in Word and have Firefox open as well.  The difference is it does not stop me from what I am doing. It is annoying when the Firefox tab at the bottom of the screen blinks. It doesn't stop until I go to that tab and hit clear.  But it comes right back in a few minutes.  I'd like to go back to 1.5 without the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open firefox.
2. go to GMAIL, Yahoo
3. or any other place
Actual Results:  
the Authorization screen pops up.  

Expected Results:  
It seems to open in the tab I was last in, so that I am taken back to the authorization screen.  I click clear and its gone for a while. I can resume what I was doing until it appears again.

The screen should not be popping up.  This is something new which started with the update of Firefox to 2.0.  Never had to do more than close a window to log out of anything with version 1.5 nor did I have to sign on to Linksys in order to use Firefox.
