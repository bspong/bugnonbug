The CSS opacity property, when applied to an image element and an object element set to display the same image, render differently. That is, the opacity on the object element is somehow more transparent than the opacity on the image element. Tested using PNG images. Upon comparison to an image that had the opacity manually set via Photoshop, it appears that the opacity on the image is correct and the opacity on the object is not. Example code:

img, object {opacity: 0.3;}
[...]
<img alt="Test Image" src="object.png"/>
<object type="image/png" data="object.png"></object>

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load two images, one through an image tag, the other through an object tag
2. apply CSS opacity where opacity is /between/ 1 and 0
3. observe that the images don't look the same
