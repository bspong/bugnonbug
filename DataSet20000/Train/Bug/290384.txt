Using Sunbird calendar 0.2 in Windows XP
On rebooting to Fedora and using Firefox there (necessary process debugging
mySQL based website to run under Linux) then rebooting to Windows XP the Sunbird
functionality disappears and I get a M$ message that Firefox has failed and do I
want to report this to MicroSoft.
Restarting Firefox and reinstalling Sunbird from the download area clears the
problem.
I cannot understand how information can be transmitted between the separate OS.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run Sunbird 0.2 in Firefox 1.0.2. Restart as many times as you want
2.restart machine switching (GRUB) to Fedora 3 Linux (& using Firefox installed
there)
3.restart machine switching (GRUB) to Windows XP. Run Firefox tools/calendar

Actual Results:  
Sunbird doesn't run, Firefox exits with MS error message

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have started Sunbird, giving access to calendar

trivial in itself (who else is going to be doing this?) but may indicate a
deeper fault.
