Audio/video autoplays even with plugins.click_to_play = true
Regardless of plugins.click_to_play, visiting the test URL causes audio (and unless explicitly blocked each time as described below, video as well) to start playing without requiring that the video player be clicked on.  I also tested this in Safe Mode. 

When I have plugins.click_to_play=true and the "Click to play per element" add-on is enabled for extra protection, I see the same thing. Even when I click the plugin icon next to the URL and say "Block plugin," this block does not survive a browser restart (and if there are multiple tabs open, that means multiple overlapping videos and audio streams starting up together when multiple tabs are being reopened at once).  After clicking Block Plugin, refreshing the page, I see a black/dark gray area instead of the video and I see an information bar asking "Allow http://www.usatoday.com to run "Adobe Flash"? but the audio still plays, and it even continues as autoplay advances in to the next video.  Clicking the plugin icon next to the URL, I get the same question with options "Allow Now" and "Allow and Remember" with no option to block the plugin that should already not be playing. I see this in FF43 as well. 

This surprise startup of audio is very annoying, for all the same reasons I have click_to_play = true and use the add-ons to try to block plugin autoplay. 

It's also not clear when clicking on a link to a news story that it'll have an autoplaying loud video (or ads), and the video don't necessarily add to the content (esp. the video up now at the example URL, in contrast to the video that was there this morning which had a newscaster adding some additional substance and detail).  

Please reclassify the Component if I got that wrong.
