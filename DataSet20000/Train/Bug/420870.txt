Installed version 2.0.0.12 of Firefox cannot access a website that requires x-shockwave-flash
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20070321 Netscape/8.1.3
Build Identifier: Firefox 2.0.0.12 

I switched from Netscape 9.0.0.6 because of Netscapes's announcement that they were not going to update that Browser any more and their recommendation to use Firefox. I installed it on two of my Windows XP systems so far and had trouble after each install accessing http://shell04.theworld.com/suirrelmail-login.shtml. It took some trial and error but I finally figured out that I needed the plug-in "x-shockwave-flash". I think the install should install more of the common plug-ins since not everyone is going to realize the problem is easily fixed by undrestanding they need to install shockwave.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install 2.0.0.12 of Firefox on a Windows XP PC
2. access http://shell04.theworld.com/suithe connection progress area at the bottom of the screen will start and then freeze and one is not able to perform any actions exept to kill the process and access some other web sidt after restartingrrelmail-login.shtml
3. 
Actual Results:  
The connection progress area at the bottom of the screen will start and then freeze and one is not able to perform any actions exept to kill the process and access some other web sidt after restarting

Expected Results:  
All of the graphic areas of the login page should display and one should be able to log in.

I found one web site (I do not remember which) that notified me that I needed to install Shockwave Flash Player. After going to the Plugins page at Mozilla update I was able to download and install Shockwave by Adobe and this fixed my problems.
