Installer quickly and silently crashes on Windows NT 4.0 without version 5.80 or newer of Comctl32.dll
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: FireFox 1.0+ en-US win32 installer

The EXE-installer unexpectedly crashes/terminates on an old box with Windows 
NT 4.0 following way:
1. It opens "Extracting" progress dialog, runs silently for a while, then it 
extracts (an installation) quite quickly.
2. It opens an info dialog "Initilizing Setup..." for short and closes it.
3. It opens an info dialog "Verifying integrity of archives..." for short and 
closes it.
4. Nothing more appears and the process terminates.

I repeated the procedure (getting the same result) with:
a) FireFox 1.0 Czech language [official download]
b) FireFox 1.0 (US) English language [official download]
c) FireFox 1.0 (US) English language [nightly build from 28-Dec-2004]


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download an installer.
2. Run the installer.
3.

Actual Results:  
Installer silently dies.

Expected Results:  
Go on with installing or at least report something.

I suspect an incompatibility with an obsolete CPU or something alike. I do not 
know how to force the installer to produce a log-file or a similar report, so 
I cannot provide more details at the moment.

See an attached report from "Windows Diagnostics" for details about the 
hardware configuration.
