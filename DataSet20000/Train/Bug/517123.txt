in the main browser window - right click a URL and press 'T' to open in a new tab.  W opens a new WINDOW 'T' and 'W' shortcuts - simple right ? 

However the command to do open a new TAB on the bookmark toolbar is 'W' 
 ( duh ?)  
BUT if you forget and  press 'T' by mistake while right clicking a toolbar link - IT ERASES the toolbar shortcut w/o warning or delay.

 NB: 'T' is not even listed as a command when you right click the bookmark toolbar, but it is a fine undocumented toolbar link eraser. OUCH !!!!

 A brutal and painful inconsistency - when keeping the command structure keys consistent would solve this . 
Suggested cure:  Make it consistent whatever the context. 
 'T' should mean new TAB  , 'W' should mean new WINDOW 

just like in the main window. 

this mindless re purposing of the keyboard shortcuts defies logic 
but losing the bookmark is a twist worthy of Microsoft 

 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.in main window right click a link and press 'T'
2.on bookmark tool bar do the same thing
3.watch bookmark be erased
Actual Results:  
c 4 yourself - has driven me crazy forever


T should always in all applicable contexts OPEN A NEW TAB 
W "       "                                 "    NEW WINDOW
