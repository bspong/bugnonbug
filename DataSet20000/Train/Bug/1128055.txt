Standard CSS 'filter' function grayscale makes HTML elements disappear
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:35.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/35.0
Build ID: 20150108202552

Steps to reproduce:

1) Open the page https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter in Firefox 35.
2) Open Firefox Developer Tool 'Scratchpad' on that page by pressing Shift+F4 (or from the menu)
3) Enter this code: 


      function AddStyle(text) {
        style = document.createElement('style');
        style.type = 'text/css';
        style.textContent = text;
        style.id = 'mystyle';
        document.head.appendChild(style);
      }

      function myAddStyle()
      {
        AddStyle("\
          * {									\
          filter: grayscale(100%) !important; 	\
          }									\
          *:hover {							\
          filter: none !important;			\
          }									\
        ");
      }

      if(document.getElementById('mystyle'))
        document.head.removeChild(document.getElementById('mystyle'));
      else
        myAddStyle();


4) Press Ctrl+R to run this small script while you have the original page still open in Firefox window. 
5) See that the Search Box on the page at the top-right disappears as soon as you do that. 
6) Now, start scrolling the page down. See that as you go past the beginning of the 'IN THIS ARTICLE' seciton(a div element) that disappears as well! 
7) Now in the Scratchpad window where you still have that simple code above, just press Ctrl+R again to remove this newly added CSS. See that the IN THIS ARTICLE and search box sections appear again.
8) If you use Yahoo Mail, try this example there as well. Most of the email contents disappear there. 
9) Also, it is *slow* to apply this simple CSS effect when it works, but that can have another bug of its own. 


Actual results:

Elements disappeared as a result of applying the CSS standard grayscale filter. 


Expected results:

Elements should have just turned grayscale, not disappeared.
