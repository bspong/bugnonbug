Bookmarks toolbar moved to Menu Line: bookmarks fail to layout correctly on startup
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When the Bookmarks Toolbar has been moved to the right of the Menu Bar, when starting Firefox the Bookmarks get laid out as if the window was narrower than it actually is. Maximizing and Restoring corrects the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to View-->Toolbars-->Customize, drag the Bookmarks Toolbar to the right of the menu bar (next to the "Help" menu). Click done to exit the Customize dialog.
2. Fill up the Toolbar with folders or bookmarks so it is almost full.
3. Have the Firefox window unmaximized, with a normal web browsing width. Observe the Bookmarks layout, which should be correct.
4. Restart Firefox. 
Actual Results:  
The first few bookmarks show correctly, but then a » sign shows indicating extra bookmarks exist (see attachment 1), but it shouldn't, because a lot of empty space is there that should be used to layout the bookmarks.

Expected Results:  
To see the expected results, just maximize the Firefox window, and then Restore it. The bookmarks now take up all available space, and no » is required. See attachment 2.

Speculation: it looks as though, on start up, the Bookmarks are laid out before the Firefox window is fully set up, and the width that is taken into consideration as available is narrower, for some reason.
