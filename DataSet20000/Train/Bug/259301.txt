On the FedEx ship site, after the shipment page is completed  and you click on "Continue"....nothing happens.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3

Went to IE and the shipment processed fine. What usually happens is it brings up
a box that confirms all of the shipment details and, once you have clicked
"Continue" again, it brings up the completed airbill (with barcodes) so you can
print it out and attach it to your package. You can go to FedEx.com and set up
an account without actually using it to test this. If you create a shipping
ticket, it does not actually bill unless the package is scanned into their
system. I saw another report that said something about not being able to print
the FedEx airbill but I don't know if it is the same issue since mine occured at
an earlier point in the process.
I hope you can fix this. I hate using IE and want to switch totally to Mozilla...
