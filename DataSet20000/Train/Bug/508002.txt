Using PageDown key jumps strangely when browsing. No problem when mouse is used.

When browsing the HTML document---BuildLog generated by Microsoft Visual Studio (2005), C++ ---I have used PageDown key. It seems to move by pages first. Then it jumps to some position farther than expected. After that, I cannot move down any more (the slider is shows that I am in about half of the document having a lot of "pages" before and after the position. It seems as if it was painted twice. Firstly, the expected position is displayed, but then the browser immediately jumps back and the same fragment of the document is displayed again and again. It is independent on current width and height of the window. It seems as if some pattern in the doc caused the behaviour.

I can send the HTML document if needed (about 5 KB zipped).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Focus to the browsing pane.
2. Go to the top of the document.
3. Press PageDown key repeatedly.
Actual Results:  
Stops moving at some position.

Expected Results:  
Display the next fragment of the document.

When tried PageUp, it behaved similarly when (not always) going up.
