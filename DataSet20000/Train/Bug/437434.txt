Page Down & Page Up buttons do not page up or down on web pages

Using FF3 RC 1 or 2 on any web page, if I try to use the Page Down button, the page will either not page at all or page completely down to the bottom of the page. The Page Up button will not page up either. If I left click on certain portions of the page, I may get a partial page down, but page up never works. This is the first time I've seen this action in any version. I also use FF2 2.0.0.14 & its keyboard navigation works perfectly.

I tried running FF3 in safe mode as recommended in an earlier post about a similar problem, but that did not correct the problem. Neither did upgrading to a newer version of FF3 (RC1 to 2). I'm not using any F keys either.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Surf to any web page that is longer than your screen resolution.
2.Press Page Down. 
3.If no movement, left click on the page.
4.Press Page Down.
5.If page moves, try page down again.
6.If page jumps to bottom, try Page Up.
Actual Results:  
2.Page Down will give no movement or partial page down.
3.Left clicking may allow partial paging.
5.Any page action is usually to the bottom of the page.
6.Page Up never works. The only action is for Page Up to produce a jerking action.

Expected Results:  
Page Down & Page Up should work as expected.

Using the default theme. Extensions are the same as I'm using in FF2 2.0.0.14. However, they have been updated for FF3. (Running in safe mode should make extensions a moot point.)
