Firefox CPU consumption jumps when mouse moves or scrolls
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:22.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/22.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130618035212

Steps to reproduce:

Just move the mouse on any page, even about:blank

For the scrolling issue, build up a dummy HTML page that can be scrolled far enough for the test to be relevant. You don't need to embed images, you don't need CSS or Javascript either.



Everything is described in length on Mozilla's support forum:

Actual results:

Ridiculous CPU consumption for such meaningless action.


Expected results:

Barely any increase in CPU consumption. I only have this issue in Firefox, no other program. Even an embedded Flash with focus doesn't have this issue, which probably makes WebGL less of an alternative if this isn't fixed.


- The scrolling sounds like a painting performance issue or something general that is not related to mouse.
- The movement issue seems to be partly caused by Firefox not supporting some mouse driver(s) correctly, and partly by something more general related to mouse handling.

It's from January 2013 and Firefox 18.0.1 but the issue remain the same to this day with Firefox 22.
