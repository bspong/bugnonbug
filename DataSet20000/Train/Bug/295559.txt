There is an intrusive ad-serving technology called "IntelliTXT", from the vendor
Vibrant Media.  It is explained (partially) at the URL 

http://www.vibrantmedia.com/whatisIntelliTXT.asp

and appears to be based on JavaScript. It generates popup mini-windows similar
to so-called "ToolTips" but containing advertising.  Based on Mozilla/FF's
policy of providing tools for users to control the browsing experience, and
considering that FF provides a Preferences item and implementation of popup
blocking, this is a request for user-preference-based IntelliTXT blocking. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select a web page with IntelliTXT, like (for example):
http://www.drugs.com/PDR/Ocean_Nasal_Spray.html
2. On that page, mouse over the green, double-underlined word "Sodium". 
3. A popup ad appears. 

Actual Results:  
A popup ad for some herb vendor appears. 

Expected Results:  
There should be a method, based on user preference, of suppressing the popup ad
(as popup blocking is provided in FF preferences).
