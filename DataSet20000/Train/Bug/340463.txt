Drop target area for tab-to-tab drops between Firefox windows is very small when multiple tabs are opened.

Use case: 
User opens two tabbed browser windows.  User drags multiple tabs from window number one to window number two with the intent to open the dropped tabs from window number one as new tabs in window number two (tab-to-tab drag and drop). 

Current behavior: 
When a tab bar becomes full in a target tabbed browser window, the drop target area is limited to small area above currently open tabs (only a few pixels).  Using a resolution of 1024x768 with a window spanning half the screen width, this condition is reached with only three open tabs in the target tabbed browser window.

Suggestion: 
Increasing tab-to-tab drop target area to include bottom status bar and toolbar area. i.e. dragging a tab to these areas would open the page as a new tab in the target tabbed browser window. Suggest no change in behavior of the two current tab drop targets (url box target & specific tab target).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open two tabbed-browser Firefox windows each covering half the screen width.
2.Create 5 tabs in the window on the left. Create two tabs in the right window.
3.Attempt to drag all tabs from the window on the left into the window on the right using existing drop target.
