Plugin-container.exe*32 locks Firefox browser after watching any video and pressing the "back one page" button. Have to end task on 2 instances of plugin-container to be able to continue. This has never happened before the last update. The update seems to have modified the plugin-container. I have never seen an instance of this on previous versions of Firefox running in the process in task manager. Wish i never updated.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go watch any video IE: youtube, Google, etc
2.press the back button
3.watch Firefox hang
Actual Results:  
Firefox just hangs, cant go to any open tab's, just locks up. Have to end task on plugin-container to continue normally.

Expected Results:  
Simply go back to previous page instantly as Firefox always had done before this latest update.
