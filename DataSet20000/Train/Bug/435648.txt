Hi,

I´m Flávio, I´m from Brazil and I work on Web Development.

I´m testing the new version of Firefox (3.0) and I´m very sad with a renderization problem which I thought had alread been solved in the new versions of Firefox.

When we create a web form, the field textarea has a diferent behaviour between Firefox and IE.

This problem also happens to "div tags".

When we have  longwords (like  peaces of codes), we have an overflow of this text. Firefox doesn´t force line breaks in these texts, in div tags or in textarea.

I wish you could solve this problem. It's very boring every time when we create some web applications and the behaviour is different between these two browsers.

The line breaks, in textarea or in div tags just happen when the user type enter (force line break) or type space (space bar).

It is really stressful to deal with it.

Please, try this example usign Firefox and than IE. You will understand what I mean: http://www.fatecsjc.edu.br/?cont=contato

Or, try this google search about this and see how many ocurrencies there are about this:

I have not checked the rules of web standards about it and how the web browsers have to renderize. Anyway, maybe you have a solution for it.

And congratulations on your job. Firefox it´s great.
