Local PDF files do not open correctly in FF (7.0.1)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:7.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0.1
Build ID: 20110928134238

Steps to reproduce:

I create PDF files, accessible from a webpage menu using link <HREF="subfolder/filename.pdf">.  I created a new PDF file today and tested it locally before uploading.  FAILS!  (Trying previously known good files also fails.)



Actual results:

In FF, the local PDF file opens from the link but will not decode -- it displays the actual binary characters of the PDF file rather than decoding to a proper page image.

Running exact same files in FF from my website works fine.
Running exact same files locally in all other browsers works fine.
(Running exact same files locally in FF used to work fine too.)



Expected results:

Opening a local (hard drive or CD/DVD) HTML file should allow access to PDF files also located locally.

Running Adobe X.1.1.33 add-on, Windows 7 up-to-date, FF 7.0.1, and Java 6:29.
(Reloaded Adobe and Java today, restarted, still fails.)

To recreate:
1.  Make an HTML file with link to a PDF file (href="filename.pdf").
2.  Open HTML file with FF, click link to PDF file.  ** THIS FAILS **
3.  Upload HTML and PDF files to website.
4.  Browse to website and open HTML file with FF, click link to PDF file.
