Firefox suddenly tells me it has to close & I get a message saying that Windows DEP has closed the program.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1

The example I gave is a page that is trying to load an active x control, but it also happens reliably on Blackboard when I go into anything editable.  It doesn't seem to like me to be able to enter data.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to joelrosenberg.com
2.  Click on "Joshua Fund" (in list of buttons on left side)

Actual Results:  
Firefox closes and gives me a message that says it has encountered a problem & has to close.  I also get a message in my system tray that says that Windows DEP has closed this program.

Expected Results:  
I should be able to view the page.  It works ok in IE.  It worked ok in Firefox 2.
