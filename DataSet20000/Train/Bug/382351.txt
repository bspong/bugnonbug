Bookmarks don't update until Mozilla is restarted

First of all, if I try to add a new Bookmark, when I click on OK, it just hangs, so it seems like it wasn't added. However, if I wait a few minutes and go to Organize Bookmarks (or restart Mozilla), they show up. Additionally, it doesn't save the name of the bookmark, even when you restart Mozilla (you have to go to Organize Bookmarks, click on Properties and manually change it).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on Bookmarks in menu and then Bookmark this page (or Ctrl+D)
2.Under Create In, select a folder other then the Bookmarks folder (can't reproduce it every time using default folder)
3.Click OK
Actual Results:  
Go to Organize Bookmarks or restart Mozilla, and you will see that the new bookmark with no name.

Expected Results:  
Should have the name, and you shouldn't have to restart Mozilla or go to Organize Bookmarks to view the new bookmark (should be instantaneous!!!!).

I am using the FoxyTunes add-in, but I don't think that has anything to do with this, as the problem didn't occur for previous versions of Mozilla.
