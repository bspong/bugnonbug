odd tooltips in location bar history pulldown

The pulldown history menu on the location bar doesn't usually provide tooltips.
 However, I have several URLs that *do* create tooltips - but of the URL 3 or 4
lines above.  I've attached a .JPG of a screen grab.  The cursor was actually on
the 'dshieldmovie' line - but produced a tooltip for the MetalandMagic site. 
Similarly, the 'cpuspeed' line produces a tooltip for the first people/axboe
line, and the loop-aes line gets a tooltop for the second people/axboe line. 
Interestingly enough, the tooltip isn't created just anywhere on the line - for
the dshield line, it's only if the cursor is to the right of the 'v' in
'dshieldmovie'.  For cpuspeed, the cursor has to be to the right of the spot
between the 2 consecutive 'e' in the URL. For loop-aes, the zone starts at the
spot vertically below the double-e on the line above.  

It appears that to trigger the bug, the line 3 or 4 above needs to have a URL
long enough to require truncation to display - the truncated URLs consistently
create a tooltip 3 or 4 lines below them.  Also, the long URL needs to be
displayed - positioning the list so the 'cpuspeed' is at the first line means
that none of those 3 URLs mentioned get tooltips. Scrolling it so
'metalandmagic' is the top line creates a tooltip for dshieldmovie, and as
captured all 3 truncated URLs create tooltips 3 lines lower.

Hopefully between the text and the .JPG, you can understand what I'm talking
about. ;)
