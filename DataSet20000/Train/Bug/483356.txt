runaway memory usage in both 3.0.7 and beta 3.1 beta 3
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1b3) Gecko/20090305 Firefox/3.1b3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Looking at task manager this is just as bad as 3.0.7.  All I see is more memory being eaten away in chunks.  I think if this keeps up I will switch to IE8.  This problem seemed to have started with 3.0.7.  The only way I can stop Firefox from crashing is to constantly restart it which is also a problem.  It's a shame that Mozilla has no real customer support.  I did try all of the suggestions in high memory usage but nothing seemed to work.  I have a 64 bit PC with 6 gigs of ram and need to stop this problem once and for all.  Until this problem started I could keep Firefox on 24/7 with no issues.   Firefox will eventually crash if not attended to.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just keep Firefox running 
2.  Minimize tags and problem continues
3. Task manager in Vista Ultimate starts with around 66k and builds quickly to 1,600k in a short time regardless of what is running.  Removed most add on apps as well.
Actual Results:  
Memory usage on task manager dropped back to 66k.  In the past 20 minutes memory has increased to 113K and climbing.  Runaway memory usage.  

Expected Results:  
Software on both beta 3.1 e and previously 3.0.7 should have stopped eating memory up.  I do not recall this issue in 3.0.6.  

I followed the directions in your FAQs on high memory usage doing an about:config and that did not work either.  I cleared all cache and that did not help. I thought that the beta might cure the issue but it has not. Is there a way of downloading 3.0.6 again if there is no other fix?  I am also going to try this on my test notebook with Windows 7 to see if the problem persists.  The test notebook has 2 gig with 32 bit Intel.  As I said before this bug seems to happen regardless of tabs open.  I was using the Cape Kennedy theme with the space ship at night.  I will try this with the default theme to see if that helps.
