Let's define expected behavior:

1. Click the RSS icon in the address bar
2. Get prompted to add a live bookmark
3. Default to add to bookmark toolbar
4. Get reminded to add to delicious

This workflow works in FF 2.x

In FF 3.x I see

1. Add live bookmark
2. Default folder is bookmarks menu and not bookmarks toolbar as expected
3. Delicious is not triggered. Latest delicious release is installed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add live bookmark
