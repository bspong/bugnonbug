Since accepting new version Foxfire Version 1.5.0.9, when I go to my E-mail accounts, I have to reset the cookies each time to all them and the preferences do not hold if I go from Lycos to sbcglobal and in some cases, they just cease right in the middle of use and I have to go reset them again.  I have stopped using Foxfire.

Thanks,

Actual Results:  
Try to open E-mail account and it would work, it inidicate need to set browser to accept cookies.  I set it and then have to do it again and again if I go to a different account in the same session or sometimes, it quites while I am going trhough my e-amils.

Expected Results:  
Don't expect to continually have to reset cookie preferences every time I open browser and in somecases multiple time while in the browser.  you expect preference setting to be saved.  In additon, I can not even find a save on Foxfire preferences, haven't needed one before, but not sure what was changed to cause this problem.

Fix preferences to where they save setting once they are set.
