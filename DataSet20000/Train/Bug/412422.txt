This is a copy of a bug from the adobe-bug-system:
URL: http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/ASC-3041

Steps to reproduce:
call navigateToURL or getURL and set the target to "_blank"
publish the fla file
launch a Firefox browser with the swf file you created embedded inside
select the link that will trigger the navigateToURL or getURL methods
(NOTE: I have attached a sample file for you to test)

 Actual Results:
occasionally a new Firefox browser window will open...but not always
 
 Expected Results:
 new browser window should open everytime
 
 Workaround (if any):
 workarounds have been proposed but none of them work in any browser 
-----------------------------

im posting it here, because i think its not only a adobe-problem.
all in all its getting a huge prob if everyone updates to the new flash and wants to navigate on flash-sites..

best regards, askimka
