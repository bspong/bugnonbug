Gentlemen:

Please forward this to the *proper* department:

The new 20% payout schedule is causing me to lose interest in playing those tournaments. 

It's too much of a bother to play level after level to make an additional 20 to 4o cents on the dollar; play becomes quite lose once you reach the *payout* level.  This might be great for the guys that are happy with making the 20% level, but is not condusive nor rewarding to a player that is now being penalized for good play by the usual payout being reduced in order for mediocre players to merely make enough to buy in to another tournament; which I gather is the goal, You get another rake of money that is paid out to a player that otherwise would not recoup his buyout, thererby, enabling him to buyin to yet another 20% payout Donk-a-Thon. 

The final table leaves much to be desired under the irritatingly groowing 20% payout structure. 

Pokerstars is supposed to create chapmpions and not mediocre players that are happy to merely recover a buyin so they can use it again, thus, giving Pokerstars a partial double rake.  Surely Pokerstars is not lacking players.  This action on your part will and should prove to be counter-productive in the long run.  A majority of the feedback I am getting is NEGATIVE.

Perhaps one day per week might be a better idea; or a select few hours per day of a few days per week, however, the ever expanding use of this concept is disturbing

Me and my bankroll are comtemplating looking for a new home. 


Your immediate attention to this matter will be appreciated greatly.

If you have any questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me.
