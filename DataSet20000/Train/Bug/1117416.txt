Steps to reproduce:

Attempting to visit any site that uses Shockwave Flash on firefox.


Actual results:

Once Shockwave Flash is activated the page hangs for a few seconds and the entire browser is unresponsive, followed by a message saying shockwave may be busy or is not responding, do you want to continue or close thr program. Continuing results in the browser staying frozen, while closing it crashes the plugin. i have already uninstalled adobe flash from the entire computer and reinstalled it but that did not work. Disabling hardware acceleration and protected mode also did not work. I also read a suggestion of setting the plugin container to 'ask to activate' which worked fine until shockwave flash was activated and...you guessed it. hang and crash. there were no previous updates to any addons or programs in the computer within 2 months. Problem began yesterday and i have yet found a way to fix it.


Expected results:

It should have played videos and content without instantly hanging and crashing.
