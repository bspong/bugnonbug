After my pc resumes from hibernation, while firefox was running, browsing becomes really slow. The points at which I have noticed most of the problem is at the address bar, where writing an address takes quite some time like the system is searching for something (possibly the entries to the history).
Furthermore, flash is slow on the pages and entering text in the fields and forms seems to stall a bit. Also scrolling stalls before it initiates. This is annoying a lot.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Mozilla Firefox with some tabs (pages) opened.
2. Put the system to hibernation.
3. Resume hibernation and attempt to work with firefox again.
Actual Results:  
The whole browsing experience is quite slow (both the GUI and the page browsing).

Expected Results:  
Everything should run smooth like the first time the program was opened.

When I further close and reopen firefox, then everything is back to normal and the speed seems to be OK.
