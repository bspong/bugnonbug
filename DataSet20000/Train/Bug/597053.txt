This is the stupidest bug I've seen, but is reproducable on the 2 PC's I have. I was typing a Blog entry on Blogger.com and once I reached a certain point typing any character or backspace/space crashes the whole browser. It seems dependent on the lines of text, cos I can use return above that line to move it down, and it still crashes if I type at that same point, just down a line.
I'm running Minefield on Windows 7 64 bit, didnt know if this was the right place, but couldn't find a minefield section. There's no crash entry in the Windows Log and I can't enter the Firefox one (about:crashes is invalid URL, if its been changed where does it say??).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto Blogger
2. Make new post
3. Get to certain line (For me on 2 different PCs is 4-5 paragraphs of 4-5 lines of default font and size
4. Watch it crash, when you restore (Why is there still that stupid "Well this is embarrasing"?? When you hit restore it restores fine, so how come Firefox couldn't fucking restore in the first place and not look fuckign stupid to users who are gonna be like "oh well IE doesnt do that back I go")
Actual Results:  
Crashes Browser

Expected Results:  
continued typing my entry
