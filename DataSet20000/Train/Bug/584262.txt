This problem doesn't happen every time I open my website [http://www.kessespage.com] with Firefox, but almost 1 out of every 3 times I open my website with the latest version of Firefox, some text on my webpage, especially the list of states on the left side of the page, gets super-sized. This problem was never once seen on Chrome, Internet Explorer, or Safari. I only have this problem with Firefox. Please help me fix this. I am not sure if there is a code that I have to embed in my website. Please help me with this.
