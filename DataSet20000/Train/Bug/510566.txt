get a "Cannot open clipboard" while trying to have text read from Read Please.

Today I decided to get Firefox 3.5.3, only to discover that it does not "like" my ReadPlese 2003(http://www.readplease.com/) full version! Every time I cut text from the clipboard the text is read but an error message is displayed in the background(behind all my windows and the "alert" sound is played).  The error message says " "Cannot open clipboard". I have had this error with other products(like acrobat reader) but not the previews versions of Firefox. The errors stack in the background if I don't close them and this is very annoying. 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Read Please 2003.(Pulse vestion) 
2. In Vistia you must run the program as an administrator(with UAC on) and in XP compatity mode as long as it is unregistered, I don't know if this happens in the unorganized version since I have a license for the program.  
3. Make shur you turn on "clipboard reading", I am using "ON - Clear Document Past and Play" 
4. Copy a short amount of text from Firefox, including text in the address bar, "source view" or actually text on an actually page. This sometimes does not happend usually with larger pesase of text. 
Actual Results:  
nope

Expected Results:  
An error will apear on you desktop.

No error should occur, like in previews versions of Firefox, where I can use ReadPlese with it just fine. Something has changed in the way Firefox handles the Vista clipboard PLEASE NOT: I am know to the bug reporting thing so don't get to angry with me if I filled this out wrong, also this is only a miner problem since I can go back to a previews vestion of Firefox and this is only a minor problem(besides the stacking dilog boxas). You could blame ReadPlese but y did this not happen in every other vesstioni of Firefox I have used.
