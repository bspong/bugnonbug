I am unable to send emails from my lycos email accounts when using Mozilla Firefox. It has worked fine for years, now these past two weeks, when I click on the send button, nothing happens. I cannot send/reply/forward emails in either of my Lycos accounts while using Firefox.  Would you please help me?  Oddly, it does work when I use Internet Explorer. The send action button does not work in firefox, but it does in Internet Explorer. Can you help? All the other action buttons work, except for the send one.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to compose new email
2.Fill in the info for sender and message
3.Click the send button
Actual Results:  
nothing happens.  It does not send.  However, when using Internet Explorer it works just fine.

Expected Results:  
Should have acknowledged the action button of the send button and sent my email(s)

If you need access to my email, it is the same user name and password as it is for this account. ThorAtBurghardts@lycos.com, and the password is *********
