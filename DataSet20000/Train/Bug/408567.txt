Transparent area in pattern print-previews OK, but prints as white instead of the background color.  Image is also squashed vertically.

At the top of the web page at http://www.kokudzu.com/ is a leaf pattern produced by a GIF file.  The area around the leaves is transparent in the pattern so the background yellow color shows through.  In print preview (with background pattern print enabled) the background yellow is visible through the transparent areas, which is as it should be.  When printed the leaves are squashed vertically, and the transparent areas print as white instead of yellow.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.kokudzu.com/ to view the home page.
2. Do File/Page Setup and make sure "Print Background" is checked.
3. Do File/Print Preview.  Note that area around leaves at to of page is yellow.
4. Send to printer, or print to PDF if you have it.
Actual Results:  
Examine the print and note that the area around the leaves is white, and the leaves are squashed to fit inside the border of the title area.

Expected Results:  
The print should match the print preview: Yellow around the leaves, unsquashed leaves.

The white-print problem also occurs in IE 7, so the handling of transparent areas must be a general browser problem.

I am attaching images that illustrate the problem.  The images were created from screen captures, but the problem is seen on two printers made by two manufacturers.  The problem is also seen when the print output goes to a PDF creator.

I know of no workaround.
