3.

the file is saved to disk (good) but disappears from the download window as soon as the download finishes (not good).


Expected Results:  
the download window should list the downloaded file as a successful download until the user clears the window.

I've used quite a few versions of firefox (currently 3.6.8). this bug goes back several versions. every time a new version comes out, I hope that this bug has been fixed, but no such luck.

there are 2 ways to find the downloaded file: 
- right-click on the file and select "show in finder" while the download is in progress (impossible if a small file is downloaded using a fast internet connection)
- open the download folder and locate the file manually.
