Crashes / locks up randomly while loading the yahoo site. Sometimes it loads other times it just hangs.

Since the latest release of Firefox, I have been experiencing crashes of the
browser on a daily basis. This has only occured while viewing and refreshing the
view on the http://my.yahoo.com/p/d.html site. I refresh the view often as I
have some stocks that I monitor on the yahoo site.
I think it may have to do with the various calls that the page makes. Most of
the time the page loads but at least 3 times a day the broswer locks up and I
have to force quit it.

I have also uninstalled the browser and downloaded the full install from your
site and reinstalled it. The problem is still there.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load the http://my.yahoo.com/p/d.html site
2.Refreshing the view multiple times.
3.Browser locks up

Actual Results:  
randomly, the browser will lock up and not respond.

Expected Results:  
loaded the page

no error message displays. the browser just gets locked up. I have to force quit
it and it tells me that the program has stopped responding.

I was very glad initially to have switched over to Firefox from IE, but if this
issue is not resolved I will have to go back to IE and I really do not want to
do that but being a developer I need to avoid frusteration such as a browser
locking up on me.
