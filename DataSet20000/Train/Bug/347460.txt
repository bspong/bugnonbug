Ajax content limited by browser window size

The left nav of this page calls content in Div tags via Ajax. These Div tags are displayed in a table cell (td). The height of this cell should increase relative to the length of the content in the div tags.

If the browser window is maximized, then the table adjusts correctly - the table cell sufficiently expands vertically to keep the div tag content within the confines of the table borders.

However, if the browser window is manually adjusted less than maximum sizing, the table cell will not expand to sufficiently contain the div tag content. This content will overlap the table borders (vertically at the bottom of the page).

How much the content overlaps is a dependant upon the sizing of the browser window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://www.demandforce.com/df_dental.shtml
2.Resize the FireFox browser window to be less than a maximized size. Make sure the table design can NOT fully display in the browser window.
3.Click on the Continuing Care left navigation button.
4.Scroll down to the bottom of the page.
5.The div tag content should exceed the bottom of the table borders.

Actual Results:  
The content does exceed the bottom of the table borders so the problem is reproduceable.

Expected Results:  
The table should adjust to the height of the content in the Div tag. This will retain the structure of the table so that the content is contained within the borders of the table structure.

This seems important since Ajax is being used more frequently in web development.
