When posting a comment on blogs from this site, the server returns a "invalid security code" after saying the comment was accepted. Likewise, registration in certain websites with security codes to be typed can't be completed because of the same problem.

Just after upgrading to Firefox 3.0, I tried to leave a comment on the blog at http://fabioseixas.folha.blog.uol.com.br/ and, after typing the security code, the screen switched to the "Comment accepted" screen and then immediately to an "Invalid security code" which asked for a new code to be typed. I typed the new code, and then another, and one more... Eventually, I sent the same comment 7 times before realizing it was a kind of bug. The comments did reach the blog, only Firefox kept being redirected to the error page.

A similar problem happened when trying to register on www.elegantangel.com (yep, for my daily dose of smut). The registration won't complete, presumably because the page has a security code to be typed. 

Other sites which also ask for confirmation codes work fine, though.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter http://fabioseixas.folha.blog.uol.com.br/
2. Click the comment link (Comentários) in any of the posts.
3. Leave a comment, inputting the mandatory fields Name, e-mail and City/state/country marked with an asterisk.
4. Type in the security code.
5. Watch as you're taken to a "Comment accepted" page and immediately to a "Invalid security code".
6. Alternatively, try to complete a registration in www.elegantangel.com (NSFW, but screw that, bugs are bugs in both news and porn sites).
Actual Results:  
The comments will be sent normally to the blog, only you'll be told otherwise. On the other case, you won't be able to complete the registration and so need to find porn elsewhere (like it's a hard task, anyway...).

Expected Results:  
Confirmed the comment was sent post as usual, or let me register in the site.
