MapPoint allows you to click and drag to select an area within a map which passes it to a form for data input. FireFox does not support this in version 1.5, version 1.0.6 works fine. This is a retrogade issue and very, very import to Realtors in the Wash. DC area who want to use their Macs to do their job. Apple Safari doesn't work either so FireFox 1.0.6 is literally the ONLY tool available to Washington DC Realtors who like their Macs. Please help fix this issue!!

Thanks!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://www.mris.com (or any MS MapPoint site)
2.Must log in as a Realtor
3.Select an area and it is supposed to auto-fill in the zipcode info into a DB search.

Nothing happens

Expected Results:  
Suppose to pass info into a form.

This worked as expected in version 1.0.6 of FireFox. It is ESSENTIAL, MANDATORY, A MUST HAVE for virtually *all*, EVERY Real Estate Agents in the Washington, DC area. There is no browser for a Mac that a Real Estate agent can use other than 1.0.6 of Firefox currently.
