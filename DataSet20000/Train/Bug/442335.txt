When viewing a flash file that is the whole web page and you create a new tab and the tab bar opens up. This makes the window's size change but flash does not know the window's size has changed. Flash will draw content under the window thinking the space that the tab bar took up is still there until you change the window size.

If you change the window size and fix the problem then close all the tabs and tab bar goes away, changing the window size again, flash does know about the new window size.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a flash file that fills the whole content area

2. Open a new tab to get the tab bar to open

3. Watch flash still draw content in the space that was taken up by the tab bar at the bottom of the screen.

4. Change the window size by hand

5. Close the other tabs

6. Watch flash change to the new size
Actual Results:  
Flash will think the stage is still the size of window before the tab bar opened up and draw content in the space that is not there.

Expected Results:  
The browser should tell flash that the window is smaller so flash can change size accordingly.
