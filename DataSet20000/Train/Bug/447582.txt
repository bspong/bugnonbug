Firefox refuse to start. Probably due to corrupt sessionstore.js
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

This happened on my friend's computer. The "Build Identifier" is from my computer so it shows Windows XP rather than Windows 2000.

When Firefox was started it showed the following dialog box:

Your last Firefox session closed unexpectedly. You can restore the tabs and windows from your previous session, or start a new session if you think the problem was related to a page you were viewing.
<Restore Previous Session> <Start New Session>

Regardless of what I chose it would continue to the message:

Firefox had a problem and crashed. we'll try to restore your tabs and windows when it restarts.
Unfortunately the crash reporter is unable to submit a crash report.
Details: the application did not have a crash dump file.
<OK>

I repeated several times the sequence of starting Firefox -> dialog1 -> message2 -> no Firefox.

I was able to resolve this issue by manually deleting the file sessionstore.js from:
Z:\Documents and Settings\myusername\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\15nm51n5.default\

A non expert user would be completely stuck like my friend was.

Firefox should add an option to clear previous session data and delete sessionstore.js by itself or fix such instability in other ways.
Alternatively Firefox should add other utility to its installation that will enable managing profile issues from outside of the main Firefox package.
