Firefox 3 doesn't respond to all redraw events when UltraVNC's video hook driver is installed. When restoring a minimized window, for instance, or switching tabs, you only see what was there before doing that. When restoring from minimized, you get a the window title bar and border, and whatever was already drawn in that portion of the screen before.

To force redraw, you can wipe across the browser by dragging another window around in front of it. Also interacting with parts of the interface in a way that causes redrawing does so. Hovering over a link makes them appear.  Highlighting text makes it appear, but not the spaces between lines of text.  Moving the mouse over or selecting buttons and menus causes them to appear.

This only happened after installing FF3.0.  Everything was fine in FF2.*.  Reverted back to 2.*, worked again. Only FF3 is affected, no other applications.

Disabling the video hook driver in Window's Device Manager causes FF3 to redraw itself properly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install UltraVNC making sure to enable the optional video hook driver.
2. Run Firefox 3.0, minimize it, then restore the window
3. Observe redrawing problems
Actual Results:  
Firefox fails to properly redraw itself.

Expected Results:  
Full redraw of restored window, its menus and contents.
