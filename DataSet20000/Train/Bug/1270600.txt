Chrome Parity: Allow setting newly non-default permissions in site identity panel
In Chrome, granting permissions exceptions without add-ons is easy:

1. Click the site identity block
2. Click the relevant dropdown within a list of only permissions relevant to the site
3. Click a new value ("Use default" will be assumed if your choice matches the default)
4. Click outside the panel to dismiss it

Just click the site identity block and you'll be given a list of all permissions that apply to the site.

In Firefox, because the site identity block's panel only shows permissions with non-default values, the following much more awkward workflow is required:

1. Right-click
2. Choose "View Page Info"
3. Wait 2 or 3 seconds for a new window to appear rather than 0.5 to 1 second for the panel.
4. Click "Permissions"
5. Scroll through many permissions that may or may not apply to this particular site to find the one you want to change
6. Uncheck "Use Default"
7. Click the radio button for the permission you want
8. Habitually click the button in the bottom-right corner of a dialog-like box
9. Curse loudly at accidentally triggering Firefox help AGAIN
10. Close the newly opened tab
11. Click the titlebar close button on the Page Info window

I've actually advised people to install the Self-Destructing Cookies addon, not because they need it, but because its toolbar button provides a more accessible way to manipulate functionality already in Firefox.
