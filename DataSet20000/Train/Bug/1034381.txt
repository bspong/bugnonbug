Enhance previous searches in awesomebar dropdown by removing URL
Currently in Firefox, if a user performs a search through a search engine, the search results page enters their places database.  If the user enters a matching string to that results page in the URL bar, it appears as other URLS: a title at the top and a URL string at the bottom.

However, this search result is unlike other URLs.  Navigating to an old search effectively re-performs the search rather than goes to a destination.  This is not apparent in the interface.  Worse, the awesomebar suggestion contains a great deal of unneeded and useless information, such as the very long and unreadable search query URL.

A better design would highlight only the parts of the entry relevant to users: the term, the fact that it's a search, and the search engine.  Specifying that the search is from a user's history is not necessary, since it's within awesomebar results, and could potentially be embarrassing if noted explicitly.

The proposed design simplifies a re-search in awesomebar to the minimal elements meaningful to users: an icon to indicate search, a term, and the search engine.

Acceptance criteria:

1. Favicon of previous search queries is replace with magnifying glass in URL bar
2. Instead of a URL, the blue text underneath a search term shows "[SEARCH ENGINE] Results"
