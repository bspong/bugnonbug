I can't imagine that this hasn't already been reported, but I was unable to find (in a < 5 min search) a summary bug report that matched.

Basically, the ability to increase text font size, or more generally enlarge the view of the page, is slow.  In FF2 I can hit Ctrl+Plus five or six times before a noticeable wait occurs.  In FF3, as soon as I hit Ctrl+Plus (or minus), it takes a couple of seconds before the zoom operation completes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Hit Ctrl+Plus
2. Wait longer time that should be necessary
3. Do it again, if you so desire.
Actual Results:  
The page zoom functionality is slow, taking a noticeable couple of seconds before displaying the page again.

Expected Results:  
Page zoom is *presumably* (from this lay-person's perspective) just a multiplier in a lot of places.  This should be near instantaneous.

The machine is not the problem, as this is a 2.2 GHz, Core 2 Duo, with 2 gigs ram.  Or, put another way, FF2 performs *much* faster on the same hardware.

This is an Ubuntu Hardy machine, but I've noticed the same behavior on my girlfriend's WinXP machine.
