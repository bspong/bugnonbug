offsetX and offsetY don't work as they should
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; InfoPath.2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)

I'm a web developer and since very long time I've had the same doubt, there's a function called findPosX/Y, that return the position of any element inside the page, ok, that sounds great, but doesn't work exactly well, for example, to prove this I make a div position absolute and this follow the cursor, ok, it works but when it's embedded in tables, the position change 1 pixel per every table embedded.
I tried IE7 and FireFox 3.0.7, and they both have the same mistake about offsetX/Y, except for Opera, which works properly.
This question is a mistake in both browsers.
I just want a solution, or an explanation about this. I don't know why this kind of things happen, just happen and we as developers only can continuw without an answer.
Oh and just one more thing, this question is not over the internet, I've been looking for it for a long long time.
Obviously the only solution I could give was:
if(parent.tagName.toUpperCase()=="TABLE")
{
_left=parent.offsetX+1;
}else{
_left=parent.offsetX;
}

I just want why offsetX works like this.
Thanks

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.offsetX
2.offsetY
3.ClientX, clientY
Actual Results:  
Well, offsetX/Y work like in IE7, except in Opera

Expected Results:  
the exactly position of an element

function getPos(obj)
{
	var _left=0;
	var _top=0;
	var _parent=obj;
	while(_parent)
	{
		if(_parent.tagName.toUpperCase()=="TABLE")
		{
			y+=p.offsetTop+1;
			x+=p.offsetLeft+1;
		}else{
			_left+=_parent.offsetLeft;
			_top+=_parent.offsetTop;
		}
		_parent=_parent.offsetParent;
	}
	return {left:_left, top:_top};
}
