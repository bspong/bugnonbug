I have a problem with switching tabs that for some reason, the program insists on taking the existing tab and starting a new, separate window with that tab, rather than switching to the tab

I don't know if there's some kind of options setting I have wrong, but for some reason, whenever I click onto a tab to switch from one tab to another, for reasons I don't understand, the tab I want to switch to will be taken out of the existing window and a new window with only that tab is started.  I really want to only be able to switch between the various tabs without another window being created in the process of switching.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Switch from one tab to another
2.The tab I want to switch to leaves the current session and goes into a new window all by itself
3.The new tab I wanted to switch to opens in a new window all by itself.


Expected Results:  
Switched to the tab I clicked on.

Allowed me to switch to the new tab without starting a different window.
