Keyboard input is disabled after viewing a dialog

This bug is probably related to the bug in Mozilla that disables all keyboard
input to a specific window after viewing a modal dialog from an empty browser
window, using the mozilla mail client while in an empty browser window, or
alt-tabbing between windows.

However, in firebird it affects all windows, not just empty ones.

After viewing certain modal dialogs and other windows that might appear on top
of another window, keyboard input is ignored for that window. The only solution
is to continue your session in a new window. Mouse input is not ignored,
fortunately.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any page. This one will do nicely.
2. Type in an invalid URL, such as mcdonalds://rar.mfx in the Location Bar.
3. Read the warning (optional) =P and click OK.
4. Try to type something into a form field, use ctrl-l, or even ctrl-w.
5. Swear a bit if you like.

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
Something should have happened.

I'm using the XFT build, and I remember this bug from the Mozilla XFT build,
where it's still not fixed. I can not remember experiencing the bug in the
non-XFT build.
