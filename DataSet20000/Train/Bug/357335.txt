The menu item View > Page Style > Basic Page Style is missing from the menu on some webpages

At certain webpages such as www.cnet.com, www.download.com, or http://news.com.com:
- you can choose View > Page Style > No Style which causes Firefox to ignore all CSS
- but you cannot undo your choice by the standard method of View > Page Style > Basic Page Style.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit www.cnet.com, www.download.com, or http://news.com.com (note: all three pages are run by CNet)
2. Choose View > Page Style > No Style
3. Oops! I didn't want No Style since the page looks so ugly with CSS disabled.
4. Try to go back to Basic Page Style

Actual Results:  
There is no View > Page Style > No Style menu option so now you are stuck on the ugly No Style option.

Expected Results:  
You should be able to choose View > Page Style > No Style.

Workaround: Go to a webpage that is unaffected by the bug such as www.google.com, then choose Basic Page Style, then click the Forward button.
