since recent update- when I click back the browser freezes and the only way to fix it is to go to task manager and end program.

I tried leaving it to see if it would sort itself out and after an hour it was still frozen. On October 28 it was happening every 4 or 5 times I clicked "back". I restarted the computer and now it is taking longer, but has still happened 4 times today. When I go to the task manager it always shows 2 copies of the window I was on when it froze. It has happened on the above website and many others- it doesn't seem to have anything to do with which site I am on. It has also happened a couple of times when I scrolled. I have tried to find a pattern to this and I can't see one. Just the back button and just since the update was installed. 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.brows around a lot, check your web based email or don't.
2.click back button
3.fire fox freezes (blue and white flag replaces fire fox logo) 

Actual Results:  
It doesn't happen on command- but it does happen consistently. at least 20 times in 3 days.

Expected Results:  
back is back- when you click back it should go if there is somewhere to go.
