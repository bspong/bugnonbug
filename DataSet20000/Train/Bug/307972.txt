so first I want to be serious if you have a site with too many frames (in my
case 5 of them, which contain tables and stylesheets) and if that site will
reload every five seconds or so .. mozilla/firefox will crash..

second part.
that's a serious reason why I don't like mozilla and the community just gives a
shit about it! .. that debugging (callback mechanism) is just a joke in my
eyes.. why don't you guys _just_ distribute mozilla with symbols and tell people
to enable coredumps?!?!!!
I tried to write a plugin a year ago for mozila back then only a few examples
worked the rest was like .. am I an alien and should I understand that insane
non-working piece of code?!

third part.
why don't close the ongoing mozilla development and just fix up these damn bugs?
I'm able to crash ff within a few hours, also why don't you tell plugin writers
to not constantly use devices like /dev/mixer (mozilla/ff has to get killed to
be able to unload the drivers sometimes)!! it really sucks...

fourth part:
please >> fix up these damn bugs that ff doesn't crash everytime (while
monitoring a site that reloads 5 frames within 5 seconds.. as I already wrote
and - or - make a sane description how to report errors) <<


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
create a site with a few frames (which include stylesheets, and tables) that
reloads all 5 seconds
