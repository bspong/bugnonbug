Firefox gets stuck in endless(?) loop of XUL_GetFileFromPath on AJAX-heavy page

Hello,
the above URL (pw protected but I can provide a copy) contains a web project with lots of JS and AJAX elements that are drag&drop enabled like this:

<span id="zuser_1977" class="zuser country_5" title="[PAR] McDonald, Sarah; 0; Kanada">1977<span class="zuser_age">0j</span>
</span>
<script type="text/javascript">
//<![CDATA[
new Draggable("zuser_1977", {revert:false})
//]]>
</script>

This is code using the Scriptaculous/Prototype JS Framework.

Problem: Firefox loads the page and after finishing loading, suddenly spikes CPU usage up to 100% and freezes (OS X shows the spinning beachball).

The more of the above fragments I use, the longer the freeze time. With several hundred fragments I had to wait for ten minutes.

I will attach the HTML code in question, and a backtrace, shortly.

Safari 3.1 on the same machine, using WebKit, also spikes CPU load after loading but only for a split second, even if there are thousand such fragments on the page.

This might be related to Bug #434513 which also reports XUL_GetFileFromPath high load because the function was (ab)used by a plugin (AFAIunderstand). But it's not the same problem.


Reproducible: Always
