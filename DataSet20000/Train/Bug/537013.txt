The find bar should exist on a per-tab basis
When I switch tabs, I don't want the find bar to follow me. When you try to find something you are doing it on the current page. Different tabs usually represent different activities. Same goes for different windows.

Here's a quick summary of how I think it should work:

* Open a new tab - no find bar
* Switch tabs (after activating find bar) - no find bar in other tab (unless it was open there too)
* Switching tabs - the find bar should remember what I searched for in that tab (not be global per window)
* Activating find bar - prefilled with what I last searched for (in last active find bar), maybe do search right away...
* Reactivating find bar - remember what I searched for before in that tab
* Open a new window - no find bar

I know the new windows problem has to do with persisting attributes/toolbars, but if the find bar is per tab, that becomes easy to deal with.

This would help with our lingering "too much chrome" issue. I often find myself wondering why I see less web page and realize I left the find bar open 20 minutes ago in a different tab.

FWIW, how some other browsers handle it:
Safari/Chrome (I guess it's part of Webkit?): Shown per tab, remembers search across all though (so editing one edits them all)
Opera: No bar, not something to look at
IE: Unknown
