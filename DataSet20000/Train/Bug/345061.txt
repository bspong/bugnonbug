All other “credit card web page statements” can be drag copied correctly (using Firefox) into a spreadsheets. Drag copies from the DiscoverCard page place data incorrectly in cells of spreadsheet. (Safari does the same thing, Microsoft IE v5.2 Macintosh places the data in the correct spreadsheet cells).

Can this be fixed in Firefox? I’m ready to contribute to the cause. I love Firefox. Please help. I’ll send money.

Thank you,

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log on to secure "Discover Card" web page
2.Drag copy credit card statement data
3.Paste into a spreadsheet.


Actual Results:  
1.Data is not usable, incorrectly placed in spreadsheet cells

Expected Results:  
1. Data should be placed in correct spreadsheet cells, like data from other credit card web pages.
2. If I use Microsoft IE v5.2 Macintosh, it will place the "Discover Card" statement data in the correct spreadsheet cells.

As you can see there is no "crash" just makes Foxfire unusable for gathering web data at certin sites like "Discover Card."
