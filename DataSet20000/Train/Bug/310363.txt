This bug occurs with a fairly common HTML structure - a floated DIV that
contains an image and some center-justified caption text.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the attached example.  Notice that the left caption text is
left-aligned, while the right caption text is centered below the image.
2. Reload the page.  Notice that both captions are now centered
3. Ctrl-reload the page.  Notice that the alignment reverts back to the state
described in step 1.




Expected Results:  
If you look at the HTML, you'll see that both captions should be centered below
the image.

I believe this problem is caused by the layout engine not recognizing that the
width of the floated element needs to change once the width of the image is
known.  When the page first loads - before the image has been fetched - the
caption text is layed out according to the derived width of the div (which is
just the width of the caption text.)  However, once the image loads, the DIV
width changes, but the caption text position/width is not adjusted accordingly.

When the page is loaded a 2nd time, the image is cached and so the browser
correctly lays out the caption correctly.

A possible workaround for this is illustrated in the HTML that renders the
right-hand DIV: Just explicitely set the width of the IMG.
