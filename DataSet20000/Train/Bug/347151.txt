bookmarks moved by drag and drop is temporary lost (disappears)
Steps to reproduce:
 1. create a bookmark B and a folder A with a sub-folder S in the root of the "Bookmarks Menu"
 2. launch the Places window (Bookmarks->Organize Bookmarks)
 3. select the "Bookmarks Menu" on the left pane
 4. drag & drop the B (on the right pane) into the folder A
 5. (optional) drag & drop B back to the root then repeat 4.


Actual result: 
 The bookmark is lost (but comes back after a restart of Firefox) with:

 * in Console², official build :

Error: Component returned failure code: 0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE) [nsINavBookmarksService.insertItem]
Source file: chrome://browser/content/places/controller.js
Line: 2423

 * in JS Console, home compiled debug build:

Error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE) [nsINavBookmarksService.insertItem]"  nsresult: "0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/places/controller.js :: PMIT_doTransaction :: line 2423"  data: no]
Source File: chrome://browser/content/places/controller.js
Line: 2423
and after Firefox restart, clicking the bookmarks gives:
###!!! ASSERTION: Bookmark hash table out-of-sync with the database: 'realBookmarked == *aBookmarked', file f:/sources/mozilla/mozilla/toolkit/components/places/src/nsNavBookmarks.cpp, line 1872 (will attach stack)


Expected result:
 The bookmark is moved into the folder and doesn't disappear.
