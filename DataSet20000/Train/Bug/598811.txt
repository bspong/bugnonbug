Hotmail locks up while accessing email (similar to bug #551123). unresponsive script. (not responding) in title bar
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.10) Gecko/20100914 Firefox/3.6.10
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.10) Gecko/20100914 Firefox/3.6.10

Typically I access Hotmail from www.msn.com, after signing in usually my inbox shows correctly but when I start reading and replying to emails, it seems to happen most frequently with a reply, Firefox locks up and "(not responding)" is
displayed in the upper title bar....the mouse indicator shows as busy and it just sits there, back does nothing, if I "X" out  to close it I get the popup dialog box asking (I think from windows 7) if I want to close the program or continue to wait, the only that works is to close, if I re-launch Firefox is does it again...

this never used to happen on this computer before some of  the recent Firefox updates, not sure exactly when it started, if I go to my windows 2000 computer the Hotmail account works fine, if I use Internet Explorer on the Windows 7 computer (where I see the issue) it works fine too....seems like a bug introduced by recent updates to Firefox when running on windows 7.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.login to Hotmail
2.open an email from inbox
3.click REPLY
Actual Results:  
the reply screen is displayed and if I click in the reply text area to write a reply, it immediately goes to "not responding" and the mouse shows "busy"

Expected Results:  
Firefox should allow me to write a reply, send it and continue using the browser.

Once this occurs, nothing else can be done in Firefox....until it is closed and re-launched

 if I avoid this situation I have not had these symptoms occur with
other websites....it used to work just fine on this computer running 
Windows 7 until sometime recently but not sure exactly when it began
since I do not always use this computer to access my email and the first few
times it occurred I assumed it was an internet or hotmail server issue
