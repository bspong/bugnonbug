On Craigslist.org page when one selects a category (i.e. under jobs  select Biotech/Science) the history remembers you selected this by changing the font color from Blue (=unselected) to purple(=selected previously). When I try to clear history using the "clear browsing history" it will not turn the craigslist selections back to the unselected state. The only way I can get this back to the unselected state is to uncheck the "save my history for at least" option on the preference page. If I recheck it, the selected items on Craigslist return. I even left the save history unselected for four days and then re checked the box for "save my history for the last 3 days" and still it shows all the catagories I selected on Craigslist in the past. The "remember what I enter in forms and the searchbar" has no effect on this checked or unchecked. Note: I run the extension "Session Saver" with Firefox 3.0.6 and clearing this as well as browsing history, cache, offline website data. autheticated sessions has no effect on deselecting the previously selected Craigslist items.

Reproducible: Always
