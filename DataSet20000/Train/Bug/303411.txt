I have had this problem since upgrading to Firefox 1.0.6, but only on Windows
2000. The version I have running on Windows XP is working properly. At numerous
website (www.redwingshoe.com, www.acehardware.com, www.gaiam.com, and sometimes
at www.rei.com) the graphics showing products do not load with the text part of
the webpage. Main page graphics do load; it's just the product photos that don't
show up. I did not have this problem before "upgrading" from the previous
version of Firefox and do not see it on the XP platform.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to any of the websites above (except REI, which is inconsistent, but won't
properly load the left hand menu bar colors)
2.Do a search for some type of product that will give multiple hits (ex: "fans"
at www.acehardware.com)
3.Preview images do not appear with search results

Actual Results:  
Search results appeared without pictures.

Expected Results:  
It should have loaded the photos.
