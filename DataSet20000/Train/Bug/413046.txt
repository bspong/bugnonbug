ThinkVantage Password Manager v3.00.0006.00 plugin crashes Firefox when opening pop-up windows
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; sv-SE; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11

Seems that the latest version that Lenovo has pushed out of the ThinkVantage Password Manager v3.00.0006.00 (part of ThinkVantage Client Security Solution) crashes Firefox when the add-on is enabled and when trying to open a url or link that opens a pop-up window. Running in safe-mode or disabling the add-on gets ride of the bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable the ThinkVantage Password Manager v3.00.0006.00
2. Click on a link that opens a pop-up window.
Actual Results:  
Mozilla crashes.

Expected Results:  
To open up and view the pop-up window.

It doesn't matter what kind of pop-up window that I tried, what ever crashes. Just to make sure; following page, http://www.haverblad.se , has following pop-up, http://www.haverblad.se/cgi-bin/refer/tell.cgi , function in the upper right corner and it crashes big time every time that I've tried enabling the ThinkVantage Password Manager.
