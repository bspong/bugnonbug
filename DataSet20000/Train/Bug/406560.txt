Cookie blocking doesn't appear to be working; started with upgrade to version 2.0.0.10

Had the website www.startribune.com in my blocked cookie list, and the blocking was working fine. When Firefox upgraded itself from 2.0.0.9 to 2.0.0.10, the blocking no longer worked, even though the site was still in the blocked list. I tried deleting all the entries in the list and reentering them (and restarting Firefox), but the site was still allowed to save cookies. 2.0.0.11 didn't fix this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Enter www.startribune.com into the blocked cookie list (Tools > Options > Privacy > Exceptions)
2.  Make sure the Allow Cookies from sites option is checked
3.  Go to the website
4.  Now view the cookies (Tools > Options > Privacy > Show Cookies).  A cookie from www.startribune.com will be listed.
Actual Results:  
The cookie from the site was accepted and saved

Expected Results:  
The cookie from the site should not be accepted and saved

This started happening immediately after Firefox was upgraded from 2.0.0.9 to 2.0.0.10.  2.0.0.11 didn't fix the issue.
