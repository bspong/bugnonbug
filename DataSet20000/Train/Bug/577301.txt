The url and google bars are not visible, the toolbar buttons have been reset, repeat three times and are stacked to the right of the window. It also seems that the tab buttons overlap the quick-links that are usually between the toolbar and view window. Clicking on any of the toolbar buttons (home, refresh ect) opens the bookmarks menu.
All other preferences and settings (bookmarks, saved passwords, homepage) are fine. Firefox operates as normal, no problems navigating within the websites, but websites must now be accessed via bookmarks. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox

Actual Results:  
Firefox opens as I described. Restarting of firefox and computer has no effect. Clicking on toolbar buttons opens bookmarks menu.

Expected Results:  
Should have opened as a normal firefox browser, with toolbar buttons taking me to home, refreshing pages or going back/forwards and so on. URL and Google bar should be visible
