Firefox fails to pass RSS feed url to external application citing failure code 0x80570016 returned in FeedConverter.js

I use the feed reader 'liferea', which has a secondary binary 'liferea-add-feed' which accepts a feed URL from STDIN and adds it to liferea. Setting liferea-add-feed as the helper application for feeds and clicking the 'Subscribe Now' button results in nothing visibly happening. The script works fine from the command line and in other scenarios and the Error Console output leads me to believe that this is a Firefox issue. The same Error Console output is received whenever an external application is selected for use with feeds.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to an RSS feed
2. Change 'Subscribe to this feed using...' to 'liferea-add-feed', or anything else from the 'Choose Application...' menu (whether the file exists or not)
3. Click 'subscribe now'
Actual Results:  
Nothing obvious happens and the following is output in the Error Console:

Error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80570016 (NS_ERROR_XPC_GS_RETURNED_FAILURE) [nsIJSCID.getService]"  nsresult: "0x80570016 (NS_ERROR_XPC_GS_RETURNED_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: file:///home/jw/install/firefox/components/FeedConverter.js :: FRS_addToClientReader :: line 415"  data: no]
Source File: file:///home/jw/install/firefox/components/FeedConverter.js
Line: 415

Expected Results:  
The URL to be passed to the selected helper application for it to do with as it will.

This occurs using both the x86 release of 3.0.6 and a downloaded-specifically-to-test-version of the x86_64 release of 3.0.7 on my machine.
