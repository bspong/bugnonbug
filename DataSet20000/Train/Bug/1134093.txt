Text input breaks down under load
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux i686; rv:35.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/35.0

Steps to reproduce:

Visited  http://webspace.ship.edu/msrenault/GeoGebraCalculus/derivative_intuitive_chain_rule.html and, after letting the interactive simulation run for awhile (more than one minute) attempted to type into the place where you enter websites or search... I forget what it's called. In this particular test case, I held down the q key for awhile until text input became irregular. I then typed the english lower-case alphabet: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz (those are the keys I pressed, and I made certain I had pressed all of them).

 System specs: 

Laptop model: Dell Latitude D630
Processor: Core 2 Duo
RAM: 2GB DDR2
OS: Lubuntu 14.10 32-bit
Firefox: 35.0.1 32-bit


Actual results:

The following text was entered into the box:
abcdefqjklmnopqtuvwxyz
Similar tests (not documented) suggest that a string is cycled through with each key press. For example, in this case, the pattern of text entered was {q, null, null, keyIDx7} where null causes nothing to be entered, q causes q to be entered, and keyID causes the key that was pressed to be entered. What happens when a key is pressed appears to cycle through this string. Issue persists in all text fields in firefox until restart (issue is NOT present in other applications in the meantime).


Expected results:

The following text:
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

should have appeared.
