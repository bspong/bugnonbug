Organize Bookmarks - adding folders doesn't work, functions add/delete/replace folder don't work every time, new created folder doesn't appear in bookmarks through the menu, etc., etc...

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Organize bookmarks and open library window.
2. Click once on "bookmarks toolbar" - add a new folder/try to replace it, delete it, add the address in it, etc...
3. Go to bookmarks toolbar folder through the menu "bookmarks" and check how they behave (endless levels of folders in folders...)
Actual Results:  
When you add a new folder to the "bookmarks toolbar folder" through library window, it places it in a very anarchic way, and often in double. When you check them via "bookmarks" menu, in this two tween files are other three empty files with the same name, and in them tree others, etc, etc... the endless levels of them !! o_Ô It is impossible to move or delete this files or to place an url address in them. If you close the library window, they do not appear in a bookmarks menu, but if you try to create again the same new folder in a library window, they appear in couple of places in double... and with multiple levels o_O

Expected Results:  
You can create new folders via library window in the "bookmarks toolbar folder" for example... organize them: remove, delete, add the files in them, etc...
