Plugins (e.g. Yoono) can read content of secure (https) pages and send them to unsecure server

I recently installed Yoono plugin and found to my supprise that I received suggested sites even when navigating secure https sites -- this suggest that the plugin is able to gain access to the information on the encypted page (undoubtly because it is un-encypted when in the DOM) -- however worse it that since Yoono works bases on coorelating page content it suggest that Yoono is able to gain access to some or all of the content, which subsequently is sent (un-unencrypted?) to the Yoono site and store potentially private data which were for my-eyes-only.

Where Yoono does implement proper security or not is besides the point -- the issue here is that someone can write a less-than-secure plugin which effectively works as spyware in disguise of some useful functionality.

Suggest that users should be forced to speciffically set permission for a plugin to read data obtained as encrypted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Yoono
2. Goto a relative popular https site 
3. observe suggestions
Actual Results:  
See suggestions in Yoono panel

Expected Results:  
Yoono should not be able to see the content of the https site and should not be able to provide any meaningfull suggestions unless provided explicit permission to see the content of https sites.
