Current design of the Add bookmark dialog is bad in practice

There are situations in which the dialog performs the disappearing act that show that the design is poorly thought out.

I pressed Ctrl+d, and the dialog opened. I needed to look at something at another window before I could complete editing the new bookmark's fields, so I switched to the other window. And when I returned to complete the bookmarking process, I didn't find the dialog. Because I was involved (as an angry user) in the design process, I was able to quickly realize what happened -- the damn dialog decided I was done with it. But I wasn't! So, I had to launch the Library, find the bookmark and modify it there. This is inconvenient. If were an unsuspecting, normal user, I would've thought that the browser is broken.

Whether the user knows what the new behavior should be or not, the behavior should return to that of a normal modal dialog because the current behavior is inconvenient in some situations (e.g. what I described) and without a significant benefit in all others.

The bookmarking process in Firefox 3 is more difficult to work with than in previous versions.
