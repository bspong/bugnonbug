Gdk-CRITICAL - gdk_x11_xatom_to_atom_for_display: assertion `xatom != None' failed

The error is in the summary. This bug has been misreported several other places.  It seems to only be present in recent versions of Firefox/Gtk (circa June-Aug 2009?).  The error may contribute to later problems (the Gdk "XID collision" and/or Gdk "Window unexpectedly destroyed" problems -- which still seem to exist).  But it is possible to generate this error (URLs provided) and to switch back and forth between tabs and/or windows without crashing the browser.  The error appears when you switch back to a tab on a URL which exhibits the problem and the page is redrawn. Stack trace(s) of the call to g_logv() will be attached.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Build a recent version of Firefox (3.0.12pre from CVS in circa 090714).
2. Restart Firefox restoring a relatively large number of tabs.
3. Restore/visit the URLs which generate the error.
Actual Results:  
Gdk error appears on the Firefox "console".

Expected Results:  
Firefox should *not* generate Gdk/Gtk/Glib errors.

I have listed the bug as major severity because these bugs were noticed before a sequence of XID collisions followed by Window unexpectedly destroyed Gdk errors which did result in the termination of the Firefox session.  Because Glib error reporting doesn't timestamp the errors it isn't clear whether or not they are connected but other bug reports of this problem seem to suggest that they may be.
