Images (no discernible pattern) not appearing after refreshing a page with F5.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.13) Gecko/2009073022 Firefox/3.0.13 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

In the URL provided, after refreshing the page with F5, the "Forum" nav image button doesn't appear. This is occurring in Firefox 3.0.13. I've noticed this happening in other sites, and there seems to be no discernible pattern to this occurrence, other than that it appears to be occurring with images within an anchor tag. If the page's cache is cleared and then refreshed with CTRL + F5, the page renders fine again.

I also noticed if the ALT attribute is present for the image tag, the alt text displays, and if you hover over the alt text, the image will appear again. If the ALT attribute is not present, there is nothing to hover over, so the only way to get the image to reappear is to clear the browser cache and refresh.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load any page (example: http://www.cad-comic.com)
2. Once the page has finished loading, refresh the page (F5).
3.
Actual Results:  
The "Forum" image disappears from the navigation menu.

Expected Results:  
Load all of the images for the page.

I've asked a couple of people to try to recreate this bug, and they've all been able to make it happen in version 3.0.13.
