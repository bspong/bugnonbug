I tried the default reset in Comment 2.  Didn't work to get buttons back.  I tried to create a new profile, but when I type firefox.exe - profilemanager into run and hit enter, it opens a new window but goes nowhere.  Same thing happens when I click a link in an email - it opens a new window but goes nowhere.

Reproducible: Always
