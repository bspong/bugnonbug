Random crashes, mainly when 20+ tabs opened, also while loading (and showing) images

The FF seems to be less and less stable when more and more tabs are opened concurrently. Crashes seems to be taking place more often when approx 20+ tabs are opened concurrently.

Also, cashes seem to happen quite often with lots of graphics (various types of web page images on various tabs) are opened.

Moreover, crashes are quite frequent when changing a tab while FF is loading tabs just after the start.

All of the above might indicate some general issues with memory allocation and/or memory issues when processing loads of images in memory.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open 20+ tabs in FF
2. Open gradually even more tabs and just continue using browser as usual.
3. Somewhere along the way, the FF will crash (most probably).
Actual Results:  
Sometimes it crashes, sometimes it does not :)

Expected Results:  
Well - it should not be crashing, right? :)

No themes used.
Standard OS/2 plugins used:
OS/2 Kit for Java Plug-in 1.4.2_09 for Mozilla
Shockwave Flash 5.0 r67

Please note: FF keeps crashing even without any plug-ins installed.
