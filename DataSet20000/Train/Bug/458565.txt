The location bar encodes certain special characters (which are displayed unencoded), and should be part of them.

Parentheses in URLs often confuse automatic hyperlinkers and lightweight markup languages. Many "smart" linkers will automatically ignore a closing parenthesis on the end of a detected URL, and some languages, like Markdown, even use them as part of their hyperlinking syntax. Meanwhile, Wikipedia has popularized addresses containing parentheses, and many browsers copy those parentheses unencoded when you highlight the URL in the location bar and copy it.
The combination of these factors can be seen somewhat regularly on forums and blogs, pointing to invalid links like "Firefox (disambiguation", leaving the closing parenthesis outside of the linked address.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a website URL containing parenthesis.
Example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_(disambiguation)
2. Highlight the URL in the location bar, and copy it.
3. Paste it on a text field.
Actual Results:  
The parentheses are copied unencoded:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_(disambiguation)

Expected Results:  
The parentheses should be encoded to play nicely with lightweight markups:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_%28disambiguation%29

(while still being *displayed* as parentheses)
