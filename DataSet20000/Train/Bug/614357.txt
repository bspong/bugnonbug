Using dual monitor causes network settings vanishes
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.12) Gecko/20101026 Firefox/3.6.12 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I have a dell studio xps 16 (x64 - an up to date vista home premium). And Firefox 3.6.12. I have set a socks5 proxy for Firefox. I turned on my second monitor and started to work. I moved some tabs to the second monitor by dragging them and then maximized the Firefox in second monitor. DISASTER: Firefox in second monitor does not use my network settings! It is a disaster because in "some" places in our world some parts of internet is blocked from inside and outside and a secure connection may worth a human life.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox with a network connection setting set on using a socks5 proxy.
2.Drag some tabs to your second monitor and place them within one packed page.
3.Firefox in second monitor does not use your network settings.


Expected Results:  
Firefox must use a network setting globally along within all running instances AND these settings must be global even if it has been set after running some instances. (Sorry) Something like internet explorer connection setting.
