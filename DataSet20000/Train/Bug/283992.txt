keyword search for exactly one word with non-ASCII characters (umlauts and accentuated characters) doesn't work due to punycode-conversion

searching for single words from the location bar does not work when they contain
umlauts (äöüÄÖÜ) or accentuated characters (I only tried a few but none of them
worked) because they are converted to punycode.
There is no problem in searching for words containing these characters if there
is more than one word that is searched for (e.g. type "à bientôt" in the
location bar) or if the keyword-search is evoked directly by typing
"keyword:Fahrvergnügen".

It seems that whenever the content typed into the location bar might be a domain
(that is doesn't contain any space characters) it is punycode-converted looked
up in the DNS. When the DNS-lookup for this fails, keyword search is invoked.
The problem is, that keyword-search should always search for what the user has
entered into the location bar, not only when more than one word was entered.
Punycode-conversion is wrong, because there are no security-concerns that users
are spoofed into doing "unsafe" searches :o)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. type "Fahrvergnügen" into the location bar and hit enter



Actual Results:  
The location bar displays "keyword:xn--fahrvergngen-llb" and the page configured
to show up for this keyword-search is loaded (for me this is google). The
results are useless, because I didn't want to search for xn--fahrvergngen-llb
and what I looked for is not displayed.

Expected Results:  
The keyword-search should show results for "Fahrvergnügen" and the location bar
should display "keyword:Fahrvergnügen".

This bug is a regression from Firefox 1.0.
