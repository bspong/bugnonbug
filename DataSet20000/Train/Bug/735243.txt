On HTML5 videos if the Highlighter is opened while on normal mode and full screen  mode is entered, after exiting full screen (by pressing on Esc key) the highlighter is not preserved. Also if the Highlighter is opened in Full screen mode, pressing Esc key does not only exits the Highlighter but also full screen.

Reproducible: always

1. Navigate to: http://videos.mozilla.org/firefox4beta/Firefox_4_beta.theora.ogv
2. Right click on the video and from the context menu select Inspect Element.
3. Enter Full Screen mode
3. Exit Full Screen by pressing Esc key
