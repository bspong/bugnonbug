Help: I have a popups always blocked problem. For the last two weeks, I haven’t been successful in finding any help on this problem.  Running WinXP Sp3 with all the latest updates, the latest FireFox v3.07, no toolbars that block popups (that I can detect).  In FF, java and javascript are both allowed. Cookies are allowed. Popup windows do not open in FF (they function properly in IE7).  Even for sites where popups have been profiled as allowed under options, popups seem to be blocked.  I run multi-popup test from www.popuptest.com and test stops on /popup4.html and goes no further.  I run multi-popup test #2 from www.popuptest.com and test stops on /popup2.html and goes no further.  This occurs whether popup blocking is turned on or off.  Popuptest.com is in the list of allowed sites.   Popups are ALWAYS being blocked from my own websites that I’ve developed using javascript.   Anybody out there have a clue as to what’s going on?  I need popups allowed for many sites. Even if I shutdown and restart FF, it still behaves as though all popups are blocked.  What’s doing this?    

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn off popup blocking or add url to whitelist
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
popups still blocked for websites

Expected Results:  
I expected that by either whitelisting a website or turning off popup blocking, that popups would appear.

Should have allowed popups
