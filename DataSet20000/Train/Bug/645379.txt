If Downloads window is open before download, FF highlights Taskbar button and holds Taskbar open

Downloads options have multiple errors now. I'll list them separately.

I have the windows Taskbar configured to Autohide, docked to the top of the window.

IF the Downloads window is left open before download, after a file finishes downloading, focus is transferred to the highlighted Downloads button on it. This causes the Taskbar to "unhide" and drop down and stay down until the  Downloads button is clicked.

This happens whether or not [ ] "Show the Downloads window when downloading a file" is selected and even if [x] "Close it when all downloads are finished" is selected.





Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set windows taskbar to Autohide
2. Open FF Downloads window
3. Download a file
Actual Results:  
After the download finishes, the Windows Taskbar drops down, the Downloads button flashes a few times then stays highlighted. The taskbar fails to autohide. It stays down, covering the top of my working window until I click on the highlighted Downloads button, which then allows the Taskbar to hide itself again

Expected Results:  
Focus should not be transferred to the Taskbar Downloads button after a download.



I tested this with this selected or not:
 1 [ ] Show the Downloads window when downloading a file is selected

 2 [x] Show the Downloads window when downloading a file is selected
     [ ] Close it when all downloads are finished is selected.

 3 [x] Show the Downloads window when downloading a file is selected
     [x] Close it when all downloads are finished is selected.

If the Downloads window is not opened beforehand, then all 3 of the above options work as expected.

The problem seems to be having the Downloads window already opened before a download.
