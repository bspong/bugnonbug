Raise or lower windows setting is broken (or reversed)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/535.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/13.0.782.112 Safari/535.1

Steps to reproduce:

In Tools->Options->Enable Javascript->Advanced:

Raise or lower windows is unchecked by default.

I created a pop-up window and a link with this javascript function:
function pop_under() { window.blur(); window.opener.focus(); }


Actual results:

When the user clicks on the "pop_under" link, the pop-up window should lower, but it stays on top.


Expected results:

It should have brought the opener window into focus and lowered the pop-up window. The only way to make this happen is to check the raise or lower windows option.

However, this text is directly from the help file: 
Advanced JavaScript Settings
       Raise or lower windows: Uncheck this option to make sure scripts cannot raise (bring to the front) or lower (send to the back) windows. 

Which means the original intention is let only the advanced users to check this option to prevent pop-unders. There is a mismatch between the help file description and the actual behaviour of that option.

This problem does not exist in other browsers. 

Because the user initiated pop-up is enabled by default so the user initiated pop-under should also be enabled by default.

I would like the installation default to change or the patch to change so that the user initiated pop-under can work.
