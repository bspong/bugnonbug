I have been experiencing problems with videos on firefox on different websites including youtube and the site I linked. The video and audio goes all choppy and my CPU goes to 100%. This has been happening since this morning when my firefox automatically updated. In the beginning it was just some minor errors but it's gotten worse to the point that I can't watch any on firefox. Sometimes the video is still for over 1 minute while the audio is still on. I have tried the sites with different browsers. I don't get this problems with any different browser with any video or site at all.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go onto a site with videos such as youtube or http://www.narutowire.com/Bleach-Episode-236/watch/0f43e7595cd4750f3a51/
2.click any video
Actual Results:  
My video and audio got all choppy and my CPU went to 100%.

Expected Results:  
It should have played the video normal and without the CPU suddenly peaking to 100%
