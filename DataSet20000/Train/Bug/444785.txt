Unable to click and/or select anything on the website after clicking on aything of the action bar (I mean the back/forward/refresh/the search field etc). This also happens the other way, after clicking on the website, you just cant select anything (the pointer doesnt react (turn into a ''hand'') when placed over icons or links where it normally would show the possibility of interaction. It can't be a mouse issue because with internet explorer this doesnt ocurr. The only way to work is: after EVERY click, I have to minimize and maximize the window, then click the next thing ... etc. Please help needed, I desinstalled and reinstalled firefox 3 times!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open mozilla
2.Search a site, press enter
3.Try to clic the site, u won't be able to, u will have to minimize and maximize, then when u click anything on the site, it will obey, but now u won't be able to clic on the action bar, and will have to mini/maxi again
Actual Results:  
u cant clic on anything where u should be able to interact, the mouse pointer doesn't even turn into a ''hand'' 

Expected Results:  
Detect the interaction
