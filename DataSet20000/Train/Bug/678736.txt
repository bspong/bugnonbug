Steps to reproduce:

clearing my history stopped clearing my forms fill-in history even though the opction to clear forms history is checked


Actual results:

my forms history was never cleared no matter how many time I tried, even if I restarted firefox (5.0)


Expected results:

when I click on stuff on a web page that I've entered info into in the past, i should not see everything I put into that form in a drop down list when I click there after clearing my forms history. It used to work in 5.0 but at some point apparently stopped working. So I've installed 5.01 (twice) to fix that (which it has, for now) and my save password function not working. 5.01 offered to save a total of one password and then not another one anywhere. so I uninstalled and reinstalled i, clearing all preferences). So far it has offered to remember two passwords, but now doesn't offer to remember changed passwords! In fact none of this password crap works reliably in any browser (I have FF, IE and Opera). One decent browser could fix this by making the feature all manual in a prominent location so we can call on it whenever we want it instead of it popping up or not whenever the hell it feels like it. It is called common sense, get some. if something isn't working, don't keep doing the same thing over and over! It's not going to work a 4th time if it didn't the other 3! so try something different, use you heads for something other than a hatrack. This password issue has been happening for forever so  it is obvious that the programmers keep trying to fix it the same way. That is called being a mindless automaton. we have the ability as humans to think and do differently when something doesn't work. So for chripes sakes, how about acting human for a change and quit doing the same stupid shit over and over and do something different fro a change!
