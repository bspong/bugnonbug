100% CPU for c. 40 secs even in safe mode on sites with Javascript and adverts
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011913 Firefox/3.0.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011913 Firefox/3.0.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

This doesn't happen on every machine but is very consistent where it does occur and is bad enough to prevent use of Firefox. Internet Explorer works normally with the pages that affect Firefox.

Sites affected are

  http://www.yahoo.com
  http://www.onelook.com (subpages only, not main page)
  http://www.amazon.co.uk

or any page with advertising banners. The CPU goes to 100% for about 40 seconds. I have tried this in safe mode and the problem persists. If I turn off Javascript the problem goes away.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
For example,

1. go to http://www.onelook.com and
2. search for "apple" (without quotation marks)

As the result of the search is displayed the CPU problem occurs. Notably, the result page includes a banner advert.

If the above is tried with Javascript turned off the result page appears very quickly (and does not have a banner).

Actual Results:  
CPU goes to 100% for about 40 seconds before page is displayed.

Some pages such as Yahoo's home page take twice as long as if they had two components that make Firefox slow. A CPU trace shows a small dip from 100% between the two components.


Expected Results:  
Affected pages load normally on all machines.


1. Problem occurs in normal mode and safe mode.

2. Problem occurred in 3.0.5 as well as 3.0.6.

3. Some machines are OK but at least two show the problem.

4. Internet Explorer on the affected machines does not show the problem.

5. If I could upload a file I could show a CPU trace from Task Manager. These traces clearly show the CPU topping-out and flatlining at 100% for consistent periods of time and the short blip between 100% periods on pages with multiple problems.

6. In practice this problem makes Firefox so slow as to be unusable and I have to go back to IE. If I work around the problem in Firefox by turning Javascript off some pages such as http://www.nationwide.co.uk become inaccessible as they require Javascript.

7. I found a guide on mozilla.org about troubleshooting CPU problems. None of the remedies in that guide made any difference.

8. I have also tried reversing the Javascript settings in Firefox but these made no change.
