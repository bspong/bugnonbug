Since i updated from FF2 to FF3 i have a very annoying problem, that all content in firefox is dissappearing, this means, independ from website or kind of content it dissappears after a while, its hard to explain, but if i use another window (any other app) and i "wipe" my screen, it comes back, sometimes simple scrolling fixes the display, sometimes resizing the window, This has never happend with FF2, i didnt changed my display drivers since then, i really go insane with this, maybe it happens due too very long uptime, but even a restart of FF did not fix the issue, hopefully someone can reproduce the problem or its a known bug on Ati Mob. Radeon 9000 which is built in my Thinkpad. it happens in all resolutions. After a reboot it works 4 a while, but depend on the use of FF it comes back after 3-4 Days.

What exactly was changed in the way how ff3 handles the windows API since FF2?


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bye Thinkpad T41 with Ati 9000
2. dont reboot for longer then 2 weeks
3. Just browse 
Actual Results:  
I asked google and bugzilla on this but no one else seems to have this stupid issue. BTW im very experienced and know how to search, but ...

Expected Results:  
research the difference between ff2 and ff3 handling display api`s

i appreciate the effort to help me, i really go crazy with this, Thanks!
