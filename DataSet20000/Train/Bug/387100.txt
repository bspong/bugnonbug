If Google is configured as "open results page in new window" and Firefox is configured to open new windows in new tabs and you have multiple Firefox windows already open, result pages are loaded in a new tab in an unexpected window. 

Furthermore, the (apparently random) chosen window is not signalized on the Taskbar (e.g. by flashing its correspondent task button) and user have to poll all Firefox windows to see where the new tab was loaded in.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
0. Assure Firefox is configured to "open new pages in a new tab"
1. Open few (3) Firefox windows
2. Open google in one of them (the last one)
3. Configure google to display results in new windows
4. Search something in google and click on a result.
5. New tab will open in a different window than the active one. If not retry the google search in another pre-opened window and the newly created tab will not be created there.
Actual Results:  
New window opened in a new tab, but not in the active window. No indication on the taskbar in which of the windows the new tab opened.

Expected Results:  
New window opens in a tab in the active Firefox window. If not possible, at least the elected Firefox window flashes on the taskbar to indicate where the new tab ended.
