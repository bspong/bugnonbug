I cannot view embedded flash videos or flash images using Mac OS X and any version of Firefox (including latest nightly build) from 1.5 to 2.0.0.6 on the following pages as examples.  Tested with latest nightly build, all extensions disabled, new profile. Further tested with Firefox 1.5 through 2.0.0.6. Sources are flash videos from youtube.com, viddler.com, lastfm and others.  Can you see the videos on the following pages with the above configurations?  Pick any version of Firefox as none of them work, including latest nightly build.

(in this last instance, one has to scroll up or down the page to see the flash videos or images disappear.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new profile w latest nightly build of Firefox.
2. Open above URLs.
3. Embedded Flash videos are missing from page. 
(The only exception is last URL; where one has to scroll up and down the page to see the flash images disappear.)

Actual Results:  
Embedded Flash videos are missing from page.

Expected Results:  
Embedded Flash videos should appear on page.

No themes, no extensions, clean profile from latest nightly build, reproducible in all versions of Firefox from 1.5 to 2.0.0.6.
