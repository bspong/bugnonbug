webpage tries to maximize already maximized browser window

(these steps trigger the bug on windows only, linux works just fine)

1. open this url:  http://reddit.com/info/66uxr/comments/
2. maximize the browser window
3. right-click the main link titled "A380 cockpit (OMG!)" and select "open link in new window"

Expected results:
The A380 page should load in a new TAB of the already maximized window.

Actual results:
A cheezy script on that page explicitly sets the size of the browser window with the intention of "maximizing" the window size. But my window is already maximized so the net effect is that my window goes from "cleanly maximized" into "a 'non-maximized' window which has the same size as the screen". This is extremely annoying, and it also affects all the other pages I have loaded in other TABs and when I open new windows they are "as big as the screen but still not maximized". Yuck!


Some kind of sanity is required here. I'm not sure what the javascript standard says about this behavior if it does say something explicit. I would rather like ff to just stay maximized if a javascript tries to set window size to screen width/height while the window is already maximized.
