Private data is cleared upon exit even though the "Always clear my private data when I close Firefox check-box is unchecked in tools, options, privacy, private data menu box. The items cleared are the ones checked in the settings box. I have to uncheck the items in the settings box even though the "Always clear..." box is unchecked. Seems to me that it should ignore the settings box items when the "Always clear..." box is unchecked.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use the default settings when installed or uncheck the "Always clear..." box and check some of the boxes in settings.
2. Browse craigslist and hit a few links.
3. Close firefox. reopen firefox and find that none of the previously visited links show red.
4. Uncheck the all the checkboxes in settings.
5. Browse craigslist and hit a few links. Close firefox.
6. Reopen firefox, visit craigslist and find the items that were visited are red.



It happened on the pre-version 3 beta too.
