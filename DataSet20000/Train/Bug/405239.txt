I have the option "ask me every time" option set for cookies. If a new tab is opened by middle-clicking a link and the page in the newly opened tab wishes to set a cookie, this new page is automatically focused. 

Suggestion: make the cookie confirmation window non-modal and replace it by a mechanism similar to the "remember password"-bar (or "allow content to install"-bar) at the top of the screen. In this way, each tab can have its own non-intrusive cookie confirmation. Furthermore, it creates a more uniform way of requesting user interaction. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set option "ask me every time"  (and check "allow cookies" option) in Tools -> Options -> Privacy -> Cookies. Furthermore, make sure that Tools -> Options -> Tabs -> "When I open a link in a new tab, switch to it immediately" is UNchecked,
2. Navigate to a page that contains links (e.g. a google search page),
3. Middle-click a link (hopefully one that will set a cookie)
Actual Results:  
The newly opened tab is focused and a modal dialog opens requesting if a cookie may be set.

Expected Results:  
A new tab opens at the end of the list. If the tab is focused by the user, a confirmation dialog is displayed

As said in the introduction, I propose to replace the cookie confirmation _modal dialog_ by a info bar at the top of the window, similar to those that are displayed in case of pop-up blocking, software installation, "remember password" (in Firefox 3).
