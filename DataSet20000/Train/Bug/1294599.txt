Desktop should download and apply Sync records in batches
Via bug 1294270 we observe the following behaviour:

* desktop makes a request to read an entire collection (ie, full=1) without a limit param.
* As the data streams in we apply the records one at a time.
* After 10 minutes or so (eg, a few thousand passwords being applied) the server closes the connection while the client is still happily applying them and reading the next chunk.
* Client sees NS_ERROR_NET_PARTIAL_TRANSFER, doesn't advance lastSync.
* Next sync does exactly the same thing, repeat ad-nauseum.

Bug 1294595 exists to increase the timeout on the server, and while this will probably unstick many users, there will always be pathological outliers.

It seems a simple (hah!) mitigation here is for Sync to use a hard-coded limit and X-Weave-Next-Offset header to split the fetch into multiple requests. I'm not sure if this will need to be in combination with x-if-unmodified-since (forcing us to restart if another client wrote), and the implementation will be slightly complicated by the fact that we support some collections (eg, history) imposing a limit simply because it doesn't want every record.

I can't find a bug on file for this. Richard, any thoughts?
