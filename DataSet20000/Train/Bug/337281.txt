Sometimes (especially often when I have just created a new window using CTRL-N) Firefox turns into a weird mode where arrow keys plus several key combinations (including CTRL-C and CTRL-V) are ignored. Typing normal letters etc plus erasing (using backspace) works just fine. This makes it very hard to edit form textboxes and so on. I know this is a subtle report, but it's the best I can do for now. Further, I have concluded that:

1. If Firefox turns into this weird ignore-some-key-combinations mode it can be fixed by selecting another application (by clicking on their entry in the taskbar) and then selecting the bad Firefox instance again and using the mouse to explicitly set focus to the relevant textbox.

2. This problem does not only affect textboxes and so on. Once the weird ignore-keys mode has been entered the same problems are happening in the address textbox (for the page URL) and inside the Google searchbox just to the right of the adressbar.

3. If I end up the weird mode and press CTRL-N, the newly spawned instance of Firefox has the exact same problems (ie it spawns in the weird ignore-keys mode) and if I close the new instance so that I effectively return to the original buggy instance that instance still is affected by the weird ignore-keys mode (applying the trick from #1 will still exit the weird mode though).

4. I unfortunately don't have a way to reprod entering the weird mode but lately it's been happening like atleast 20 times a day. I do very large amounts of Googling as part of my job and I also do I alot of pasting stuff into forms so 20 times per day is for a very very heavy user.

5. These problems existed way before 1.5.0.3 and probably a lot longer.



Reproducible: Always
