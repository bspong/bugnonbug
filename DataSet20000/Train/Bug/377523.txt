When many websites are opened: Tab switching and loading animation and location bar don't work and CPU hog

Firefox 2.0.3 (and earlier) on Windows XP SP2

When many, lets say 90 tabs are open which are spreaded across
a few Firefox windows this happens:

- Switching with the mouse to other tabs doesn't work anymore,
  though changing the tab position with the mouse via
  drag'n'drop works always and for every tab.
  Switching to an other tab does only work via keyboard.
  Mouse hover blending-effects over tabs work too.
- Clicking on the active tab works as supposed to:
  the focus gets to the active tab ( and then <- and -> can be used )
- The loading animation (the animated ring) isn't animated any more
- When switching to other tabs, the text in the location bar isn't updated
- The text in the location bar isn't updated by webpages either.
- If you have configured to start Firefox windows with a blank page,
  then newly opened firefox windows are unusable.
  There is a blank page and confirming typed-in addresses has no effect
  (neither with "enter" nor mouse) (i.e. no browsing is possible)
  But if you have configured a startup-page for Firefox then
  Firefox will try to open that page and
  all other manually typed-in websites will work too.
- Firefox needs >85% cpu while idling


But now a positive report:
- In 2.0.1 there were many memory holes - the situation seems to have improved

IIRC happened also on 2 winxpsp2 PCs with firefox 2.0.1 (and maybe 2.0.0)
