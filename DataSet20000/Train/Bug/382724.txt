New version does not display homepage or "Click to Donate" pages correctly.

Since upgrading from '.03' to '.04' today, I can no longer display my homepage or the "Click to Donnate" pages correctly, which makes navigation difficult.  You have to look for the links you want in the text in order to go to the page(s) desired.  The only pages which seem to display correctly on this site (that I've used, anyway) are the mail pages.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Install the upgrade from Firefox 2.00.03 to Firefox 2.00.04
2.  Load homepage (www.care2.com)
3.  Check display for mail notification or links to email, "click to donate"
Actual Results:  
Display is not correct.  Links appear according to browser color, but not in correct positions, intermixed with HTML language, spaces, etc.  There are no frames or columns, no major tabs, etc.  Display is many screens long.

Expected Results:  
Framed display with easy to read notifications, tabs and links should display within 2 screen "pages."
