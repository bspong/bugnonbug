This Web-site stopped to load when i update my Firefox Web-browser from version 3.5.x up to 3.6.x. In version 3.7a3 this bug is not resolved too :( I tried to turn off all my plug-ins and to modify param "network.http.redirection-limit" in "about:config", but this don't help. In browsers IE 8, Google Chrome and Opera it seems to be all OK...
P.S. Sorry for my bad English...
