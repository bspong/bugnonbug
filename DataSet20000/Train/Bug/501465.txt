Switching between inbox, sent, bin folders

Horrible problems when trying to switch between the inbox, bin and sent folders in Gmail. This happened after I turned on all the security features under Security other than Private Browsing. Firefox continually errored and then tried to switch between folders. I kept getting dialog boxes asking me whether I wanted to leave an encrypted page, which I wasn't, I was still inside Gmail, and then it would error, more dialog boxes more errors. i finally gave up and switched to Safari. 

The other thing that I was not impressed with is that when I upgraded to 3.5 I lost all my bookmarks. Luckily for me I had them saved in Safari and I just imported them. 

Had I not had Safari's bookmarks I would not have been too impressed. I have well over 100 bookmarks and I was not keen to lose them.
