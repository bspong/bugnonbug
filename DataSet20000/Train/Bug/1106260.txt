Firefox stop loading pages probably related to China Construction Bank authorization software
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:33.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/33.0
Build ID: 20141113143407

Steps to reproduce:

*I installed the "Personal account E-route security module" (CCB_E_Setup_Total_20140819_x64.exe, downloaded from http://ebank.ccb.com/cn/ebank/personal/downloadcenter/201306071370593615.html) on my Windows 7. This allows me to access the China Construction Bank (CCB) online banking service via internet browsers like Firefox with the USB security device plugged in to my computer.



Actual results:

*I successfully proceeded the CCB banking service like currency transfer in Firefox. And then I just logged off from my banking account.

*After perhaps few hours later, with Firefox was still active, I couldn't load any new webpage.

*When I closed and attempted to reopen Firefox again, I got the message ""Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window, you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart your system."

*I forcefully shut Firefox down in Task Manager and opened Firefox again.

*Firefox loaded webpages, but after some time later, it failed to load any new webpage again.

*After shutting Firefox in Task Manager, the same issue happened increasingly quicker than the initial start up, unless I restart the OS.

*After uninstalling the CCB security module software from my PC, the issue with Firefox has seemingly gone.
