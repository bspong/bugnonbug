Firefox windows fails to respond correctly to user when it attempts to load this page, open tabs and URL bar stop functioning.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

The following URL appears to cause this bug to occur (affecting only tabs in the
current window):

http://plone.org/documentation/archetypes/ArchetypesDeveloperGuide

When trying to load this page in Firefox the current active window will cease
responding correctly. Any existing open tabs will no longer display their
contents when selected and the URL bar stops working. The page appears to load
correctly in Safari without issues.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a few sites (any sites) in different tabs within the same window
2. create a new tab and then paste in the above mentioned URL and hit enter

Actual Results:  
Firefox tries to load page, but fails (it just sits there with a blank page).
Any open tabs in the current window will now no longer respond when clicked and
the url bar will not allow any new URLs to be entered. Toolbar buttons may also
stop functioning.

Expected Results:  
Page should load and be displayed. Switching to other tabs in the current window
should work, along with url entry bar.

I have tested this bug on several Macs running OS X (Panther) and it
consistently messes up firefox. I have not yet tested it on my Linux PC at home
to see if that has the same result. Also only the window in which the page is
loaded becomes messed up, other open windows continue to function correctly.
Closing the messed up window does not seem to affect the functionality of other
open firefox windows either.
