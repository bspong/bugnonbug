File "Opening" dialog displays incorrect "Open With" application

When I open a file with a helper application, the dialog remembers the first helper I choose, and doesn't update if I use a different helper app later.

For example, if I open the first download link on the vim script site, and select /usr/bin/gvim to open it with, everything is fine.

The next time I click the link, I choose a different helper - /usr/bin/scite.  The dialog still says it is opening with /usr/bin/gvim, but if I press OK it does use /usr/bin/scite.  So it is doing the right thing, but not showing it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download a non-text/html file
2. Select a handler app
3. Download the file again
4. Select a different handler

Actual Results:  
The right thing happens, but the display leads one to believe that the wrong thing is going to happen.

Expected Results:  
The dialog should reflect the helper app I just picked.

Did this with a 10-minute old download of Firefox 2.0 RC3, and a completely empty profile.
