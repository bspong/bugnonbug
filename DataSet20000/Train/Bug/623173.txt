Much memory usage for a few loaded and dozens of not-loaded tabs

I have dozens of tabs (about 500), and when I open the FF it tries to load it from the cache, so it takes a few minutes to become accessible. However, then I'm not connected and the majority of pages cannot be loaded as my cache isn't that big. When FF becomes available, I get connected and start using it. But the issue is that FF takes about 300MB of the memory for pages that simply have not loaded anything, and accordingly, it slows down. I wonder whether the FF could manage the tabs more efficiently, so that my space and time is not wasted.

Thank you.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open FF (my cache-size is about 250)
2.Load it with a few hundred tabs addressed to some page
3.Close and save tabs
4.Disconnect
5.Open FF
Actual Results:  
Consuming much memory while a few of the hundreds of pages are actually loaded. Normal operation is slowed down.

Expected Results:  
Memory consumption and operation performance be linear to the amount of pages that actually are loaded.
