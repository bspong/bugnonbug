for testing i need to change some preferences often. like the proxy, whitelist etc

be great if there was a start up option to make the preferences window non modal so i can keep it open,, switch between windows and work quickly.

save me and a i believe other people who need to do this for testing or other reasons some time and repetitive tasks of no use ...

or a way to change some prefs from a special localhost page/ add on that can have a non modal / page like UI?


can show  a warning, once "mozilla can be unstable if u change something at the same time as browsing ...."

Reproducible: Always

1.not really relevant this is a request for a new feature.
2.want to go from prefs window to browser tab without closing prefs window
3.
Actual Results:  
cannot change prefs and switch back to browser tab without 

Expected Results:  
be able to keep both open and work on both alternatively

let me know if i can provide any
