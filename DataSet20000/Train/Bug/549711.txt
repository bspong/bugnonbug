Impossible to save an image seen on the screen when browsing! Operation : *Right Click on image; *Select Save Image As; ... then Nothing Happens, no pop up window, nothing at all!! This bug was persistent from the previous version, it may be difficult to find because right after the start it's sometimes working and after a few minutes it does not work anymore! It seems also related to another bug that refuses to display all the files saved inside a directory, in fact it keep saving them as told, but only displays the first 2 new files! (( By the way in another post somone wrote about the <img ... alt="..." > that does not work with Firefox, I know "Title" exists, but it's a pain to care about both of them .. as far as I remember it's like that from the beginning.))

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
