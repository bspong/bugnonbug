change feed item representation to allow per-item CSS style rules

currently the list of feed items is represented in a generated document tree as a set of element pairs <h3> + <p>.  instead, wrap each <h3> + <p> pair in an enclosing element (such as a <div>) to allow styling of the entire item rather than styling the <h3> and the <p> separately.  this would allow CSS style rules to make it visually apparent that the <h3> and the <p> go together, such as with a common background color that underlies both the <h3> and the <p>, or with an border that encloses both of them.

currently

	div #feedBody
		div #feedTitle
		div #feedContent
			h3
			p.feedEntryContent
			h3
			p.feedEntryContent
			h3
			p.feedEntryContent
			h3
			p.feedEntryContent
			
proposed			

	div #feedBody
		div #feedTitle
		div #feedContent
			div.feedItem
				h3
				p.feedEntryContent
			div.feedItem
				h3
				p.feedEntryContent
			div.feedItem
				h3
				p.feedEntryContent
			div.feedItem
				h3
				p.feedEntryContent
