After starting the beta 5 all bars went wild, toolbar, bookmarks and tabs. Also, some form inputs were displayed weirdly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install firefox 3 b5 overwriting ff 2.0.0.13
2. launch it
3.
Actual Results:  
The bars and some form elements look weird. See screenshots.

Expected Results:  
The default OS X theme should look "as advertised".

I've run it several times with different settings.

- The first run was over a firefox 2.0.0.13 profile. It seemed like it updated the profile, it warned about non-working extensions disabling them and everything seemed fine but the looks was weird and the scroll was quite slow. Then I browsed to firefox's bugzilla and found that some form elements were displayed with black text over black background.

- Then I created another profile with the profile manager and run the beta with the new profile. The bars still looked weird. I deleted the new profile with the profile manager.

- Then I launched firefox in safe mode. The bars still looked weird.

- Then I deleted all the contents of the default profile directory ("~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/${hash}.default/*"), and relaunched the browser. The directory was repopulated, but bars still looked weird.

- Then I deleted the whole "~/Library/Application Support/Firefox" directory and relaunched. Firefox asked me to import from safari, I rejected, it kept initializing recreating and populating the deleted directory, and when it stopped loading, the bars still looked weird.

As a side note, while the browser is loading and no text is yet displayed, the bars look fine. Then the browser finishes loading, the text appears and the white parts are shown like in the screenshot.
