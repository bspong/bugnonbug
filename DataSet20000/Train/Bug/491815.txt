Ads on most sites cause Firefox 3.0.10 to hang.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I have been frustrated as of late, with ads on most sites causing firefox to hang.
Places like Mugen-Infantry.net, Hotmail and even http://news.cnet.com/new-beta-paves-way-for-firefox-3.5/ causes firefox 3.0.10 to hang because of the ads placed on it.

Hotmail especially is suffering from major hanging. It takes an approximate one minute of hanging before it goes back to normality.

I have not installed any add-ons in the past couple of months. I've removed one plug-in (Java Platform SE6 U6, and I have SE6 U12 and U13 on it) and that's all. This problem did not occur in previous versions of Firefox.

Also, Internet Explorer and Google Chrome are able to load the ads no problem. Deleting cache and cookies did not fix the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a site with ads (Mugen-infantry.net, hotmail.com after login or http://news.cnet.com/new-beta-paves-way-for-firefox-3.5/
2. Firefox will hang for a moment before going back to normal because of the ads loading.
Actual Results:  
Firefox hangs for a moment.

Expected Results:  
Continuous firefox usage without hangs.

Used default theme, removed one plugin (Java Platform SE6 U6 extension).
