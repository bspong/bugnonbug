Pop-Up Blocker does not work while "close other tabs" awaits confirmation

First I open some new pages and visit some sites with pop-up commands.
When I right-click on a tab and say "close other tabs" and the confirmation dialogue appears, the pop-ups can open.
When I do not open the confirmation dialogue, the pop-up blocker works properly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn the pop-up blocker on (if it is off)
2. Make a HTML-Page with a hyperlink to a page you know that uses pop-ups and open it
3. Now open new tabs by holding the ctrl-key pressed and clicking on the link several times
4. While the pages are loading, right-click on any tab and choose "close other tabs"
Actual Results:  
After performing the 4 steps, the pop-ups opened, even with my pop-up blocker turned on.

Expected Results:  
The pop-up blocker should block the pop-ups, as it's name says. =)

Reproducing the bug also works, when you open new windows for each page instead of new tabs, as long as you choose "close other tabs".
I don't know if it also works with other confirmation dialogues.
