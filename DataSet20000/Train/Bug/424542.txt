Bookmarks manager needs a separate entry for Search:

Until the upcoming release, the search.label entry in bookmarks.dtd was used for both the Search sidebar as well as the bookmarks organiser. This had not been a problem, as both terms (Search) were the same and basically meant ‘find’. In 3.0, places.dtd still uses the search.label, but its meaning has become different in the organizer window compared to the sidebar as the selectable places following the search string make it stand for places _where_ to search there, instead of only _what_ to search (i.o.w. find), like the latter is used in both the bookmarks and history sidebars.

In Dutch for instance, we changed the label (looking at its meaning in the organizer) from Zoeken to Doorzoeken (for German this would mean change Suchen to Durchsuchen). The logical result of this using a shared label is that Doorzoeken also appears in the sidebar, where we would still like to see Zoeken, as we still see in the history sidebar due to its own label (find.label in history.dtd).

It seems logical to me if the new entry would be the new one currently shown for the new meaning (Doorzoeken/Durchsuchen) in the organizer, keeping the old sidebar entry and its key as they were before (even though it would make sense to use a find.label/key for those). A new access key would not be necessary, as the current one is only being used by the sidebar.

If implementing this for 3.0 is a goal, copying search.label's content to the new entry for all locales may be a quick action; localizers then can see if they want to change the content of one of them or not. Using history.dtd's find.label for the bookmarks sidebar may even be a quicker option without having the need to bother localizers, though a little risky and not a very nice one of course.

Impact:
May look minor, but compared to older versions a visible regression if search.label has already been changed for locales. Basically needed anyway if the selection buttons remain in, or it may look unfinished.
