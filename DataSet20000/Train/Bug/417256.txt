Unusually high memory consumption, causes periodical "freezing" of the browser
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080201 Firefox/2.0.0.12

Task manager reports Firefox using on average >200,000k memory, multiple tabs (3-4+) raises memory usage to >300,000k, causes browser to temporarily (1-3 minutes) "freeze" on loading new page. On "freezing" Firefox's CPU usage spikes to over 85% causing the system to become extremely slow, or stop responding altogether. during periods when Firefox is frozen, cursor changes to "working" (hourglass) while hovering over page, but changes to "working in background" (normal cursor w/ hourglass) when hovering over the window's top bar (where %pagename% - Mozilla Firefox is displayed at left). The maximize/restore down button is also disabled during these occurrences. task manager will not report Firefox as "not responding" unless the main window area is clicked on during the "freezes" in which case the browser must be stopped by ending the process "Firefox.exe" 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open 4+ tabs in same browser window
2.direct each tab to different websites
3.open more tabs as necessary, pointing each to a new URL
Actual Results:  
browser became unstable- freezing, and process needed to be terminated in some cases.

Expected Results:  
Page loading would be understandably slower, due to higher network activity, but, as Firefox is a local application, it should have continued to run normally.
