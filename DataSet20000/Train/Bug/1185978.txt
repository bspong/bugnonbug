How well does it work?: 100%

Steps to reproduce working features:
* Visit https://userstyles.org/ and install any of the "Best" styles, then watch for its declared effects. For instance, install https://userstyles.org/styles/102050/dark-youtube-nights and visit https://youtube.com/ : expected result: a blackish view.
* Click the [S] icon in the toolbar and try to enable/disable the currently applied user style, listed as a check menu item
* Click the [S] icon in the toolbar and try the other commands, i.e. "Manage Styles" which should open an add-ons panel subsection, "Turn all styles off", "Find styles for this site..." and "Write new user style...".
