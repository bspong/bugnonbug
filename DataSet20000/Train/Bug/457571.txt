www.wsj.com has a interactive charting website under their "data market" tab. Firefox will not chart 2 indices togther (it will chart 1 indice that you select but not the 2nd pne selected), windows internet explorer does allow for chartin 2 indices?  Wall Street Journal tech support doesn't know why it doesn't work on Firefox and recommended only using IE? Any way of fixing this? Here's the lonk

4. select about 3/4 down the webpage under "International Markets" "canada:s&p/tsx and the link will launch you to a new tab witha chart of the s&p/tsx index 
5.go to the left hand side of the website beside the chart produced and select the drop down "Compare" box and select any other index i.e. s&p 500, about 3/4 of the way down on the drop down.

only chart the 1st index selected, will not chart the 2nd index selected to be compared with the 1st index

using microsoft windows IE you would see both indices charted on the chart

wall street journal's tech staff verified that it does work with IE and doesn't know why it doesn't work with firefox?
