nsSearchService.js:38 - octal literals and octal escape sequences are deprecated
Noticed these JS warnings at startup of my debug build, with a fresh profile:
{
System JS : WARNING file:///$OBJDIR/dist/bin/components/nsSearchService.js:38 - octal literals and octal escape sequences are deprecated
System JS : WARNING file:///$OBJDIR/dist/bin/components/nsSearchService.js:38 - octal literals and octal escape sequences are deprecated
System JS : WARNING file:///$OBJDIR/dist/bin/components/nsSearchService.js:38 - octal literals and octal escape sequences are deprecated
System JS : WARNING file:///$OBJDIR/dist/bin/components/nsSearchService.js:39 - octal literals and octal escape sequences are deprecated
System JS : WARNING file:///$OBJDIR/dist/bin/components/nsSearchService.js:39 - octal literals and octal escape sequences are deprecated
System JS : WARNING file:///$OBJDIR/dist/bin/components/nsSearchService.js:39 - octal literals and octal escape sequences are deprecated
}

(Not sure why I get 3 copies of each warning, but I do.)

This is from these lines:
> const PERMS_FILE      = 0644;
> const PERMS_DIRECTORY = 0755;
which date back to bug 317107.

(And for reference, we disallowed octal literals in strict-mode JS in bug 514559.)
