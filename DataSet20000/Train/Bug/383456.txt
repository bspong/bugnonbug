While loading URL, IE Tab and Tab Mix plus crashes. Closing program causes Firefox itself to crash, leaving stub in memory.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20070515 Firefox/2.0.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20070515 Firefox/2.0.0.4

The problem involves Java, SE 6 Version 1.6.0 (build 1.6.0_01-b06).

The website could take indefinite time to load. As soon as URL is loaded, IE Tab and Tab Mix Plus crashes. However, Ctrl-Tab can be used to cycle through the tabs. In frequent severe cases, child window forms and list boxes, the scroll bar and the arrow key scroll stop responding. Firefox crashes on attempts to shut it down through X button or File->Exit, leaving stub in memory which needs to be cleared manually before Firefox can be restarted. Otherwise, msg is displayed: "Firefox is already running but not responding".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. type URL <http://www.bseindia.com/
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
1. IE Tab and Tab Mix Plus crashed immediately.
2. mouse pointer stopped responding.
3. Child window scroll bar and form elements including drop down list boxes crashed.
4. Site takes indefinite time to load, and sometimes does not load at all.
5. Attempts to close firefox causes crash with Java exception error:
>> java.lang.NullPointerException
	at bse_ticker.init(bse_ticker.java:370)
	at sun.applet.AppletPanel.run(Unknown Source)
	at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)
6. stub remains in memory as Firefox.exe, needs to be unloaded manually.
7. If 6. is not done, attempts to restart gives Windows message: "Firefox already running but has stopped responding"

Expected Results:  
Site should load normally.
IE Tab and Tab Mix Plus should not crash while loading page.
Java tickers should run.
Firefox should not crash at any point.

The problem involves Java, SE 6 Version 1.6.0 (build 1.6.0_01-b06).

Attempts to close firefox causes crash with Java exception error:

According to my experience, any site with certain types of Java tickers can reproduce the error.
