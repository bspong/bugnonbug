Text entry fields lose focus as page loads

When I start Firefox( v1.5.0.4 ) and it begins loading my home page, I can be typing a URL into the address field or search text into the Google bar and the field I'm typing in will lose focus after 1-x characters, keystrokes no longer work, and clicking into the field doesn't return the focus. I have to click into another field first before the original field will accept the focus.

This occurs regardless of what website's page I'm loading or what text field I'm typing in and it has always been present in Mozilla since I began using it years ago. Sometimes I remember to hit the Stop button before typing but that doesn't always bring things to an immediate halt. Waiting for complicated pages like The Weather Channel to fully load before I can go anywhere else is a considerable nuisance.
