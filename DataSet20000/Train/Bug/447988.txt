Mac OS, some pages load only partially. When I restart Firefox, everything is ok.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; fr; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008061004 Firefox/3.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; fr; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008061004 Firefox/3.0

This bug has been annoying me since at least Firefox 2 and it is still present. I experienced it only on my Mac OS X laptop.

When I surf for a while, or if I wait long enough, pages stop loading completely. By this I mean, for example, some images won't load, or the CSS style sheets won't load (this then displays a quite ugly page), or even a whole page won't load.

I may hit the refresh button, close the tab and reopen it, nothing works. For pages that partially load, the browser will tell me that the page is completely loaded (the finished word at the left of the bottom status bar). If I hit refresh many times, I sometimes get everything, but most of the time I don't.

I also noticed that when the browser is in this state, when I close it, even if I have many opened tabs, it won't ask me to save them (but will save them anyway), it simply closes, sometimes with a crash (sometime not). When I open the browser again, all the tabs open and the pages load completely (until the next time it happens).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Surf or wait a while
2.Notice that pages are not completely loaded

It happens everytime, the only thing that varies is how long I can surf without it happening, but at some point, it will.
Actual Results:  
I explained it above.

Expected Results:  
It should not do that!


(Speculations)
To me, it looks like at some point, Firefox is not able to connect to the remote servers anymore, or have a hard time doing it. (even if my internet connection is completely fine and I'm doing something else with it, like chatting without being disconnected).
