In the Places Library, when you want to import your bookmarks.html file from a fx2 profile to a Minefield profile, the Bookmarks Toolbar in the fx2 file does not automatically become the Bookmarks Toolbar in the fx3 Places Library. You must either move or copy the bookmarks in the old Bookmarks Toolbar to the fx3 Bookmarks Toolbar.

When I last did this a week or two ago, I could simply select all of the bookmarks and bookmark folders in the fx2 Bookmarks Toolbar (right pane) and drag them to the Bookmarks Toolbar icon in the left pane. That is no longer possible. Given the changes in function Minefield is experiencing, I am not sure if this is intended behavior (a feature) or a regression (a bug). In any case, dragging no longer works, much less dropping.

So, on to plan B: copying the bookmarks and bookmark folders from the fx2 imported Bookmarks Toolbar to the fx3 Bookmarks Toolbar.

This seems at first to work: all of the bookmarks seem to have made it, along with the the bookmark folders. Inside the first set of bookmark folders (the ones that appear on the Bookmarks Toolbar itself) the bookmarks and bookmark folders are intact. But when you go inside the next level of bookmark folders, you discover they are empty.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Places Library
2. Select a collection of bookmark folders with subfolders.
3. Copy them.
4. Paste them somewhere.
Actual Results:  
Only the contents of the folders are copied.

No contents of subfolders are copied.

Expected Results:  
The contents of the subfolders should have been copied.

The bookmarks collection is relatively large, as discussed in Bug 415201.

The copy problem may be a regression.
