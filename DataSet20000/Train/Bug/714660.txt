Page navigation bugs
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/535.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/16.0.912.63 Safari/535.7

Steps to reproduce:

1. 
Go to a page that requires scrolling. Attempt to use the following keys to move through the page: [Page Down] [Page Up] [down arrow] [up arrow] [End] [Home] 

2. Go to a page that has links to other pages on same website. Attempt to use keys listed above.

3. Same as #1 above. Mouse click anywhere on the page. Attempt to use keys.

4. Same as #2 above. Mouse click anywhere on the page. Attempt to use keys.


Actual results:

Erratic responses. Some keys do nothing at all. Some do the wrong thing, e.g., [down arrow] moves to absolute bottom of page (instead of only one line down); [Page Down] only moves down several lines (and not a full page), etc.

PLATFORM: ASUS laptop, Win7 64 bit, MS keyboard & mouse.

NOTE: This only happens in FFX -- does not happen in other browsers (MSIE, Chrome), or in other programs (Word, etc.). It was working correctly before most recent upgrade (9.x).




Expected results:

[Page Down] should move down one full page, no more no less (unless only fraction remains).
[Page Up] should move up one full page, no more no less (unless only fraction remains).
[End] should move to absolute bottom of page.
[Home] should move to absolute top of page.
[down arrow] should move down one line.
[up arrow] should move up one line.
