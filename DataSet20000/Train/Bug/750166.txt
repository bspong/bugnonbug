Steps to reproduce:

I have a clean install of Firefox.

I listed the cases by clicking on "Responses & Statistics" item on the "Responses" menu of LimeSurvey Version 1.92+ Build 120405. Then clicked "Display Responses" button on the menu (of the new page).


Actual results:

It lists the cases. There are many cases default is 50. But it does not scroll.

Page Up/Page Down buttons do not work. Arrow keys do not work. F7 shows the cursor and cursor goes down with the arrow key. But screen is still. The interactive stuff on the visible part like drop down boxes etc. work. But I can not go down. There is no scroll bar at the right but there is one at the bottom. I can go left and right. But can not go up/down.

I can see the remaining data in the source file. But when I "inspect 3D", it shows as if there is nothing in the unseen (bottom) part of the page. 

Interestingly, I can zoom the screen by the touchpad. After that, I can see the remaining cases (lines of data like in spreadsheet) and rest of the page normal but of course characters are very small in this resolution. On the other hand, when I resize back, problem persists.


Expected results:

It should have let me scroll.
