A printed map is defective, when compared with the on-screen map version which is correct. The printed version always has a horizontal section towards the top chopped out. As if the printer had "jumped" several pixels vertically. The defective section isn't blank, it really is missing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.openstreetmap.org
2. Input a UK postcode (zip code) in the Search box (e.g. SM6 7JU).
3. Choose the desired location for the map from the alternatives offered.
4. Print the map and compare it with the on-screen version. 
5. A horizontal band towards the top is always missing. 

Actual Results:  
The map when printed has a horizontal band completely missing, towards the top of the image.

Expected Results:  
The printed map should exactly match the on-screen map.

This fault doesn't happen when printing in Internet Explorer. So... either it's a Mozilla bug? Or perhaps it's a fault in the rendering by OpenStreetMap?
