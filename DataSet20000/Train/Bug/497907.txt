You won't be able to see the problem because it's in a staff area, but I think I can explain it.

on our website, we run a bulletin board called vBulletin. It's a PHP/MySQL Based bulletin board, and FireFox was the preferred browser until lately. There has been less and less compatibility with every update of FireFox, and now, we can't operate our staff chat functions with FireFox. There are applet tabs on the side of each chat entry, and those tabs allow us to sticky a chat in place, if we need to, and they worked great until about 2 updates ago. There are many other choices in the applet tabs, but that is one example. 

What happens is, it quickly flips up a screen that we need to enter a chat statement, which is not right... If you have a person that can be trusted in an administrative capacity, I'll give them access to the sites staff area and they can see what I'm talking about...
