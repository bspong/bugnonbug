Using ALSA, but it may be misconfigured any possible way, or not. Regardless, firefox 3.1beta2 is the first one which actually dies on popups and new windows (like file>>new window), beta1 did not seem to suffer this one. Strace shows that the child waits forever on sound which seems to be blocked by parent (as far as I remember, or vice versa, I try to freeze after I finished typing this), while parent get angry and try to terminate (with the active child in the way). SIGTERM usually helps - killing off the whole FF shebang naturally.

(I did not find my report on that which I thought I've filed, neither find any possible duplicates, but you may remember them..)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start FF
2. trigger a popup, or open a new window

Actual Results:  
Complete FF freeze (blocking on soundcard open)

Expected Results:  
Opening the window nicely.

I'll try to get some stracing. If you need any data on alsa config try to be very specific, as I'm not up to date on any possible alsa config details and the way to find 'em. 
I have esd running, but I'm not supposed to use it. AFAIR it doesn't change anything, but now that you reminded me, I'll try that as well. (Shouldn't freeze, anyway.)
