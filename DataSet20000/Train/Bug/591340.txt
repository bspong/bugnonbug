Pop-up blocker faulty - Blocks new tabs/windows
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.11) Gecko/20100701 Firefox/3.5.11
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.11) Gecko/20100701 Firefox/3.5.11

After browsing for a few hours, Firefox starts blocking all new windows. It shows the message "Firefox prevented this site from opening a pop-up window" even when "Block pop-up windows" in Options>Content is unchecked i.e. turned off.

Any button on any web-page/website that leads to a link that is supposed to open in a new tab/window gets blocked. Right clicking the original link and selecting "Open link in a new tab/window" bypasses the pop-up block message.

A Firefox restart also fixes this problem for a few hours but I loose all open tabs/windows on restarting. It happens again in few hours.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse FF with a large number of tabs open
2. Clicking many links which open in more new tabs
Actual Results:  
Suddenly FF pop-up blocker starts blocking most of the links clicked on any website thinking it as a pop-up and shows the message "Firefox prevented this site from opening a pop-up window" even when "Block pop-up windows" in Options>Content is unchecked i.e. turned off.
