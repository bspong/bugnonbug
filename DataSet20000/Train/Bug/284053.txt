Download Actions should allow changing to different plugins
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050227 Firefox/1.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050227 Firefox/1.0+

Tools > Options > Downloads > [Download Actions] View & Edit Actions > should
allow selecting from multiple plugins when available for file types.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install a Firefox build containing new Options panel (in my case: Mozilla/5.0
(Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050227 Firefox/1.0+),
hourly BEAST tinderbox build (.exe)
2.Install Quicktime (www.apple.com/quicktime). Quicktime plugin will be placed
in the Firefox plugin directory by its installer.
3.Install another application which has a Firefox plugin that can also play .MOV
files. For the purposes of this example, VLC: www.videolan.org. Place its
included Mozilla plugins in the Firefox plugins directory if they aren't by its
installer (I can't recall if they were ...)
4.In Firefox, Tools>Options>Downloads>"View & Edit Actions">Highlight ".MOV"
extension and click "Change Action". At the bottom the "Use This Plugin" setting
does not allow you to select between the VLC plugin and the Quicktime plugin.
(and in my case, it selected the VLC plugin automatically even though Quicktime
is associated with .MOV files)
Actual Results:  
Firefox does not seem to notice that there are multiple plugins capable of
handling the same file/mime type.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should allow a dropdown list or similar selection interface for changing
the plugin setting.

program versions (may not matter, but for reference)
Quicktime 6.5.2
VLC 0.8.1
