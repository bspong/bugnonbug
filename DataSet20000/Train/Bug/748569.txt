Fix (most) remaining migration bugs for Firefox 14
Combo-patch for remaining migration issues is in the pipe, not too big, not to small. Bugs which are already filed will be blocked by this bug.

Here's a list of user-facing bugs I'm going to fix here:
 * [Major] Bug 738263 - Default bookmarks.html import on migration is temporarily broken ("planned" regression)
 * [Major] Bug 748047 - Reset profile feature is broken (regression)
 * Migration wizard fails to recognize default browser on Windows vista and window 7. This is a long standing issue, but I don't think it's filed.
 * On Mac and Linux we don't even bother detecting the default browser.
 * Detection of default browser on Windows doesn't check for safari.
 * The wizard lies (and doesn't tell all the truth) about the data that is about to be migrated:
   "Import Options, Bookmarks, History, Passwords and other data from:"
    ...Chrome, Safari
 * Internet Explorer becomes _Microsoft_ Internet Explorer in the homepage wizard-page.

Implementation details to be fixed here:
  * Simplify migration wizard modes.
  * Remove the puzzling code for saving the homepage pref.
  * Build the list of migrators in the wizard dynamically. As a result, quite a few duplicated strings are noew removed from migration.dtd.
  * nsIBrowserProfileMigrator: do away with the startup arguments.
  * slow decom: getMigrator now returns the wrappedJSObject of each migrator.
  * Remove some leftovers of "From File" mode.
  * When the default browser is detected on windows, the reg-key was never closed (my bad). The new code does not rely on registry keys.

The following issues will _not_ be covered by this bug:
  * Chrome migrator reports that migration is done too early (not yet filed)
  * Safari migrator does not import cookies and top sites (to be done in other bugs. We may or may land these for Firefox 14)
  * about:home is still featured as "Firefox Start, a fast home page with built-in search"
  * The migration wizard interaction is worse than Linux.
  * It's rocket science to test the homepage page on builds with non-official branding.
