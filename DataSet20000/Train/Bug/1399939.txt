IDN script mixing policy: Consider switching to highly-restrictive
Coming from Chromium bug: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=726950

Currently, Chromium uses moderately-restrictive for mixed script check in domain name components. As a result, certain scripts with confusable characters to Latin are allowed to mix with Latin.   To protect against them, Chromium has added some ad-hoc rules.  

When I reviewed Verisign and IDN ccTLD rules for scripts other than Han, Hangul, Hiragana/Katakana, and Bopomofo,  they don't allow mixing with Latin. [1] 

So, using 'moderately-restrictive' policy for mixed-script detection does not do much for (major) TLDs.   

Of course, tertiary and lower level domain components can mix Latin and those scripts (Hebrew, Deva, Arabic, Armenian, Georgian), but if you look at web pages in languages written in those scripts,  script-mixing within a single word is very rare if any. 

I propose that Firefox and Chromium can sync up on this policy and change to 'highly restrictive' script mixing check.

3.B has this:
B. NOT PERMISSIBLE
1. CODE-PAGE MIXING

As an example, Latin-Devanagari mixed label is given.
