This has happened twice, the first time I uninstalled FF and removed all the Profile directories and all Mozilla folders in both Application Data folders under all user names and reinstalled, the error then reoccured after a few weeks, there was no apparent change made to/in FF that caused the problem.  However I do now recieve crashes more often than usual, however the module is reported as unknown.
