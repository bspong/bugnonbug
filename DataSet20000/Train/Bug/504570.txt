I am an ebay seller.  when I send out invoices I use the back button to get to the list of invoices I need to send.   Sometimes peole buy more than one item and when I combine them to send the invoice, I have to use the back button to get to the page with my invoice list to continue sending invoices.  When I hit the back button I get the above message.  This is annoying to me.  Can there be a way to disable this action, so I do not have to repeatedly cancel the action out?
thanks
