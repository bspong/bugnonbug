Browsing history not being completely cleared

After recently updating to version 3.5.5, I noticed that FireFox no longer fully clears everything in the history when selected. Cached items and the browsing history (list of sites) appear to be cleared, but form and logon information are not.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a site where login credentials or a web form are present. This affects both secure (https) and non-secure (http) sites.
2. Log into the site as usual, ensuring that the logon process completes.
3. Go to another page in the same tab (e.g. google.com), then open the clear history dialog: Tools->Clear Recent History...
4. Ensure that the details pane is open (arrow is pointing upwards) and check every option available (ensure that all checkboxes are selected -- all data should be cleared).
5. Select "Clear Now"
6. Close every instance of the browser (including any associated windows like the Downloads dialog)
7. Re-start FireFox and return back to the site originally visited in step 1. Note that all values will already be pre-filled, including the user ID, password, and any other form data that may have been entered.
Actual Results:  
The data that was entered into login fields and web forms was not cleared out as expected. I have not yet been able to clear this information out in any way.

Expected Results:  
All information should be cleared based on the settings selected in the "Clear Recent History..." dialog.

I use this feature regularly as part of my web development. As mentioned, much of the history is correctly cleared but, for some reason, passwords and other form data seem to be retained, and I have yet to be able to figure out a way to clear them out.
