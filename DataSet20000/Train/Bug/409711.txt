When the drawImage method of a canvas tag is called repeatedly, memory useage increases rapidly, and is not released until the application exits.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. HTML file with canvas element.
Javascript:
2. Create an image element.
3. Create a draw function which uses drawImage to put the image on the canvas.
4. Call the draw function from a setInterval timer.

I believe files can be attached; (but not from submission GUI) test case will be provided later.
Actual Results:  
Memory increases rapidly (in proportion to the number of drawImage calls; several MB/sec in my case.  Virtual memory (as reported by OS X activity monitor) will grow beyond physical memory (2GB), real memory will be capped by the OS below (1.7GB in my case)



Expected Results:  
Memory use should remain stable.

Closing the tab/window does not release memory; must quit application to release memory.

Reproducible with clean profile in safe mode.

The leak monitor plugin, leak-gauge.pl, and about:cache report nothing unusual.  

Observed in 2.0.0.11, but appears to be resolved in 3.0 beta 2.
