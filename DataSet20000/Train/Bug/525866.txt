Linkedin
When I want to add a contact, the drop down box does not appear in various fields (on how you know the contact).
Normally, say you select Colleague, a drop down box appears showing the companies I have worked at before.
If I click on IE Tab, and change engine to IE then this works.
Also it works if I go into Internet Explorer.

I thought it would be related to NoScript but I disabled that add-on and it still does not work.
The only other new add-ons updated ware Colourful tabs and LastPass.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.linkedin.com
2. Login
3. Look for a person, say "Mumani solutions"
4. Add that person
5. When choosing how you know them , select say Friend and normally a box opens below asking for the email address. This box no longer appears.
Actual Results:  
As I am not able to add the email address, LinkedIn gives an error message asking to fill in the missing details but they can not be filled in.

Expected Results:  
A box should appear letting you enter an email address.
