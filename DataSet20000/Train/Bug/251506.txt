Browser crashes when using "Sort Bookmarks 0.51" extension with "Add Bookmark Here 0.5" extension installed [@ nsXULContentBuilder::RemoveGeneratedContent ]
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2

I have both the "Sort Bookmarks 0.51" and the "Add Bookmarks Here 0.5:
extensions installed in Mozilla Firefox 9.2.  As well I imported my bookmarks
from IE.

Whenever I go to sort the imported bookmarks Firefox crashes and I get an error
saying that Firefox has encountered problems and had to close.  However, if I
remove the "Add Bookmarks Here" extension and do a sort it sorts just fine.

  



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install both "Add Bookmarks Here 0.5" and "Sort Bookmarks 0.51" extensions.
2. Try and sort imported IE bookmarks.
3. Firefox crashes every time I tried it (I tried it at least a dozen times).

Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes and generates and error message.  Without the "Add Bookmarks
Here" extension the bookmarks do sort properly every time yet with the extension
the browser crashs every time I try and sort.

Expected Results:  
Bookmarks should have sorted without crashing browser.
