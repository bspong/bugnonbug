Browser window doesn't display when some lightweight themes are enabled on Windows 10
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:58.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/58.0
Build ID: 20170929100122

Steps to reproduce:

After today's update I was using the "Mightly" lightweight theme.  When I restarted, the window did not show up.

After getting back to a usable state, I went to Add-ons -> Themes, and enabled some of my other lightweight themes.  I have found that some themes turn the window frame white, and those themes will render the invisible window on Nightly restart.

Some of those themes:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/abstracblue/
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/aurora-australis/
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/blue-bomb/
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/frozen-wood/
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nightly/

I am using build ID 20170929100122


Actual results:

Certain lightweight themes caused the window frame to be white when switching themes from the add-on manager.  If one of those themes is enabled and the browser is closed and restarted, the window is invisible on restart.


Expected results:

The theme should be applied without a white border and the browser window should not be invisible.
