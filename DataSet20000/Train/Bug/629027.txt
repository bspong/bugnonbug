Want ability to disable the Aero Glass effect

The chosen default UI (Strata, I believe) provides a glassy selection box on hover and select actions to toolbar items (bookmarks, eg). With clear default window this no problem. I you add a Persona, particularly a dark background, this choice results in a very ugly white outline box and detracts visibly from the intent of a custom UI.
Many users are adept CSS stylers. Myself, I make heavy use of the userchrome.css and use opacity settings for hilite. I should be able to turn off this "UI glass feature". Instead I have to go through acrobatics.
Firefox main claim to FAME is customingabilitynessitude. Extensions, addons, etc. By choosing the default UI Firefox looks and acts like GChrome, at least on the surface. Whoopee! I want more. My solution is to stay with 6.13.
Similarly, the use of XPI extensions makes it much more inconvenient to modify and improve extension/add-ons. Most developers are unresponsive to suggestions. I can still do it but it has become a real pain.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Customization
2. Customization
3. and again Customization



A simple solution is a setting panel (think Objectdock).
Selection or hover effects might be glassy box (now) or glow or color.
And more important: tab hi-lighting, colors and behavior. Again tab behavior!
The UI is YOUR domain. It is what every user looks at, constantly, EVERYDAY!
In marketing terms IT IS YOUR BRAND.
Take more control of these basic elements.
But make it easier for the community to customize.
If Firefox looks like Chrome, acts like IE, then it might as well be either.
Looks matter more than speed, encryption, ... to first adopters.
