Resizing the browser window while loading a heavy frames based tab in the background screws up the innerheight value for that tab's frames.

The newly created window space isn't being used.
You might need a few tries to reproduce this as it only happens when the frame page is being rendered, And you resize the browser on a different tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open a hefty (frames) page
2.while this loads / renders go to an other tab, and resize the window
3.notice the new window size isn't being used, and there appears a white border where the new usable window space is. 
4.The scrollbars aren't extended either, and scrolling to the end of the page does what it should as if the window would still be small.
Actual Results:  
A white bar is rendered in the new free space, instead of the documents being stretched.

Expected Results:  
firefox 2 behavior would be nice,

This build runs on linux, with no extentions.
