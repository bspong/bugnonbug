I'm not so sure this is a bug.
Since I have updated to this version. Sometimes I try to close a site that I can see is just a scam and it brings up a pop up window saying stuff like are you sure you want to leave and I refuse to click on those so I go to control alt delete and end program... When I open up firefox again it takes me right back to that scam site and I can't close it manually I have to control alt delete again. Then I open up firefox for the 3rd time then finally it gives some oops error. Before I upgraded I used to be able to when opening firefox after a crash get the option of selecting "restore previous session" or "start new session" so I would like to select the "start new session" so that I don't go back to this scam site but since this upgrade I don't get those buttons at all anymore. A great example is grantsourcedirect.org or grantsforcitizens.org there's a million sites like this where if you try to close the browser or tab or go to a different website boom there's the millions of popup windows even though I have popups disabled. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to a scam website and try to close the browser, tab or go to another website
2.open new browser after ending program, takes you back to the scam website
3.open new browser for 3rd time get error message
Actual Results:  
takes me back to the same website or gives error message on 3rd end program

Expected Results:  
should have given the options; "restore previous session" or "start new session"

I have pop ups disabled within firefox settings so these "pop ups" aren't really popups somehow they're some kind of scams to get people to click more things.
