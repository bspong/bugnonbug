Many applications in OS X are designed to allow you to drag and drop things in various ways, including dragging and dropping URLs from browsers (or other applications) into places where either an HTML link, the text URL itself, or a link with the title of the page as the text would be useful. For example, if a user wishes to share a page being read (or a Twitter tweet, which I use as a reference in my demonstration movie) with someone via instant message.
