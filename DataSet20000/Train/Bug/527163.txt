Moving a bookmark within a bookmark folder, moves the bookmark to root list.

To organize my bookmarks, I have created some folders.  My "bookmarks" dropdown contains a list of these folders as well as bookmarks that don't fit into any category/folder.

When I bookmarked a page (and created a new folder within a folder..i.e. I created a "XYZ" folder inside the root "ABC" folder.  I wanted the new bookmark inside "XYZ".  Firefox created the new folder and placed the bookmark inside this 2nd-level deep folder - as expected.

I then looked at the bookmark dropdown menu, and noticed the new 2nd level folder was in "ABC", but below all the others.  I wanted to drag it near the top of the "ABC" folder, between two other "2nd level" folders.  However, as I clicked the bookmark with my mouse, and attempted to drag it up, the "insertion line" (which indicates where it will be dropped) was NOT in the "ABC" folder, where my mouse was...it was in the root folder.  In other words, "XYZ" would be a peer of "ABC" rather that contained within "ABC".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Bookmark a web page.
2.When asked where to save it, create a new sub-folder (inside a root folder)
3.return to the browser
4.click "Bookmarks"
5.inside the root level folder, locate the 2nd level folder containing the new bookmark
6.drag that 2nd-level folder up or down
7.Firefox indicates where it'll be relocated by either highlighting a parent folder or draws a line between two existing bookmarks.
Actual Results:  
Instead of letting you move the bookmark within the 2nd level of bookmarks, it forces it back to the root level

Expected Results:  
I should be able to move my bookmark "folder" back to the root or move it within a folder off the root.
<root>
<folder A>
<folder B>
   <folder B1>
      ...B1-folder bookmar
   <folder B2>
   ...B-folder bookmark
   <new folder B3>
<folder C>

I should be able to move B3 between B1 and B2, instead it only lets me move it above/below/between the root folders A, B, C

Work around: "Bookmars/Organize Bookmarks..." will let you arrange things as you want, rather than using drag-drop method of re-arranging bookmarks.
