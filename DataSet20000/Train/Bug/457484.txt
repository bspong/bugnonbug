popup says software update failed even though I successfully updated

Firefox automatically downloaded v3.0.3 and asked me to install. I said sure. It said, software update failed. The same thing happened when I installed v3.0.2, so I knew what to do. I switched from my Limited Access account to Admin and installed it from there. Everything was dandy, I closed Firefox, switched back to my Limited Account, opened Firefox, and the popup showed up again. I wasn't concerned, I closed the program, started it up again. Same popup. Tried several more times. It keeps popping up. When I installed v3.0.2 I don't think it came up even a single time after I'd gotten the software installed through my Admin account.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Double-click Firefox icon
2.Bam! There's the pop-up.
3.Say 'okay' to pop-up and Firefox opens like normal.
4. Close Firefox
5. Repeat as many times as desired
Actual Results:  
A pop-up shows up that says:

Software Update Failed
The update could not be installed. Please make sure there are no other copies of Firefox running on your computer, and then restart Firefox to try again.

Expected Results:  
No pop-up should have occured
