If you have a page which will conduct a form POST (to itself) and you want to detect that the form will be re-posted when the user presses the refresh button on their browser you may do so (using session variables for example).  When you have detected the fact that this is a re-post you may safely redirect (Header response 303 or 302) the user back to the same page as a GET (to avoid the POSTDATA from being sent to the page again).  This works fine until the user attempts to refresh the page a second time, at which point the original POSTDATA from your first POST is saved and the browser will attempt to REPOST this data to the GET (redirected) page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. POST to a page
2. Refresh the page (and re-submit post data)
3. (Detect that the page has been re-posted) redirect back to the same page using header 303 or 302 to produce a GET request
4. Refresh the page (it will once again request to re-submit post data), clicking yes will re-post the original form data
Actual Results:  
The form data is re-posted to the last step #4 and available to the page

Expected Results:  
The data should not be posted to the page in step #4 (nor should the dialog appear which asks for permission to re-post the data)
