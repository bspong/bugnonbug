Restart recovery fails when "sessionstore.js" is locked by backup program
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:7.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0.1
Build ID: 20110928134238

Steps to reproduce:

Firefox crashed with many windows open, and IDrive, an online backup program, was running at the time. 

Windows 7, SP1. FF 7.0.1, 32-bit.


Actual results:

Restarting Firefox brought up the recovery dialog with all the windows that were giving trouble, and they reopened. Firefox then crashed again. On the second (and later) restarts, the same list of windows was reopened. Restarting Firefox with the "do not restore" button did not clear the list of windows to restart. There was no way to get back to a clean open of Firefox without a recovery popup. 

Trying to manually delete "sessionstore.js" failed, because the file was busy. Killing the online backup program released exclusive use on "sessionstore.js", allowing a proper Firefox restart.

When this happened, IDrive had been stalled for about 6 hours. There seems to be some problem between IDrive backup and Firefox which causes IDrive to stall waiting for Firefox to let go of a file, and Firefox getting into trouble because IDrive won't let go. 


Expected results:

Something more useful than what did happen. A warning that something else has
Firefox files locked would be helpful.
