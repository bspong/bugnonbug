User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:6.0.2) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.2
Build ID: 20110906102300

Steps to reproduce:

I started firefox 6.0.2 on my Ubuntu 10.10 computer. 

Some useful information:
FF runs on the control of the Linux 2.6.35-30-generic-pae kernel, with the NX bit set (NX bit set and (32-bit PAE kernel or 64-bit kernel) prevents Adobe Flash from writing to the memory of Firefox=Firefox doesn't crash, but the Flash plugin does).

Network connection is via Huawei E1752 3G (GPRS/UMTS/HSPA) USB modem.


Actual results:

Case I: Firefox didn't showed up on the desktop, not even an desktop icon. Instead it claimed that firefox was started, wich it wasn't.
Case II: Firefox showed a blank (white) screen with no user interface components on it, see the attached image, please.

Case I happend first, it was solved by doing this:
kill -9 $(pgrep firefox)
Then Case II began to show.


Expected results:

Case I: Firefox should had shown itself after being started.
Case II: Firefox should draw its GUI.

Case II was fixed with this workaround:
1) Remove USB 3G modem
Here Firefox goes out of the livelock, and immidiately draws the GUI, and on each and every tab FF displays that it cannot connect to the websever.
I guess it goes out of blocking call on every tab with an error from the kernel telling there are no internet connection.
2) Reconnect it
3) Enter PIN code
4) for each tab: click try reconnect again button

I discovered the connection troubles with LostIRC (a simple IRC client), wich wrote Error Cannot connect to server.

In my opinion Firefox should draw its GUI no matter whether there is a internet connection or not.
