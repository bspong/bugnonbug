Installer sets Firefox 3 as default browser and there's no silent unattend switch.

Hello,
When I install Firefox 3 RTM on Windows XP or Vista using the /INI=path\config.ini
for a silent unattended installation, there's no way to avoid Firefox 3 to be setup as the default browser.
It's not the same question as the bug # 433249.
I want to deploy firefox silently using an unattended answer file (config.ini) and set there an option like "SetAsDefaultAppUser=False" and "SetAsDefaultAppGlobal=False"
Thx for modifying the NSI installer according to my request and needs :-)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. setup.exe /INI=path\config.ini

Actual Results:  
Firefox is set as the default browser

Expected Results:  
Firefox should not be set as the default browser

My corporate default profile for Firefox already turns off the user prompt asking if firefox should be the default browser.

Currently my workaround is to execute:
"%systemroot%\system32\ie4uinit.exe" -reinstall
So that IE is set back as the default browser in my corporate environment.
