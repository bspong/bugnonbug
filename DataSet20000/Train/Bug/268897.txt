How about adding a feature that would allow user to open all the links painted
with mouse in new tabs or windows. Many pages contain a list of links that must
be clicked individually to see the contents of the pages but if user could open
multiple links with a couple of mouse moves it would become easy to see such pages.

Instead of tabs it could be handy to have links opened in a new kind of a
viewing system. The system could be something like a normal image viewing
program (without thumbs, only slides) but it would display web content. There
would be a list (not necessary visible) of sites that are to be viewed with this
page viewer. User then clicks next and previous buttons to view through all the
pages. Maybe user should be able to drop out non interesting links.

An example about the first and the latter combined.

User enters a FTP-directory containing multiple images. Instead of clicking them
all, user paints all the files, chooses "viewer" from the right button menu and
then is able to view the images easily in one browser window. This would work
for web pages containing image url catchers etc. After dropping out poor images
user could then press choose "save files" making a nightmare to be easy downloading.
