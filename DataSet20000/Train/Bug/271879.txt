Mouse cursor flickers heavily when page is loading

On pages which take some time to load, Firefox causes the mouse cursor to
flicker badly. This only happens in the client area of the screen where the
webpage is due to appear. Moving the cursor onto the sidebar, address bar,
toolbar, or menu bar halts the flickering. Once the cursor is moved back into
the client area again, (provided the page is still loading), the flickering
starts again.

Once the page has completed loading, the flickering does not happen at all!

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into www.theaa.co.uk.
2. Click "Traffic News" at the bottom of the screen.
3. Enter a location (I chose "Leeds/Bradford" if that makes a difference).
4. Click OK.
5. Observe the cursor flickering whilst the site is loading the required data.

Actual Results:  
Badly flickering cursor after step 2 and after step 4. This ceased when cursor
was positioned over any screen area other than the page client area. Recommences
when cursor is returned to the client area again.

Expected Results:  
The cursor should remain static on the 'busy' pointer, with no continous
flickering in the client area.

Probably seems to occur on any pages that take a considerable amount of time to
load, (regardless of whether this is sheer size, or the amount of traffic).
