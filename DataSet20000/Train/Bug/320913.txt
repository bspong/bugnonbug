A session cookie is set with the following attributes:
Name: login-cookie
Content: test-xyz
Host: cookie.inbos.com.au
Path: /
Send For: Encrypted connections only
Expires: at end of session

The cookie is accepted by Firefox, but when the page is reloaded, firefox does not send the cookie.
I tested this with Konqueror and IE and they both accept and send the cookie back for subsequent pages.
I can make this work in firefox by changing the path from "/" to "//" but this seems to be a bug... Sorry if I'm wrong.
The URL https://cookie.inbos.com.au demonstrates this - to see if the cookie is being sent back, just press the reload button.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to https://cookie.inbos.com.au
2.Hit reload button - cookie not sent back.
3.
Actual Results:  
A cookie was set on the browser, but firefox did not send it back when page was reloaded.

Expected Results:  
I would expect firefox to resubmit the cookie when the page is reloaded.
