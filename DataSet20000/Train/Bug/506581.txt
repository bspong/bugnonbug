After installing 3.5 I configured it to:

Open windows and tabs from last time
Use custom settings for history
Not automatically start in a private browsing session
Remember my browsing history for at least 5 days
and not clear browsing history when closing

I then immediately closed it, and upon reopening it my homepage was returned.

I am concerned after seeing that many reports like this were labeled as duplicates of drastically different reportsand a similar problem ignored in 1.0.8, I hope this will be read carefully.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Adjust settings as described
2.Open a tab or two
3.restart Firefox 3.5.
Actual Results:  
Homepage

Expected Results:  
Some tabs

There is a very slight chance that my laptop's substandard construction is at fault, it has also refused to ever compile anything.
