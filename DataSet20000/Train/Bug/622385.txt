Firefox crashes when attempting to make changes to 'Contents' tab in Preferences folder.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0b8) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b8

I had temporarily enabled the 'Enable Javascript' box in the 'Contents' folder to watch a Youtube video for five minutes. 

After watching the video, I attempted to disable the 'Enable Javascript' box, but, when I tried clicking on it, was not able to 'uncheck' the box. I then attempted to 'uncheck' both the 'Load images automatically' and the 'Block Pop-up windows' boxes with no success. 

I had to 'force quit' Firefox and restart it in order to be able to make subsequent changes to the tabs in the 'Contents' folder. 

I have had a local hacker compromise my computer over the last 3 months, and I suspect it is the same individual/group that is trying again to hack into my computer. 

Please help! Please respond!

Best, 

Rodrigo

Reproducible: Didn't try

Actual Results:  
I tend not to enable JavaScript on my Firefox browser as I have heard that it is an easy entry point for hackers to gain access and/or control of one's computer when JavaScript is enabled.


I believe my computer was compromised by a local hacker within the last three months, who had managed to gain administrative access to my account. 

I had to get my computer fixed by security professionals after I got the 'blue screen of death' whenever I tried to start my MacBook up. 

I don't want this to happen again and am extremely vigilant overall with my computer security now, to the point of outright paranoia. People in your industry tell me that this is considered 'normal.'
