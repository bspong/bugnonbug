CTRL-C does not copy text in text entry boxes to clipboard

When I highlight some text in a text box and press CTRL-C it is often not copied to the clipboard. Pressing CTRL-X to cut and using the Copy function on the context menu works OK.

It seems to happen at random. So far I have only observed it happening with in-page text boxes, mostly single line ones rather than multi-line text areas. The Awesome Bar does not seem to be affected.

One site which almost always does it is imageshack.us. Other sites, including Bugzilla, do it from time to time. It seems to happen more often when the text has been filled in by the web site, e.g. the image links on imageshack.us. Only Firefox is affected, other apps work normally.

I have tried a clean profile, it still happens. It also happens on my work machine from time to time which has a completely different profile and is running on Windows 7 x86.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter text into text box or have web site fill it in
2. Select some or all of the text and press CTRL-C
3. Selected text is not copied to clipboard, verify by trying to paste it.
Actual Results:  
Text not copied

Expected Results:  
Text should be on clipboard

I thought it might be related to the "Copy Plain Text" extension, but as it happens with a clean profile that rules out extensions.
