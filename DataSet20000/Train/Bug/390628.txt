On a forum I browse frequently, any attempt to post a message comes back with an error saying the message body field is empty (i.e. the site thinks I haven't typed anything in the box, when in fact I have).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Register an account on the forums - link above.
2. Go to any topic and try to make a post.
3. Receive the error message.
Actual Results:  
After hitting the "post" button, I get the error message "MESSAGE_BODY is a mandatory field. You must enter a value for it."

Expected Results:  
It should have posted my message and refreshed the thread, so that I could see the results.
