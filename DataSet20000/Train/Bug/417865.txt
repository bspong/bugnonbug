Logging into a webct / blackboard site causes browser to crash with adblock enabled

I have a new issue with either the current nightly or the previous one as I had a discussion post required for my class due on Wednesday and the issue wasn't present. Apparently adblock plus 0.7.5.3 being enabled (went through the addons one by one once a standard profile didn't cause this problem) along with a recent version of blackboard's webct (also known as webcourses at some universities) and loading the initial webct webpage after log in causes the browser to crash. This did not happen before, as a matter of fact an issue with webct was just fixed so maybe someone developed a bug fix without taking into account this new code that's been patched in a few days ago. The bug I'm referencing is this one: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=412324 . For me the specific problem occurs with my school's webcourses page (latest webct version i believe) its: webcourses.ucf.edu and it happens after logging in while the browser is loading the page after clicking "ok" on the page. Ad block has the easylist+easyelement filter installed however deleting it doesn't make a difference. With no filters it causes this problem as well, only disabling works. I also tried the latest Dev build (0.7.5.3+ 2008011108) I have a few crash reports on it:

Note that this doesn't seem to be an adblock problem due to the fact that I had adblock installed and enabled when the patch for bug 412324 landed. This seems to be a problem caused by a patch within the last 3 days at very most.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have latest adblock installed (mine was 0.7.5.3)
2. Nightly build 2008021504 
3. Log into a webcourses / webct / latest blackboard site such as webcourses.ucf.edu
