Try to save a file with an underscore in the file name and either it doesn't work at all and treats the file like a folder such that it puts a slash after the file name, or it tries to save it as an octet-stream.
Pretty reproducible. 
The same link in internet explorer works fine.
If I get rid of the underscore in the file name, it also works fine.
Compare these links, with the same file with and without and underscore in the title. The files are in the same directory on the server. Everything else is the same except the file name.

ftp://firefox:bugreport@nima.myftp.org:1357/render_final.zip
ftp://firefox:bugreport@nima.myftp.org:1357/renderfinal.zip

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Try to follow a ftp link to a file that has an underscore in the title, I'm not sure if the login information needs to be in the link to reproduce this bug.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
File treated as a directory, or firefox saves it as an octet-stream

Expected Results:  
To save the target file

Same link works in IE, so the problem is likely with firefox and not with the server.
