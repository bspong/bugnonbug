Wait longer to get correct filename for "save link as"
Created attachment 556190
Wait for 4 seconds instead of 1 second for download filename.

I run into this everyday on Bugzilla, and I bet you do too.  I right-click an attachment and click "save link as", and about 1/3rd of the time I get "attachment.cgi" as the filename, instead of whatever the patch/filename actually is (from the content-disposition header).

A little poking (and help from biesi on IRC) reveals that we wait 1 second for the reply from the webserver (to get the content-dispostion filename), and if we haven't heard back, we use the URI basename as the filename:

  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=299372#c184

1 second is not long enough.  I understand there is some concern with popping up a dialog in a "reasonable" timeframe, but a perusal of our telemetry data (yay!  A decision based on actual data!) reveals that only around half of HTTP requests are getting their 1st byte back in less than 1 second:

   https://metrics.mozilla.com/pentaho/content/pentaho-cdf-dd/Render?solution=metrics&path=telemetry/&file=TelemetryHistogram.wcdf

(page takes a while to load: select the HTTP_PAGE_OPEN_TO_FIRST_RECEIVED metric.)

This means we're losing the correct filename a lot of the time (especially for HTTPS sites like Bugzilla, users on low-latency connections, etc.).

The attached patch bumps our default wait time from 1 to 4 seconds.  I pulled that number out of a hat, and I suggest we give our UI experts the final say.  We pay them to paint the sheds...

I've created the following page where you can both verify the behavior here, and try out different timeout values (by setting the browser.download.saveLinkAsFilenameTimeout pref):

Parity issues: 

Chrome doesn't set a timeout at all--they simply wait for the content-disposition header for as long as it takes (I tried the 60 second link on my CGI page, nothing longer).  That seems dumb.

IE: according to 

    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=299372#c12

IE pops the download window right away in the "Getting file information" state, and once that completes the file picker shows up with the "proper" filename.  (Also seems dumb if it takes 60 seconds?).  I haven't verified this, and the comment is from 2005.

I think our UI is actually good here, as long as we use a longer timeout.
