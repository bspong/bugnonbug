cannot manually select text cursor location, or copy/cut text, within a number of text boxes

Problem has most notably been found while posting on a variety of messageboards - particularly Invision Boards. Simply put, the text cursor cannot be manipulated in any way whatsoever. I can highlight text with the mouse cursor, but copy/cut do nothing, and backspace is ineffective as well. If I highlight and begin typing, the text stays highlighted, but the new text I entered is still placed wherever the default cursor location is.

I have tested the issue on multiple systems, running both Windows 7 64-bit and Windows XP 32-bit. In both occasions, reverting back to Firefox 3.5.8 has adequately solved the issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a messageboard text box in Firefox 3.6
2. Attempt to position the text cursor manually
Actual Results:  
Cursor positioning fails. Text can ONLY be manipulated by basic keyboard commands (backspace, delete, insert, ordinary typing).

Expected Results:  
Should have been able to maneuver the cursor at will.

NOTE: This problem does not apply to ALL textboxes across the board. It appears to only apply to textboxes encoded certain ways.

I am uncertain what sort of coding is utilized here, but Invision Boards use PHP, if that helps any at all.

I would consider this a major issue; however, it only affects certain types of websites. Until I discovered I could fix the issue by reverting to 3.5.8, though, my temporary workaround WAS to resort to using Chrome until I could solve the issue. Though I do find Firefox to be drastically superior to Chrome, this problem DOES significantly hinder my Internet usage, and enough that Chrome was a more pleasant experience at the time.
