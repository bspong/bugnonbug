This bug does NOT occur on my 32 bit system. Only on my 64 bit system. I am using Window 7 Home Premium on both computers. Use the about URL to go to the page before the failure. There are some links in a column on the right end of each line. There are two types of links. TEXT is a page that displays the info as text. IMAGE is a page that displays the info as a graphic. Just to make sure that we are doing the same thing scroll down the page to the name "George, Herman". Then click on IMAGE. On my 64 bit system the result is a black screen. Repeated attempts result in a white screen. On my 32 bit system the result is a PDF page with Obituaries that are scanned images. The page is also positioned at the name from the previous page in the PDF image.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to the indicated URL.
2.Click on blue IMAGE.
3.
Actual Results:  
Black screen. White screen in additional attempts.

Expected Results:  
Display image of the obituary for the selected person.

I get around this by running my netbook computer to display the desired image. However, this is not the only web site that this problem occurs on. It also occurs on ancestry.com but that is a pay to subscribe web site. The one suggested above can be accessed by anyone.
