Firefox - CD/HDD relative addressing issue when using frames
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-GB; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041110 Firefox/1.0

On my c: drive, I've got a web page which uses frames, and it works fine with
both FF and IE6.  I have a second web page with a link pointing to the first
page; this link works OK with IE6, but not with FF - FF finds the first web
page OK, but then fails to load the frames.  

My two web pages are in different folders, and the problem is that when FF tries
to load the frames, *it looks in the wrong folder*.  Whereas IE6 recognises that
the addresses of the pages it needs are relative to the folder containing the
first web page, FF treats the addresses as being relative to the folder
containing the second page (i.e. the one with the hyperlink).

I don’t have much knowledge of HTML, but I figure that this may be a bug in FF.
(I apologise in advance if the problem is in my HTML.)  The problem can be
easily reproduced as follows:

c:/test0/page1.htm
   <HTML><FRAMESET rows=40,* >
   <FRAME src="page1A.htm">
   <FRAME src="page1B.htm">
   </FRAMESET></HTML>

c:/test0/page1A.htm
   <HTML>
   <P>Top<P>
   </HTML>

c:/test0/page1B.htm
   <HTML>
   <P>Bottom<P>
   </HTML>

c:/test1/Test Link.htm 
   <HTML> 
   <P><A HREF="..\test0\pagel.htm"> Test Link<A><P>
   </HTML>

When this link is executed, FF loads c:/test0/page1.htm OK, but then it looks
for the two frames in c:\test1\ rather than c:\test0\, and of course they are
not there.
