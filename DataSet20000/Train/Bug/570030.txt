Ebay requires that a graphic six digit number be copied by user. When Firefox is used, the number is always rejected.

Ebay has a facility by which buyers and sellers can communicate. A message box is filled in and a six digit graphic number must be copied.  Ebay repeatedly rejects the number claiming that it is incorrect. Rebooting Firefox or the computer does not make any difference. Same process in Google browser or IE results in no problem. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the description page of some item on ebay
2. To the right of the page there is a link to send a message to the seller
3. After clicking the link a page is presented with a message box. Put something
   in the message box.
4. Below that is a six digit number you must reproduced in order to demonstrate you are not some kind of bot. Fill in the number.
5. Press the send button,
You will then get an error message from ebay saying that you did not put in the correct number.
Actual Results:  
Continual rejection of number and therefore no sending of message to seller.

Expected Results:  
It should have sent my message to the seller, and a confirmation screen would have been displayed to me.
