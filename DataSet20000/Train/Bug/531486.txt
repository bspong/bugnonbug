Firefox 3.6b4 process does not terminate when window is closed
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2b4) Gecko/20091124 Firefox/3.6b4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When using Firefox 3.5 Beta 4, the process will not terminate when the window is closed. Im not quite sure if its a Firefox issue or a Windows issue as I have not tested it on a Linux or Solaris system. Its just really annoying to have to use task manager to terminate the process. 

Sidenote: I also have a build of Firefox 3.5.5 installed for comparison testing but it doesn't do this when I close it. Will include dump file and screencap in attachments

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox 3.6 beta 4
2.Close window
3.Try to open any Firefox Build with any Profile
4.Error message stating that Firefox is already running
5.Open task manager to terminate process
Actual Results:  
Process terminates only through task manager

Expected Results:  
Firefox process should terminate when window closes

Bug occurs with default theme as well as Nautopolis version 1.8.52
