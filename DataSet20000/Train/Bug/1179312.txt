Crash OOM | small InfallibleAllocator not so from PR_Assert; 44 windows 347 tabs open

Steps to reproduce:

So 44 windows and 347 taps is certainly A LOT. FF is taking 3GB of virtual memory as reported by process explorer. Also, this version of process explorer (v16.04) reports GPU memory. I have 65MB dedicated GPU memory--it's a laptop with integrated Intel graphics. But i have 1.6GB (10%, apparently) of System GPU Memory--which again is A LOT. That was reading at 1.4GB, when FF crashed, again, according to process explorer.

I'm not sure FF is supposed to handle this many windows and tabs.

But i filed the bug because the stack trace contains

nsTArray_base<nsTArrayInfallibleAllocator, nsTArray_CopyWithMemutils>::EnsureCapacity(unsigned int, unsigned int)

which i assume is supposed to prevent OOM crashes, and yet, it, itself, crashes with OOM.

This crash, too, was the same thing:

Actual results:

FF crashed and brought up the crash reporter.


Expected results:

FF should not crash, or at least not here.
