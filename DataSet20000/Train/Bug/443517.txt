Two days ago I was automatically updated from Firefox 2.0.0.12  to 2.0.0.15.
Although the 2.0.0.12 ran fine, with the newer version I have a great deal of difficulty printing from the web. (It's impossibly difficult) Only one sheet or two will print and several pages will be omitted from what should be a multiple page printout. I can't seem to find a remedy no matter what I do. I have a HP Deskjet 6988. It's not the printer-- Safari still prints fine! 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Select a web page from splitcoaststampers.com gallery or from a blog that includes pictures
2.Choose file and then print; pick print from the print dialogue box, choose to print all pages or whatever selected pages are desired to print. The print Preview will most likely show that significant parts of the material that is supposed to print have been omitted. 
3.Check with preview if desired
Actual Results:  
The printed material leaves out significant parts that are not printed. Even in the print preview view these pages are omitted.

Expected Results:  
All parts of the web page should print unless selected otherwise and ALL parts of the page should show in print preview.
