Any Firefox extension that adds a <menupopup> child element to Firefox's context menu causes the context menu to appear horizontally with up and down arrows that need to be hovered over in order to scroll. This is very undesirable and the normal vertical menu is much preferable. Part of the reason is that the scrolling needs to be judged exactly and if an arrow is hovered over for an instant too long the menu will scroll to the wrong page. The other reason is aesthetic - the horizontal context menu looks and feels awful.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7375
2. Right click on a webpage.

Actual Results:  
The undesirable horizontal context menu appears. Uninstalling the extension in Firefox 3 or using Firefox 2.x causes the context menu to revert to the far more preferable vertical menu.

Expected Results:  
The Firefox context menu changed to be horizontal instead of vertical.

The normal vertical context menu should have appeared.
