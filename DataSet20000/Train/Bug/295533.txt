Opening several links from Outlook 2003, then closing first window, causes links/address bar to stop working
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

Using Microsoft Outlook 2003, with Firefox (v1.4) initially closed:
When viewing an email with several links and then clicking on those links,
Firefox opens several new windows.  Initially, everything works fine.  However,
if I then close the first window opened (the one corresponding to the first link
clicked in the email), the links in the remaining windows stop working (i.e.
nothing happens if you click on them).  Furthermore, the address bar also stops
working (i.e. typing, for instance, www.google.com, and hitting enter does nothing).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure Firefox is not running
2. open (any) email with several links in Microsoft Outlook
3. Click on those links, opening several new browser windows
4. Close the first of those new windows that opened (the one corresponding to
the first link clicked in the email)
5. Click on any link in any of the other windows, or type a new address in the
address bar and hit enter

Actual Results:  
Nothing

Expected Results:  
Go to the page of the link clicked or the address entered
