Firefox comes with a built in 'google' search keyword. when you use it,
the keyword is included in the search phrase


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. type

  google firefox keyword search bookmark

in the address bar and press enter.


Actual Results:  
the keyword ("google" in this case) is included in
the search text %1 that is expanded. i.e. Firefox opens the URL

http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sourceid=navclient&gfns=1&q=google+firefox+keyword+search+bookmark



Expected Results:  
should go to

http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sourceid=navclient&gfns=1&q=firefox+keyword+search+bookmark

(no extra "google+")



This also happens for user defined search keywords; I defined a shorter bookmark with the keyword 'g'

http://www.google.com/search?q=%s

and when I type

   g firefox keyword search bookmark

I end up at the URL

   http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sourceid=navclient&gfns=1&q=g+firefox+keyword+search+bookmark

which should be

http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sourceid=navclient&gfns=1&q=firefox+keyword+search+bookmark

instead
