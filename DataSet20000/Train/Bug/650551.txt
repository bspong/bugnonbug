Firefox stops responding as soon as any website is visited, can't be killed with Ctrl-Q or kill -9
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

I've got a profile that I can't visit any non-about:* sites with. The binary is fine (I'm writing this with a clean profile but that binary).

Things that I have tried:

- disabled all extensions (although I haven't actually removed them)
- disabled all plugins

I don't know what else to do. It works fine to visit about:{sessionrestore,blank,addons} tabs, but as soon as I press ENTER after typing in a URL the browser hangs dead--to the point where I need to hard reboot my system to get the process to die. (Which additionally means that TalkBack never gets a chance to run, none of these have been reported.)

Output of `ps aux` looks like: 
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
bwm       2631  0.4  0.0      0     0 pts/2    Zl+  17:22   0:02 [firefox-bin] <defunct>

A Weird Thing that's going on is that top and system monitor (and ps) are reporting CPU usage of <1%, but the system monitor applet in gnome-panel is reporting 100% CPU usage, and my CPU's fan is on like it's been running at 100%.

I know that this report isn't actually useful, if you can suggest any things for me to do to actually provide you with useful information I would be happy to do them.
