Cursor style incorrect after clicking

When clicking on an element with the cursor style set, the cursor reverts the default (arrow) cursor until the cursor is moved off the element (and over an element with a different cursor style), then back over the first element.

This behavior appears to be unlike Firefox 2, IE 6 and 7, Opera 9.61, Safari 3, and Chrome.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a page with this code in it:

  <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
  <html>
    <body>
      <span style="cursor: pointer">click</span>
    </body>
  </html>


2. Hover over the word "click."  The cursor switches to a pointer.  Good.
3. Click.  The cursor switches back to an arrow.  Bad.

Actual Results:  
Cursor switches back to an arrow.

Expected Results:  
Cursor should remain a pointer.

Attaching a mousemove handler which logs to Firebug's console reveals that from javascript, the style appears to still be "pointer" even though it is being displayed as the default arrow.  Setting the element.cursor.style to 'pointer' seems to have no effect, nor does triggering a reflow (say, but changing font size).

As yet, I cannot find a way to work around this issue.  If anyone can figure out how to fix the cursor in this scenario (javascript hack, css hack, different HTML elements, anything...), I'd love to hear them.  Thanks!
