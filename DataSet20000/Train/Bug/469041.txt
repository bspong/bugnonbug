Enhancement to remove "A Little Housekeeping" where it appears in Installer UI.

"A Little Housekeeping" seems patronising; if it is worth reporting the current step to the user at all, then this should describe, in general non-technical terms, what is happening, for example using verbs such as "preparing", "checking", or "finalising".  If it isn't important, then I'd remove this notice and just have the progress bar.

The term Housekeeping as applied to computer science may be a bit obscure for a general audience, and may produce confusion for users who cannot make the connection between actual housekeeping and what a computer program might call housekeeping.  For example, users with language difficulties or to whom English isn't their first language but they are using the English edition.

Those who do make the mental connection may find it unnecessarily vague: a slightly patronising introduction to installing Firefox for the first time.
