Spinoff from bug 406894.

Lim Chee Aun posted the following code in bug 406894 comment 19 which can be added to userChrome.css to change the autocomplete-history-dropmarker on Vista to menulist-button:

#urlbar > .autocomplete-history-dropmarker{
-moz-appearance: menulist-button !important;
margin: -1px -1px -1px 0 !important;
}

The result can be seen in attachment 313893.

In bug 408694 comment 24, Mike Beltzner said: "Can we get a separate bug on that filed with that patch nominated for review
and approval? That looks a lot nicer for Vista than what we have now.
", so here is the bug :)

I have only noticed one small problem with using this, which is that on secure sites, the background of the dropdown arrow button stays white while the rest of the location bar turns yellow. This would be a moot point if it is decided not to turn the location bar yellow on Windows, of course.

Reproducible: Always
