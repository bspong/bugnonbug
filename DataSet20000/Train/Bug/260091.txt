Actual Results:  
A dialogue panel is displayed on the screen:
 There is no disk in drive. Please insert a disk into drive \Device\Harddisk1\Dr1



Expected Results:  
If the application comes across a mapped drive when importing:
1. Display a dialogue to this affect
2. Drive letters from Opera or any other software will not be imported into FireFox.


Because the application does fully state the issue at hand. Any subsequent
actions within FireFox such as changing setting will re-introduce the bug.
