Default zoom too large on hi-dpi display with 200% font size
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:22.0) Gecko/20130315 Firefox/22.0
Build ID: 20130315030943

Steps to reproduce:

This is new with the latest nightly build 22.0a1 (2013-03-15).  I have a Windows 7 (x64) PC with a high-res (200dpi) monitor and therefore have set text size 200% in Window's Control Panel.  With the 200% scaling, in most applications fonts appear at the same size as they would on a 100dpi monitor under normal scaling.

Therefore I would expect Firefox to work the same way, with the default zoom level (View->Zoom->Reset) giving pixel sizes twice those you'd normally get (where 'normal' is a computer with the Windows font size set at its default 100%).


Actual results:

However, in the latest nightly, the fonts are even bigger than would be expected.  For example the Google home page is rendered so large that it doesn't fit horizontally even though the screen is 2400 physical pixels wide.  I suspect that the 200% scaling is being double-counted somehow, so Firefox is now rendering everything at *four* times the number of pixels.


Expected results:

The default zoom should render text at exactly 200% of the pixel size when Windows Control Panel is set to 200% text zoom.  This will match what other applications do.  Please revert back to the behaviour that applied before the most recent nightly build (2013-03-15).  If you can't reproduce this or would like a screenshot let me know.
