Graphics get blanked out
This site shows pictures of coins and does a PTM (Polynomial Texture Map) with the.  The page initially shows the front and back of a coin.  When you click on one of the faces, a pop-up window shows a larger view with controls where you can change the lighting of the object.  After a few seconds of clicking on the windows and adjusting the lighting, either the pictures of the coins in the main browser window or the larger picture of the coin in the pop-up winder will go blank.  re-sizing the pop-up window or re-loading the page temporarily clears up the problem.

  This is another Java plug-in.   FireFox has trouble with these, but the CHI website seems to see problems with the applet PTM view a lot.  The  picture of the coin is displayed briefly and then the goes to white frame.  IE has trouble with this also.  Clicking on a picture normally results in a pop-up set of windows that display and allow control of the relief view.  This initially works, but quickly becomes grayed out.

   Same kind of graphic as the last one.  This one works fine.
