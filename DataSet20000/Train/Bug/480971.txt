"Firefox has encountered a problem and needs to close..."
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011913 Firefox/3.0.6

Details of error message are:
Windows cannot find 'http://oca.microsoft.com/resredir.aspx?SID=1778&BucketTable=1&iBucket=1061515203&LCID=1033&OS=5.1.2600.2.00010100.3'
This almost immeditately occurs, after clicking on a page from a Google search.
It also occurred when going to my Email link (Yahoo) to verify and set up this bug report account. I have tried uninstalling Firefox 3.0.6, Installing older 2.0
to see if that fixed it. No such luck. Then upgraded back to latest release
3.0.6 but the bug is still there, and appears connected to what content
I am searching. i.e. no problem on this site, and it is stable. Going to any
Google or Yahoo search page will immediately trip the bug. Example:
Record Stores/Phoenix (in Google) - generates stable page. Clicking on ANY of the record stores listed on page results in the ERROR message.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Google (anything...local record stores, Barak Obama, whatever)
3.Click on ANY entry on the results page
Actual Results:  
"Firefox has encountered an error and needs to close...etc"

Expected Results:  
Go to site

This is a recent problem...I have had Firefox for years and never had this repeated occurrence of crashing.

PS: My OS is WIN XP Pro  with SP3 and all updates  running 2.8 Gig Pentium IV
    with 1.02 Gig DDram. on a Dell Demension 2400.
