Wheb trying to preview/debug a html page with Firefox in Dreamweaver, the first time I try, I may be able to open the page but after that a message appears: Firefox failled to find "index.html  preceeded by the complete address.If in  Firefox I go to the same address it opens fine. 
Yesterday I had the same problem with the following website <http://www.chantal-jumel-kolam-kalam.com/pages/pagehommages/hommages.html>. Some pages opened then others didn't, no apparent reason.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.restart Firefox
2.from Dreamweaver try Preview/debug in Firefox
3.The first time the page may appear but later it doesn't.
Actual Results:  
After one try at the most, the following message appears:
"File Not Found
Firefox can't find the file at /Macintosh HD/Users/soandso/Sites/billy2/index.html."
which is the right address

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have opened the page as expected

When the problem appeared first the page didn't appear even the first time. Now it happens erratically the first time but later attempts do not succeed. No problem with other browsers.
