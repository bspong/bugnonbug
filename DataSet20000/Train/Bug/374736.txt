Since I got the new update tonight, I have multiple tabs that just open. I normally use about 6/8 tabs at work. For some reason, I will use the pull down menu to show tabs and there will multiple duplicates. So far the most I had was 48! The other issue is that when I open the browser, it trys to open all the windows I had open before and does it in duplicates. I have also had issues with it saving my home page. The search I did on Session Saver sounds like the issue I am seeing but found this is not a feature in the version I have. Also not in my Tools menu. 
I love FireFox but I can no longer use this browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just open the web browser
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
I just open the app, trys to log into multiple tabs. Have to stop it and then close all the tabs it has opened. And the tabs just start duplicating with me doing nothing.


This sucks, how do I fix it? Please note I am PST and work grave yards and not have access to this computer on Thursday, Friday and Sat to assist with trouble shooting.
