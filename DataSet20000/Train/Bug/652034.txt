Firefox 4 hides/reduces the text area of popular Cbox's chatboxes (HTML/Ajax chat) after restarting the browser

Firefox 4 is breaking the text area of popular Cbox's chatboxes (HTML/Ajax chat, see the website http://www.cbox.ws/ ).

If the browser is closed with a tab displaying a Cbox's chatbox, at the time of the next start, Firefox hides or reduces the text area (a zone to enter a nickname, email/URL and message).

Refreshing the page doesn't fix the broken text area.
The user needs to revalidate the website URL in the URL bar to fix the bad rendering.

Tested with new and old profiles, all cookies deleted or not, bug still present.
Tested on a chatbox hosted on Cbox.ws servers or personal server, bug present.

Works with Firefox 3.6.16 (and earlier versions) and various OSes (XP SP3/Vista SP2). 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a tab with a Cbox's chatbox (like http://kanon81.cbox.ws/ )
2. Be sure the text area on the bottom is present (fields to enter nickname/email/message)
3. Close Firefox with the tab open
4. Restart Firefox and look at the tab
Actual Results:  
Firefox 4 is breaking the text area after restarting it.

Example with the chatbox http://kanon81.cbox.ws/ (you can search "cbox.ws" on Google to find other examples of chats):
* fields of text area are reduced, see http://i54.tinypic.com/15rfnm1.png
* complete text area is missing, see http://i52.tinypic.com/291fakx.png

Expected Results:  
Firefox 4 should display the text area of Cbox's chatbox after restarting.
