After hiding the toolbar in a browser window, the gradient in the titlebar is not updated, and does not blend well with the rest of the interface.

Opening a new window without a toolbar renders a correct gradient, but also renders a thin separator line that should not be there, except maybe in the default theme when the toolbar is hidden and the bookmarks bar is visible (because it has its own gradient; does not apply to other toolbars, afaict). Adding the toolbar to said new window correctly redraws the titlebar gradient, however.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a new window with the navigation toolbar.
2a. Hide the navigation toolbar.
   -OR-
2b. Press the toolbar toggle button to the right of the window.
    (it probably has a proper name)
Actual Results:  
Ugly unfinished gradient.

Expected Results:  
The titlebar should feature a full gradient, blending well with whatever other toolbars are below it.

This is the full list of behaviors I could find:

* Hiding nav toolbar in a window: unfinished gradient, no separator.
* New window without nav toolbar: correct gradient, unnecessary separator.
* Toolbar toggle button (with nav toolbar): unfinished gradient, unnecessary separator (should blend with the tab bar).
* Toolbar toggle button (without nav toolbar): gradient stays correct, separator pops out of nothing, possibly creating a double separator effect.
