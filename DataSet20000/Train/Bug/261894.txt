Intentionally malformed URL disables Firefox UI
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Powergiraffe/0.9.2 (Firefox/0.9.2)

I was just experimenting with another app (which uses ShellExecute to launch
Firefox, as Firefox is the default browser), giving it intentionally screwed up
URLs in an attempt to simulate someone trying to hack the app.

I tried several different URLs; the one listed above was the last.  I'm not
completely certain which one killed the UI.


Reproducible: Didn't try
Steps to Reproduce:
With Firefox running in the background (with several different pages open in
tabs), call ShellExecute from another app, passing the following URLs (as
documents) in turn:

http://%08%08%08%08%08%08%08notepad
http://%08%08%08%08%08%08%08file://notepad
http://%08%08%08%08%08%08%08file:///notepad  (twice)
Actual Results:  
Interestingly, the first URL navigated to http://www.notepad.org/; the next two
navigated to http://www.fileplanet.com/.  And after the series of four URLs I
noticed that the UI had gone dead.  I'm not certain when it happened -- even
while "dead" the ShellExecute calls will still bring up a new page as normal.

By "killing the UI" what I mean is that all the menus can still be dropped down,
but selecting ANY menu option does nothing.  You can switch between tabs (and
see the different pages), but the Address Bar does not update (the window
caption does, however).  Right-clicking on a page does nothing (no context
menu).  Trying to navigate to "about:blank" works; trying "about:" just stalls
endlessly.  That's about all I tried before closing the window (and then having
to manually terminate the process, because it was left dangling after the window
closed).

Expected Results:  
I'm really not sure why fileplanet got opened (unless they've registered
www.file.com perhaps?) -- but that isn't the problem.

Clearly it shouldn't have broken the UI like that!
