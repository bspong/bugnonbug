Fidelity Investments' Advanced Charts never worked with Firefox on the Mac (MacBook Pro), neither the new version nor prior versions.  The Advanced Charts also do not work correctly with Google Chrome or Apple Safari on the Mac.  They do work perfectly with MS Internet Explorer on a PC or a PC within my Mac (VM Ware Fusion).  Possibly a JavaScript plug-in issue?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Fidelity.com and log on to one's account 
2. Get a stock quote on a pop-up page
3. Select detailed quote at bottom of page
4. Select Snapshot for stock
5. Select Advanced Chart
6. Attempt to use the functions on this Advanced Chart page
Actual Results:  
Lack of functionality. No charts appear and nothing works.

Expected Results:  
Full functionality, as when using MS Internet Explorer on a PC or a PC within my Mac.

My JavaScript is up to date.  Google Chrome and Apple Safari on the Mac show the charts but do not function properly. Need to have a Fidelity account to log on in order to access Advanced Charts.
