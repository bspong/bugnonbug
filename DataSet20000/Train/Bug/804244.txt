We assume fonts like DejaVu Serif exist on systems, this causes 2 checks to fail
I am running the unittests on very vanilla linux 32 bit VMs.  While running the a11y tests, I find that two of them fail consistently:
2481 ERROR TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | chrome://mochitests/content/a11y/accessible/attributes/test_text.html | Attribute 'font-family' has wrong value for area16 at offset 27 - got Nimbus Roman No9 L, expected DejaVu Serif
2487 ERROR TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | chrome://mochitests/content/a11y/accessible/attributes/test_text.html | Attribute 'font-family' has wrong value for area16 at offset 27 - got Nimbus Roman No9 L, expected DejaVu Serif

In looking at test_text.html, I see that we set the cursive font family:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/accessible/tests/mochitest/attributes/test_text.html?force=1#484

Then in attributes.js, we assume that is DejaVu:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/accessible/tests/mochitest/attributes.js#240

Ahh, this makes sense.  I don't have dejavu fonts installed on my system and this test fails.

Solutions could be:
1) require test machines to have DejaVu fonts
2) determine inside the test if we have the expected fonts on the system, otherwise skip the tests.
