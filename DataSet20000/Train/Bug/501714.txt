Last tab should show close button when browser.tabs.closeWindowWithLastTab=false (missing close button, no close button on last tab, does not have)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090624 Firefox/3.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When closing tabs with the keyboard (Ctrl+W) and preference closeWindowWithLastTab=false, the last Ctrl+W clears the content in the last tab and shows a blank page. 

But in Firefox 3.5 the close button has been removed from the last open tab, so it's impossible to clear its contents with the mouse. This is inconsistent behavior between keyboard and mouse.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open about:config
2. Set preference browser.tabs.closeWindowWithLastTab=false
3. Close all tabs on the window with the close button in each tab.
Actual Results:  
The last tab doesn't show a close button.

Expected Results:  
The last tab should show the close button, pressing it should show a blank page as per the browser.tabs.closeWindowWithLastTab=false preference.

Note that this is NOT a duplicate of Bug 456425. That bug was about the default behavior when the closing the last tab closes the window, and used the option to set closeWindowWithLastTab=false as a rationale for the Wontfix. This current bug is present even when using the solution provided by bug 456425
