Can not access some x.mozilla.org Sites (without using a Proxy)
I can not access some x.mozilla.org Sites (without using a Proxy).

I can not access this Site (bugzilla.mozilla.org) to file Bug Reports (but was able to file this BR by using a Proxy) nor can I get Updates for Aurora or Nightly (though the "Release" Version of Firefox Updates just fine).

I have no problem connecting to http://www.mozilla.org/ or http://support.mozilla.org/ either.

When the Update for Aurora fails it suggests that I manually download a new Version and reinstall my Browser but the address it leads to is also inaccessable: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla-aurora/firefox-21.0a2.en-US.win32.installer-stub.exe .


When I go to about:addons and check for Updates it completes instantly (and finds none) so I suspect that a portion of the Code does not check for lack of connectivity and simply returns.


I suspect it is some sort of a connectivity problem (on your end), the Server that serves my Area is down, or the Routing has been changed in the past 2 days. A few Proxies I tried seemed to work (but the support (EG: Cookies) was incomplete) so I suspect that most People are not having this problem.


Thanks.
