Under Tools -> Options -> Content -> Advanced... (Under Fonts & Colors)

When either the Serif or Sans-serif drop down list box is single clicked around the middle of the box (not around the arrow on the right) for the first time, it changes the font name but does not pull down the box and display a list of fonts. When it is clicked again, it displays the list correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Tools -> Options -> Content -> Advanced... (Under Fonts & Colors)
2. Single click on the Serif and/or Sans-serif drop down list box around the middle of the drop down list box (not around the arrow on the right) for the first time

Actual Results:  
The drop down list box changes the font name but doesn't pull down the box.

Expected Results:  
The box is pulled down and a list of fonts is displayed.

When the drop down list box is clicked for the second time, it behaves normally.

This bug is found with the latest Firefox 3.0.1 released today, but I don't recall facing this problem in Firefox 3.0.0.
