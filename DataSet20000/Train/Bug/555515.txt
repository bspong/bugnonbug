Support Windows 98 and Windows ME(Millenium) again, the easy way

When the new version of Firefox is released it should include a seperate Windows 98 and Windows ME(Millenium) version for people in poor countries who are still using these operating systems.

There is very minimal work involved in doing this because there is already an emulator that allows Windows XP software to run on Windows 98/Windows ME called KernelEx( https://sourceforge.net/projects/kernelex/ ). 

So firefox could develop a Windows 98/ Windows ME(Millenium) installer that integrates KernelEx, so when firefox is run, KernelEx will run with it, and when firefox is closed, KernelEx will close too. You should modify KernelEx so it is only applied to firefox and not any other software on a user's computer.
You should also make sure the adobe flash 10 plugin detects firefox as Windows XP so the users can download the latest version of the adobe flash plugin and other plugins.
By the way, KernelEx is open source.

Do you think you could do this?
