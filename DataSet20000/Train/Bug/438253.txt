"Customize Toolbar" makes all bookmarks in bookmarks toolbar disappear so items can only be placed at the left end.

When you go to customize toolbar, you can drag items onto the toolbars. However, this causes the bookmarks to be replaced by "Bookmarks toolbar items" when in customize mode. This means that all items dragged to the bookmarks toolbar are placed on the far left end, and once customize is closed, those items are unmovable. Essentially, I want to be able to move items while the bookmarks are present so that I can place them where I want, not just at end where they are unmovable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Right-click on the toolbar area and go to customize.
2.Drag items onto the area that says "Bookmark toolbars area".
3.Close customize and see that all items are stuck on the left of the toolbar.
Actual Results:  
Items are stuck on the left of the bookmarks toolbar. You can't move them around.

Expected Results:  
Should be able to either drag items around after customize is closed, or show the bookmarks while customize is open so items can be placed between them.
