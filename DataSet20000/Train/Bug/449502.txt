Using Firefox 2.0.0.X on a Mac running OS X 4.11, for essentually all articles on this site, <http://townhall.com/Columnists/>, the first line of the article's text is partially obscured/blocked by two horizontal sets of 5 selection boxes.  But when using either Firefox 2.0.0.14 on eCS 1.2R (OS/2 build) or Firefox 2.0 on Xandros Linux 4.0, this blocking does not occur: the first line of article text starts below the row of selection boxes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to site <http://townhall.com/Columnists/>
2. Open any of the long list of Commentary articles
3. 
Actual Results:  
First line of article is partially obscured by row of selection boxes

Expected Results:  
Article text should start _below_ the selection boxes.

I noticed two bug reports, 313274 and 315205, that might be related to the above, but it wasn't clear to me that they were.
