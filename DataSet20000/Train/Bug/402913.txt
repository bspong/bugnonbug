Preferences with remembering passwords affects the form submit handler
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

In that page there are tree differents buttons that will call the submit action:
1.- "GO" button for the search box
2.- "GO" button for the quotes box
3.- "Sign in" for the login fields.

There is a javascript function for each textbox of those fields waiting for the user to hit "Enter" to handle the call, if you are on search after hitting Enter the button of search should handle the call, the same for quotes and login.

This happens ONLY if I this site is not listed in "Exceptions" or "Show Passwords" lists (Tools/Preferences/Security/[[Passwords Section])
