Firefox Installer should ask if it should install to Program Files on Windows
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:22.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/22.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130618035212

Steps to reproduce:

I made three attempts to install Firefox 22 on top of Firefox 21.  In the first attempt, I just ran the installer.  The default directory was an insecure location inside my Windows Profile.  I tried to override that to the existing location (c:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla\Firefox).  But the installer said I didn't have rights and didn't attempt to elevate the process.

So I reran the installer, this time as the administrator.  This time the path was the location where I had FF 21.  But again, it claimed I didn't have rights.

So I then opened FF 21 and tried to upgrade from Help/About.  That worked.


Actual results:

Firefox's installer for version 22 claimed I didn't have rights.


Expected results:

1. If Firefox is already installed, that location should be the default location regardless.

2. Ask if the user prefers the insecure location (and label it as such) or a location in Program Files or Program Files (x86) and mention those are protected by UAC.  As needed, add the location where Firefox is already installed.

3. If the user picks a location protected by UAC, attempt to elevate the process.
