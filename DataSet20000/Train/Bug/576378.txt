Improperly displays text boxes.

With Whiskey Media pages (such as Anime Vice) the comments box at the bottom of forum posts has a text box with a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) formatting bar at the top of the box, allowing you to format your text. However, with Minefield, that box shows up as a plain text box when originally writing the post.

Once I've written a post in plain text, and then submitted it, if I edit the post, the text box I get there shows up properly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any Whiskey Media (Giant Bomb, Comic Vine, Anime Vice, Tested) forum page with a comment box on the bottom.
2. Submit a comment
3. Once the comment has been submitted, edit it.
Actual Results:  
At Step 1, there is now Formatting Bar in the text box. After performing Step 3, you get the Formatting bar, but only for the post you are editing. If you go to another page, or refresh the existing page, the bar goes away. This issue does not occur in prior versions of Firefox, or with Internet Explorer or Google Chrome.

Expected Results:  
The text box should have a formatting bar at the top of the box, for controlling text formatting.
