Error when updating from beta 4 to 5. Session with tabs lost (panorama too)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; SLCC2; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E; InfoPath.3; Tablet PC 2.0)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b5) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b5

Updated from b4 to b5:
Everything went ok.
I clicked the button "Restart firefox"
It shut down and restarted automatically..
Compatibility check for extensions (everything ok)

Then a messagebox:

L'operazione non può essere completata a causa di un errore interno. Una comunicazione di rete sicura non è stata chiusa correttamente.

meaning something similar to:
Unable to complete the operation because of an internal error.
A safe network communication has not been closed properly.

if I click on "OK" the window opens up.
with all the tabs I had before but WHITE without anything in it (all "new tab")

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I don't know. I had lots of tabs open (some HTTPS)
Actual Results:  
Session LOST.
All tabs addresses / organization (with PANORAMA) ARE LOST!!!!
They are all blank (new tab)
Noreover the browser won't surf if I use that tabs.
If I type something into the address bar nothing happens.
I have to open new tab and use that.

Expected Results:  
Update as usual.

I had sync properly installed/configured and already synced on this computer (yesterday)
Is there a way to restore my session from sync?(I need all that tabs and I don't remember their address)

I need a way to tell sync "ignore actually opened windows, don't sync them with the server, restore everything from last synced status on this computer"

Please help.
