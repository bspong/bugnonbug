The bug encounters mostly on long blog threads - as the one I have linked.

I could not reproduce it deterministically for myself but the issue happens if I try in less than 15 seconds.

When switching to another window the view is refreshed and shows fine. I managed to create a screenshot using the "create screenshot after 5 seconds" option of screenshot application.

I had the feeling it could be hardware or driver problem. I have tried on another box (totally different HW but same distribution - Ubuntu 8.04) and the result were the same. I could reproduce the problem.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a page with much text on it (flamed blog entries are ideal - see the one I have linked)
2. Set page zoom to a high level (I set it by pressing with ctrl++ 4 times)
3. Start scrolling down the text (holding the down arrow)
4. At some point some tiles of the page will stay onscreen while you can see the others scrolling under that.
Actual Results:  
some tiles of the page will stay onscreen while you can see the others scrolling under that.

Expected Results:  
Fine scrolling
