after the first key is pressed, taf is triggered
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.2) Gecko/20040804 Netscape/7.2 (ax)
Build Identifier: Firefox v1.0 downloaded and installed. Converted bookmarks from Netscape v7. Every page that I bring up that requires input from me such as entering a password, a user id, or auction bid amounts results in each key entry (after the first keyed entry) randomly hilighting the character entered tha t already appears somewhere on the page or if it doesn't appear, the search bar a the bottom of the screen opens up and the keyed character enters there. 

When entering data into a data entry window in any page from any web site, the
forst character entered goes properly into the entry window. All succeeding
characters entered go outside of the entry field and find an identical existing
character on the page and hilights it. If the character does not aleady appear
on the page, the search window at the bottom of the page pops up and the keyed
character appears in the search word window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open any web page that allows or requests data ebtry into provided fields or
boxes.
2.If the cursor is not alredy in the data entry area, click the cursor into the
window and begin keying data.
3.After the first keyed character is accepted, each succeeding character goes
outside of the key receiving area and either hilights a matching, existing
character on the page or the search line pops up from the bottom of the page and
the characters appear in the search box.

Actual Results:  
I had to quit the page. kill Firefox, and reload Netscape to be able to continue
processing.

Expected Results:  
The software should have accepted the keyed data into the receiving fields and
allowed me to continue processing the page with my keyed data present.
