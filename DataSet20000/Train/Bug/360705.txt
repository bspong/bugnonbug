Page displayed as application/rss+xml even though delivered as text/plain

I'm developing the PHP in the URL stated above. To help me debugging I established an override to display the contents as another document type instead of application/rss+xml, the correct default. This worked before (in FF 1.5 I think it still did). But now FF thinks himself very clever and displays the page as RSS nevertheless.

First and foremost I'd like the browser to honour the Content-Type specified by the web server. It's bad enough with all those web pages relying on Internet Exploder to guess types, we don't need additional misconfigurations to go unnotoiced because Firefox becomes clever as well. And maybe the Server just meant what it said about the content type.

In case this "feature" should stay, please make it configurable! And probably display some big warning somewhere so people notice that the Web site is broken, that Firefox is being clever, and to inform them how to configure this cleverness.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Visit above URL
Actual Results:  
Page displayed as RSS, i.e. a form to subscribe and below the RSS news items.

The Page Info states application/xhtml+xml which is a third type, neither the designated nor the displayed one.

Expected Results:  
Page rendered as text/plain.

Page Info should always display Content-Type as provided by the server.
