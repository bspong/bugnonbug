Adobe Acrobat 7.0 does not start when going to *.pdf URL.

I am running 2.0.2 Firefox with Acrobat 7.0.9.  This version of Adobe Acrobat does not start when a *.pdf URL is used.  It crashes.  Adobe Acrobat is a very popular plug-in and version 7.0 is not new.  Why should I have to put up with more hassle than I do with Internet Explorer?  Why does Firefox not work as well as IE 6 & 7?

Firefox should work with it.  Can you suggest any troubleshooting to help fix it?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to a web site.
2.  Click on an Acrobat URL.
3.  After a bit, a message appears: "Cannot use Adobe reader to view your file.  Exit Adobe and try again."
Actual Results:  
Click OK and get a blank window.  Can go back and get the window with the link that caused the bug.

Expected Results:  
It should have immediately fired up Acrobat and displayed the PDF in the Firefox window.

I have a workaround.  Right click, "Save Link as" and it can be saved to a file.  The file is then opened within the save as window.  I cannot use this workaround when clicking a link in an e-mail.

Usually, the URL extension does not appear or I am too used to the convienience that I get with IE 6.  Either way, I forget to employ the workaround.

I am not quite ready for IE7; I will be using IE6 more and more until this bug gets fixed.  I am willing to try and troubleshoot with a little help from Mozilla.
