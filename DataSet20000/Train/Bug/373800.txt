Deleting multiple bookmarks does not reflect on display until clicked back to

When I highlight more than one bookmark and hit the Delete key, the bookmarks ARE evidently actually deleted, but their deletion is not reflected in the actual bookmark display unless I click away from the particular folder listing and then back to it.  This is also described by people in the MozillaZine forums at:

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on Bookmarks > Organize Bookmarks.
2. Highlight more than one bookmark (as little as two).
3. Press the Delete key or choose Edit > Delete.
Actual Results:  
The bookmarks are deleted, but Firefox, at the moment, behaves as if they still exist, including displaying them.

Expected Results:  
The bookmarks are deleted, and Firefox removes them from the display.

This appears to have only shown up with the Firefox 2.0.0.2 upgrade.

Optionally, undeleting them (either through an Undo action, etc.) creates the same problem; they are restored, but Firefox doesn't reflect their restoration until clicked away from.

This is not a problem with localstore.rdf corruption.
