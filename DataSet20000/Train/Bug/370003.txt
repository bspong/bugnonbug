When clicking E-mail links on web pages, window comes up saying: Firefox doesn't know how to open this address, because the protocol (mailto) isn't associated with any program.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1

This failure to accomplish sending articles to friends by the E-mail links on the article pages fails on all.  An example:

•	Blog This
•	E-mail          This link will not open to anything except what you can see below.  
•	Print
•	Digg
•	del.icio.us
•	Sphere

The above E-mail link address is: http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=249&tag=nl.e539#

I always get the window when clicking on the E-mail link that says what I entered in the above Summary box.  Can somebody fix it?

 

Thanks,

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.The address in the above URL box is one example.
2.Save it to the address bar of Firefox and tap ENTER key. 
3.Hope you see the window that says what I entered in the Summary box above.
Actual Results:  
Just get the Firefox window that it doesn't know, etc. as stated in the Summary box above.

Expected Results:  
Should have brought up a page to enter E-mail addresses of people the article should be forwarded to by the presenter of the article, ZDNet.

It does not crash, it just does not do what it is supposed to do, maybe like Firefox got lost and can't find a way to open the URL that causes a forward to be accomplished about the desired article.  I have to copy and paste the article to a WORD DOCUMENT and attach it to an addressed E-mail instead of using the forward feature on the web page.
