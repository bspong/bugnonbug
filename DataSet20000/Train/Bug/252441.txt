Quick searches can be perfomed by highlighting / selecting some text and then
dragging it to the address bar (to display search results in current window) or
by dragging on to a blank piece of the Tab Bar (to display search results in a
new tab).

One of the easiest ways to select a word is to double-click on it. However when
you do this, Windows (rather stupidly) includes a trailing space. If you then
drag this selected word (including trailing space) on to the address bar, then
the search works as expected, (I think was a recent bug fix) BUT if you do the
same onto the TAB BAR, then the search breaks, and nothing happens. If you go
back and manually select the same word (by dragging your mouse over the text
rather than double clicking on it) so that the selection does NOT include the
trailing space, then dropping the selected text onto the tab bar performs a
quick search and opens the results in a new tab (as expected).

This problem also exists for multiple word selection where spaces are in the
middle of the selected text.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a web page that contains some plain text.
2. Double click on a word to select it.
3. Drag this selection onto a blank piece of tab bar and let go.

Actual Results:  
Nothing whatsoever happens. The Quick search breaks.

Expected Results:  
The word dropped onto the tab bar should be used to perform a quick search and
the results should be displayed in a new tab.

I believe that Bookmark keywords and the Address Bar had a similar problem (but
they have now been fixed, as I can sucessfully use spaces in both). The same fix
has not been applied to the tab bar.
