Will not open Save dialog box when try to save anything

Will not open a save dialog box when you try to save an application, an image, or anything else.  Even downloading a new Firefox installer will not work.  Feature working fine in all beta's of Firefox 4 and only broke with the RC 1 build.  The issue appeared instantly upon upgrade.  I uninstalled, including all user data and deleted the folders under Program Files and installed a fresh copy I downloaded using IE.  Did not resolve the issue.  I did not download any plugins or make any changes to the default install.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Upgrade or install to Firefox RC1
2.  Try to download anything that would generate a Windows Save As dialog box
Actual Results:  
Select to save content then nothing else happens.

Expected Results:  
When you try to save content, a Windows XP save dialog box should appear to allow the location to save the file.

Will post back as I am going to try and install one of the previous beta's to confirm it is still only happening to the RC or if the installer broke something.
