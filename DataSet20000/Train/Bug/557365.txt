This problem is intermittent. Started after upgrading to v 3.6.3.

When FireFox and Outlook Express are open, and McAfee anti-virus and Diskkeeper are running in the background, the entire computer slows to a crawl. Resumes normal speed when FF is closed.

I do not believe that it has anything to do with McAfee downloading its upgrades, but I'm not 100% sure.

Drop-down menus (Edit, View, etc.) drop a faint outline of a menu box when clicked, but the content of the menus never appears. The faint box outlines don't go away when the command word is clicked a second time.

FF so unresponsive that it's got to be forced to close with Windows Task Manager, although Task Manager doesn't report "Not Responding".

Other times, all is well.

During the time that the trouble is happening, I can close FireFox and open Internet Explorer, and everything's ok. Closing Internet Explorer and re-opening FireFox causes the problem to start again.
