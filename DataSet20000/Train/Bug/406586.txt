Tooltips raise browser above other Firefox windows
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071008 Firefox/2.0.0.8 Mnenhy/0.7.5.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071008 Firefox/2.0.0.8 Mnenhy/0.7.5.0

If any firefox window is open (including downloads, image properties, view source, or browser windows) and another firefox window has an element with a tooltip underneath the window in focus, then activating a tooltip on the inactive window will raise that window above the window in focus - but without changing the focus.

This means that clicking on the lowered, but focuses, window will not raise it because Windows thinks it is already raised!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any two Firefox windows - for example, two browser windows
2. Give one window focus by clicking on it
3. Overlap the two windows (though see below)
4. Hover over an element with a tooltip in the nonfocused firefox window (for example, the Back button).


Actual Results:  
The nonfocused window will be raised but not focused. Clicking in the body (not the titlebar) of the focused-but-lowered window will not raise it.

Expected Results:  
Expectation #1 (general): In the Windows UI, the focused window should always be  the highest window (unless always-on-top windows are present, which they shouldn't be here)
Expectation #2 (specific): The tooltip, if it appears at all, should not raise or lower any windows, and itself should not appear above the focused window.

This bug is most obvious when the windows overlap, but it can still manifest if they do not:
1. Open two FF windows
2. Focus one of them
3. Ensure they don't overlap
4. Hover over a tooltip-enabled element in the nonfocused window
5. Drag the focused window over the nonfocused window. It will actually move under the nonfocussed window! When you let go of the mouse button, it will jump to the top.
