I tried to uninstall and re-install the Mozilla Browser, choosing the Custom Install. At no point did it give me the option of not installing the Yahoo Toolbar. I have also combed through the Registery Editor to the best of my ability. I erased every Key in the Mozilla listing having to do with Yahoo. Nothing I do seems to work.
