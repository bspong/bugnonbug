Process.run doesn't launch exes which has the UAC protection.

I have been using nsIprocess.run() to launch an exe (which is configured to run as adiminstrator). And it used to launch fine until firefox 2.0.0.7. That is it asked for administrator password and ran without and problem. But when the firefox updated to 2.0.0.8 and onwards, the process.run() stopped working at all it started giving exception.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Write an extension with just runs an exe in vista (which is configured to run as  administrator) using nsIProcess.run().
2.Run it in Firefox 2.0.0.7 it run successfully
3.Run it in Firefox 2.0.0.8 it fails to run. 
Actual Results:  
It did not launch the process and gave the following exception 

0x80520003(NS_ERROR_FILE_EXECUTION_FAILED)
[nsIProcess.run] nsresult:0x80520003(NS_ERROR_FILE_EXECUTION_FAILED)

Expected Results:  
Should have launched the process by poping up the UAC dialog.

The problem goes away if I configure the Firefox to run as administrator. But this  is not exceptable as a browser is never expected to run the administrator context it will be a big security hole (no offense )
