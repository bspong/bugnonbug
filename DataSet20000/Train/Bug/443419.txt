The page being added to bookmarks is not the current page, but the last one!

1. The page added to bookmarks is the one viewed before the current page instead of the current one. I have to cancel and add the current page again to fix this problem.
2. I can not add any page to bookmarks by using the right-click menu.
3. Sometimes when I selected a specific destination bookmark folder for a page, it turned out that it went to the unspecified place within the bookmark folder.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Problem 1 only:
1. Open Webpage 1, 
2. Open Webpage 2, in a second tab,
3.A Go back and forth between the two pages and each time try to add each page to Bookmarks by using the Bookmark menu at the top,
3.B Add either page to Bookmarks by using the right-click menu

Actual Results:  
Of
3.A Often the added page is the other one instead of the expected.
3.B No response at all.

This problem happens "every time" when you opened many tabs, as in real use. But when I try to reproduce this problem, it occurs "sometimes" only. 

Expected Results:  
You know that, dear sir.

Thank you!
