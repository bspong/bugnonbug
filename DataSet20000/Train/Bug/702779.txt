Steps to reproduce:

It seems there has not been much recent communication on Developer Tools. For instance there has been no new post on http://blog.mozilla.com/devtools/ for the past 2 months, while some developer tool prototypes have landed in Firefox (Aurora at least, maybe Beta as well?) during this period.

My current impression is that:
- the new developer tools are promoted in release notes in order to get more testing/bug reports, with words that may set high expectations;
- but the tools are prototypes, some of them quite crude or crude-looking, and will evolve a lot.

What's missing from this picture is an overview of what is planned for the built-in Developer Tools in Firefox, and some information on how far along the road the project is.

Defining what the vision/goal is: there is an old post at http://blog.mozilla.com/devtools/2011/05/25/the-relationship-between-firebug-and-mozilla-developer-tools/ which basically says “we want to try something different”. An update with an overview of the planned feature set and maybe some mockups would be nice.

Reporting on the current progress: I suggest a blog post on http://blog.mozilla.com/devtools/ before each Aurora release, assessing the overall progress (like, “we’re roughly 40% done” or something subtler) and listing highlights. Release notes, tweets, etc. would then link to that post.

Just my feedback and some ideas.
