Use an icon and display some text in location bar for about:blocked
The awesome bar should indicate whenever you are on a browser special page (all "about:", error pages / warnings e. g. "Not Found" and "Phishing attempt"). 

Right now, it's trivial to fake a browser special page rendered in-content (at least error pages). This allows for phishing / social engineering. When e. g. in-content preferences land, the implications will be far greater. This risk is reduced when the changes to site identy land in Fx 15. However, the current indication for special pages (i. e. on error pages the warning sign as "favicon") is not obvious enough for non-trained users. 

I've sketched out a proposal, adding a new element in the location bar whenever you are on a special page:

Another possibility (probably better and less intrusive but still remarkable) is reusing the EV site-identy (https://msujaws.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/tumblr_m2xymz9bfz1r47294.png) and have an e. g. orange background + text + warning sign for errors ("Not Found"), red background + text + warning sign for warnings ("Phishing attempt", "Certificate Error"), and blue background + text + gear icon(?) for in-content preferences + _any_ "about:" page (text is "about:" for any "about:" page except "Addon preferences" for "about:addons", "Preferences" for "about:preferences" etc.).
