Here are some layout issues I have seen in the new Applications tab ind the Options dialog.

* The list box jumps when the text "The following entries match your search:" is shown/hidden. This is annoying. Maybe the text should not be shown at all.

* The left and right margin of the search bar and list box is twice as thick as the rest of the items in the Options dialog. They are thus misaligned with the buttons in the bottom and the introduction text in the top.

* The select box in the selected item is too far to the left compared to the other items.

* Icons touch each other. It doesn't look great. There should at least be one pixel of space between the icons.

* The selected item is a few items higher than the rest of the items. This is annoying. I don't know exactly why, because I don't think it is annoying that the selected item is higher in the Add-ons manager. Maybe it is because the difference is so small.

Reproducible: Always
