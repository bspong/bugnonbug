This bug occurs most often when using the cPanel 5 web hosting interface
software, especially when working with .sql files. The following will showing up
in mimeTypes.rdf, but is not visible under the download options within the
Firefox browser.
<RDF:Description about="urn:mimetype:application/force-download"
                   NC:value="application/force-download"
                   NC:editable="true"
                   NC:fileExtensions="sql"
                   NC:description="SQL Script file">
    <NC:handlerProp resource="urn:mimetype:handler:application/force-download"/>
</RDF:Description>

The above has to be manually removed to prevent Firefox from trying to force the
file to download.

This is really only problematic with cPanel 5 as an information frame from the
file "select.html" is supposed to show up, but Firefox instead tries to download
"select.html" because it thinks it is a .sql file.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a .sql file in a web directory with cPanel 5.
2. Go to a web page that has a link for a file ending in .sql. Select to save to
disk.
3. Download the file repeatedly using the save to disk option, reloading the
page each time. Repeat this maybe five or more times.
4. Go back to the .sql file created in cPanel 5, click on its name to bring up
the information side panel.
Actual Results:  
Firefox tried to for me to download the file "select.html" which is the result
of clicking the URL
http://www.mywebsite.com/place/theme/files/select.html?dir=/home/website/public_html/somedir&file=db_dump.sql


Expected Results:  
Should have displayed the information on the file with optional file operations
in the appropriate frame.
