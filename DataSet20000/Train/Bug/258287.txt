Selection effect without mouse drag after switching tabs & clicking textarea scrollbar
This could very possibly be a duplicate as form selection bugs have been around
forever, but as the form code was forked from Mozilla last I knew, this is a
Firefox bug now.

The bug is completely reproducible.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Visit the URL (not every URL with a textarea works - I can't reproduce it on
the New bug page, for example).  Make sure another tab to another site is open
but not selected.  (I used
<http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2004/09/06/a-labor-day-weekend-of-love/>
when I reproduced the bug.)
2. Type some stuff in the comments box at end of page - type enough to get it to
start scrolling vertically.  Random text copied a bunch of times works fine.
3. Put the cursor at the end of the text with the mouse pointer.  Then click the
mouse off the textarea -- to the right of the textarea works fine.
4. Switch to the second tab and then switch back to the first tab.
5. Click on the vertical scrollbar for the comments textarea.
6. Move the mouse pointer to within the textarea (but not on the scrollbar).
7. Move the mouse pointer up and down to see selection from bottom of textarea
to wherever the mouse is located vertically.  Click to see the "selection"
disappear, replaced by a regular cursor at the location of the mouse pointer.

This is something I've never seen before with native forms (only XUL forms), and
it's rather disconcerting.  It's also something that can somewhat easily occur
accidentally -- it's taken me awhile to get a reproducible set of instructions
to demo the bug.

I've added the conversion keyword because I think screwy form selection is
something that's just odd enough to push away a potential user who doesn't like
the inconsistency with native behavior.
