Document from DOMParser or XHR with responseType="document" breaking debugging functionality.

Steps to reproduce:

Running this Javascript code, after DOMContentLoaded and served from a webserver, observing with the developer tools:

var parser = new DOMParser();
var doc = parser.parseFromString("<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "text/html");

console.dir(doc);
console.dir(doc.body);

debugger;

console.log("done");


Actual results:

For "console.dir(doc);" nothing is displayed in the console. (Not even an error.)
For "console.dir(doc.body);" the text "<body>" is shown but the box underneath is empty, no properties are visible.

The "debugger;" statement is ignored, also manual breakpoints in the debug view are ignored.

The string "done" is displayed correctly even if above breakpoints are ignored.


Expected results:

The first call to console.dir should display the HTMLDocument and all its properties that are available, like a normal "console.dir(document);" does and should not display nothing at all.

The second call to console.dir should include all properties of the body of the parsed Document.

The debugger of the developer tools should break at the debugger statement and also manual breakpoints should be available in order to inspect the "doc" variable.
