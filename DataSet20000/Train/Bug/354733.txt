It gives all the information needed.

Also I stated in that thread that I reverted to an older Firefox. Which wasn't too much older than the current release ... and it also behaves abnormally to the stated conditions in that thread.

Please note as per that thread this system is a G4 Sawtooth with 512 MB RAM running Mac OS 10.4.7.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Browse the net specifically sites with heavy usage of images, styles, and so forth. Like DeviantArt ... posting and looking at peoples art. As well as communicating inside their ShoutBox. http://shout.deviantart.com/popup. However this bug is reproduced on any site. Just a quick way to reproduce it is DA, so you don't have to spend alot of time to see it for yourself.
2.Try typing in new URL's after a while into the URL Bar or typing in form fields, either ones in focus or ones not in focus.
3.Close window/tab and reopen new window will fix the problem for a while. Sometimes copying and pasting text will fix. And will enable it to work in either cases for a little longer. Then the same bug will reappear.

Actual Results:  
Will disallow any typing in the URL Bar or typing in Forms. However text is selectable to copy, delete, paste, etc. Just won't let you type or delete using delete key.

Expected Results:  
Allowed the characters from keyboard to be typed in the URL Bar, as well as forms.

FF was the basic installed version on 2 clean install systems (G4 Sawtooth's). And replicatable on both. No additional plugins, features,etc., to either system was performed after the basic install of 10.4.7 and then the install of FF.
