Hitting "open" after getting the browser to choose your file results in hang. The dialogue box or file browser stays in place and the filepath does not populate on the main page. Luckily Minefield does not crash or require force quitting. Double-clicking the main page results in the dialogue box/file browser disappearing and then you can try again.

Observed this on only one other site and it is unclear if this is only an issue with this build or with the sites (same issue observed in WebKit).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Under "Upload Graphic" hit the button that says "Browse..."
2. Select any small graphic (tried with a JPEG and a GIF)
3. Hit button "open"

75% chance of success.
Actual Results:  
1 in 4 attempts observed the reported behavior. WebKit has slightly higher rate of success.

Expected Results:  
The software should be populating the filepath of the chosen image in the field on the main page.

The frequency may change based on selecting one image and then changing to another prior to hitting "open"

Minefield is the fastest browser I've used yet! Keep up the amazing work. This "bug," if it can even be called that, is trivial and does not tarnish the stellar job that has been accomplished with this browser.

Many Thanks!
