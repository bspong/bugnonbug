Downloading a file causes "libnotify-Message: GetCapabilities call failed..." message in .xsession-errors
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100105 Firefox/3.6

If I download a file from a web page (any), after the initial download, I get "libnotify-Message: GetCapabilities call failed: The name org.freedesktop.Notifications was not provided by any .service files" in my .xsession-errors file. The download completes and all appears to work, but the error message is recorded in the .xsession-errors file. This seems to only happen on the first download; subsequent downloads don't seem to bring up this error message.

I have tried this with a fresh profile (closed Firefox, renamed my ~/.mozilla directory and restarted Firefox) as well as my current profile (recently updated from 3.5.7 to 3.6rc1), but on both occasions, the same error message happens.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a website with a download link.
2. Click on download link to download file.
3. Save file.
4. Go and take a look at your .xsession-errors file in your favourite editor.
Actual Results:  
Download is successful, but .xsession-errors file contains "libnotify-Message: GetCapabilities call failed: The name org.freedesktop.Notifications was not provided by any .service files". Downloads after the initial one will appear not to touch the .xsession-errors file with an error message.

Expected Results:  
Download to be successful, but .xsession-errors file not touched.
