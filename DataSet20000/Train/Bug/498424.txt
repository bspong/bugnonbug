For the last month Firefox has developed a bug.
After being open for a period of time anything that is typed into the address bar or into login spaces (for mail, banking, etc) goes in backwards, i.e. the cursor moves to the left.
Closing the page hangs up firefox and it cannot be reopened unless you restart the computer or Closing the page hangs up firefox.
This is happening on both my machines that run Vista Home Premium edition with service pack 1.
Recent updates to firefox have worsened the problem, it is happening more frequently,
Can you help?
