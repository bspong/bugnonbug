Firefox 8 has ridiculously slow bookmark searching and address bar dropdown with thousands of tags
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/535.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/15.0.874.106 Safari/535.2

Steps to reproduce:

Initiate a bookmark search through the bookmark sidebar (ctrl-b) or the bookmark manager window, or click on the dropdown arrow at the right of the address bar.


Actual results:

Firefox 8 stops responding, I get the blue spinning cursor in Windows 7, and only after several minutes does the search finish or the dropdown populate and Firefox 8 becomes responsive again. This started only in the last few beta builds but persists


Expected results:

Should have finished the action instantly or within a few seconds. This started only in the last few beta builds of Firefox 8. It did not happen in 7.01 or previous beta 8 builds. But it persists in the release build of Firefox 8. There was a similar issue several versions ago which was eventually fixed. This is extremely frustrating as it renders Firefox nearly useless for me and it is now constantly trying to force me to upgrade from 7.01 to 8.0 on all my computers. 

I've run Firefox 8 in safe mode to rule out an extension but this does not help. 

Note also, even re-installing 7.01 does not immediately fix the issue. However, I've found that deleting the files "urlclassifier3.sqlite" and "places.sqlite" (40 and 20 Mb, respectively) will fix the issue after downgrading to 7.01. The first time Firefox loads after deleting these files it will remain hidden and hang indefitely, but if I kill the process and reload it then works fine and i can restore my bookmark library by downloading it from Xmarks, after which performance is just fine. If I do this same process using Firefox 8, it continues to have poor performance even after rebuilding the bookmark library.
