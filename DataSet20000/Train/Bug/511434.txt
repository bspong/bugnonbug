Since I installed Firefox (from 1.5), I always have a hard time using the right click function of my mouse (obviously it's working on other applications and it's function on my OS). One thing I observe is that my right click function the same way as my scroll wheel/middle button. what is happening is that every time i right-click (without releasing it), it will show the scroll up/down icon and when i move the mouse up/down, the page moves up/down and then shows the right click menu. another example is that when I right click into my bookmarks toolbar (especially on my RSS feeds) it automatically opens all the pages (imagine if one of my RSS feeds contain 50 feeds it will open 50 tabs). This has been bugging me for a very long time as the right click button on my keyboard doesn't help either. 

I thought updating firefox browser will solve the problem but it wasn't.

Reproducible: Always




take note that I do not have any special software for my mouse or adjusted its settings to function differently than normal.

My right click functions correctly just in this page: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/post_bug.cgi other than this page, it acts like a middle button/scroll wheel
