Steps to reproduce:

I created a very simple html page with some text, and an IFRAME whose src was set to "http://wiki.com"   (any other site that allowes to be framed would work, anyway)  

code: 

<!doctype HTML>
<html>
<head>
	<style>
	body{
		background-color: #ccc;
	}

	.iframe{
	width:900px;
	height: 800px;
	}
	</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>TEST</h1>
<small>smallText</small>
<iframe src="http://wiki.com/" frameborder="0" class="iframe"></iframe>
</body>
</html>

This was saved to an .html file (test.html).

The page was then: 
1) opened directly from file system using file:\\ protocol
2) uploaded to web server and opened using http:\\ protocol

Note that the IFRAME src is always loaded via http.


Actual results:

Two problems were apparent:
1) the whole content of the page loaded via http has a smaller size than the one loaded via file protocol (fonts look smaller and the iframe size is smaller too).

2) when the page containing the iframe is loaded via http, the whole content of the iframe (an external website) is scaled (smaller), too. This does not happen if the page is loaded via file protocol.

This means that any Iframe in a web page (loaded via http) scales the content to a smaller size than the original.

See attached picture.

Performing the test in Chrome (45.0.2454.99 m) shows the pages and iframe content always at the same size.


Expected results:

1) the page should have looked the same in the browser

2) the IFRAME content (external website) should always have the same dimensions no matter if within the iframe or in an own page.
