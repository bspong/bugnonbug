Downloaded Firefox 1.0 Setup.exe locks up Windows Explorer
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)
Build Identifier: 

This is strange. I downloaded Firefox 1.0 Setup, which went fine. I am running 
Windows 2000 SP4, browsing with IE 6.0. All MS current security updates have 
been applied. Using Norton Antivirus. 

However, when trying to view and execute the downloaded .exe file, Windows 
Explorer hangs up, with no activity, no response. This is true even when just 
VIEWING the folder to which Firefox was downloaded, let alone trying to execute 
it. 

Task Manager reports Windows Explorer as "not responding." I waited as much as 
10 minutes, but nothing. I deleted the entire folder and downloaded Firefox 
again. Same problem. I did this 3 or 4 times with the same results. 

Other than this download folder, Windows Explorer seems to work fine. The 
download folder is the only one I have found that gives me this problem. 

The download folder is on a network drive (my LAN). So, I tried downloading the 
file to a local drive and did NOT have the problem. 

For some reason, when downloaded to a network drive, the file causes Windows 
Explorer either to take an awfully long time just to display its existence or 
to hang completely. 



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download Firefox 1.0 Setup to a folder on a network drive. 
2. Open Windows Explorer. 
3. Select the download folder. 
 

Actual Results:  
4. Windows Explorer hangs, "not responding." I am unable to view the folder 
contents, select or execute the downloaded file.
