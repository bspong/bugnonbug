Firefox locks up after an unknown period in time. No obvious reason for lockup. It's been happening since I performed the software update the other day. Sometimes I'll leave my computer for a few hours, and come back to it, and it's locked up. Other times I'll be in the middle of browsing, and it'll lock up.
I can still click and move the mouse, but nothing loads, and I cannot change tabs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Mozilla
2.Open all of my usual tabs
3.Wait

Actual Results:  
If I have everything set to how I use it everyday, when I return to my computer after a few hours it will be in the locked up condition.

Expected Results:  
Not locked up. Continued to load links as I click them, and change tabs when I click them.

This has only been happening since the last software update, which I performed on Tuesday. I have two separate systems, and I have been experiencing it on both machines. Mildly annoying to close, end task in the task manager, and re-open every time I want to browse.
