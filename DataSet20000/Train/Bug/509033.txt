File download terminates early with no error message to end-user.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.13) Gecko/2009073022 Firefox/3.0.13 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I am using Firefox 3.0.13 which my browser was updated to yesterday.  While attempting to download Oracle Enterprise Linux CD images, the download would terminate at random long before the file was actually complete, but without any error, as if the download was OK.  I repeatedly attempted to download a 575 Meg image, and the download would terminate after 125 - 135 megabytes, as if it was really finished.  I had to use IE 8 to get the download to complete. :(

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the following set of URLS:

http://edelivery.oracle.com/linux
http://edelivery.oracle.com/EPD/GetUserInfo/get_form?caller=LinuxWelcome
http://edelivery.oracle.com/EPD/Search/handle_go
http://edelivery.oracle.com/EPD/Download/get_form?egroup_aru_number=11379162

2.  Attempt to download the CD images for Release 4, update 8, for x86_64.
3.  See if the download completes after transferring the entire CD image.
Actual Results:  
My downloads consistently "completed" after downloading different amounts of the file, from 125M to about 135M.  The Download Manager page showed no errors at all.

Expected Results:  
I expected the download to transfer the entire file (575M).
