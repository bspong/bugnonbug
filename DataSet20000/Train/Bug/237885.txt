Intermittently, Firefox failes to clear the Add Bookmark and Save As Dialog when
I press Command-D to bookmark a page OR when I click on a link that prompts a
file download (e.g. PDF).

I can't find a pattern yet that would provide any more info but it happens at
least a once a day.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce
Steps to Reproduce:
1. I just continued to use Add Bookmark and select links to file downloads
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Dialog box for Add Bookmark and Save As do nothing. Clicking OK or Cancel
produces no result (except that each button provides feedback when clicked).

Only way to resolve issue is to Force Quit the application.

Expected Results:  
Clear the dialog box after pressing OK or Cancel as appropriate.
