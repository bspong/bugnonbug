Missing https headers (at times) with auto-detect proxy settings mode

Do an HTTPS request from a XUL overlay using the following code. I don't have any other extensions installed. Note that the Content-Type  info  is missing in the first line of apache log. This problem goes away when the Network Settings is switched to "No Proxy" mode.

var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.open('POST', 'https://localhost/unique.php', true);
req.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');
req.setRequestHeader("User-Agent", 'Special-UA'); 
req.send(null); 

Apache logs: 

[12/May/2009:14:40:33 +0530] IBytes=718 ContentType=- ::1  "POST /unique.php HTTP/1.1" 208
 [12/May/2009:14:41:10 +0530] IBytes=670 ContentType=application/x-www-form-urlencoded ::1   "POST /unique.php HTTP/1.1" 208



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set "auto-detect proxy settings for this network" from Preferences->Advanced->Network->Settings.
2. Send an https request via an extension with some https headers.
3. At times, some http headers are missing in the request. 
Actual Results:  
At times request headers are missing in auto detect proxy settings mode.

Expected Results:  
All request headers should be sent irrespective of "auto-detect" proxy settings / no-proxy mode.

I have seen this happening in windows and Mac. Tried the same from my home PC and Office network.
