Better logging of token server errors

Currently errors from the token server result in logs such as:

1392924838097   Sync.BrowserIDManager      ERROR Authentication error in _fetchTokenForUser: Client error.

Which isn't useful for diagnostics.

I'm attaching a "strawman" patch.  It has 2 parts:

* tokenserverclient - have the error objects implement a toString() method that includes everything relevant to the error.

* browserid_identity now has its AuthenticationError object be passed the initial error, and have its toString() also do the right thing.

The end result is errors in the log now look something like:

1393292203547	Sync.BrowserIDManager	ERROR	Authentication error in _fetchTokenForUser: AuthenticationError(TokenServerClientServerError({"message":"Server error.","cause":"general","response_body":"{\"uid\": 56882, \"hashalg\": \"sha256\", \"api_endpoint\": \"https://sync-1-us-east-1.sync.services.mozilla.com/1.5/56882\", \"key\": \"qEeha1YKpg4vtS3Lz81MHAHV8bQiWgd_kW1nZmNG8-4=\", \"duration\": 300, \"id\": \"eyJub2RlIjogImh0dHBzOi8vc3luYy0xLXVzLWVhc3QtMS5zeW5jLnNlcnZpY2VzLm1vemlsbGEuY29tIiwgImV4cGlyZXMiOiAxMzkzMjkyNDk2LjY2OTkzNTksICJzYWx0IjogIjRhMzJmMiIsICJ1aWQiOiA1Njg4Mn1TJXswMSgbkgP1P_nN_-78jq0cbwXN_i-QXqJTDmGNFg==\"}","response_headers":{"access-control-allow-credentials":"true","access-control-allow-headers":"DNT,X-Mx-ReqToken,Keep-Alive,User-Agent,X-Requested-With,If-Modified-Since,Cache-Control,Content-Type,Authorization,X-Conditions-Accepted","access-control-allow-methods":"GET, POST, OPTIONS","access-control-max-age":"1728000","content-type":"application/json; charset=UTF-8","date":"Tue, 25 Feb 2014 01:36:36 GMT","server":"nginx/1.4.4","x-timestamp":"1393292196","content-length":"409","connection":"keep-alive"},"response_status":200}))

(Note the line above was done by instrumenting the code so a 200 response was actually treated as an error)

Another obvious alternative would be to ensure the tokenserverclient logs end up in the sync logs and just have them reported that way, but it's unclear that makes sense longer term (ie, when there are tokenserverclient consumers other than sync)

Anyway, casting a wide feedback net, and including Nick for any android-specific insights.
