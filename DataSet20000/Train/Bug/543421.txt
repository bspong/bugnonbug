The save dialog box does not appear on the desktop, and you are unable to save any files because of this.  The window listing does appear in the "Window" menu in the toolbar.  When the save dialog box is supposed to come up, the only menu that appears in the menu bar is the "Firefox" one.  To force Firefox out of this, you can click anywhere on another open FF window.  The download is impossible to get started.

I have disabled all plugins and addons, so it's probably not an incompatibility with them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on a link to a download a file (any file type)
2.When the Save dialog box is supposed to pop up, the menu bar is reduced to "Firefox" only
3.You are unable to confirm the dialog box to save the file to the predetermined location.
Actual Results:  
The save dialog box is missing, you are unable to confirm and click "Save" to save a file, and the menu bar disappears.

Expected Results:  
Popped up the Save dialog box
