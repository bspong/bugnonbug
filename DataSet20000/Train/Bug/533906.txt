This seems to be commonly reported with the exceptions list disappearing "bug" which seems to have a "resolution," but it is a separate issue.
 
When I add a cookie to the exceptions list as "blocked" and delete that cookie from the list of cookies, the next time that cookie is sent it reappears in the cookie list even though it is "blocked" in the exceptions" list.

Luckily my anti-virus software catches the bad ones when they "reappear" but I would expect the blocked cookie never to even make it to the cookie list.  In addition in trying different things, it appears that some cookies still get through even when I uncheck the "accept cookies from sites" button.  Could these problems be related?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Add cookie to the exceptions list as blocked.  Delete that cookie from the list of cookies.
2.Go to a site with that cookie
3.Blocked cookie shows up again in cookies
Actual Results:  
as above

Expected Results:  
Blocked cookies in exception list should not be accepted.

This would seem to be a fairlysevere security issue as there are some notorious cooies out there.
