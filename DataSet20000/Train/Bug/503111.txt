I have religious issues regarding the "I'll be careful, I promise!" button in the about:config nag screen. I believe promising is either the same as swearing or close enough to swearing that the Lord's Word in Matthew 3:33-37 applies in which the Lord tells us to not answer with an oath of any kind (e.g. we shouldn't say "I shall do it, I promise," but rather, "I shall do it" and then stop right there; the "I promise" part in the former sentence comes from Satan).

I know what I'm doing - I have a CS degree. I don't need to be careful nor do I need to promise to be careful in order to adjust the browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have difficulty with a Firefox browser feature which can be adjusted via the about:config box.
2. Type in about:config into the URL entry textbox
3. View button that requires me to make an oath to continue.
Actual Results:  
The button says "I'll be careful, I promise!"

Expected Results:  
The button should say something like, "OK", "I agree," etc - but no oath.

I'd like to say that the "bug" is trivial but since it's preventing me from adjusting firefox to remove the URL autocomplete feature that slows me down, I'd have to say its NOT trivial and should be dealt with ASAP.
