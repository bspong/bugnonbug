Web page doesn't load completely

Since install, certain features on web pages were not displaying in Firefox,
mostly images and graphics. These graphics seem to be tied to Java scripts. My
mouse cursor would change to the little hand when placed over these "void" or
empty areas on the page and things would happen when I clicked on these "void"
areas. I could get MS IE to work just fine on the sites so I thought there is
something amiss with Firefox.  Just today, I figured it out. I went to
www.barnesandnoble.com to find their store near me but could not find the tool
on their site to put in my zip code. I remembered a problem with IE about images
loading in the browser originating from sites other than the site actually
visited. So in Firefox, I went to Tools > Options > Web Features and with "Load
Images" checked, I unchecked "for the originating web site only". Everything on
the Barnes and Nobles site works fine now - other sites, too.  The thing is,
that discomfiting function, "for the originating web site only", was checked
upon installation; it was that way when I installed Firefox.  I hope this helps.
