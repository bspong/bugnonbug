open URL above. It shows a map with life airplane traffic. Clicking on an airplane opens an info window with additional flight details for that plane. This flight details are difficult to read because they are displayed above the underlying map.

The flight info window should be displayed with a neutral background to become readable.

Same problem  occurs with other similar applications/homepages. 

No problem if I use Internet Explorer instead of Firefox 2.0.0.14

Is this a configuration or Firefox problem ? Please give me input. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open http://radar.zhaw.ch/
2. click on one of the displayed planes
3. this opens on top right a flight detail window ontop of underlying map instead on neutral background. These infos are difficult to interpret due to mix with map
Actual Results:  
Unclear, unreadable flight details

Expected Results:  
Flight detail window must open on neutral background (without map in background)
