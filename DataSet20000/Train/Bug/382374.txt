In Manage Bookmarks, to set another folder as Bookmarks Toolbar Folder, the option is initially grayed out (Edit menu) from the list on left side (folders), but if the cursor is moved to another folder, then back, it's not grayed out and can be selected. As I just now discovered, however, the folders on the right side (folders plus complete list of bookmarks) can be selected directly. 
It's much easier to select folders from left side as they are the only thing listed (unless you have lots of subfolders).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Manage Bookmarks
2. Cursor in left side on a folder you want to set as Bookmarks Toolbar Folder
3. Menu Edit, Set as Bookmarks Toolbar Folder, is grayed out
4. Move cursor to another folder, then back
5. Now the Edit menu options are not grayed out
Actual Results:  
See above

Expected Results:  
Set cursor on any folder on left, use Edit menu to select directly as Bookmarks Toolbar Folder
