whole window scrolls (not just webpage)

Whenever something else in Firefox is selected (or my mouse is over the tab bar) other than something IN the actual web page frame (part of the window) and I try and scroll using the trackpad, the whole window scrolls.  I have yet to try this with a regular mouse.  It works with my laptop (Macbook Pro) but I haven't tried it on any other computer either.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox with tabs open (it doesn't matter if its 1 or 20, but you have to be able to see the tab bar)
2. Click a tab and leave the mouse over the tab bar
3. Scroll using the trackpad upwards (and sometimes it works scrolling to the left as well)
Actual Results:  
I see the entire viewable webpage window shift, along with the tab bar downwards, and a white border appear around the top of the window.  If you scrolled to the left you can sometimes see it shift to the right as well, with a white border appearing on the lefthand side.

Expected Results:  
I'm not sure if the tab bar is supposed to do anything when you scroll up and down on it, but I know that when you scroll left to right it should flip through the open tabs (not open them, just shift through them).

I am doing this with the default theme and nothing changed out of the ordinary.  I do have extensions on but non that should cause this.

Here are screen-shots:
