Firefox shuts down for no apparent reason, I can be working away browsing the web or even after I have just started Firefox

This has happened a couple of times now and there seems to be no consistency of what causes this to happen, I have been working away browsing the web or even after I have just started Firefox and all of a sudden Firefox will shut down.  I have added some extensions and all are up to date.  Below is a list of the extensions currently installed working and up to date;

Bandwidth Meter and Diagnostics 1.1
CLEO 3.1
Cookie Manager Button 1.0.1.1
Ctrl Tab Preview 0.2.1

I was using the default session manager, then changed to the session manager in Tab Mix Plus, but found that which ever one I was using Firefox would still just shut down, but the session manager never prompted to restore a previous session?
