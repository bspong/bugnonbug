Searching in the Location Bar freezes my computer

Utilizing the new search feature in the Location bar in Minefield locks up my entire computer, forcing a hardware restart to regain control of any part of my system. This occurs in searching the URI history or bookmarks using the Fx3 Beta Location Bar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Begin typing either a URI or bookmark name in the Location Bar
2. Firefox becomes unresponsive and I am unable to switch to another open window or even use the system shutdown function in my OS (Ubuntu Gutsy)
3.
Actual Results:  
Firefox becomes unresponsive and I am unable to switch to another open window or even use the system shutdown function in my OS (Ubuntu Gutsy)

Expected Results:  
I should have been able to get, and select, a history item or a bookmarked site and continue my browsing

I am using the latest Nightly build of Firefox, but it has happened in the last several nightlies. I am unsure when this behavior started, although I began trying to use this feature in Minefield off and on about a week ago.

I am using Gran Paradiso/Minefield as downloaded from Mozilla, run from a custom launcher. The Ubuntu repos are never used for Mozilla products on my computer due to the changes they seem to make before releasing it to the repos.
