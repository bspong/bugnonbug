url focus rectangle (dotted rectangle) goes away from last clicked link, without having clicked new links, on switching to and fro from a different window

In any page with a list of links, when the links are opened in new windows/tabs,
the focus rectangle of the last clicked link disappears even without clicking a
new link.
This happens if we switch to some diff. window and switch back, and *simply
move* the cursor over different links in the original page.
This becomes particularly irritating for the following two reasons
1. Mozilla doesn't change the color of a url to visited if it is opened in new
window/tab
2. It becomes difficult to discern which link was visited last. say in a page
full of news headlines.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a page with a list of links. say a page of news headlines.
2. open a few of the links in new windows/tabs
3. visit a window/tab and return back to the original window
4. move your mouse over any other link in the page


Actual Results:  
the last visited link's focus rectangle in the original page should be gone,
without having clicked any other link in it.

Expected Results:  
the focus rectangle of the last clicked link should be kept till the user clicks
a new link.
And also the visited links should be colored, even thought they are opened in
new window/tab. This second result is being handled as a separate bug.

Try the same steps in Internet Explorer to see the result I am trying to achieve.
