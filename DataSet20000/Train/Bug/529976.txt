1 thing I think SHOULD BE Normal but Never happens is that the restore option SHOULD RESTORE automatically, but instead I ALWAYS get 'OOPS THIS IS EMBARRASSING but...' and wonder why you have that message when it ALWAYS comes up and NEVER comes automatically...EXCEPT This Once (Today) but that is as far as it got. AntiVir just then displayed a message saying it just updated. FF didn't move since then before manually taking it down using Task Manager.

It added a deleted tab,1 which always slows FF way down - 'iGoogle' w/the message about a script and do you want to abort it'
