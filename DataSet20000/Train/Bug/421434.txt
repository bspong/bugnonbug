autocomplete is very erratic

Sometimes it works; but generally autocomplete doesn't find matches...  just typing "g" should give me lots of choices; but I have to type "google.com" in its entirety to get there.  Some letters just cause the window decorations to flash, while other cause an autocomplete list to flash momentarily...  the keyboard input must be slowed down or keystrokes are missed.

Of course, as I try to reproduce it now, the problem is hiding; so I tried to use the dropdown button...  in previous versions of Ff, I could just click on the button and move the mouse and click again on my selection. In this version, I must hold the mouse button down to get to the selection, or the list disappears.  It's much less fun to have to hold down a mouse button -- kinda like driving with your foot on the brake.  :)

Overall, the location handling is much less friendly IMHO.  The list should also be configurable to allow using the old style for those of us who a) don't care for the extra fluff, and b) to allow longer lists...

Since Ff3 is in beta, I wanted to participate in testing the UI which where I usually experience subtle issues...  I'm not disappointed...  :D
