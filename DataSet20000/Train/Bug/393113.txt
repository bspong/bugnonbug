Shutdown event order inconsistenty in Firefox 3.0a8

In Firefox 2.0 the shutdown event order is always as follows:
quit-application-granted
window unload event
quit-application

This is true even if the "X" is used to close out the last visible window.
In Firefox 3.0a8pre, the above sequence occurs when the File->Exit menu is used to quit the browser, but when the "X" is used to close out the last visible window in which case the order goes:
window onunload
quit-application-granted
quit-application

Granted the window is technically closed by clicking "X", but it also initiates browser shutdown.  I looked for a bug changing the shutdown order, but could not find one.

My extension listens for the "quit-application-granted" to run certain processing.  It also unregisters the "quit-application-granted" observer in the onunload handler because if it didn't it would cause memory leaks when windows are closed.  It works fine in Firefox 2.0, but in 3.0 the the "quit-application-granted" observer is removed when the last window is closed manually before it has a chance to fire.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Observe quit-application-granted and quit-application
2. Listen for window unload event.
2. Close Firefox 3.0 using "X" on window

Actual Results:  
Fire order:
window unload event
quit-application-granted
quit-application

Expected Results:  
Fire order:
quit-application-granted
window unload event
quit-application
