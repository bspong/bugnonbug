Tab does not load on start up with two windows and minimum two tabs per window
This is similar, or possibly the same, as bug 1090430, but mconley indicated that I should file a new bug.

I reproduced this in a fresh profile, which is how I was able to isolate it to a very precise set of circumstances.  With a new profile,

1. Open two windows.
2. Open two tabs per window and load pages in all four tabs.
3. Close Firefox.
4. Open Firefox.

Expected:

Visible tab in both windows loads and displays content normally.

Actual:

One window (background, I believe) appears to load content but does not display it.  Instead there is just a throbber, usually frozen (I think I saw it continue to spin once in my testing).  Switching to the other tab and back causes the content to display.  The other window displays content as normal.

The conditions have to be very specific for this to happen.  It *only* happens with two or more windows, and at least two windows must have two or more open tabs.  I verified that the problem does not occur with two windows and only one open tab in one or both windows.  With three windows, at least two must have two open tabs to reproduce; the third window can only have one open tab and even be in the foreground to continue to reproduce the error, as long as the other two windows have two or more open tabs.
