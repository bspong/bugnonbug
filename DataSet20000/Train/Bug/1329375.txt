Steps to reproduce:

I didn't know Firefox was Crashing til just now on the 6th,I read stories about my TV shows and leave my internet browser up when I go to bed so I can read on that site the next day.. The last 3-4 days that site/page has been gone I figured my computer has been restarting cause maybe of updates because I have a new computer,did it tonight on the 6th with my brother in law and he said the box said it crashed.. I have the lastest update for Firefox and I have Windows 10 PLEASE fix this I LOVE you're Firefox I don't want to have to LEAVE it PLEASE I'm really asking you to FIX this CRAP once and for all PLEASE!!!!!


Actual results:

I didn't get to see the box rather if it said Firefox crashed or not was not using the computer brother in law said that's what it said,last 3-4 after I gotten up Firefox browser has been gone by it self after I had left it up from the night before..


Expected results:

I have left the browser on this site that I have on for YEAR'S with no problems at all and its not caused any problems shouldn't had done anything at all should had left the browser alone but the last 3-4 days at LEAST that the page/site has been gone for some reason I don't know why....
