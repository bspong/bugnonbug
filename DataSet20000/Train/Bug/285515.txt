Novell BorderManager SSL authentication page shows HTML source code
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050225 Firefox/1.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050225 Firefox/1.0.1

My preferred text editor, which I use to edit HTML files (UltraEdit32)
automatically detects the file type when the file is loaded. It will look for
the FF FE marker for Unicode files and I found that it was prepending UTF-8
files with this marker were it not present. 

Therefore when I customize the BMLogin page, even simple text changes, this file
marker was added at the start of the file. Normally this has no effect, but when
the page is served by the BorderManager mini webserver and viewed with the
firefox browser, things broke ie. HTML source code is displayed. IE displays the
page fine.

If I make the edits in Notepad or DOS Edit then the custom page works fine.
Because the Unicode file marker is not added to the file.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Customize the BorderManager login page using UltraEdit32 or use any HTML file
that has the Unicode file marker (FF FE)
2.Attempt to authenticat to the proxy server using Firefox
3.HTML source code of the BMLogin page is displayed

Actual Results:  
HTML source code of the BMLogin page is displayed and authentication is not
possible.

Expected Results:  
Authentication page should be displayed

This problem is specific to an interaction between the Novell BorderManager mini
web server and the Firefox browser and as such has a very limited scope.
