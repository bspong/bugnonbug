Some places are permanently "stuck" in places.sqlite (negative parent values)

Main symptom:
Several sites, that are not currently bookmarks, cannot be cleared from autocomplete drop-down box in the location bar with Clear Private Data.  They are not starred in the drop-down box, further indicative that they are not bookmarks.  They also do not show up in the history.  I admit, this sounds similar to a lot of other bug posts, but seems a bit different.  I definitely visited these sites, but perhaps I bookmarked them and then deleted them (I don't remember).  That is, it may be more a bookmark deletion bug instead of a history bug.  The only reason I say this is that I found them grouped together under "moz_bookmarks" in places.sqlite, which does not seem to contain any other non-bookmark entries besides RSS stories, suggesting that I once bookmarked them.

These sites (only 5) got stuck early on (and are still stuck) right after I installed 3.0, but no more sites have accumulated since then (several weeks), ie I have not been able to reproduce it. Possible reasons: Perhaps it was because I was still trying out different options and features at first, but since then I've left things alone (turned off history).  I also had a lot of crashes due to a FF+AVG7.5 virus scan bug which might have corrupted things, which I have also since disabled.

More symptoms:
I cannot bookmark these sites with Ctrl-D or clicking on the star (no "Edit This Bookmark" dialog box appears).  I can forcibly bookmark them by dragging its tab into the Library, but deleting them still leaves me with the original problem.

My (small) debugging contribution:
I installed the extension "SQLite Manager 0.3.4", and I found the stuck sites grouped together in moz_bookmarks.  I found something unique about all the stuck sites: they all had large negative "parent" values.  They also had "NULL" for "lastModified", which only the RSS entries otherwise had.

places.sqlite->moz_bookmarks:
(title is truncated, typ=type, po=position, key=keyword_id, fol=folder_type, mod=lastModified)

Hope that helps.  I imagine I can delete these sites from places.sqlite using SQLite Manager, but I will leave them in there for now for debugging purposes.
