[Tracking Requested - why for this release]:

[Affected versions]:
- Nightly 58.0a1 (2017-09-26)
- Firefox Beta 57.0b3 

[Affected Platforms]:
- All Windows
- All Mac OS
- All Linux

[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Open Firefox browser with a new profile.
2. Press "Shift + F2" key combination to open the "Developer Toolbar".
3. Observe the toolbar closing button.
4. Click the Firefox "Menu" button and choose the "Customize" option.
5. From the bottom controls, choose to change the theme to "Dark" one.
6. Click the "Done" button and observe again the Developer Toolbar closing button.

[Expected result]:
- On both themes the toolbar closing button is correctly visible.

[Actual result]:
- On "Dark" theme, even if the toolbar color doesn't change (white), the button and its hover effect do and become invisible.

[Regression]:
I've checked for a regression and found out when this broke. Probably when the developer decided to make the change in #1389939, forgot to also change the button color.
