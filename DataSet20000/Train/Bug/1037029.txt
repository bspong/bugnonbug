Update hotfix may be installed in disabled state
Catalin discovered that the update hotfix is installed in disabled mode on OS X and Linux and never gets uninstalled. I can reproduce.

STR:

1) New profile on Linux or Mac
2) Hook up extension updating to addons-dev.allizom.org
3) Trigger some extension updates

Results:

1) We get the SSL cert hotfix on first trigger
1a) If your Firefox version is really old, we'll get another cert hotfix on 2nd trigger
2) We get the update hotfix on next trigger
3) Hotfix is installed, but disabled

This doesn't make much sense because bootstrap.js's install() explicitly sets userDisabled = false [1].

I dug into things and the add-on's appDisabled is true!

During the review stages of bug 1014194, <em:targetPlatform>WINNT</em:targetPlatform> was added to the install.rdf. I reckon this is what's causing appDisabled to be true.

A handful of existing hotfixes set <targetPlatform>, so there's precedent for it.

Looking at the implementation of other hotfixes, they each perform an "is compatible" check in bootstrap.js:install() and do an uninstall if not. This code runs even if appDisabled is set.

The update hotfix, by contrast, performs its "is compatible" check in update.jsm, which runs after startup(). startup() never runs because appDisabled=true.

The easy fix is to remove <targetPlatform> from install.rdf and let the hotfix code post startup() do the uninstall. This code works fine on Linux and Mac.

I knew better than this. I should have pushed back on the review comment that asked to add <targetPlatform> :/
