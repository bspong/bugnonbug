Watching the video at the URLed site, in a roughly square aspect
window, I maximezed the flash viewport to the window size. The
video played okay, but then when I clicked the window's upper
right corner "maximize" widget, the video halted, Firefox became
unresponsive (never, for example, painting the fullscreen window's
contents, refusing to close in response to the close widget) and
eventually had to be shut down with the WinXP task manager.

Talkback, which I'm pretty sure I've installed, never came up,
but a "you recently crashed, do you want to start with the old
tabset" requestor did appear when next I started Firefox.
