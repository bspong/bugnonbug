find functionality hangs on pdf viewer pages
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:23.0) Gecko/20130905 Firefox/23.0 (Nightly/Aurora)
Build ID: 20130905203958

Steps to reproduce:

1) Using a fresh load of firefox 23.0.1, press <ctrl>-f to open the "find" functionality.
2) Enter "practitioner" in the find box (or some string that can be found in the pdf that will be used in the next step). 
3) Start the open of a large pdf document (one that will take some time to load so that there is time to press a button while it is loading). It doesn't matter which one but the house of representatives health care bill is big enough for almost any speed machine or network, it is at:
http://housedocs.house.gov/rules/health/111_ahcaa.pdf
4) While the pdf is loading  in the firefox pdf viewer, press the "next" button.
5) After the pdf completes loading, press the "next" button again.
6) Repeat step 5 as many times as desired.



Actual results:

No find functionality is exhibited from steps 4, 5, or 6, regardless of how many times or how long one waits.

Details:
The find functionality does not hang if the load completes before step 4 is done. 



Expected results:

The find functionality should work at least in steps 5 and 6; and the press at step 4 should also work eventually although it is arguably not as important as steps 5 and 6.
