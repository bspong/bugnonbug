Firefox gets sluggish and seems to pause every so often if KOL Chat is left open for a while

After logging into KOL and opening up LoathingChat and leaving it open for a while (preferably while listening to active channels like /newbie), Firefox will pause every so often and not accept keyboard input or respond to mouse clicks--but will "catch up" to itself after a bit so no keystrokes or mouse clicks are lost. This pausing behavior happens in all Firefox windows and not just the frame or window that lchat.php is in.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in to KoL at http://www.kingdomofloathing.com/ . 
2. Click on "Enter the Chat" in the frame on the right.
3. Wait a bit for people to chat and fill the chat pane up so you need to scroll up quite a bit to see everything. You'll need to keep typing things in chat every 15 minutes or so to keep the connection alive.
Actual Results:  
Notice occasional pauses in responsiveness to mouse and keyboard input in any Firefox window.

Expected Results:  
Should remain responsive at all times to mouse and keyboard input.

I've noticed this bug on my Vista machine, even after a fresh reinstall of the OS. However, it doesn't seem to turn up on my Ubuntu, XP, or OS X machines.

Additionally, this bug didn't happen on Firefox 2 on my Vista machine, either.
