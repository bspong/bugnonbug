I use firefox as my default web browser for internet.

But since release of 3.6 i am facing some bugs in this new version.

Normaly at my work I access internet through a proxy server.

But eventhough i am part of a domain at work, usualy i use my laptop as admin and internet i access through proxy.

When using version previous versions ( 3.5..) When i try to connect to internet it asks me for proxy log in details and then i could navigate normaly.

But i face problems after i installed version 3.6 ( i tried also 3.7) that after i start browsing it asks me for login details and if i try to open another page it requests again for proxy details.

It keeps requesting for every page. I have even used remeber password option and its automaticaly completed but i have to press several time OK.

Just to be sure that it was not happening to my computer only i tested on 10 of my colleagues PC and the result is the same.

If i log in in domain i don't face this problem.

It is present in networks with domain.
