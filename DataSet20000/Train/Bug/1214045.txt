Restore browser.newtab.url behavior
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:41.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/41.0
Build ID: 20150929144111

Steps to reproduce:

Updated to a recent version of Firefox, can't remember the exact one but it's about a month old.


Actual results:

My "newtab.url" setting is not respected and every bug/support request about this problem suggests installing an add-on to restore this functionality, because Mozilla thought malware was exploiting this functionality (cf. https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1085359 ) for malicious purposes and the best solution was to remove the functionality.


Expected results:

It is not Mozilla's job to fix idiot user behavior by removing functionality, especially since the idea is flawed from the start - you can't fight malware which runs with the same privileges as the user, or worse - administrative privileges. Removing this functionality won't do anything against malware, since it can very well install itself as an extension and patch the Firefox binary to bypass code signing requirements - or completely change the Firefox shortcut to point to a malicious binary, which it can do since changing the shortcut's destination doesn't even require administrative privileges.

Now please stop the nonsense, restore this basic and must-have functionality and avoid wasting everyone's time by forcing them to use a third-party addon.
