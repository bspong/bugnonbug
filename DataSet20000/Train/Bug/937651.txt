Replace the sessionstore.js with an sessionstore.sqlite
It seems that when a user always saves his session and restart them, the sessionstore.js grows rapidly, Firefox needs a lot of memory, slow down, get instable and creates a lot of crashers (with no thread identified).
Replacing the sessionstore.js with an sessionstore.sqlite can maybe fix this (and a lot of other) problems.


It seems that when a user always saves his session and restart them (e.g. after crashes) - even he do not reload all tabs - the sessionstore.js grows rapidly.
It seems that then Firefox needs more and more memory from session to session, slow down and get instable.
It seems that FF crashes then a lot - mostly with:
[@ EMPTY: no crashing thread identified; corrupt dump ]

If the sessionstore.js reaches ~100MB it seems FF crashes immediately after restart with the following two Crash Signatures:
[@ mozalloc_abort(char const* const) | NS_DebugBreak | nsTextEditorState::GetValue(nsAString_internal&, bool) ]
[@ mozalloc_abort(char const* const) | mozalloc_handle_oom(unsigned int) | moz_xmalloc | ConvertBreaks<wchar_t> ]

Also a big sessionstore.js file can't be opened in any other program to work with the session for e.g. convert it to bookmarks.


Replacing the sessionstore.js with an sessionstore.sqlite can maybe fix this (and a lot of other) problems.
