Session restore causes prompting for cookies with leading "." in domain name (e.g. .google.com)

When you visit a site with domain level session cookies (e.g. google.com or linuxquestions.org) and have the cookie option "ask me every time" and the startup option "restore my tabs from last time" set then the cookie domain in the cookie accept dialogue is not 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable cookie accept option "ask me every time", clear host list for domain to be checked (e.g. linuxquestions.org).
2. Set startup option "restore my browser tabs from last time".
3. Visit a site with domain level (i.e. no "www") session cookies, e.g. linuxquestions.org .
4. Set "allow for session" and "remember this decision".  You should not be asked again.
5. Exit firefox with linuxquestions.org still open.
6. Re-open firefox.
Actual Results:  
Cookie dialog box appears asking whether to accept cookies from domain ".linuxquestions.org" (yes, with a leading "."!).

Expected Results:  
Cookie dialog box for appears linuxquestions.org domain does not appear because we remembered it previously.  It works correctly when linuxquestions.org is opened manually, not by "session restore".
