When I open the "Open File" or "Save as" dialog it is a blank window (no area for shown files, just Grey like the border).  There is only a drop-down menu on the top for locations and a search box to the right of it.  The locations in the drop-down menu are not standard, (They show folder locations and websites previously accessed).  Any attempt to access a location opens a miniature, non-resizable window with a "close button" taking up almost the whole window and causes an error beep.  When the "close button" is pressed, Firefox crashes. Any attempt to manually input an address in the drop-down menu does nothing or opens the miniature window. Others with the problem report the rolling-back windows to pre-sp1 fixes rhe problem.  The problem goes away for me when I disable the "Places Bar" in the left side of Vista's common dialog (using the Tuneup System Control Applet of Tuneup Utilities). Safe mode does nothing.
