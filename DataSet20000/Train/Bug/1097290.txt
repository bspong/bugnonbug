Clicked on a link - and received a faulty error message - the link is valid
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:32.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/32.0
Build ID: 20140923175406

Steps to reproduce:

NB: FF version is:  32.0.3

Clicked on this web page

<https://shop.ashampoo.com/10/paypal/65677927 >

and got a (faulty) error msg - see detail below.  

The link is, in fact, valid - & works correctly in Opera.
So it must be a FF-specific problem!

NB: I had to contact Ashampoo to get this resolved.
It was not apparent it was a fault within FF - based on the error msg!

NB: They suggested it might be a fault in FF ......and they were right!  :-)

They identified that the link was truncated after a "-"
- in case that helps.

I just tried the link again - just before submitting this bug .. and it's still
failing with the same error.

Since I have dealt with this via Opera now, I have been able to pay
& complete my order for the relevant Ashampoo s'ware.

However, clearly there is a problem .. It should be looked into!
I was, after all, trying to make a Paypal payment.  Who knows
what security issues may have arisen as a result of this.

I just have to hope that nothing untoward has occurred.
