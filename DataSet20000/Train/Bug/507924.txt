After I upgraded from the nightly build 20090731 to 20090801, my bookmarks tab and all my bookmarks, as well as my typing and browsing history were gone.

After checking the profile folder, the bookmarks file was there and it was fine,
it wouldn't appear in the browser.
Even attempting to add new bookmarks, or importing from a backup or a html backup produced no results. No error messages, and nothing happens.

After downgrading to the build from 31st July 2009, everything seems fine. The bookmarks, the history, the bar, everything is there.

Upgrading to the build from 2nd August produced the bug again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Minefield Nightly build from 31. July 2009 or lower
2. Create bookmarks
3. Upgrade to a build from 1st August 2009 or later
Actual Results:  
Bookmarks, browsing and typing history disappeared. No new bookmarks were possible to add.

Expected Results:  
Show the bookmarks bar, the bookmarks and the history.

I have used the nightly tester tools to force-install the pitchdark theme, but uninstalling it and using the default theme still produced the bug.
