accesskey doesn't work for <input type="file">

Tested via the following HTML page:
<html>
<body>
<form>
  <label for="male" accesskey="m">Male</label>
  <input type="file" name="sex" id="male"/>
  <br />
  <label for="female" accesskey="f">Female</label>
  <input type="file" name="sex" id="female"/>
</form>
</body>
</html>

Press alt+shift+f then press tab; focus moves to the "Browse..."
button of the first input, which is incorrect. I would expect focus to move to the "Browse..." button of the second input.

Maybe FF doesn't set the focus since the input field is read-only, but if that's the case can you instead set the focus on the "Browse..." button?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a local HTML file using the included HTML.
2. Try the alt+shift+f accesskey.
Actual Results:  
It seems that focus is set on the page/document instead of the input.

Expected Results:  
Focus should be set on the input associated with accesskey="f". The "Browse..." button acts as a tab stop, so perhaps it's possible for the browser to set focus on it.
