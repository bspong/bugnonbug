Firefox 2.0 loses network connection, firefox.exe still running after closing window

"While casually browsing pages, suddenly all browser activity stops completely. Firefox acts as if it has lost the network connection."
It happens to me every 20-40 minutes if I use the browser. After it freezes, the interface is still usable, but it won't be able to make any new network connection.. you cannot load new webpages, but also not RSS feeds, nor check for Extension updates, etc. So like if network was down, except it isn't (other browsers work).
After I close the window, firefox.exe remains in task manager processes. I have to kill it manually, and only then I can browse again with a newly started Firefox.

Didn't have this problem with Firefox 1.5, I disabled my Firewall, updated Java, updated Flash, disabled all Extensions, the problem still occurs.
