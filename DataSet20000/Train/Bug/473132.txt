Autoscroll getting "stuck" on
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko/20090111 Minefield/3.2a1pre ID:20090111021127

In the past couple days, I've had autoscroll get stuck turned on for me twice. In both cases, when I started it on a tab, it would not stop, even when I left clicked or middle clicked again. Closing the tab and hitting ctrl+shift+T would fix it for that tab. In one case, the icon was present in all tabs in the same place, and starting autoscroll in a new tab would not give an icon where the click was. In the other case, no icons showed at all.

Menus (File, Edit, etc) were not accessible when this happened.

One time, restarting Firefox fixed it. The other time, unmaximizing the window fixed it.

The first time this happened was maybe two or three days ago. Given the time between first sighting and second sighting, it's probably somewhere between 3 days old and a week or so.

I'm currently (this is after fixing it by unmaximizing) getting the following error ridiculously many times in the error console. I have no idea if it's related or not:
Error: [Exception... "'JavaScript component does not have a method named: "handleEvent"' when calling method: [nsIDOMEventListener::handleEvent]"  nsresult: "0x80570030 (NS_ERROR_XPC_JSOBJECT_HAS_NO_FUNCTION_NAMED)"  location: "<unknown>"  data: no]

NoScript was installed about a week ago, so if it is an extension it could be that.


I would love confirmation that anyone else has seen this.
