This issue applies to a page with multiple textfields (all with different
autocomplete data in each text field.  If the user uses autocomplete on one
textfield and then moves to another text field and presses the down arrow, the
autocomplete options presented are wrong.  Instead autocomplete presents
whatever the last selection option from the other textfield.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://atwnt333.external.hp.com/bus-nacons/caller/chat_pilot.asp
2. Fill in some data in the text fields and hit the "conect" button
3. Go back to the same page again.
4. Select and use an autocomplete option on the first text field (any method is
ok, whether it be keyboard or mouse).  In other words, fill in that text field
using autocomplete.
5. Place the cursor in another blank text field.
6. Press the down arrow key.

Actual Results:  
You will notice that the option that autocomplete gives you is the same data as
what you filled in in the previous text field.
You can repeat this process on other textfields and it will show the same data.

Expected Results:  
Autocomplete should have showed you the options available for the specific
textfield.
