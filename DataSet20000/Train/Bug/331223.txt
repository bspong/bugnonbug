Don't know if this is actually a bug, but it's weird. Drudge Report 2006 is the only site so far that's happened. Unnamed tabs will start opening. I have "Block Popups" checked, but these are separate tabs. Right clicking to see the "Page Info" produces zilch. Blank, gray screens, nothing in the top (blue) bar. I let it go one time, then closed the browser, and got the "Closing Multiple Tabs" warning...it said I was about to close 308 tabs. Weird. This just started happening within the last few days or so. I ran my AV and came out clean. Also, the Download Manager box will open, but nothing's listed. I have to ctrl+alt+delete to stop it, and shut down Firefox.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Went to http://www.drudgereport.com/#plutonium
2. Waited
3. Reorted this thang in case it happened again

Actual Results:  
Nothing...yet. Still waiting.

Expected Results:  
Expecting all those tabs to start opening...Drudge Report automatically refreshes every so many seconds/minutes/whatever. Maybe that's when it occurs.
