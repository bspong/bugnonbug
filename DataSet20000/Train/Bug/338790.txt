The CPU Usage is getting high and then to normal and back to high in a cyclic manner (much like a sine wave) if I use firefox.
This doesn't occur if I use Mozilla or Netscape browsers.
I have provided the task manager screenshot for your reference.

This image shows the sine wave image of the processor

This image shows that the firefox exe is using 98% of the resources at that time of high period in the curve.

I'm using Windows 2003 OS
I have ZoneAlarm Firewall Enabled (I have given firefox full access)
I have installed Symantec Corporate Edition Antivirus also.

And this happens, even if I'm not connected to the internet.
When I try to browse local files or intranet files, this problem occurs.
