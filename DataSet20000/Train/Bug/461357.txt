Boodmark disappears after being created

I go to a particular web site and create a bookmark for that web site. I appears at the end of my shown bookmarks. I can even create a remembered login for that site. However, after I close Firefox, or even just minimize it that bookmark disappears. A search for it in the bookmarks yields no result.

Manually enter the URL and the site comes up even with my "remenbered" login information. Can create the bookmark over and over again, only to have it disappear again.

I thought that maybe there was a numerical limit on the number of bookmarks so I deleted two (2) of my bookmarks, closed Firefox, and re-booted . Then tried to bookmark a web site.

Like as before the "new" bookmark is created and added to the end of the bookmark listing, but when Firefox is closed and then re-opened that newly created bookmark is no longer there. I's as if that bookmark was NEVER there, it just disappears.
