Playing Videos on WSJ - must play in IE tab.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10 GTB5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10 GTB5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When I click to play a video, it appears to start, but the video never downloads.  I can see that with a download gadget in my Sidebar.  The advertisement that appears before the video also does not download consistently.  All works normally in IE8 or in an IEtab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the WSJ - from the addressbar, a link, it does not matter for me
2.Click on a video
3.
Actual Results:  
I get a sound which starts all videos, I see a flash screen of the video, and I get a screen telling me the video will start in 15 seconds.  The screen has the double vertical line to "pause" a video.  Clicking that has no effect that I can see.  

Expected Results:  
In IE8 or an IEtab, I see the video -- which is why clicked on the thing anyway.

WSJ is paid site, but I expect most users are not FF  people.  However, this weakness in FF is not going to endear FF to the corporate IT people.

If you have further questions, I figure you know how to find my email, feel free to ask.
