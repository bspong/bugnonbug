no flash (player 9) content displays on Firefox 2.0.0.1 (works on Safari and earlier Firefox)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1

I'm using a PowerPC Mac, OS 10.3.9, Flash player plugin 9,0,28,0.

After upgrading to:
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1)
Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1
...the Flash player stopped showing Flash animations.

It's worked fine for years through many Firefox upgrades without needing any
attention. It still works fine in Safari. Haven't tried IE.

See the Adobe Flash test page at
http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/about/index.html
...this displays fine in Safari, telling me my Flash plugin is installed fine.
Nothing rendered in Firefox 2.0.0.1.

Interestingly, after using the Flash plugin uninstaller, then the installer, as
root, Firefox started, and showed me the above page fine.

Re-running Firefox as a normal user does not display the Flash.

I don't think it can be permissions-related, as running Safari as a normal user
works fine.

Hope this helps,
kind regards,
Matthias Grunwalde

ps I've mentioned this under bug 358143, but that relates to "pictures" not displaying - this is definitely flash that's not being displayed

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.visit any flash site
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
no flash content is rendered

Expected Results:  
you should see the 'flash player correctly installed' message (or words to that effect) - and it also shows the player version

I've set this as 'Major' as Flash is the primary animation format on the web.
