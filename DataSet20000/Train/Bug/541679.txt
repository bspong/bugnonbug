Blank article rather than saving it on a Wikia.

Sometimes, when editing an article on a Wikia, pressing the save button will show a preview of a blank article, rather than the altered page. Didn't happen in versions of Firefox earlier to 3.6.
MIGHT only happen on Carmageddon Wiki (http://carmageddon.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page), but it most likely happens in other Wikias as well.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Edit a page on a Wikia
2. Press the save button
Actual Results:  
A preview page is shown, showing a blank article, and the edit box is blank as well.

Expected Results:  
The page should've been saved.

An edit summary is almost always written, though this bug seems to happen when an edit summary isn't specified as well. Preferences are set to always preview on first edit. This means that when the edit page button is pressed, a preview immediately appears, and the edit box is at the bottom; as opposed to only showing the edit box, and a preview being optional with the preview button.
