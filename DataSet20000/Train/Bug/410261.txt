apologies if this is being taken care of elsewhere, but I couldn't find it.

Starting this morning, after no problems last nght prior to shutdown, with no software changes, the address bar is not displaying anything other than the symbol of the website, like the mozilla dinosaur head or google's G.
If I remove the nav tool bar and re add it, the correct page is then displayed, but as I progress through a site, the url does not follow suit.

I recently, last week, had to create a new user account to fix another issue that  has not reappeared. the add-ons i have in use are pdf downloader, the g-space, and Ie emulator, 

I really like firefox, but for problems in the functionality of the like this to keep popping up time and again, I'm getting sick of it.

anything I can do to rectify this sit I'll gladley do and then report back

'thanks

 Chris
