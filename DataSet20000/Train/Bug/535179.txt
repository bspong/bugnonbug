When I delete the most recent visit to a frequently-visited site from my history, the site no longer comes up at or near the top of the location bar when I type in the first few letters.  These are sites that I visit every day and should be coming up at the top even if I hadn't visited them for a day.  

Immediately after deleting, the sites don't appear at all in the location bar autocomplete, even though they appear many times in the history.  When I manually enter the URL for one of the sites, it seems to start back into the autocomplete system as though it was a completely new site with no visits.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a history item that comes up in top spot for a location bar autocomplete of a certain string based on past days' visits.
2. Go to that site.
3. Go to history and delete the item "Today", erasing all history items for the current day.
4. Attempt to bring up the same history item from step 1 based on the same autocomplete search string.
Actual Results:  
Item that used to be at the top of the autocomplete list is now missing.

Expected Results:  
Item should still be there based on previous days' visits.
