Previously visited sites listed under the Go menu do not open in current window or new tab when selected/clicked

Whatever site is open in the browser remains unchanged when pulling down the Go menu and selecting any previously-visited site listed there. The window just sits there as though no selection has been made. Moreover, holding down the command key and selecting a site from the Go menu does not open a new tab - it also does nothing. Same with the control key where I navigate to "open in new tab" using the contextual menu. Simply, in all these scenarios, nothing happens. Opening the History pane and clicking links in that continues to work perfectly. This behavior was noted before and after restarting Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open browser, allow home page to load.
2. Pull down Go menu and select any site.
3. Watch nothing happen.

Actual Results:  
As indicated above.

Expected Results:  
Site/link selected from the Go menu should replace topmost tab/url, or, using either the command key or the control key, should open the selection in a new tab.
