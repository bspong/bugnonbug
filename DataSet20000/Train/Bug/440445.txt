On pages from slow servers with many pictures, not all pictures are loading. (Additionally, duplicate context menu entry in German version.)

Pages from some servers with many pictures don't show all the pictures, some show up as "broken picture", they can be reloaded by right-clicking on the picture and choosing the first entry "Grafik anzeigen" of the context menu. (The second entry also named "Grafik anzeigen" shows the picture on its own. The two menu entries should be named differently.)

The same pages show up well in Opera, Safari, MSIE and older Firefox versions. Is Firefox's timeout set too low when loading pictures and building up the page?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the above page, or any page from http://railfaneurope.net/ with many pictures.
2. Some pictures (different ones whenever you load the same page) are not loaded.
3. Right-click on the "broken" graphics and see the duplicate menu entry (probably a translation error).
Actual Results:  
The page shows up with some graphics replaced by a frame with a "broken page" icon.

Expected Results:  
The page should be shown with all graphics (after all the server is sending them all).
