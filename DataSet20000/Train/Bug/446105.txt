When importing bookmarks, cannot delete updated folders and some bookmarks missing
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.16) Gecko/20080702 Firefox/2.0.0.16
Build Identifier: Firefox 3.0

I couldn't use the BUILD INDENTIFIER BECAUSE I went back to 2.0. ON both my XP computers, when I import bookmarks --- which I do daily, home to office and back--- after the bookmark folders are imported, I delete the older ones.  The page freezes up half the time, the other half it works.  But now I noticed that certain bookmarks and folders were not included.  But they do show up with Firefox 2.0!!!  They're hidden in 3.0.  From the start, 3.0 bookmark importint is slow, and now partially freezes.  I'm using 2.0 on my two XP's, and 3.0 on my Vista's.  Should I have uninstalled manually 2.0 before installing 3.0?  or do we have a compatibility problem here.  Vista imports and reads the 2.0 bookmarks fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  IN XP, import bookmark folders that named the same as existing bookmarks and folders
2. Try to delete the older versions
3. Page Slows up and freezes, or after five minutes the older versions are deleted
4. Check bookmarks imported, not all bookmarks and bookmark folders may be there
Actual Results:  
Same

Expected Results:  
Deleted the old bookmarks and bookmark folders leaving the new imported versions
