When about:config is opened in a tab and other tabs are also open, an
intermittent screen redraw bug can occur.  Specifically, when viewing another
tab and then clicking over to the tab displaying about:config, the area where
the Filter search box should be is not properly drawn, and shows the graphics
that were being viewed on the previous tab.  **SEE ATTACHED SCREENSHOT**

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a tab to about:config
2. Open one or more other tabs to various pages (e.g. mozilla.org, google.com,
etc.).
3. Click around in the tabs, opening new tabs, closing tabs... i.e. normal browsing
4. Periodically click back to the tab displaying about:config.
Actual Results:  
4. Intermittently, the area where the Filter search box SHOULD be will show
"remnant" graphics from the previous tab.  See the attached screenshot.  This
does not always occur... I have not yet narrowed down the exact sequence of
events, but it has to do with multiple windows and/or tabs being opened/closed
before clicking back to the about:config tab.

Expected Results:  
Obviously, the screen should have been properly drawn to include the Filter
search box, etc.

See the attached screenshot for an example.  This is Firefox v1.0.6 on MacOS X
(10.3.9).
