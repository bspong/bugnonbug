Page redraws unnecessarily if select tag contains more options than are visible

If I insert (via Ajax) a select tag on a page, which select tag 1) allows for multiple select, 2) displays three items (size="3"), and 3) has more than three total options, so that the vertical scroll is active, the entire page repaints (an ugly flash). The page is fairly complex, and the select is inside a table cell. The html in question (the table and a couple of wrapper divs) is also being loaded into a div via Ajax. 

Removing the select eliminates the redraw. If the select has all options visible, that eliminates the redraw.

My ugly workaround is to hide the outermost div on load and use setTimeout to fade it in after 300ms. It works and isn't noticeable to the user. Would be nice if it weren't necessary.
