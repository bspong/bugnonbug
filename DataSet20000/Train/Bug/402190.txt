presence of DTD field in !DOCTYPE causes first image on page to be lost
User-Agent:       Opera/8.51 (Windows NT 5.1; U; en)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko/20071025 Firefox/2.0.0.9

A very simple page with just two image tags fails to display both images when the following tag is present: 

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"  "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">

but shows them correctly if the dtd declaration is missing. It doesn't matter what is in the dtd field -- even empty quotation marks cause the effect:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"  "">

not a problem in Opera or MSIE. First observed at http://www.saintmarys.edu/~pbays/Stereochemistry/3DFish.htm, where there should be an image in the two left-side panels.
