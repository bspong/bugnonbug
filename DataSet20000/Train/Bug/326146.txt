.url shortcuts with long querystrings load incorrectly when no Firefox instances open

If a windows .url shortcut's URL, with querystring, exceeds 255 characters *and* there are no instances of Firefox already running, then the newly spawned Firefox splits up the querystring and opens a tab trying to navigate to each bit. Obviously this doesn't work. The result is that the .url does not load correctly and the user is left with many garbage tabs.

Format of problem URL (the "real" one disguised a bit because I'm reluctant to give out our dodgy beta site) :

If the long URL is pasted into the location bar or navigated to via a normal HREF link it works fine. Bizarrely, it also works fine if a Firefox instance is already open.

It works in all cases in Internet Explorer.

This is the case on at least Firefox 1.0.7 and the current latest release, 1.5.0.1.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ensure no instances of Firefox are open
2. Ensure Firefox is the default browser (which makes it the .url handler)
3. Double click .url file pointing to a valid URL longer than 255 characters, due to a long query string

Actual Results:  
URL is not fully loaded, many garbage tabs trying to navigate to bits of the rest of the URL are created.

Expected Results:  
URL should load normally, as it does if a Firefox instance is already open and as it does in all cases in Internet Explorer.


Making a windows .url shortcut via right-click --> New Shortcut, or right-click --> Create Shortcut in IE limits the length of the URL to 255 characters. (I'm guessing this is just because they reused a file dialog control.)

*However*, my application needs long querystrings from .url's to feed it data, i.e. .url's similar to the above (details section) which are longer than 255 characters. These can be constructed, and are accepted by IE as valid. They can be made either : 
- Making a shortcut to www.example.com or whatever then editing the properties. At this point, URLs > 255 characters can be entered.
- Manually outputting a .url file (what my applet does).

No special configuration or themes, tested on multiple XP / win2k systems with the same results.
