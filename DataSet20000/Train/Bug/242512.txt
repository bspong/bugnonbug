Favicon appears in address bar even when browser.chrome.favicons is false

I have browser.chrome.favicons false and browser.chrome.site_icons true, because
I see no need to have the icons appear in both the tab itself and the url bar.
On a page with a favicon, the icon apears in the address bar after I refresh the
page. It vanishes if I change tabs, and back, or if I click a link. It also
appears very briefly when switching between tabs. This only appears if both are
set as mentioned.

Minor annoyance.
