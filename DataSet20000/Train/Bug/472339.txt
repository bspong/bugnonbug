Firefox 3 not listed in Windows Default Programs
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When I had Firefox 2 installed everything was OK but after installing Firefox 3 I've noticed that Firefox is missing from the Windows Default Programs list. After some researching and comparing registry entries for Firefox 2 and 3 I was able to fix the problem.
Here's what I found out:
Basically the problem is in the two registry keys FirefoxHTML and FirefoxURL.
In Firefox 2 the (Default) values for the keys
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\FirefoxHTML\shell\open\command
and
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\FirefoxURL\shell\open\command
are set to
"C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe" -requestPending -osint -url "%1".
In Firefox 3 the (Default) values for those keys are empty.
Also in Firefox 2 the (Default) values for the keys
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\FirefoxHTML\DefaultIcon
and
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\FirefoxURL\DefaultIcon
are set to
C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe,1.
In Firefox 3 those values are set to C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox,1.
Changing the values back to the way they were in Firefox 2 fixes the problem.
