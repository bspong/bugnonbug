Restart of Firefox after Yahoo mail signout = error saying Firefox did not close properly
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20070515 Firefox/2.0.0.4

I sign out of Yahoo mail properly, using Sign Out option, and close Firefox by clicking on the 'x' at top right of browser. Later (even after turning off computer) when I restart Firefox, I get a Windows error message (sorry, text unavailable) and a Firefox window saying Firefox did not shut down properly last time, which is not true.
I'm given two options: new Firefox session or restart last session. Many times upon clicking the 'restart session' button I end up BACK INSIDE MY MAIL INBOX, and this has happened when someone else was using my computer, twice giving them access to my private webmail.
Please fix!!! This is a serious bug!
Thanks.

Expected a crash, but when I try to reproduce it behaves normally.

I would expect it to return either to the Yahoo mail signup page or my preset browser home page.
