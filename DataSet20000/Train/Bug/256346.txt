times out when I try to open this window to manage my email or to read my webmail

When I try to open http://www.community-ventures.org/cpanel or webmail, the
browser times out and cancels the request. community-ventures.org is my
company's webpage, and cpanel is the software to manage our email, which I get
to via the above link. webmail takes one to the webmail page. The links both
work fine in: MSIE & Mozilla 1.6 on Windows XP as well as on Safari, Mozilla 1.7
& MSIE on Mac OS 10.3. It doesn't work on Mozilla 1.7 on Windows XP or 2K. I've
tried it on 5 machines on 2 networks. Plus the Mac. The 1.6 version Mozilla
worked fine on a W2K machine. Then I upgraded it to 1.7, and this link stopped
working.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.community-ventures.org/cpanel using Mozilla 1.7 on Windows
2K or XP.
2. Go to http://www.community-ventures.org/webmail using Mozilla 1.7 on Windows
2K or XP.
3.

Actual Results:  
I get an error message that says exactly this: "The operating timed out when
attempting to contact www.community-ventures.org." When I click the "OK" button
on the message box, the browser just goes back to the previous page.

Expected Results:  
Cpanel should have opened a small window where I can log in and then another
window where I can control my company's email settings. Webmail also should have
opened a small window where I can log in and then another window where I can
read my web-email.
