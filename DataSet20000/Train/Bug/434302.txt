running "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008051202 Firefox/3.0" on my PowerBook G4, http://chw.rit.edu/index.html now seems to always decide the client browser display is >= 480 pixels wide (see embedded JavaScript in the page). this page works fine in a wide range of release browsers (incl FF), but is broken in FF3. should not grab 2nd stylesheet and insert into tree if small screen detected at load. now always thinks it is on big screen.
