Memory usage is extremely high (2.2 GB after half a day)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20131206145143

Steps to reproduce:

My report is not necessary a bug report, more like a proposal:

Using Firefox for let's say half a day with no pause (browsing, youtube-ing, gmail + facebook). In total, about 12-15 open tabs.


Actual results:

Firefox got to an incredible memory usage of 2.2 GB. I think this is way too much I would like to allocate  to my browser. My computer has 4 GB of memory, the OS needs some of it and I would also like to do something else on the computer while browsing.


Expected results:

At some point the browser should clean memory. Facebook in special. Using FB in an intensive way (lots of friends, large lists/groups activity, lots of chats, messages, etc.) makes it reach an extreme memory usage. It should not be allowed to do that.

After blocking Facebook from being so hungry, another proposal would be to implement some function similar (but better working) than "The Great Suspender" extension for Chrome. A good way is to allow user to set a maximum time an unused tab would be active, and if it is inactive, it should release all its resources. Just like Firefox starts with many tabs, but without content; load it when pressing a button or when switching to that inactive tab.
