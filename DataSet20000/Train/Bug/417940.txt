I am using a Dell D600 laptop 
In My Yahoo I have a series of one line summary groups, Top Stories from Reuters, World News etc. When I mouse over one of the summary lines a popup balloon summary appears.  When the popup appears the screen is completely scrambled.
If I refresh the screen it returns to normal. If I use CTRL+ or CTRL- to change the zoom factor the problem disappears until I exit and reenter the screen.  It also happens regardless of the zoom level. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create personal My Yahoo acoount. 
2. Set up screen in 2 column format, put weather (for example) in the left column and multiple one line news summaries on the right with 10 entries each.  I have World News, Top News from Reuters and Oddly enough as my top three. 
3. Save and exit My Yahoo
4. Reenter My Yahoo and mouse over any of the one line news items and the screen scrambles.   
5. Press CTRL+ to zoom up by one and the mouse over works normally (no longer scrambles the screen)

Actual Results:  
Screen is totally scrambled and unreadable

Expected Results:  
Normal display

I am using the default theme
