Flash project which reads data from xml file. When xml file is changed, new data added, FF does NOT EVER read the new info.

IE ALWAYS Does. For IE it does require shutting down all sessions-a simple refresh won't do it, but if you close it down and reopen, then the new xml data is read. No matter what you do with Firefox, it never reads the new data. I have tried all the meta tags, commands within action script.  I find this incredibly annoying as it is affecting customers, not me.  I want them to see new proudcts added and any of them using FF will think nothing is ever added.

In Flash I have even chnaged the name of the xml file to have the date/timestamp added onto it, and it still doesn't know its a new file, still reads the old data.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. add new data to xml file
2. go to site in IE, new xml data is fed in to flash
3. go to site in FF, old xml data is read, meta tags no help, refresh no help.
FF seems to have some very odd ways of dealing with cache and being quite stubborn about it. I cannot control any settings on my customers browsers. I guess in this case its actually good that most people are still using IE, even though I personalluy far prefer FF
Actual Results:  
described above, FF does NOT read new xml file, it continually reads cached version  Add data to xml file, upload xml file, load page, old data is still being read.

Expected Results:  
read the new data in xml file
