Add better handling for HTTP downloading for the stub installer
Currently the buffer we use in the NSIS plugin InetBgDL is too small (512), so it leads to slower download speeds.
Also we only do a single big request/response.  Some proxys may buffer a resource completely.
The problem with that is we use the default WinINet timeout of 1 min.
So the stub will hang on downloading.

Fiddler is one example that produces this behavior (unless you change the setting)
It buffers the response until the whole response is there and then it releases it.
Which leads to a timeout loop.  A good proxy streams the content as it receives it.
But I'm sure not all proxies are good.

This may (or may not) be hurting stub installer conversions, so is worth fixing.
We should split the requests into multiple parts and use a larger buffer size.

When a timeout happens for this reason the user would see an indeterminate progress bar forever.
It keeps looping between these states:
1. HTTP GET with response of 302 for http://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-nightly-latest&os=win&lang=en-US
2. No response for: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla-central/firefox-19.0a1.en-US.win32.installer.exe
3. Wait a minute or so
