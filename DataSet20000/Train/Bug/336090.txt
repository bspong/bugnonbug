CSP and Key size on a Microsoft Certification Authority Web service not available

Hello, I am currently testing Mozilla 1.78 and Firefox 1.5.0.2 to connect on a Windows Server 2003 Enterprise installed as a Certification Authority. My concern is that when browsing to the certifcate request page on the CA web service (certrqma.asp), the CSP (Cryptographic Service Provider) is constantly showing "Loading" and the Key Size field is empty. Microsoft support has mentionned issues with ActiveX. Could someone please help me on this, if a workarround is available or some special configuration is to be made.
Thanks you very much for your help.
Best regards,
Kevin Rutz, CISSP

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. got to http://<ms ca machine>/certsrv
2. select "Request a Certificate"
3. select "Advanced certificate request"
4. select "Create and submit a request to this CA"
5. the certrqma.asp page is displayed with the CSP & key size problems (Loading and empty)

Actual Results:  
The CSP field is contantly showing "Loading" and the Key Size field is empty

Expected Results:  
The CSP field should show some CSPs available through the MS Server 2003 CA service (i.e. Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Service Provider v1.0), and the key size should show some figures (i.e. 512, 1024)
