Descriptive tooltips for browser UI
One of the most common issues we see in support are people who are unfamiliar with the UI of new features like the unified back/forward button, the add bookmark dialog and the location bar.

One way we can address this simply is to have a second tooltip that explains how to use a feature on mouseover if you hold it there for a second longer.

Eg: hover over the location bar, you get the URL as you do now, wait an extra 2 seconds, get the following tooltip: Smart Location Bar, type URLs to webpages here or start typing to instantly search your browsing history and bookmarks.

The same extended description for other aspects of the UI: Eg: The "bookmark menu" folder in all dialogs should tooltip to: "Holds bookmarks and folders listed when you click Bookmarks in your menu bar", even things like the [+] should tooltip to "expand this folder" (You'd be surprised how many people are confused by this since there's now an extra layer of folders).  The favicon could have the following tooltip: "Favicon, drag to a bookmark folder or toolbar to bookmark this page, click to see security information for this page"

I'd even like it for menu items to explain things like "add-ons".

A side benefit is that people will learn the names of the various aspects of the browser UI so if the DO search for help, they'll have something to search on.

(Of course, it'd be nice if this feature could be disabled but I think it's unobtrusive enough to not need it.)

Alternately, have a [help] button like they have in Microsoft office which turns your cursor to a questionmark cursor and you click on an aspect of the UI to get a help article.  I don't like this option as much as it's not as discoverable but it may be easier on localizers since the strings are all stored on the KB.
