Some commonly used web pages will not load from Mozilla.  Will load on Internet Explorer from same computer.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko/20071025 Firefox/2.0.0.9

For paypal.com, I receive the message "a script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding."  Choice is given of "Stop Script" or "Continue".  Neither of which works.  The page begins to load, but stalls out with only half of username appearing.  Then, cannot navigate on page to continue.
For constantcontact.com, I receive the message "An unexpected error has occured."  The links given to continue to the site do not function.  
These websites will function and I can log in on Internet Explorer.  
Have cleared cache, checked cookie permission.  Nothing helps.  
This all started at the time of update to 2.0.0.9.  
About this time,there was a notice to accept or reject some type of certification or validation, but I did not recognize the name and rejected it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.login to www.paypal.com
2.login to www.constantcontact.com
3.
Actual Results:  
Pages will not load or will only load partially, then stall out.

Expected Results:  
Pages should load as usual.

I was able to access these sites from another computer, so I am assuming that my own system needs some type of adjustment to accept the new update of Mozilla 2.0.0.9.  Just a guess.  Please give any suggestions.
