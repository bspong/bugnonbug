When adding a new bookmark there are three options by default
Bookmarks Toolbar
Bookmarks Menu
Unfiled bookmarks.

The choice of "unfiled" as a label is bad in two ways. Firstly, I (as well as others I have talked to) read it as "unified bookmarks" - as in, appears in both toolbar and menu.

Secondly what happens to these bookmarks that are "unfiled"? It's not a very clear term and doesn't really suggest to the layman unused to places how to search and tag bookmarks.

I suggest "unfiled" be changed to "starred pages" or something along those lines as this would show the lack of relationship to the two traditional entry points (toolbar and menu) and also would provide an analogy with both the UI itself and gmail.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add bookmark
Actual Results:  
Unfiled is easily misread as unified and is unclear on what is does

Expected Results:  
Should provide an option of "starred" pages which would be more clear.
