Opening many tabs of pages on the site www.myspace.com always show a condition
of loading.  For some reason, when returning to the page which appears to be
always loading and clicking the stop loading command, the tab may not be
deselected as the active tab by selecting another tab.  Doing so causes Firefox
to not responding as stated by clicking and holding on the Firefox icon in the
Mac OS X (10.2.8) Doc

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open several tabs at the web site  www.myspace.com

2. notice one tab which appears to be always loading and press the stop loading
button

3. select an inactive tab to become the new active tab before the stop loading
command is done--the icon changed to the non-moving icon

Actual Results:  
the application window no longer responded to mouse movements.  The application
could no longer be hidden (clover-H) no longer window-shaded and the Doc showed
the greyed note:  Application Not Responding.

Expected Results:  
Stop loading the active tab. The active tab made inactive when the new tab was
selected to be active.

Differing from a crash, Firefox hangs and mustbe closed with a loss of all open
data pages.  The force quit is needed.  After the Force Quit, Firefox opened
again and performed as normal without a need to restart the entire iMac 400 MHz
