A JAVA applet to support scanning of a document loads within the calling browser window correctly but buttons needed for operation are not visible and are not selectable.  (This also did not work under Firefox 2 but I was hoping it would under 3.)  This JAVA applet works correctly under all versions of IE on the same machine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.LOGON to banking site
2.Request service which starts a JAVA servlet/applet to accept scanning documents
3.The scanning window within the original browser window/page opens
4.There are no buttons visible or selectable to carry out the scanning operation
Actual Results:  
scanning window appears initiated by JAVA but no buttons are visible and no buttons are selectable

Expected Results:  
The scanning window should appear with control buttons below the window.  The control buttons should be active and selectable to proceed with the scanning operations.

All other passive JAVA applications (no buttons) seem to work correctly.  This also fails on a Win x64 AMD system with Firefox 2.  This JAVA application (with fully functioning buttons) works correctly under all versions of IE.

The about:plugins shows JAVA 1.6.0_07 with a variety of versions for JAVA Applets and Beans.  In the first group reported Applet (1.4.2) and Beans (1.5) from npjava14.dll.  In the next group displayed, Applet (1.1.1) and Beans (1.1) from npjava11.dll and another for npjava12.dll, npjava13.dll and npjava32.dll.  All show up as being ENABLED.  Is that normal?

I'm using the default theme (3.0.1).

Under IE, when the JAVA application is active, the IE display of active plugins shows 3 JAVA-related lines: (1) Sun JAVA Console (file = ssv.dll)
(2) SSVHelper Class (file = ssv.dll)
(3) JAVA Plugin 1.6.0_07 ActiveX Control

By the way, otherwise Firefox 3 is working great and looks good.

Thanks
