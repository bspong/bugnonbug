Debugger stops at the end of a javascript file
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:

Bring up a large and complex browser page with alot of javascript modules that execute when the page first opens. Hit Ctrl-Shift-I to bring up the built-in web dev tools. Pick a particular module that will be called when the page first comes up. Put a breakpoint that should be hit on page startup. Reload the page, step, continue the breakpoint several times.


Actual results:

Eventually, the debugger begins stopping at the bottom of my javascript file instead of the breakpoint. This is frustrating because the debugger will now refuse to stop at any of my breakpoints until I open another browser tab and set all of my breakpoints again. The page load usually fails in my case because many of the timeouts have been exceeded causing my page to fail to properly initialize.

When the debugger stops it appears to be at the global scope. My guess is that it is in the process of parsing and evaluating the top-level statements of the module.

One interesting workaround is to use "debugger;" statements in the module you are working on. It seems to avoid this problem entirely.


Expected results:

Instead, the debugger should hit my breakpoint that I set. I should not have to use discouraged "debugger" statements.
