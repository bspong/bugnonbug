It takes 20 (twenty) minutes to export or import a large Firefox bookmarks file from Bookmarks.JSON or bookmarks.html files.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use a large Bookmarks file in Firefox
2. Organize Bookmarks (Ctrl+Shift+B)
3. Import and Backup
   Select Backup/Restore or
   Import HTML.../Export HTML...
Actual Results:  
It takes 20 minutes to Backup or Restore bookmarks! Also it takes approximately the same amount of time to Import/Export to HTML.
Moreover, a warning message pops up 'Script is busy. Do you want to continue?'

Expected Results:  
Less than ONE minute.

Google Chrome 2 Beta takes less than one minute to export or import the same Bookmarks.html. Thus it is 20 times faster than Firefox. Moreover, the user can INSTANTLY save or restore a single file, BOOKMARKS, and thus save/restore bookmarks in the native browser format.
Apparently, Firefox uses a JavaScipt script for Bookmarks Backup/Restore/Import/Export, which is painfully slow for these features.
It should use a custom sed script or an executable module written in C/C++. Then these tasks could be accomplished in seconds!
A simple way to preclude these problems would be to offer users an option to use internally bookmarks.html file format instead of PLACES.SQLITE, as was done in Firefox 2.x. Both Orca and K-Meleon Gecko-based browsers avoid these problems using Booknarks.html internallt.
