This probably should be under plugins but that's not listed in the Component list on this Bugzilla page.

We have a page that streams live and recorded lectures from our auditorium. There are three QuickTime movie objects on the page, two for video and one for audio. The movies are streamed using RTSP, encoded with mpeg-4. This worked perfectly with Firefox 2 (in fact that was our recommended browser for this page).

With Firefox 3 on Mac OS X Leopard (including the latest nightly build as of 7/1/08):

The large movie (labeled "Projection Screen") does not update, or at least not very often. It is basically frozen most of the time.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the page referenced above <http://www.biotech.wisc.edu/webcams/>.
2. If there is a live lecture it will play immediately.
3. If there is no live lecture choose a recorded lecture from the More Lectures menu at the bottom of the page.


Actual Results:  
Audio and Podium video update normally. Projection Screen video does not.


Expected Results:  
Movies should play normally as they did in Firefox 2.

The movie that doesn't update is the largest on the page and also the last one referenced on the page.
