Prints only blank pages, even though print preview is normal.  Not affected by scaling, margins, orientation.  Happens even with a TXT file instead of an HTML page.  Turning off all headers and footers restores print, but selecting ANY header or footer in any page position causes blanks to print.  Happens regardless of print driver.  Number of blank pages corresponds to correct number of pages.  Originally started around 1 Aug 2009 on Firefox 3.5.1.  Deinstalling then installing 3.5.2 did not correct.  

Reproducible: Always
