Steps to reproduce:

In Ubuntu, software updater updates once a week.  I ran a standard update, and noticed it contained a Firefox update. My homepage is Google, and it opened as black and white with no text (see image).   I restarted with add on disabled (safe mode), and still no text.  When I type in the Google search field, nothing shows up.

I tried some other websites, and still nothing.  The only one that works has no text, www.purple.com.

Another weird thing is that when you open a tab, like troubleshooting info, then switch back to the Google tab, the Google tab now shows the troubleshooting page.

Something is really wrong.  I hate having to try a reset because it screws everything up, if it even will fix this, and I don't think users should have to reset because of a new version.  


Actual results:

Broken, see above.


Expected results:

It should have opened like the normal Google search page, with a white background and text.  When I type in the Google search field, it should show the text I am typing.
