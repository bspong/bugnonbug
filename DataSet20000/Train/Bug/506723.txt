Firefox Installer for 3.5.1 forces you to reboot
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Firefox requires that you reboot Windows before you even get to use it.  Seeing that any libraries can be de-linked before re-installation, as the old version of Firefox is not running, there should be no reason to ask the user to reboot.  Even if there is a conflict with a library, either the user should be prompted to close the application or the installer should close the offending application for them (which should only be Firefox anyway).

No application on Linux asks me to reboot (unless it's a kernel modification), including Firefox.  This isn't Windows 98 where I'm asked to reboot every time I change an IP address.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox

Actual Results:  
I am forced to reboot, even if I say No to the reboot and try to start the application.  User is not happy.

Expected Results:  
The installer should install everything that is required without a reboot of the OS.  User clicks on Firefox and gets to run the application right away.  User is happy.
