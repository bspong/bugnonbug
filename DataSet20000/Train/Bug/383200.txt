Calling methods in Java applet results in error part of the time

I am hosting an Applet in a page which uses reflection to call Javascript on my page, and I call methods in the Applet using the document.appletid.method() strategy.

The first time the applet is run, everything is fine. However, on subsequent reloads of the page, the call which worked before results in the following js error:

uncaught exception: internal error: Can't get Java class name usingjava.lang.Class.getName()

I have to leave Firefox and restart it for the applet to work again.

The only results I could find Googling for this error was the following page:
http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Talk:Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide:LiveConnect_Overview:JavaScript_to_Java_Communication

I am marking this as Major because I believe that this is a serious bug for pages which use Javascript<->Java Applet interaction.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
I am working to produce a public page where this can be demonstrated. At the present time the site the applet is hosted on is a very confidential project. I will update the bug when I finish the page.
Actual Results:  
Internal error message:

uncaught exception: internal error: Can't get Java class name usingjava.lang.Class.getName()

Expected Results:  
The applet should continue to be usable on reloading.
