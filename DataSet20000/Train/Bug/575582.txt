3.6.4 update played havoc with Gmail/GoogleGears

FF 3.6.3 worked perfectly with GoogleGears and Gmail.

When I applied the 3.6.4 update, and immediately FF would not boot up. i.e. when I click the FF icon in the OSX dock, the icon gives one bounce, and does nothing else.

I tried re-installing FF with 3.6.4 and problem remained.

I tried uninstalling 3.6.4 and reinstalling 3.6.3 - problem remained.

The only way around it was to use Apple's TimeMachine to restore all the folders that relate to Firefox and GoogleGears, e.g. in the Library folder, preference files, Cache files etc.

However, in 3.6.3, the problem was replicated when I updated NoScript AddOn. Upon upgrading the NoScript AddOn, the above problem revived, i.e. when clicked on the FF icon, it gives one bounce and then does nothing else. FF cannot boot up.

So I had to restore all the FF and GoogleGears folders and preference files, as described above.

I became so worried that I thought of removing all AddOns to avoid further problems since, for my work, I rely on GoogleGears offline Gmail.

But I discovered that removing the WeatherBug AddOn caused the same problem, i.e. the FF when clicked gives one bounce, and does nothing else.

So now I am stuck on 3.6.3 and not wanting to touch my system for fear that anything random is going to kill FF.

Reproducible: Always
