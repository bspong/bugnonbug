Steps to reproduce:

Hi :)

I have detected an issue on Firefox Nightly and on the DeveloperEdition, I suppose it's about element.scrollTop. BUT on Firefox classique (46.0.1) the bug is not here.

I propose you to see it yourself:
Go on gridsound.com, here you will see a huge blue grid, the column who contains "track 1" etc. And the big blue column are inside the same element, this element has overflow:hidden; overflow-x:auto; so when we scroll it use the real native scroll of the browser.
But I choose to hide the scrollbar in CSS way (if you want to see the native scrollbar, you can write in the console: `ui.jqGridCols.css("right",0);`)

The X axe is calculated by hand, I modify manually a margin-left for doing it. And there is no problem with the X axe.

Currently all this part works great on Chrome, Firefox classique, Safari (on mac).

Please, try with Nightly to move inside the grid by doing space+mousemove, try also the zoom by doing ctrl+mousewheel, these to action modify the scrollTop of the main container of the grid.


Thank you in advance.
