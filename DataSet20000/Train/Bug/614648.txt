Mozilla staying logged into websites randomly for the first time ever.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.12) Gecko/20101026 Firefox/3.6.12 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.12) Gecko/20101026 Firefox/3.6.12 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Up until about 10 minutes ago when I got on Mozilla Firefox to get on Facebook and stuff, it would always automatically log me out of whatever websites I was on when I closed firefox.  No settings have been changed, I made sure that all of the settings about clearing history and cookies and everything were still set not to save passwords.  But it is keeping me logged into a lot of websites.  Initially I thought it was just specific websites new settings, but it is happening on gmail, facebook, glyde, points2shop, and every other site there is.  

This can just be a potentially big problem, if someone like me who is used to schools automatically logging out or something no longer doing so.  This is only happening on my computer that I know of, just saying it could be something big.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into website
2. Close firefox
3. Go back to website
Actual Results:  
I was still logged in.

Expected Results:  
I would not be logged in.

I have not changed any settings in literally months.
