opening new pages by command line behaves strange (hanging/memory leaking?)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; rv:30.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/30.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140605174243

Steps to reproduce:

I have a script that opens pages that I need to check on a regular basis.

the vbscript/commandline command is simply

shell.run quote & "c:\program files\mozilla firefox\firefox" & quote & " -new-tab " & link,1,0 


Actual results:

instead of opening the tabs immediatly firefox seems to freeze.

in the taskmanager on windows I can see that for every url a new firefox.exe is opened and hanging.

I also see the memory usage going up fast even before a new tab appears and the CPU peaks too.

When I'm lucky and it doesn't reach 100% memory usage the tabs appear after a while and the firefox.exe's go away.

When it hits 100% the computer hangs and after a while gets back to normal and only a few tabs get loaded.

it seems that some scripts of currently loaded tabs also get in a loop and I need to stop them when the computer becomes responsive again.


Expected results:

It should load the tabs quickly like it did in v10 or something.

I can't verify since when this is happening but it's already a while and it's happening on 2 machines so it's not a single machine issue.

I even added pauses between the tab opening but that doesn't seem to help either.

I currently changed the execution line from

,1,0 to ,1,1

then it waits till the new firefox.exe process has ended before launching another one.
