Firefox doesn't paint correctly if extended desktop mode is used

I have an HDTV as a secondary display (1920x1080 resolution) and I use the extended desktop mode.

Firefox is on the primary display and the secondary desktop is empty. When lots of tabs are open, contents are not always painted correctly. The amount of painting errors seems to vary. Sometimes 30 tabs can be open with no problems, sometimes 60. I'm not sure if the tab amount is relevant. There is more than enough free memory and temp disk space.

As soon as I disable the secondary display, Firefox starts painting correctly again.

This problem can be reproduced with both ATI and NVidia cards with latest drivers, so it shouldn't be a display driver issue. Also no other application than Firefox is affected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable dual display & extended desktop mode from display drivers.
2. Start Firefox with lots of tabs with web content.
3. Change tabs, refresh tabs, do some surfing.
Actual Results:  
Main window content becomes corrupted. Tab contents or basic window components are not painted or refreshed fully. Scrolling, moving the main window or moving mouse cursor over corrupted areas may change how things are painted.

Expected Results:  
Firefox paints correctly.
