remove "www" from History entries like you already do with "http"

"www" puts History folders in the wrong order

For example, If I have some sites that have "www" and some without it, they
aren't placed in ABC order because the www makes History assume that they should
be a "w" not an "a"

This would make it consistent on how History ignores "htpp://" and let me see
sites in abc order without the "www" corrupting it

IE does
google (www.google.com) so that google is placed in the middle because of the G
and Firebird does
www.google.com which places it near the bottom because of the WWW

It would also be consistent with History>View>By Site which then places google
in the middle, not the bottom
