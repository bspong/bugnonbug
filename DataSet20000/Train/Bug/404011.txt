After I start the Browser and the Homepage is opened I close this tab.
The only left tab then is the default about:blank tab. But the weird thing is, that this tab has not the focus.
Same happens if I open another tab in background, before closing the homepage, and then close the homepage tab. Then the new tab is displayed (the content) but has not got the focus (visible in the tab bar).
Also in both cases the address bar does not reflect the now correct address, it still shows the address of the closed tab.

This behaviour only happens in FF3/Minefield.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Browser
2.Close Homepage

-OR-
1.Open Browser
2.Open Page in Background Tab
3.Close Homepage
Actual Results:  
The tab, that should be active has not the focus in the tab bar.
Also the address in the address bar is not correct, but the old address of the closed tab.
The content display is correct (page, which was loaded is shown in the content area)

Expected Results:  
Tab bar should activate the a) empty tab or b) the background tab, that now came to be the foreground tab.
And the address bar should display the correct address of the now active tab.
