Arial and Helvetica fonts are always displayed in bold, never in the normal font-weight
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; pt-BR; rv:1.9.2.12) Gecko/20101026 Firefox/3.6.12 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

It's amasing how such a basic bug still happens with Firefox : it simply does not display properly one of the most used fonts, Arial, always displaying it in bold, even if the css property 'font-weight:normal;' is assigned to the page. Firefox simply ignores it. The same happens with the Helvetica font. But, surplisingly, if the text is in italics, the bug does not happen, in this case the font-weight is displayed correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a webpage.
2. Assign the css property : body {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;}
3. Type something at the body. 
4. Open the page with Firefox and with any other browser. See that the text is in bold only in Firefox. 
5. Try to force Firefox to display the font without the bold, changing the css property to : body {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weigth:normal;}
6. Open the page again with Firefox and see that it still displays the text in bold. 
7. Invert the order of Arial and Helvetica in the font-family property. 
8. Open the page with Firefox and with any other browser. See that, also with the Helvetica font, the text is in bold only in Firefox.
