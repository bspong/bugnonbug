Using a keycombo to hide[1] a ff window can cause the focus to be lost or not
properly released; that is to use another wm-keycombo to switch to another
window --if the cursor ends up on the background no window is selected--
might require moving the mouse into a window, to regain focus, first.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Hit <wm-key> <hide-window> (default meta-enter, see wmx config)
2. Hit <wm-key> <next-window> (default meta-tab, see "" )

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.
Move mouse to window, try again, succeed.

Expected Results:  
Mouse pointer should move to window decoration and focus to the window.

Since this occurs using Firefox 2.0.0.4, Xorg 7.2, FreeBSD 6.2, and wmx-6p1
and it did not occur using firefox 1.0.*, Xorg 6.9, FreeBSD 5.4, and wmx-6p1,
and I have not experienced it with other X applications I use, I'm reporting
it here first.

I have so far not discovered precisely what the trigger is.
