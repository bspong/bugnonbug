Debugger fails to open additional scripts in Service Worker toolbox.
Steps to reproduce:

1. Go to https://simple-push-demo.appspot.com/ and Enable Push Notifications (for some reason, Firefox wants you to "Always Allow" or "Always Reject", I don't see a "Allow Just Now").
2. Open another tab for about:debugging#workers. The SW "https://simple-push-demo.appspot.com/service-worker.js" should be listed.
3. Click on "Debug" next to it.

Expected: A toolbox opens with a working Debugger.

Actually: A toolbox opens with an empty Debugger showing "Error loading this URL: /scripts/indexdbwrapper.js"

Eddy, any thoughts on this issue?
