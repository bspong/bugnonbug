JavaScript stops working completely.

I have had recurring problems with JavaScript being completely inoperable. I have JavaScript enabled, and have never installed the NoScript extension. It has been happening on and off across all sites for the past couple weeks in FF RC1 and RC2. A restart (of browser or computer) does not specifically fix the problem. However, it does go away after an unknown time (days usually).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
This works nearly all of the time.
1. Watch long Flash movies (>30mins)
2. Navigate to another page.

However, that isn't the only time it's occurred for me. Beyond the above example, I have not been able to detect any discernible pattern.
Actual Results:  
JavaScript does not work: Flash videos don't load; redirects, javascript functions don't work, websites tag the browser as not having javascript enabled.

Expected Results:  
JavaScript working.

I do have the Web Developer toolbar installed. From the latest nonfunctional site (www.dhl.com), I do have the following warnings in the error console:

That site is not the problem, as it works in FF 2 on Linux and was working in the same Windows FF 3 RC2 browser within the past week.
