GTK-FF2.0 crashes when using Qt pseudo-theme

GTK-FF2.0 crashes every time I try to call any dialog except "Preferences". I tried "Tab Mix Plus" and "Adblock Plus" preferences, "Customize toolbar", "Addons" window. Also it crashes when I try to use "Restart Firefox" option (instead of restarting), and asks to restore the session next time it starts. All this happens _only_ if GTK/Qt is enabled. Btw, when I toggle the theme in GNOME Control Center's applet, FF hangs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. K Menu->Settings->GNOME Control Center->Themes
2. Click "Details" button
3. Choose Qt look'n'feel and confirm selection.
After this FF almost always hangs. If it did, restart it :)
4. Here Bookmarks toolbar appeared, although I've turned it off a month before. So, hide it using pop-up menu item.
5. Try Edit->Preferences. It works.
6. Now try "Customize" from toolbar pop-up menu.
7. FF should chars here.
8. After restart, the Bookmarks toolbar is restored and shown (!)
Actual Results:  
1. FF hung while changing GTK theme
2. FF crashed while trying to open "Customize toolbar" dialog.
3. Bookmarks toolbar is restored every time you start FF.
4. And nothing was noticed by Talkback agent (?!)

Expected Results:  
1. FF should not hang while changing GTK theme
2. FF should crash also if I try to open Edit->Preferences too or not to crash at all :)
3. Bookmarks toolbar state should be saved while I'm using GTK/Qt theme.
