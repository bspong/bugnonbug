Arrow Key scrolling is very slow; mouse wheel is slightly delayed.

I've noticed that scrolling up/down on certain long pages is very slow & non-responsive.  Basically, any Reddit comment page exhibits this behavior as long as it has sufficient length (>50 comments).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a longish Reddit comment page (<50 comments)
2. Try to scroll halfway down the page by holding the down arrow key
3. Release the down arrow key and notice how the browser continues to scroll for several seconds while trying to "catch-up" to you.
Actual Results:  
The page continues to scroll by for several seconds resulting in you missing your target.  I usually end up going back and forth (up arrow / down arrow) at least twice before zeroing in on the part of the page I wanted to view.

Expected Results:  
Maybe the buffering of the arrow keys is too aggressive.  I would expect the scrolling to stop when I stop pressing an arrow key.  The mouse wheel is more responsive, but still lags by .5 seconds or so.
