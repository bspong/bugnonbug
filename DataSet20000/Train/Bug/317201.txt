Plugins do not render at all.

I find that any page that is meant to launch a plugin, including Quicktime, Windows Media Player and Shockwave, fails to display any visuals in the area reserved for the graphic. If the associate media has a soundtrack this can be heard.

When I used Firefox 1.0.x I experienced a similar bug but the plugin would render if it's area was made to overlap an edge of the visible page area.

All plugins appear as they should in Safari.

My system is a G4 667Mhz PowerBook (gigabit ethernet, no DVI), 768mb RAM and a 16mb ATI Mobility Radeon graphics card - the bare minimum for Quartz Extreme. OS is OS X v10.4.3, all latest software updates applied.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open http://www.michaelbach.de/ot/lum_adelson_check_shadow/index.html
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
I am presented with a page featuring a gradient backdrop, the heading "Adelson’s  “Checker-shadow illusion” / From Michael’s “Optical Illusions & Visual Phenomena”", a table with a completely blank top box that fills about 2/3 of the display area and then a lower box with text that starts "What to do / You will, in all likelihood, perceive the above picture as a 3-dimensional scene..."

Expected Results:  
A Shockwave Flash interactive animation should appear in the top box demonstrating a simple checkerboard optical illusion.

As stated, other plugins fail to render also. For example, http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3667906664707520844 displays a righthand series of pictures showing scenes from a video concerning remote control cars but the main area on the left that should contain a video window is completely blank. After a short wait, the sound of the video can be heard.

The video displays perfectly in Safari. I have not deliberately adjusted any settings in the OS or Firefox concerning plugins.
