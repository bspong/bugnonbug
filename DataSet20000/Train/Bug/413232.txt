There appears to be a problem I've encountered with the Firefox browser - possibly the error already reported in ID 408616. I was looking at a page on ebay (please check item number 190189469154), which shows a complete description of the item below the final picture, BUT ONLY ON INTERNET EXPLORER. I always use, and prefer, Firefox, but friends kept telling me of this "extra" info which I was unable to see, so I decided to investigate. Please let me know your findings. Thank you.
