Virtools plugin area does not gain focus when clicked

In Firefox 1.5 the Virtools display area could gain focus (similar to a Flash or Shockwave game).  In 2.0 it doesn't seem to happen.

The problem that arises from this is games that use the arrow keys.  The keypress events are captured by the game and everything works correctly.  However, they are also captured by the browser.  If the browser isn't maximized the arrow keys control the vertical and horizontal scroll bar making the game virtually unplayable.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch the URL in Firefox 2.0
2. Install the Virtools plugin (restart Firefox if necessary, then navigate back to URL)
3. Launch the GT Racing game and make sure the browser is not maximized (vertical or horizontal scroll bars should be visible)
4. Start a race and press up, down, left, or right.

Actual Results:  
The scroll bars also capture the keypress events and make the game hard (almost impossible in some cases) to follow.

Expected Results:  
The game window should have focus as do Flash / Shockwave games, preventing the keypess events from being captured by the browser.

This has been reproducible on every Firefox 2.0 installation I have tested on.
