A bit confusing: windows opened with window.open() open new tabs in another (parent) window (FF3RC2)

This code opens a new window:

<a id="lnkIcon1Header" href="javascript:window.open('http://www.trilogica.it/','990x670','toolbar=yes,location=yes,status=yes,menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=990,height=670');void(0);"><br/>TriLogica</a>



The new window looks exactly like a new firefox browser.
No indications that it is a popup or anything less than a normal FF browser window.
More confusing is that any link in the popup window, that has target="_blank" does not open in that window, but in another (parent or any other if parent was closed). If the popup window is maximized, it seems that the links do not work at all, event that they are opened, but in another window.
And the window that has opened the tab does not give any feedback about it (flashing or other things)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.ikea.it (example)
2. Click on the icon ESHOP Lombardia
3. A new window opens
4. Maximize the new window
5. Go to http://www.google.it or www.live.com
6. Make sure that the preferences of the search engine are to open links in a new window (Open search results in a new browser window)
7. Search something
8. Click on the result links.. it seems that nothing happens
9. Switch to the parent window.. the links are there

Actual Results:  
I'd expect some visual hint that something has happened.
The best for me would be to open the tabs on the current (popup) window, but at least the window that opens the tabs should flash or do something to indicate that the system is working.

Expected Results:  
Anything that tells me that the tabs are getting opened.
