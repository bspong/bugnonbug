Firefox first run page calls Mozilla.UiTour.getConfiguration() every ~2000ms
I started Nightly on a fresh profile on Windows to look at what system calls were being made. To my surprise, there were registry accesses to HKCU\Software\Classes\FirefoxURL\shell\open\command and similar every ~2000ms.

Some stack walking later reveals it is the first run web page sending an event to the UITour repeatedly. Probably a setTimer() that doesn't get unset or something.

I don't think this is a major performance issue. But I didn't look at the JS code too deeply to see what all it is doing. It certainly feels like the check it's doing only needs to occur once.
