The new (now default) java file uploader at Photobucket causes my Firefox to freeze. The progress bar reaches 100% after you have selected the files to upload and the image size you want them to be stored as, and usually the page autrefreshes to display the uploaded files. However, the browser (all open tabs) stops responding. 

I tried it three times. 

Selecting the Old upload option fromthe page works fine, though, and the Firefox is still able to restore the previous session when you restart it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Got to photobucket and log in
2. Use the default uploader
3. I set my file size to medium 240x320 px and hit upload. The progress bar reaches 100% but everything stops after that.
Actual Results:  
Firefox freezes. You cannot switch between tabs, open new tabs or close existing tabs. Only the red X to kill Firefox works.

Expected Results:  
File should have uploaded and the app refreshes to display the newly uploaded files alongside your existing images

I'm not sure how serious it is - perhaps it is an issue regarding a Java update more than Firefox. Currently I'm using Java standard edition 6, build 1.6.0
