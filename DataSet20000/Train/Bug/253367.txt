In Prefs UI, left pane (with General, Privacy etc. buttons) steals focus from
anything else if mouse hovers over it. There is completely no reason for this.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Tools -> options
2. Use keyboard or mouse to change focus to any widget in preferences window, or
even any widget in other firefox window
3. Move mouse over left preferences pane

It's even more visible in Pinball theme, where new Options window has focus on a
button, and this focus unexpectely dissapears when you move a mouse (which means
you don't have to do step 2 above to see weird behaviour).

Actual Results:  
focus changed

Expected Results:  
mouseover should not steal focus - at least it doesn't do that anywhere else, FF
or windows or in other window managers

The fix is easy: in browser.jar/content/browser/pref/pref.xul, line 88, the
right pane is defined with 

  onmouseover="focus();"

Simply removing this restores the "expected" behaviour without any ill effects I
could detect. 
Except one:

The default theme "takes advantage of this" by ignoring the difference between
focused buttons and mouseover-ed buttons, since any mouseover removes focus from
them. This looks a bit weird, and can be fixed by the following change in
classic.jar/skin/classic/browser/pref/pref.css:

- .buttonBoxButton:hover, .buttonBoxButton:focus {
-   border: 1px solid;
-   -moz-border-left-colors: #98B4E2;
-   -moz-border-top-colors: #98B4E2;
-   -moz-border-right-colors: #98B4E2;
-   -moz-border-bottom-colors: #98B4E2;
-   background-color: #E0E8F6;
- }

+ .buttonBoxButton:hover {
+   border: 1px solid;
+   -moz-border-left-colors: #98B4E2;
+   -moz-border-top-colors: #98B4E2;
+   -moz-border-right-colors: #98B4E2;
+   -moz-border-bottom-colors: #98B4E2;
+   background-color: #E0E8F6;
+ }

+ .buttonBoxButton:focus {
+   border: 1px solid;
+   -moz-border-left-colors: #98B4E2;
+   -moz-border-top-colors: #98B4E2;
+   -moz-border-right-colors: #98B4E2;
+   -moz-border-bottom-colors: #98B4E2;
+ }

which doesn't change behaviour for "mouseover" buttons, but makes focused
buttons have a border only, without background change (which is perfectly
consistent with all other "focused" indications. And looks very good too, IMHO
of course).

I do not have the CVS source so I can't make a diff. However, if you agree with
the change and need a diff, I probably am able to create one. Please advise.
