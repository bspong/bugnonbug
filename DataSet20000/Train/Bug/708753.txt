Firefox Button menu items has broken keyboard support, and is missing accelerators (underlined letters)
On the normal menus, things work beautifully.  Arrow keys work fine to navigate within the menus, and move from menu to menu.  There are proper keyboard accelerators (underlined letters), which can activate the menu items by pressing that key on the keyboard.

But on the Firefox Button's menu, things are completely broken:
* After opening the menu by clicking the Firefox button, there is no response from any keyboard keys, except Alt, Escape, Tab, or Windows Key to close the menu.
* After hovering over a menu items, it displays the usual dark blue to indicate the item is selected.  Once a menu item is selected, you can use the arrow keys to move to some of the other menu items, and press Enter to activate that items.  You can not move to any split items, nor move between the left and right half of the menu.
* After hovering over a split menu item (such as the New Tab menu), you can press Right to open the submenu, and navigate within the submenu, but you can not navigate to any other menu items with the keyboard.
* No keyboard letters activate any commands, not even pressing the first letter of the command name.
* There are no keyboard accelerators (underlined letters) on any of the menu items.  Not even on any items in the submenus.

On submenus of the Firefox Button Menu, keyboard letter keys work to activate the menu item that begins with that letter, but there are still no displayed accelerators (underlined letters).

Yes, I have confirmed the same behavior on a clean profile.

Also, when using the "Personal Menu" add-on, custom menus added to the Firefox Button menu have proper accelerators.  Why can't the real menu have them too?
