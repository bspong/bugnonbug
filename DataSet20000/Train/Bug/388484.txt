Upgrade from 1.x to 2.0.04 or Minefield causes Firefox to constantly intermittently freeze for seconds at a time.  May get worse with more tabs open, but always occurs even without tabs.

Upgrade from Firefox 1.x to 2.0.0.4 (or Minefield), and all websites, all pages, all fields freeze intermittently every few seconds.  It does seem to get worse if you add a tab or more.  Text entry is also affected and is severely annoying!  Long posts get chopped off after several paragraphs as Firefox cycles through freeze.  Does not cause crash, but makes browsing/typing infuriating!  Please return to latest 1.x version until bug is fixed!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Upgrade to firefox 2.0.04 from 1.x or install minefield latest build
2. Start browsing!  You will soon hang like crazy!  Open one tab or more to become increasingly incapacitated!
3. Watch your text stop for seconds, load from buffer, continue, watch pages load, stop, load more, videos play, stop, play more, music stop, play more, get the picture?
Actual Results:  
Upgrade or install Firefox 2.0.0.4 or later

Expected Results:  
Run without pausing!
