I have had no issues running older Firefox versions.  This morning I had a popup requesting a new version of Firefox had been released. I downloaded it and installed appropriately. Since then, the new Firefox browser has crashed at least 6-8 times on various webpages (Firefox.exe has caused a general error etc - 'Cancel' only option). I have rebooted and the same issue still occurs.

I have found on the above website the problem occurs. It also occurred on other websites however I forgot what those are.

I have been a loyal Firefox supporter for some time. I am disappointed this bug exists. I have lost work twice this morning, really pissing me off and I will be uninstalling if this continues.
