Starting private browsing: keep-alive http connections are not terminated
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_7; en-us) AppleWebKit/533.20.25 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0.4 Safari/533.20.27

If a web-server is using HTTP connection's keep-alive setting, expected behavior for Firefox is to honor it. However, the question is when Firefox switches to "Private Browsing" mode, what would Firefox do to these kept-open HTTP connections that already knows who you are? Unfortunately, Firefox keeps them alive. So if you go to these web-sites again after starting the "Private Browsing" mode, they might actually detect you.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
When using the sample web-server code in the URL provided, the web-server will remember you when you switch to "Private Browsing" mode in Firefox while visiting them. Namely a user:

1. Visits the site that is running the code in one of your firefox tabs (let's call this site: Site-A)
2. Switches to "Private Browsing" mode
3. Enters the URL of the Site-A again and then notices that the Site-A still knows who the user is


Actual Results:  
At the URL provided, there is a sample web-server code that uses the network socket information to remember who you are in the scenario above. After above step "1" the below code randomly assigns a name to you. Then at above step "3" it remembers your name and tells you who you are.

Expected Results:  
The web-server should not be able to find out who the user is after switching to "Private Browsing" mode.
