While trying to surf the interner I experience a Slow & crashing Browswer

After the last update to the Firefox Browser, I have experienced problems with the browser being very slow to switch from one page to another, and when trying to open and/or switch to tabs or new browsers, and sometimes the browser completely crashes.  Certain functions, such as 'Define xxxxx', simply are not working, at all.

I've spoken with several others who also use Firefox, some of whom I'd told about Firefox and convinced them to switch, and even with the friend who first introduced me to the Firefox browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Browser
2. Press link in the page, or  CTRL T or CTRL N to open new link or tab.
3. Page is extremely slow in changing, and sometimes crashes during the extended period of time it acts as if it's trying to switch to pages, tabs or other occurrences of browser.
Actual Results:  
Browser either freezes while attempting to switch or crashes, altogether.

Expected Results:  
Move to the new page, tab or browser occurrence

Occasionally, if I get lucky, I can press the Tab key and force the page change or view to the new tab or browser.

As stated, previously, several friends who use Firefox have also reported problems; one has the same problem I do, another stated his browser simply crashed every time he tried to refresh, switch to tab or switch to new browser occurrence.
