Connection through Proxy fails as Prompt dialog only allows entry of "login name" and "password". "Domain Name" is also required.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; SRA-60-05032003; RC-60-040226)
Build Identifier: 

Proxy server requires identification including "login name", "password" and "Domain Name". Firefox Prompt only includes "login name" and "password" so identification fails. M$ IE includes all three parameters in its dialog which succeeds. 
(This MAY be related to bug 182719 which implies firefox has an automatic domain detection which fails)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter any internet URL 
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Enter login name and password in prompt displayed by Firefox
If not logged on to internet, this produces an error message saying URL can't be reached.
If already logged in (say through Internet Explorer), the Firefox login prompt is displayed repeatedly as the page gradually displays (presumabely as page accesses different URL's to build up the page) 

Expected Results:  
To access URL requested.

This started when the IT department (who support only IE) changed proxy servers. Firefox correctly, automatically detected the change. 

I consider this to be bloody serious because my only options are now 
1. (unlikely) to use Internet Explorer or 
2. (more likely) not access internet until bug is fixed.
