Attempt to avoid accidental dataloss by removing "saved passwords" from clear recent history dialog (not history and doesn't respect timeframe)
Similar premise to bug 472211 but a different potential problem.

The "Clear Private Data" system has been changed to a "Clear Recent History" system. The dialog is more flexible and allows users to selectively clear only portions of their data and thus might be used more often by people who don't want to wipe everything. There's one problem here: the price of an accident can be high. Most people don't back up their data and if one was to wipe everything when they didn't want to it would be quite bad. One way I think would be useful to attempt to avoid mishaps (aside from adding more confirmation for "everything" in bug 472211) would be to remove the saved passwords wiping checkbox from this dialog.

To start, saved usernames and passwords are *not* "recent history". The placement here is a bit odd with this new terminology. I and many users can wipe their entire history, cache, cookies, form autocomplete, etc. and not have it be a horrible inconvenience. Wipe my saved passwords and I'll be annoyed. I can visit pages again and remake cookies and autocompletes, but I can't guarantee I'll remember all my logins that easily. I could easily foresee a user clearing everything intentionally then a long while later coming back here for a quick history cleanup and not noticing that the saved passwords box is checked. It's my opinion that this is more dangerous than it needs to be.

This data is more important, not necessarily relevant to the currently labeled dialog function, and there is already a button to wipe them all in the password manager. I think it should be safe to remove it from here and could potentially save some users a good bit of unnecessary grief.
