Location bar allows users to begin entering a location only until page loads, then automatically move the insertion point into the browser window.

When hitting a page that has a JavaScript Applet, or any other reason the page
would load more slowly, the location bar will allow users to begin entering a
URL, but then once the page is loaded, the cursor moves down into the browser
window and as the user continues to type, words on the page that start with the
letters being typed (into the location field) are selected in the web page that
just loaded as the user types. This is very frustrating, enough to stop using
the browser. This is especially annoying because we are required to have our
homepage set to our companies homepage and it has a JavaScript that loads slowly.

I immediately start typing the URL of the page I want to go to and as the page
finishes loading, I am not able to finish typing the URl because the insertion
point moves automatically to the browser window.

Thanks,

Thomas

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to or set www.chiroweb.com as the default homepage (then open a new window)
2.as soon as you get there begin typing a new url in the locatio field
3.Get really annoyed when you can finish typing the URL without manually moving
the insertion point back into the location field.

Actual Results:  
See #3 above:

3.Get really annoyed when you can finish typing the URL without manually moving
the insertion point back into the location field.

Expected Results:  
Let users finish typing in the Location field even after the page is done
loading. I don't understand why it has to remove the insertion point from this
field once the page loads. It doesn't serve any purpose.
