Some animations are really slow, in firefox-granparadiso, but also in firefox 2.0.6.
These are non-flash animations, because this bug is reproducible when the firefox plugin is not installed.
This bug is valid if using the radeon opensource driver, both on r300 and r200 graphic chips

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. visit http://notebookitalia.it/ritardi-nelle-consegne-dei-thinkpad-t61-con-tecnologia-ultrawideband.html
2. click on the laptop image
3. watch the animation that makes the screen black and makes the laptop image appear
Actual Results:  
The animation is jerky (the exact opposite of fluid)

Expected Results:  
The animations should be fluid

I'm running ubuntu linux 7.10, always updated
I have a radeon mobility 9700 64MB and a radeon 9100
I'm using the opensource driver
If I add "XAANoOffscreenPixmaps" to xorg.conf this problem vanishes
Using fglrx there is no problem
the gnome application "evince" had a similar problem (pdf files were very slow to render, and the XAANoOffscreenPixmaps option solved this problem) which was fixed in a recent commit, with this comment:
 - Great speedup by using CAIRO_FORMAT_RGB24 instead of CAIRO_FORMAT_ARGB32
