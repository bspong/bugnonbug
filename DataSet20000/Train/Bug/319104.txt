QuickTime 7 video fails to play even though the plugin is loaded
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

If you go to the linked URL and click on any of the MP4 streams, the QuickTime plugin loads but the video does not play.  This works on IE 6, but it refuses to work with Firefox 1.5 - even with a clean profile.  I can confirm that my QuickTime plugin is in fact working, if I go to another site with embedded QuickTime movie.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Note: I installed Firefox 1.5 (official) using the installer distribution (i.e. if you're using the ZIP distribution, YMMV)

1. Make sure you have QuickTime 7 installed.
2. Visit the linked URL and click on any of the movie links
3. Notice that the plugin loads and the media link appears below the embeded QuickTime plugin but does not play.
4. Now try with IE and notice that the movie plays.

Actual Results:  
The plugin loads, and the plugin loads and the media link appears below the embeded QuickTime plugin but does not play.


Expected Results:  
The movie should have played.
