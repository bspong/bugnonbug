2.0.0.13 freezes if I switch to another application's window
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.13) Gecko/20080311 Firefox/2.0.0.13

Ever since the upgrade to fix the security problems, Firefox crashes many times a day. It seems to open any site correctly, but if I open or switch to another application (e.g., Word, Excel, Acrobat Professional, LotusNotes) and then try to go back to any open Firefox window, it is frozen (as are all other Firefox windows) and I have to force-quit out of Firefox. This happens no matter what site I am visiting so I don't think it has anything to do with specific sites. I would honestly rather have some security risks than software which stops working all the time. I have cleared my cache and the problem persists. I am able to go between different Firefox windows/tabs without a problem as long as I don't use any other applications.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a site firefox 
2. open Microsoft word
3. click on the firefox window or access it via the bar at the bottom of the screen
4. wait fruitlessly for something to happen
5. go to the bathroom, click again, still nothing
6. give up, press control-ALT-DEL to force-quit
7. Switch to Internet Explorer for the rest of the day (ugh!!!)
Actual Results:  
The windows/tabs open in Firefox are frozen or do not reload when I maximize them. There are no error messages generated.

Expected Results:  
That I would be able to resume using the browser.

I am using the default theme.  These are the add-ons I have loaded:
Locator, McAfee site Advisor, PDF Download, Print/Print Preview, Pronto, StumbleUpon toolbar, Talkback, Toolbar Buttons, ToolbarMS, Web Developer, WebMail Notifief, Woot Watcher, Zotero.
