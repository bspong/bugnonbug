Firefox window stays on top of all others, even popup menus.

I'm experiencing a problem in which the main Firefox window will float on top of all others.  This has two effects:
1) Switching to another application (e.g., Finder) does not bring that applications windows on top of the main browser window.
2) Popup menus, particular the one on the URL bar at the top of the browser window  paint their contents below the main browser window rendering them practially unusable.

The problem started occurring recently (since recent upgrades to Firefox 2.0.0.12, Leopard 10.5.2, and Graphics Update).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Browse for a while (problem occurs approximately 1/hour of browsing)
2.  Select triangle in URL bar to select frequently typed location, no window appears.
3.  Select window from different application, Firefox window remains on top of window in active application.
Actual Results:  
No popup menu appears (although sometimes can be seen briefly if window is minimized).
Browser window floats on top of active window, although will properly move to Dock when minimized.  Problem persists when window is maximized again.

Expected Results:  
Popup menu window or window of active application should move on top of main browser window.
