AUDIODEV environment variables causes crash on keyboard input
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040221 Firefox/0.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040221 Firefox/0.8

Setting the AUDIODEV environment variable causes Firefox to crash (or, perhaps
more accurately, close) on keyboard input.  It is not clear that Firefox issues
a nonzero exit code when it closes in this manner.  Keyboard input directed to
the menus (i.e. alt-F for the file menu) does NOT cause Firefox to close.  There
is significant evidence, although I cannot confirm it, that this problem also
exists in Mozilla and derivatives (i.e. Nautilus, in which it sounds like it
actually causes a segfault).  Mouse input causes no problems, and all menu
commands work as expected.

Setting the AUDIODEV environment variable is useful for getting applications to
use the ALSA dmix pluging for software audio mixing.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Set the AUDIODEV environment variable.  Specifically, mine was set to "DEFAULT".
2.  Run Firefox (i.e. $ AUDIODEV="default" firefox)
3.  Direct keyboard input at Firefox (location bar, any dialog, or the browser
area).
Actual Results:  
Firefox closes, but not obviously with a nonzero exit code.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have accepted input either to the location bar or a dialog box or
begun a type-ahead find.
