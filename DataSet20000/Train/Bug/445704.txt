JSON bookmarks backup has localized filename (and can't be easily restored)

Hi,

Using the Dutch localisation, when I look in the bookmarkbackups folder of my profile I see the following files:

bladwijzers-2008-07-16.json
bookmarks-2008-03-13.html

The .html version is a left-over from before the JSON bookmark backups were put into effect. However, this made me notice that the file name changed along with the file format.

It seems that for the JSON version of the bookmarks backup, the localized name is used? (But not a localised date!) That looks like a bug to me. The filename should not contain any locale-specific parts. There is no precedent for that in the rest of the Firefox profile’s filenames, and no good reason to either.

The file name of the JSON file should be the same as the HTML one was. Having a localised part in the filename can lead to unexpected bugs (e.g. does the part that restores a bookmarks backup also use the localised name?).
