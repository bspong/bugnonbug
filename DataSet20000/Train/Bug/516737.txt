Command line arguments don't take effect right away and are flaky.

I think there must be a bug in command line arguments taking effect.  Because I've been trying to test directly like bug 471997 comment 49 I got the same results over and over again, didn't wfm, about:privatebrowsing asks if I want to start private browsing, everything looks the same as normal mode, with latest nightly trunk.  

I just started testing -private.  no PB mode, didn't wfm.
So then I decided to see if -P worked, no profilemanager, didn't wfm.  hmm.
Then I went back to -private it worked and always works now.  double hmm.
Then I tried -profilemanager, the profilemanager popped up.  ok, works.
Then I tried -profilemanager -private, ok, works.
Then I tried -p, got the profilemanager
Then I tried -P, got the profilemanager

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
STR seems based on whether the profilemanager has been used.
Actual Results:  
Seems if you never used the feature it doesn't become active until the profilemanager gets used.

Expected Results:  
upon downloading a new build, command line argument should be recognized and take effect immediately with current profile..

I was tried to verify bug 471997 and ran into this.
