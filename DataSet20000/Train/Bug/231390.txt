When setting options for cookies such as adding a or removing an expection (in
the tools->options dialog box under privacy) the setting does not take effect
until firebird is closed and opened again.  This is not a good thing because if
i as a user accidentally deny cookies from a site that will only load with
cookies enabled (and i have other tabs/firebird windows open), then i have to
bookmark everything and restart the browser just to get to the site i wanted to
go to.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  go to www.bestbuy.com with "enable cookies" and "but ask before accepting"
selected in the privacy options dialog box
2.  select "deny" cookies for the site www.bestbuy.com
3.  bestbuy.com will not let you enter without cookies enabled
4.  go to tools->options-privacy->cookies->exceptions and remove www.bestbuy.com
 form the list of blocked sites
5.  refresh www.bestbuy.com (cookies are still blocked)
6.  close and open firebird
7.  go to www.bestbuy.com and select "allow" cookies this time.  the page loads.

Actual Results:  
firebird blocked cookies from bestbuy.com even though i had removed it from the
exceptions list until a firebird restart

Expected Results:  
firebird should have asked whether i wanted to "allow" or "deny" cookies from
www.bestbuy.com after removing www.bestbuy.com from the exceptions list
