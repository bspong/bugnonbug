The dialogue box in "Send Message" comes up frustratingly as

<<The < *** LIST > is not a valid e-mail address because it is not in the form user@host. You must correct it before sending the e-mail>> 

All my lists comprise of names copied directly from the single individual list. 

When I re-write the entire list with a different name and copy EXACTLY THE SAME NAMES FROM THE OLD LIST by drag-and-drop, messages go without complaint. 

Can you explain please?

It should be sent surely?

I give the list a new name with the date added and copy EXACTLY THE SAME NAMES FROM THE OLD LIST by drag-and-drop. Message goes without complaint.
