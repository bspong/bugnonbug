64bit browser hangs on startup when restoring session

The browser hangs on startup when the session is restored. The window is unresponsive the only widget that works is minimise/restore. All the tabs indicate that pages are still loading. Firefox has to be killed with a -9.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Reproducing the problem is difficult. The first time it happened was when our IT department stopped direct internet access and required us to use a proxy server.
Somehow on this occasion it made the entire computer hang such that a hard reset was required. I have since upgraded from Suse 10.0 64 bit to Suse 10.26 bit.

The last time it happened was just now after rebooting following increasing the size of the swap partition. Prior to killing firefox I attached gdb and obtained a stack trace as below.

I suspect this problem is 64bit specific but I am not certain. Suse 64bit linux
seems to have a number of problems. Yast would not work with the proxy until I manually updated curl from 15.X to 17.X. Colleagues using 32bit Suse 10.2 have not had this problem. I have also seen firefox killed by the OS when the system runs out of virtual memory (hence the increase in swap size previously mentioned).  I believe this to be a manifestation of a separate known firefox problem though I have not so far been able to capture evidence of a memory leak.
