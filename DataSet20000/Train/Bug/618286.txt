The Minefield window controls (Minimize, Maximize, and Close) are not redrawn when waking up from computer sleep mode.  I CAN see and activate the orange Minefield menu.  Also, Minefield takes a while to restore the window previews when restoring from sleep mode.  I had eight tabs open and it took about 25 seconds for Minefield to redraw the window previews.

A screenshot is provided for the window controls.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate the World Wide Web.
2. Put your computer to sleep and read a book, do a crossword puzzle, or have a cup of coffee.
3. When you restore the computer from sleep mode, Minefield takes a long time to regenerate window previews with very few tabs open (about 30 seconds for 8 tabs) AND I cannot use the Minefield window controls (Min, Max, Close).
Actual Results:  
Window controls are not redrawn.

Expected Results:  
I should still be able to view and click on the Min, Max, and Close buttons.
