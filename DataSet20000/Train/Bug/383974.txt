Build Identifier: I'm unable to identify the version since I'm unable to start firefox, it occurs to the latest version as well.

I can no longer starts Mozilla Firefox.
Whenever I run the application, it will never show up.
It did show up in the process list and take the cpu usage for 99% but it never shows up.
I've tried to restart my computer, open safemode firefox and even unstall and reinstall firefox... problem still occurs.

This occurs after I send over 10Mb of text through <form><textarea> and I realized that my computer starts to work slowly because firefox eats up too much RAM so I decided to close firefox and reopen it. But I can't open it anymore...
