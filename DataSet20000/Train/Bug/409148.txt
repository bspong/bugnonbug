When typing in a URL using the floating tablet input panel in Windows Vista the autosuggest window that comes up after typing a few characters will appear over the TIP window, the result is the TIP window closes automatically assuming the user has moved the carrot out of the address bar input box and onto the suggestion box below, which takes no text input. This makes using firefox 3.0 impossible for tablet users who have no physical keyboard as typing in any url results in the autosuggest coming up, and the TIP support can not be turned off. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 3.0 B2
2. Visit Slashdot.org
3. Close Browser
4. Open Browser
5. Go to address bar and start typing slashdot.org
6. by the time you type sl, the autosuggest window will pop up, and the TIP window will close as a result
Actual Results:  
Tablet Input Window closes

Expected Results:  
Ideally, firefox should render the suggestion window both below the TIP window without stealing the carrot so the TIP window does not close, as well if possible it should be aware of the tablet input panel and render the autosuggest pane below the tablet input panel. This behaivor is visible if using Internet Explorer 7 in the same usage pattern. If you start typing a URL in IE7 with the TIP panel open, the suggestions to complete the URL render below the TIP panel, as a part of it
