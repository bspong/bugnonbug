I tried to download the file nistime-32bit.exe from the above referenced page.  Was unable to do so in Firefox.  Was able to do so in IE 7.  Here is the email I sent NIST and their response.

The download uses the standard file transfer protocol (ftp). You might want to forward this information to the firefox bug report address.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to web page
2.  Attempt to download file
3.  
Actual Results:  
Download Manager add in claims that file is downloaded.  However, it does not appear in Windows Explorer and file cannot be opened.

Expected Results:  
File should have downloaded.

Successful download achieved using IE 7.

I classify this bug as minor because I was able to workaround using IE 7.  For someone who does not have (or refused to use) IE 7, this would be a major bug because the file cannot be downloaded using Firefox.
