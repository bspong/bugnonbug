 The offsetLeft, offsetTop and another offsetProperties are not update when you change the element corresponding attribute (style.left, style.top etc) with JS.
 In a application where i change the left position like this:
               
		element.style.left     = someValue;

 The value of element.offsetLeft for example still is the same, no matter how much you change the left of the element.

 I tested it in IE 6 and the same thing happens 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.get an element inside another element, like a div inside a bigger one, and give it an id.
2.alert or put the element initial offsetLeft, or offsetTop in some html element or anywhere you can see with something like. alert(document.getElementById(Element_id).offsetLeft)
3. Change this element left position with something like document.getElementById(Element_id).style.left+=40;
4. Alert the new offsetLeft and see that it's value is still the same.
Actual Results:  
The values are still the same, they don't change, maybe it is because it is seted when the page is loaded and don't get refreshed after you move the element.

Expected Results:  
 The offset property should be changed according with the element actual left position.
