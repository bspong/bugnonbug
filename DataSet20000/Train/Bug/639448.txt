History lost when running under DropMyRights
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.14) Gecko/20110218 Firefox/3.6.14
Build Identifier: Firefox/3.6.15

I always run Firefox with reduced privileges under DropMyRights (XP). After updating to version 3.6.15 my history suddenly disappears after reading a few forum posts if I open the browser under DropMyRights. If I use the standard Firefox shortcut button (with full administration rights) I don't have a problem. 

Note: history totally disappears if run under DropMyRights but if I then initiate the browser by clicking the normal Firefox shortcut button, the history reappears.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download DropMyRights from http://download.cnet.com/DropMyRights/3000-2144_4-10722877.html and install
2. Modify the desktop Firefox shortcut properties to read: Target : "C:\Program Files\DropMyRights\DropMyRights.exe" "C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\Firefox.exe"
Start in: "C:\Program Files\DropMyRights"
Click OK
3. Click on the modified shortcut and visit a forum or two. Suddenly all history is lost. Click on the History button and the page will be blank.
Actual Results:  
All history disappeared. Sometimes the toolbar disappears too.
