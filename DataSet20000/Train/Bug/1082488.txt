Clipboard intermittently not working
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:36.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/36.0
Build ID: 20141013104125

Steps to reproduce:

Problem Symptom :
---------------------------
	When Firefox (64 bit version - 36.0a1 (2014-10-13)) and Firefox (32 bit version - 32.0.3) are installed  in a Windows 7 machine, the following problems are observed :
	
		1.) Copy (Ctrl +C) some HTML page from browser and then pasting it (Ctrl + V) in Windows Word / Outlook does not paste images.
		2.) Right click does not work.
		3.) Adding security exception for some websites does not work.

	I opened the same website in Internet Explorer browser, and no such problems are observed.

Workaround :
-------------------
	1.) Uninstall both 64bit and 32 bit firefox completely by following instructions here.
		https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/uninstall-firefox-from-your-computer
	      Note:  Firefox folder found under 'Roaming\Mozilla' folder must be deleted.
	
	2.) Then install 64 bit version only.
	
Root Cause :
-----------------
	1.) Seems both versions share the same local application directory, '%APPDATA%\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox', things got confused.
	
	May be separate folders should be created for different modes (32 bit / 64 bit) of Firefox.




Actual results:

Copy, Paste of images from firefox browser is not happening.


Expected results:

Copy, paste should work normally.
