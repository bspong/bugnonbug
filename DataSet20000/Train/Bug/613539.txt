Blank Page After Displaying Javascript Pop-up

We are seeing an issue in Firefox related to displaying a normal javascript alert pop-up box.  After clicking ok on the pop-up box the resulting screen is blank.  The version used for the testing were 3.6.3, 3.6.10 and 3.6.12.

In this particular section of the application there is a pair of frames separated vertically.  The right frame has the javascript pop-up alert, a javascript method to load the left frame and also content in the body of html to display in the right frame.  What we are seeing is after clicking the ok button the html/javascript below the alert is not executed, neither the fetch for the load of the left frame or the content in the body of the right frame is displayed.

One thing we have noticed is when we turn off the Firefox caching, the issue goes away and after clicking the ok button the content is successfully loaded for all frames.  

Below is the setting in Firefox we can turn off to fix the issue:
network.http.use-cache;false

We prefer not to have to turn off all browser level caching.  It appears the problem is related to Firefox in the way it is caching and showing a popup using the alert javascript function.  

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Access the section of the application with the pop-up.
2. Click ok on the pop-up
3.
Actual Results:  
The resulting page is blank.  Repeating the same steps in IE or with Firefox caching turned off gives the expected results.

Expected Results:  
The content in the left and right frames should be displayed.
