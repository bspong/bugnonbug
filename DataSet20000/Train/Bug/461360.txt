High CPU usage (50 to 100 %) after user switching (in Windows Vista)

If the firefox is being used and I switch the windows user account to another, firefox on the first user starts to cause a high CPU and memory usage (more than 400 MB occupied and from 50 to 100% of CPU usage). It happens even if nothing has being done before the user switching (no page loading, no downloads...).

memory: 2GB
CPU: Athlon 64 X2 6000+
OS: Windows Vista x86 SP1

*it has already been occurred on Firefox 3.0.3

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Connect to the internet
2.Open firefox
3.View some web pages
4.Switch the windows user account
Actual Results:  
The firefox process on the first user start to use a high amount of memory (more than 400 MB) and increases dramatically the usage of CPU (from 50 to 100% oscillating) on both of the two cores.

Expected Results:  
The firefox process of the first user wasn't doing anything (no page loading, no downloads in progress...), so is expected that firefox behaves like an idle process (low CPU usage).

When it occurs and I back to the first user, the issue persists. If I disconnect and reconnect the internet connection, the high CPU usage ceases, even if i return to switch the windows user account.
