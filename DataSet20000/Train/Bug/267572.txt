uninstaller opens new firefox window
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041103 Firefox/1.0RC2

I just uninstalled 11/1 version of rc2, to upgrade to the 11/3 version, and
something strange happened: the uninstaller attempted to open Firefox. I was
prompted by Sygate that firefox was being opened by UNINSTALL.exe, which is what
I was running at the time to remove Firefox.

Firefox attempted to open my homepage, but I refused the connection due to the
very suspicious nature of this request. Here's some firewall log info that can
hopefully help:

Security Log:

Application Hijacking has been detected
The application: C:\Documents and Settings\Aaron Keier\Local
Settings\Temp\ns_temp\UNINSTALL.EXE  try to launch another application:
C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe  to go to remote host  turkeybot.info

I was unable to obtain a packet log for this, simply because I never enabled
packet logging. If I can reproduce the problem, then I will catch the packet and
post the contents of it here.
