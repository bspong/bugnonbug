Automatically selecting certificate fails
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9b5) Gecko/2008042803 Red Hat/3.0b5-0.beta5.6.el5 Firefox/3.0b5

I use a CAC (smart) card to log into various .mil
sites.  If I have my firefox preferences (Advanced -> Encryption) set to
"Select one automatically" then I presume Firefox is selecting the
inappropriate certificate as the site will fail.  On the other hand, if I
select "Ask me every time" it will prompt me for which key I want to use
(always the second one on the list) it will properly authenticate but will ask
me a dozen times (or more) which key I need as it loads different portions of
the page.

I have found that if I have my preferences open at the time I load the page I
can manually select the key and then quickly select "Select one automatically"
and it will work properly.  While this is an inconvenience, it is a pain to do
and I'll have other "non-geeks" using this solution very soon.  Is there
something I'm not doing correctly?
