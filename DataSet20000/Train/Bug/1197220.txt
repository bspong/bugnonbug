User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.8; rv:41.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/41.0
Build ID: 20150817163452

Steps to reproduce:

Since transferring my data and user profiles to a newer MacBook Pro 6.2 with OSX 10.8.5 and 4 GB RAM, I am getting crashes multiple times a day. I have tried:

- starting with add-ons off
- safe mode
- resetting Firefox
- switching to FF Beta 41 latest version

No change with any of these. I am running on average 13 windows each with 5-10 tabs as I have for years. This same profile was generally stable on my prior MB Pro 1.1 with OSX 10.6.8 and 2 GB RAM.

Other symptoms: FF is using crazy amount of RAM, 1.1 to over 1.5 GB and over time the inactive RAM climbs steadily up to around 1.5 GB, leaving very little free RAM, as though FF is not giving memory back to the system properly. The extension Tab Memory Usage doesn't show tabs to be using anything near the total being used, most are 20 MB or even way less than 1 MB.




Actual results:

Two of them are titled "@ @0x0 | mozilla::dom::DeferredFinalizerImpl<T>::DeferredFinalize(unsigned int, void*)" and 1 is "@ js::jit::AssemblerX86Shared::bind(js::jit::Label*)" but neither of those match the other symptoms or my system that I can find. All three of those have EXC_BAD_ACCESS as the crash reason.

I am attaching a JPG of Activity Monitor.


Expected results:

FF should have run stably and not crashed.
