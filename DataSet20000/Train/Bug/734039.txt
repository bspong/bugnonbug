jQuery ajax query does not load upon success into an element with fixed positioning
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:10.0.2) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0.2
Build ID: 20120215223356

Steps to reproduce:

I created an element which at default state is absolutely positioned. When the user scrolls down the page I have used jQuery to change the css and add a class that alters the positioning to fixed so that the element follows the user down the page past the page fold. Lets call this element 'notes' for reference.


Actual results:

I am using jQuery ajax function to load content from a script into the element 'notes' which works perfectly. However when the positioning has been altered to fixed as mentioned above the new content does not render in firefox even though loading has completed successfully. When the user scrolls up this seems to refresh firefox and the new content is there however that is not the purpose of having this element follow the user down the page.


Expected results:

The content in webkit browsers refreshes no matter where the element 'notes' is on the screen in real time and without additional scrolling. Ideally it would be great if this too could work in FF as it is my preferred browser and anyone still using IE is helping to keep the monster alive!
