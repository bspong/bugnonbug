0.54 - 1.05% installer size  (linux32, windows8-64, windowsxp) regression on push bfb4f7467dd4b39005d61fbcb2872da14a29d66b (Fri Aug 5 2016)
It looks like bug 1288511 increases the size of the installer rather significantly. I figured I should file this bug to track this. James, is there a plan to mitigate this increase?
