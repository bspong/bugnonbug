Firefox does not open local files from other paths than $HOME, /media or /usr
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091109 Ubuntu/9.10 (karmic) Firefox/3.5.4pre

Whenever I try to open a local file outside $HOME, /media or /usr (or any of their subdirectories), nothing happens (maybe there are some other directories that work, but several ones don't work). It does not matter whehter the address is typed on the location bar or opened via the file dialog.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create some HTML file that is not under the mentioned files (for example, scratchbox documentation is often outside thos)
2. Open the file in firefox. You can follow any of these:
   a) Open using File > Open file, and browse to the file
   b) Open the file by typing the address to the location bar, such as "file:///scratchbox/users/myself/home/myself/index.html"
   c) Open the file by typing the container foler to the address bar (such as "file:///scratchbox/users/myself/home/myself/") and opening the file by clicking on it
3.
Actual Results:  
The file is opened and displayed by Firefox.

Seems like the functionality is somehow intentional, or a side-effect of some white-listing, since the directories that work correctly are quite common, but still at least an error message should be shown if opening the files from other locations is intentionally disabled.

Expected Results:  
Nothing happens - as if the file was not tried to be opened.

I tried to disable all extensions, too, and restarting firefox, but it did not help.
