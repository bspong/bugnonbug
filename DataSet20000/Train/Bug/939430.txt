Firefox hanging and eventually crashing several times a day, crash reports say it's in js::jit::DoCompareFallback
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:25.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/25.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20131112160018

Steps to reproduce:

Nothing, as far as I can tell. My browsing/extensions/etc has not changed since I moved from a mid-2010 MacBook Pro running 10.8 (FF beta channel) to a 2013 Retina MacBook Pro running 10.9 (FF production channel).

But the hangs and crashes have been going on ever since I installed FF on this new machine.


Actual results:

Several times a day, Firefox will lock up and become extremely unresponsive, and I am forced to kill it. If I am away from my computer, it appears that it will crash on its own, as I get a couple of crash reports per day (all submitted).

I wish I had more details but I really am not sure where to begin, and the crash report doesn't mean anything to me as I'm not familiar with Firefox's code. Does a crash in js::jit::DoCompareFallback give any clues for ways I can narrow down the cause of the crash? I have been unable to find other bugs mentioning this, and the number of crash reports (aside from me) is limited.


Expected results:

No hanging/stalling/crashing.
