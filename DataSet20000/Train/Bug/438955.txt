When restarting a FF session when I have MANY (often >100) tabs opening, sometimes (~5-10% of the time) the navigation toolbar buttons are totally messed up on the right hand side, to the right of the search box, with a display of an extra 5 rows of twenty or so buttons on each row. These extra five rows of twenty buttons all appear to act as ONE huge button.

Closing Firefox and starting again eliminates the problem, with the session and UI displaying normally the next time, until it happens again, with no known trigger.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have MANY tabs open (I don't know the minimum number, but I'll often have >100 tabs open at a time, when it happens)
2.Close Firefox
3.Restart Firefox
Actual Results:  
5-10% of the time, the navigation toolbar UI is messed up, on the extreme right hand side, with a display of an extra HUGE button that is twenty icons wide by 5 rows deep, with ~85 icons displayed in it.

Expected Results:  
The navigation toolbar should display normally, without that extra button, with the ~85 icons on it there.

See screenshot at http://img443.imageshack.us/my.php?image=ffrc2whentaxedjw4.jpg for best way to understand what is going on. Note rectangle around icons on the right. That's because I had the cursor over the area, making it highlight like that, as if those icons are one big button.
