Firefox window freezes when above URL is opened.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051025 Firefox/1.5

Every time I go to the above URL the entire window visiting that URL freezes.  Other windows are unaffected but other tabs on the same URL are unaccesable.  If you click on other tabs their titles appear on the browser window and the bookmark toolbar still works but the page itself will not render, i.e., the part where you see the web pages is completely frozen and will not render anything.  

The page URL (in the primary toolbar on top) is also frozen and cannot be selected or otherwise allow text entry.  The search box also does not allow any entry but the menu allowing one to select other search engines still displays.  Trying to go to another webpage via bookmarks changes the page title again but leaves the page itself frozen, i.e., it is still blank and white.
