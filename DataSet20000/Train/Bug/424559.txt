I'm using a Fujitsu v5505 laptop. If the computer goes to sleep, when it's woken Firefox is able to establish connections to new/current websites open in the tabs for about 20 mins. After that it won't connect to any website at all. If I close firefox (File>Exit or click the X), Firefox doesn't end properly. I have to go to the task manager and close the process. And then if I open Firefox again, it will connect to sites for about 30 mins before the same problem occurs. the only way to stop this is to reboot windows. My connection is ok, as I can open websites in IE7 when this problem occurs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Let laptop go to sleep
2.Wake laptop 
3.Browse for around 20 minutes
4.Close firefox from File>Exit
5.Stop the process in Task Manager
6.Restart firefox.
7.reboot Vista
Actual Results:  
Firefox works normally once Vista is restarted - until the computer goes to sleep again.

Expected Results:  
Connect to websites. End the process upon Exit

I only have the DOM plugin installed. I normally have 8-9 tabs open. I haven't tried it with just one tab to see if it still does this. My tabs reopen when I restart firefox.
