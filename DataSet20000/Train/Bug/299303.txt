My Online C Crash Course at
http://www.stellimare.com/~aragorn/scouting/mb/computers/c-cc.html displays as
expected in the browser, but, when printing with background colors on, the
background color of the <pre> elements bleed over to the entire page. The first
page will print normally, but the others do not.

This problem exists on all platforms, Max OS X, Windows, and Linux. It can also
be seen in the print preview. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the page at http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,2043-1-3098-1,00.html
2. Go to page setup, check "Print Background (color & iamges)"
3. Either print, or view the page in print preview.

Actual Results:  
First page prints as expected.  Following pages with <pre> elements have the
<pre> tags background color bled over the entire page, and not contained within
the boxed in section as on the first page, and as the browser normally displays it.

And burns lots of toner...

Expected Results:  
Printed the page just as it looks in the browser (not in the print preview).
