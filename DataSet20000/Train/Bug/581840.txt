Starting with late Minefield 4.0b2pre nightlies, I have seen an intermittent failure to display ANY web content windows.  The menus display fine and open windows show up in the Window menu, but no windows are actually visible and no amount of trying different URLs, reloading existing sites or even closing and opening Minefield will reinstate the showing of windows.  The only solution seems to be closing Minefield, opening Firefox 4.0 beta 1, closing firefox and then reopening Minefield.  Minefield then behaves normally for a long period of time until the next incident.  Minefield is my default browser and the problem seems to happen about once a day.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse using Minefield
2. Closing all windows may be part of the problem; it is so intermittent that I really haven't been able to pinpoint a sequence of events
3. "About Minefield" window will open and display, but all normal web windows fail to display.
Actual Results:  
Intermittently, ALL web windows will fail to display.

Expected Results:  
Web windows are visible
