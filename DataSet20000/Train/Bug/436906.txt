No action is committed upon the selection of the "Submit" button after making a roster move.

Unfortunately you must have a team and league to be able to test this.  It may be a standard call that is just missing

Using Wireshark, I observed no packet activity when selecting the "Submit" button.  I did capture packets from IE7 and Firefox2.x
