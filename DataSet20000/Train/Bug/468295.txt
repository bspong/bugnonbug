I personally hate the smart location bar, but according to your site I can turn off that feature by going to the TOOLS section selecting the CLEAR PRIVATE DATA, to have another pop-up option menu to appear. NOTHING APPEARS... NOTHING HAPPENS. If I close the firefox completely and log back on, it still has all sorts of links some that not favorites but rather searches and various sites still present.

After a few moments the firefox program will stop responding.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open FireFox
2. GO TO TOOLS
3. CLICK ON CLEAR PERSONAL DATA
Actual Results:  
NOTHING APPEARS... NOTHING HAPPENS. The CLEAR PERSONAL DATA appears to be not working. After a few moments the firefox program will stop responding.

Expected Results:  
The CLEAR PERSONAL DATA should have opened a another options window as describe on your help pages, giving the option to clear the smart location bar history.

That the smart location bar should have the option for one to use it or not, I personally would not use it, for personal reasons. I have no fancy themes or add-ons added. Basic firefox, I am not a computer expert - very much a novice.
