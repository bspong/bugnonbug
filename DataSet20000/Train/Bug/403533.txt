Firefox on OS X Should Respect MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH (or other alternative plugin directory)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko/20071025 Firefox/2.0.0.9

Despite spending a great amount of time searching I have been unable to discover a means to install plugins for firefox but not for safari in a robust way.  In OS X firefox appears to only search /Library/Internet Plugins and ~/Library/Internet Plugins in addition to the directories inside the bundle (which I assume will be deleted on upgrade).

Gecko Plugin API documentation says that MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH enviornment variable will allow the user to specify an additional plugin directory on windows and unix.  This should work on OS X as well (or something else accomplishing the same function).  I tried and it fails to work

If I'm missing something simple that will fix this I apoligize but if so the documentation is really lacking.  The plugin documentation (http://plugindoc.mozdev.org/) goes into some depth about plugin directories on windows and unix but is silent on OS X.
