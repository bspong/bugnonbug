Setting "Firefox" the default browser through menus removes enitre htm filetype from the Windows' "Folder preferences"

Setting Firefox to be the default browser throught the menus completely trashed the htm filetype handling. I used to have options like "Edit" and "print" in the right-click pop-up menu, but they all were removed. Not only this, but the entire htm filetype disappeared from the Windows' filetype handling preferences (booting the system didn't help). When I tried to re-enter HTM back in as a new style, Windows denied it, claiming its handled by Firefox and can't be altered.

To fix this problem I had to set Internet Explorer back to default browser (print and edit options became available again) and then manually set Firefox to handle the files.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Uninstal Firefox (Windows resets IE as default browser)
2. Instal new Firefox
3. Go to menus and set Firefox as default browser
Actual Results:

Expected Results:  
It should've just altered the "Open" instead of reseting everything (as Firefox doesn't come with HTM editor, there really is no need to alter the rest).
