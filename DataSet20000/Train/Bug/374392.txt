display of some unicode characters is incorrect

&equiv; shows the "divide" symbol

&minus; shows a large circle

To reproduce, I can use the tester at "http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/demo/tester.html":

Test code:

<math xmlns="&mathml;">
&equiv;
</math>

Gives the divide by glyph.

I can also reproduce the problem by using your MathML test suite:  "http://www.w3.org/Math/testsuite/", and choosing Characters->EntityNames->e, and then scrolling down to equiv.

I noticed a number of other entities appear to be giving problems, i.e. &minus;,  &mnplus;.  In the e's, eDDot, eg, elsdot, emptyset, EmptyVerySmallSquare, emsp, emsp13, emsp14, ensp, eparsl, eplus, equivDD, eqvparsl, erarr, Esim are missing, but only equiv appears to be giving the wrong result.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I can also reproduce the problem by using your MathML test suite:  

1) http://www.w3.org/Math/testsuite/

2) choose Characters

3) choose EntityNames

4) choose e

5) scroll down to equiv
Actual Results:  
divide by sign

Expected Results:  
should show "equiv" sign, three horizontal bars lined up on top of each other

This started showing up sometime in the last two days.  I had upgraded Firefox to 2.0.0.2 recently, but checking with Firefox 1.5 produced the same results.   I upgraded to Mac OS X 10.4.9 yesterday, which may have triggered the bug.  I have no way to check that.  Another program on the Mac, BBEdit, is able to render the &equiv; character OK, so the problem does not appear to be system wide in impact.

Specifying the character by number does not help.  Since I can reproduce the problem using your MathML test page
