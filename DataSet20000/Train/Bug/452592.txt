Hi,

re: Mozilla Firefox v3 

Emailing about What seems to be very odd to 

me:

Under C:\Program Files, there have appeared 

TWO entries for Firefox.

Folder #1 is called "Mozilla Firefox. It has 

"Firefox.exe" in it.

Folder #2 is called "Mozilla Firefox(2)." It 

does NOT have "Firefox.exe" in it. But its 

"uninstall.log" contains these 2 files at 

the top of the contents:
File: \AccessibleMarshal.dll
File: \application.ini

Is this normal? (The first "Mozilla Firefox" 

 "uninstall.log" does NOT have it.)

Firefox ALWAYS reports it is NOT my default 

browser, even immediately after I make it 

so!

Earlier in the day, I was mis-directed to an 

unrelated website.

Seems like I have a virus...

Do you want to see the files?  No, I am not 

looking for technical support.  Just trying 

to be helpful.

Please reply either way asap.  I will be 

deleting these and re-installing in a day or 

two.

Sincerely,
John Johnson

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.run Firefox
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Each time Firefox claims NOT to be the default browser, even immediately after I make it so; it's like this whether I continue browsing or close Firefox (and/or my computer down for a cold boot).

Expected Results:  
Same thing as described in "details" above...
