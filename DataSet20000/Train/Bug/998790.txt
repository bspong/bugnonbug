User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:28.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/28.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140314220517

Steps to reproduce:

I'm working through an old CSS textbook (Sams CSS in 10 minutes) and reached the part about css for print previews. The source is given in the attachment listing20-11.htm. Load the attachment in both Chrome & Firefox. 


Actual results:

When the page is loaded in Firefox 28.0, the links from the nav container are shown at the bottom of the page. Using firebug they are displayed as.

<a href="#" style="visibility: visible; display: block;">Home</a>
<a href="#" style="visibility: visible; display: block;">About us</a>
<a href="#" style="visibility: visible; display: block;">Services</a>
<a href="#" style="visibility: visible; display: block;">Staff</a>
<a href="#" style="visibility: visible; display: block;">Portfolio</a>
<a href="#" style="visibility: visible; display: block;">Contact us</a>

When view source is selected, these fields are not visible in the source, but are shown in the rendered page. I've verified this on a clean Firefox 28 install.


Expected results:

The page should render as it does in Chrome 33.0.1750.152

No Links should be displayed on the page.
