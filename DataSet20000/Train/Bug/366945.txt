middle-clicking on a page starts a load based on clipboard contents (on unix-like hosts)

the middle-click behavior in firefox is mind-boggling...even for those who fully understand the unix middle-click.  

first of all, it does makes sense that middle-clicking in a form pastes the clipboard contents into that form.  it also makes sense that middle-clicking on a link opens that link in a new tab.

however, it makes absolutely no sense that middle-clicking in arbitrary space on a page attempts to load a url based on the text in the clipboard.  oftentimes i am trying to middle-click on a link, but miss slightly, and am taken to a 404 not found because the clipboard text is not a url.  i hadn't meant to use the clipboard text to take me anywhere, but inadvertently, i was.

i really think that middle-clicking within a page should not attempt to parse the clipboard text as a url.  instead, that click should just be ignored.  let the user middle-click in the address bar, then press "go" to use clipboard text as a url.  that makes sense.

thank you for your consideration.
