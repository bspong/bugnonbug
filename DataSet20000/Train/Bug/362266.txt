(Personal Toolbar) link to local file, (right-click) "open in new window", fails.

(May be related to Bug 344569 ).  I have a link to a local .htm file in my personal toolbar.  If I rightclick this link and "open in new window", a new window opens, with two tabs.  The first tab contains (untitled) blank.  The second tab takes longer (DNS request delay) and results in a "Server not found" error message:  "Firefox can't find the server at www.yahmail.htm."  The local file does not load.    The link to the local file = file:///c|/yahmail.htm

If I select "open in new tab", the local file opens without a hitch.    The link also works perfectly with a single navigation click (opening in existing window.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox.
2.Rightclick on link in Personal Toolbar Folder to local file.
3.Select "Open in new window."

Actual Results:  
A new window opens, with two tabs.  The first tab contains (untitled) blank.  The second tab takes longer (DNS request delay) and results in a "Server not found" error message:  "Firefox can't find the server at www.yahmail.htm."  The local file does not load.

Expected Results:  
The local file should open, in a single new window (no tabs).

This error has persisted through all Firfox updates to date.  Clicking on the link again (in the 2nd tab, with error message) opens the local file without a hitch.  Removing one of the slashes in the link (link = file://c|/yahmail.htm ) does not change results.
