After applying a userchrome.css hack to right align the items in the bookmarks toolbar, drag and drop causes bookmark items to jiggle erratically and the blue indicator arrow misleadingly indicate that the bookmark will be placed at the far right side of the toolbar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox with userchrome.css:
/**/
#bookmarksBarContent {display:inline;text-align:right;}
#bookmarksBarContent toolbarbutton {text-align:left;}
/**/
2. Show the bookmarks toolbar, bookmark items should be right aligned.
3. Have at least one bookmark item (also tested with two, three).
4a. Try to rearrange a bookmark item by dragging.
4b. Try to bookmark a page by dragging its tab into the bookmark toolbar.
Actual Results:  
 * Other items jiggle left and right erratically while dragging
 * The blue indicator arrow for the bookmark's new location remains at the far right side of the toolbar

Expected Results:  
Drag and drop to work as it does without the custom user chrome. Dragging an item should not cause the others to jiggle, the blue indicator arrow should appear where the bookmark will be placed relative to the others.

Dragging an item to the far left will force the other items to be right aligned.
Calling the customize toolbar dialog re-aligns the items.

Attempts to reproduce the problem on Minefield (16-Jul-2009 build) caused (with no discernible pattern) the program to spike the CPU to 100%, leaving it unresponsive. But Minefield did start twice and both times it had the same problem. Mardeg on moznet #firefox is running Minefield on the same platform (Windows XP) and can reproduce the problem reliably, with the jiggling only happening when dragging an item to the far right.

  <%Mardeg> yann: if it's any consolation, the bookmark drops exactly where you're hovering it on trunk nightly versions, but the blue indicator arrow is way off target
  <%Mardeg> actually dragging to the far right still makes them jiggle :/
