Autocomplete dropdown does not scroll with page using wheelmouse or touchpad (without clicking)

The dropdown selection box for choosing an autocomplete choice does not scroll along with the rest of the page when using a wheel mouse's center wheel for scrolling.  It appears to float (in it's last location) while the rest of the page scrolls beneath it.

Using an HP wireless keyboard and mouse, the mouse has a center button/wheel for scrolling.

Note that on a click (L,M,R), the dropdown disappears.

Suggested Fixes:
- Add a dropdown close/hide hook into some onscroll type event in addition to the one that occurs onclick.
OR
- Move the dropdown along with the page as it scrolls around.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Nav to a page that requires a vertical scrollbar and a form with a text box.
2. Complete a text entry in the form and submit.
3. Go back to the same page and click or press down when in the text box to initiate the autocomplete dropdown box.
4. Move the mouse cursor off of the dropdown to somewhere on the page background.
5. *Without* clicking any buttons (L,M, or R), move the wheel up or down.
6. BUG: The page moves, but the autocomplete dropdown stays in the same place.

Actual Results:  
The page moves, but the autocomplete dropdown stays in the same place ("floats").

Expected Results:  
Either the autocomplete dropdown should disappear, as when a user clicks somewhere  else on the page or the selection box should move with the page.
