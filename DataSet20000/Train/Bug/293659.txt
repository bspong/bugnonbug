In Firefox 1->1.0.3 under RedHat9 and WinXP some images (no matter what format)
are rendered incorrectly while loaded remotely (http://...).
Same images loaded using OpenFile are displayed OK.
Mozillas 0.9->1.7.7 display OK no matter how loaded (also Netscape, IE, Opera).
However images originally resided within a map, it is probably not a question of
surrounding HTML since the problem persists for direct GETs as well:

Images named banner1.* were never in a map hence should not be cached.
Images were created using GIMP. Other images (including other created with GIMP)
are rendered OK. Convertion by convert does not help (test png and jpeg were
created this way).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load http://www.science24.com/resources/paper/2598/banner1.gif
2. or http://www.science24.com/resources/paper/2598/banner1.png
3. or http://www.science24.com/resources/paper/2598/banner1.jpg

Actual Results:  
image is rendered as a 4x4px small bright dot. Should be 600x200 banner.

Expected Results:  
display actual image

Standard installation of RH9 with Firefox 1 up to 1.0.3 downloaded was observed
