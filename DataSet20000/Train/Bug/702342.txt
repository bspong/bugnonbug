Filter Button should remain popped up when unchecking a suboption if any of the other suboptions remain checked

Only uncheck filter button if all of it's suboptions get unchecked

The behavior of the filter buttons when you uncheck a "Warning" or "Error" selection is confusing, the STR:

1. Open up http://harthur.github.com/test-pages/filters.html
2. Open the Web Console
3. Reload the page so you see the errors and log messages
4. Make sure the "JS" filter button is "On" (all options checked, button depressed)
5. Click the drop-down of the "JS" button
6. Select the "Warnings" option to filter out JS warnings

Actual:
the "document.all" warning is no longer shown, and the "JS" button looks "off" (popped-up)

Expected:
the "document.all" warning is no longer shown, but the "JS" button still looks "on" (depressed).


I'm often turning off just warnings in the web console and the filter UI has confused the living daylights out of me, and I think this is why. When I'm seeing "JS stuff" in the web console, I want the button UI to reflect this.

There's bug 626018 about making a tri-state UI for the filter buttons (all on, some on, none on), but in the meantime I think we could do this. Here's a patch if you want to play around, let me know what you think of this idea.
