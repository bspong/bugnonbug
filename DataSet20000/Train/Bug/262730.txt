Adding a new search engine - no text description for new engine, upon selecting the engine logo, firefox crashes.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10

When I try to addy any engine through the 'add engine' option in the search bar,
it add's the engine, without any text (just a logo) when I then select this
engine, Firefox performs a general windows crash, so I get the 'firefox has
errors and must close' type standard message.

This has been reported through the automatic 'talkback' agent.  I have tried
removing all extensions, un-installing, re-installed the latest build, going
through the painful process of removing FF registry keys, or any left over
files, and the problem still persists.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. On the search bar (top right) select 'add engines'
2. add any, new engine
3. select the new engine

Actual Results:  
Firefox crashed.  Basic windows crash box, saying FF has errors and must close.

Expected Results:  
selected the newly installed search engine, and allow it to be searched like any
other engine.  

This problem did not happen on 0.9.3, I dont remember if I un-installed 0.9.3
before I installed 1.0PR but I have completely removed anything mozilla from the
pc as far as I can find, including the profiles, several times.  Still using no
extensions and the problem persists.  It should at least now work as it should
when I expect to be literally installing FF again, as if it were the 1st
download, as I had removed everything.
