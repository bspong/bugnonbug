Earlier I used to see this entry in the about:config and my setPref never failed. When I downloaded the new firefox I observed that this setting kept on failed. On digging further into the issue noticed that the entry isn't there in the about:config. I couldn't create an entry network.dnsCacheEntries and even tried with the prefwrapper utility i.e js file from mozilla dev. Since my script dynamicaly sets this value. AFAIK it looked as a bug, since even thereisn't any provision to set a value for such default entries or even create.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. A script to create prefInstance and set network.dnsCacheEntries
2. Shouldn't create the entry manually, since requirement is to dynamically update without user intervention
3.
Actual Results:  
Exception thrown on setIntPref

Expected Results:  
Should set the new value in place of the default one.

Since I have been hugely dependent on this entry. Now my entire script and feature went for a toss since resetting & setting this entry flushed the dns cache now it doesn't allow me to reset or even to set any other value. Earlier it has been there so looks like a feature/functionality broken
