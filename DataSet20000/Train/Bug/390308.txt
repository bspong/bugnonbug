Summary:
Downloads using Firefox 2.0.0..5 & DivX Browser Pluggin [DivX 6.7] corrupts both Firefox and SystemUIServer causing first incorrect behavior and then either a System Hang or a Kernel Panic



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Install Firefox 2.0.0.5 [latest version] and DivX Mac 6.7 [latest version]
2) go to <http://tv-links.co.uk/listings/1> and select several videos that are in DivX format to download/play and use the contextual menue "Open Link in a New Window" to 
open a player/down window.
3) Set the download preferences to a folder of your choice 
   [click on X icon to the right of the progress bar]
4) make certain to put each player window into the stop state
   [if the player is allowed to play to the end of the buffer it will crash Firefox
   and you will not see the corruption in SystemUIServer]
5) When the videos have downloaded, you will find that SystemUIServer has been 
   corrupted. 
6) All Firefox Browser windows will now have the frontmost property and Dropdown
   sheets and Contextual Menues will be displayed BEHIND the browser window.
7) If the full corruption has occurred the same behavior will be present for
   Finder windows and any other applications windows vs Firefox.
8) SystemUIServer may hang or cause a Kernel Panic or it may just misbehave.

Actual Results:  
The crash when playing to the end of the buffer and the corrupted SystemUIServer behavior happens 100% of the time. The hang and Kernel Panic have occurred once each.

Expected Results:  
Dropdown Sheets and Contextual Menues should ALWAYS be displayed IN FRONT of the
parent windows.
