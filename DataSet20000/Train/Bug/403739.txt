Google Books offers a "View Text" mode that offers the user the ability to both view and extract ASCII text for each page of a book.  When one attempts to use a select "zone" operation, to be followed by a "copy" for pasting in another file, the "select" operation fails when the "copy" is attempted.  The "selection" cursor for the text selected disappears before the "copy" can be attempted.  This sequence works on IE.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.books.google.com
2.enter a search key for a book, then page down until a page of text can be seen.
3.Select: "view text" (upper right column for most books)
4.Select a block of text.
5.Right-Click to copy the text-the selected block of text will disappear before the right-click menu is opened.
Actual Results:  
The selection zone should stay active until the menu-box is opened in response to the right-click. In this case, the selection zone is lost and the copy can not be accomplished.


As state above, this sequence works in IE.
