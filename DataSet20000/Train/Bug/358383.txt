link text and/or link images move on mouseover if CSS a:hover is used

using Slackware 10.0.0 and firefox 2.0, images and text used as links sometimes move on mouseover - this seems to be when the color of the link is changed using a CSS a:hover

e.g. link text and link images on a page with the following CSS move about:

a, a:visited, a:active { color: #106790; font-weight: 600; }
a:hover { color: #3087b0; }

either replacing the a:hover color with the same as that used in the line above it solves the problem. removing the a:hover altogether solves the problem.

problem is seen on many sites, including mozilla.org!



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. visit http://www.mozilla.org/quality/help/
2. move mouse over links


Actual Results:  
the text of some of the links moved slightly (about 1 pixel, so just a visible twitch)

Expected Results:  
no movement

problem does not seem to occur using the windows version of Firefox - just linux.

in a sense it's not "critical" but is irritating enough to make me go back to the previous version.
