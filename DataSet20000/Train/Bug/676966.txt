Steps to reproduce:

'm trying to write a wysiwyg editor using a contentEditable div, and am having trouble in Firefox when dealing with bold (and italic).



Actual results:


When all text in the div is selected, execCommand('bold') works in the div, but when I try to grab the HTML of that content, the HTML does not reveal any formatting.
To see what I mean, please try running the attached HTML code in Firefox 5.

Please try the following:

  -  Select the word "Some" only. Click the Bold button. This will make the text bold, as expected. The HTML output uses <span style="font-weight:bold;"> to bold the word, which is somewhat unfortunate (it's <b> in Safari, Chrome), but nonetheless does the job.
 -   Select the entire phrase "Some editable text" (either manually or using CTRL-A). Click the Bold button. While the contentEditable text is bold, as expected, the HTML output does not have the bold formatting applied.



Expected results:

The HTML output should have the bold formatting applied.
