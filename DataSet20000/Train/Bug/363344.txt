Mmkey.
There isnt much to write about, FX crashes randomly while I surf, sometimes its 2 times in a row in 5 minutes, sometimes its 5 hours between the crashes.
I think it doesnt crash while not loading a site, its always (I think) when I enter a new site. It doesnt matter wich site I enter, it crashed like 10 minutes ago, when I was entering this side. :/ All from Youtube to Hotmail to google. Im getting crazy cause I dont know whats wrong. S:

The problem started AFTER I installed Fx 2.0, not before. :/
Havent tried to reinstall since Im afraid all my bookmarks will dissapear.


Reproducible: Didn't try
