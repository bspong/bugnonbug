Uploading images to Imagevenue frequently terminates with a file selection error

Over 70% of the time, uploading multiple files to Imagevenue prematurely terminates and generates the following unsuccessful error message:
 
"you need to select at least 1 file to upload"

The message is generated by the URL: http://imagevenue.com/uploadflash.php

In the above case, 9 files were selected from Firefox's File Open dialogue.

Yet, when I upload the same files to Imagevenue in IE6, I experience a 100% success rate!

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to:  http://imagevenue.com (or http://imagevenue.com/hostflash.php)
2. Click the BROWSE button on the web form
3. Select 2 or more files in the File Open dialog
4. Click the SEND FILE(S) button
5. Wait for upload completion/termination status
Actual Results:  
The following error message is displayed:

"you need to select at least 1 file to upload"

Fails over 70% of the time!  Fails over 90% of the time after the first successful upload!

Expected Results:  
Thumbnails of the uploaded images will be displayed, along with insertion codes for forums, blogs, and web pages.

Sometimes, Firefox completes the upload successfully, only to display additional thumbnails for images that were previously successfully uploaded.
