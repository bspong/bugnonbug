My BUG is similar to #272542 #299206  that i have found on your site...
I am afraid to RE-Boot for fear of loosing ALL my BOOKMARKS.  
This maybe connected to some other strange bugs occurring lately.  EG. I 
installed some Extensions & themes a few weeks ago (for the first time. The 
next day,I was asked for USER PROFILE(never did before), & my bookmarks were 
erased.  Then strange bugs(WHICH I did a SEND REPORT)..so.. so I did a System 
Restore to earlier time... Got :rstrui.exe would not UNRESTORE!
Spent hours reseaching & running checks on my pc...All good...continued working 
from the EARLIER time to find errors every time I attempted to log onto web 
through MOZ FF desktop icon.  So, I decided to upgrade versions through IE...
and here we are!
PS.  I recall some type of error when i upgraded back in JAn. 05(?ish) but i 
just hit something which made FF work, so I never bothered you with it
