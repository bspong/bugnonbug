Going to a Russian website with the American Firefox browser version will
display the website with Russian (Cyrillic) characters, but the title bar
displays only ?'s instead of the correct Russian/Cyrillic text.

NOTES:

- Opening the Source code, the Cyrillic characters are correctly displayed
between the TITLE tags.
- This also occurs on other Russian websites

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

needed for your system) using an American version of Firefox.
2. Notice the text is in Cyrillic characters, then look at the Title bar.
3. Click on "View" --> "Page Source" and verify the text between the TITLE tags
correctly displays Cyrillic characters.


Actual Results:  
The webpage displays with Cyrillic characters, but the title bar displays only
?'s for each character.

Expected Results:  
For the title bar to display the Cyrillic characters correctly (and for all
other languages when the language pack for that particular language is installed).
