Firefox freezes and is unresponsive (try to switch between tabs, for example) for several seconds during page loads from the ynet.co.il web site, for news articles from this site, probably due to pages with many user comments on the article . This is a major news site in Israel.

When opening multiple tabs of news articles from this site, and since the website refreshes the tabs automatically after some period of time, Firefox slows down and freezes a lot for several seconds.

This happens even when I use Adblock Plus to block all the flash ads on this page , so it probably is not related to flash 

Tested on an Intel Celeron 3.2Ghz machine with 2GB RAM, Windows 7, but I believe it is a problem with all platforms. 
The bug is both on Firefox 3.5 and on the trunk (Minefield)

Based on the URL from bug 401679 . I opened another bug since that bug summary was about 100% CPU usage, and the main problem here is not the(almost) 100% CPU, which might be expected since it is a long page with ~2000
comments, but the lack of application responsiveness for some seconds when the
page loads .


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open the URL . Block flash ads on the page using adblock plus to filter the flash ads performance influence .
2. Try to switch between tabs quickly during page load
3.
Actual Results:  
Firefox freezes and is unresponsive for several seconds during page load

Expected Results:  
firefox should be responsive and not freeze during page load
