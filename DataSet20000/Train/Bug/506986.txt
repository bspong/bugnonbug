(This bug was carved out from Bug 452183 - see for more info)

Currently, a <Ctrl+Shift+click> on a folder in the bookmark sidebar or toolbar replaces the current tab in the foreground and then inserts any remaining tabs before the next existing tab.  As per the discussion in Bug 452183 and Mike's recommendation, this should be changed to appending all the tabs in the background.  This would make it consistent with <Ctrl+Shift+click> on a single bookmark.  Also, as Mike said, "Ctrl+Click, whether or not shift is pressed, should never replace the current tab.  Modifier-click openings should append, like for single bookmarks" to which I concur.

Right now, the "Open All in Tabs" menuitem does the same thing as <Ctrl+Shift+click>, ie replace&insert in the fg, so they may be tied together.  If we change <Ctrl+Shift+click>, I'm not sure if the menuitem should also change or be split off to retain its current behavior.

Reproducible: Always
