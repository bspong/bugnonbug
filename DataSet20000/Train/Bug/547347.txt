FF 3.6 partial "freeze": "CGWindowContextCreate: failed to create software delegate"

Since updating to 3.6, I am seeing repeated partial "freezes". Symptoms include:
- clicks on icons in status bar ignored
- opening preferences does not display preference sheet but blocks further interaction as if the sheet was displayed
- system.log includes repeated error messages "Failed to create window context device" and "CGWindowContextCreate: failed to create software delegate" corresponding to failure to display sheet

It is usually possible to quit normally via the menu. If I haven't tried unsuccessfully to open preferences, I may be able to use toolbar buttons, switch web pages etc. as well so this is not a complete freeze.

The only way I've found of restoring normal function is to restart.

console.log shows many repeats of errors such as:
"2010-02-19 22:36:31.722 firefox-bin[6032] *** _NSAutoreleaseNoPool(): Object 0x23d22c0 of class NSIdEnumerator autoreleased with no pool in place - just leaking

..."
These do not correspond timewise to the partial freezes so perhaps they reflect a different problem but I'm not sure, so include them here in case.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. use FF 3.6
2. examine console.log as it fills with error message after error message
3. wait until clicks on status bar icons are ignored and/or preferences sheet fails to display although FF clearly "thinks" it has displayed (i.e. it waits for it to be dismissed even though this is impossible)
4. examine system.log for corresponding error messages regarding preferences sheet, if applicable
Actual Results:  
as described above

Expected Results:  
ff does not leak
preference sheet displays
clicks on status bar icons are not ignored
