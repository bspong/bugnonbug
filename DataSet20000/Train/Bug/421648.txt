Firefox thrashes hard drive, runs slow, and crashes.

When visiting the page: 

http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-mon_webtv_0225feb25,0,3154980.story

the hard drive thrashes like crazy, responses to keyboard or mouse slow down, and if my talking clock happens to decide to recite the time at that point, it pauses longer than usual between .wav the files that it uses to denote various parts of the time "statement".  I haven't had time to look at CPU activity, but it wouldn't surprise me if that's maxed out, too.  It's happened on several Chicago Tribune pages, and I was blaming the fact that the person who sent it to me sent it in the form of a page, and not the link.  But, it happens both ways.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Pull up the page.
2.Hit Ctrl+ a couple of times to make the text bigger.  (Not sure if this is necessary, but it's what I always do when the text is too small for me.  Blind as a slightly-gifted bat.)
3.Scroll down at a reading pace.  I usually use the cursor keys.

Actual Results:  
Firefox closes unexpectedly, not even a "gotta go poop" message.

Expected Results:  
It should've kept working!  :-)

Nothing special about my setup.  Plain-vanilla Windows, no theme, no wallpaper, just ordinary stuff.  No idea what module, etc.; I'm not a developer.
