Sliding tab animation causes UI to handle keystrokes differently

Ubuntu 8.04, package firefox 3.0~b5+nobinonly-0ubuntu3.

Once there's enough tabs in a window so opening a new tab causes the existing ones to *slide* left in an animation, FF3 is too busy doing that to handle my keystrokes in the same way as it would if there was no animation on-going.

With FF2 regardless of the number of tabs, and FF3 when there's so few tabs open that no scrolling occurs when opening a new one, I could quickly type <Ctrl-T>news<Tab> and have the URL field complete to http://news.bbc.co.uk/text_only.stm ready for hitting Return.  Now, after typing that, I find the <Tab> has moved the input focus from the URL field to the tab bar instead of completing the partially typed URL and the possible completions haven't yet appeared.  It seems the overhead of doing the animation, which isn't smooth but jerky if I type at the same time, means FF3 isn't doing the more important task of working on completing my URLs.

The animation is distracting and annoying.  I've a blocker for animated images but I'm not aware of an about:config option for turning off the animation and reverting to FF2's behaviour.  That would be a workaround for those of us that are suffering.

Perhaps connected is the fact that the list of URL completions, when they do appear as one types, appear to cause more X protocol overhead than the old widget that was just a simple drop-down of URLs, one per line.  This also causes poor typing feedback at times.

Reproducible: Always
