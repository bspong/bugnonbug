Firefox very unresponsive, hogs one CPU, core after some time, when using two monitors

After some time, or when opening certain websites in a Firefox window maximized (or even normal window) on the second monitor, Firefox initially starts to scroll very badly, with some delay and moving chunks of page at a time. 

Soon after, it becomes very slow to respond even to its own menus like View or Tools and during this time, in Task Manager I see firefox.exe using 25% CPU (out of 4 cores, so I assume it's one core used)
At some times, it's hard even to drag the windows on the second monitor to the first monitor, as half way the mouse loses control of the window. The only solution then is to use Ctrl+Alt+Del and kill the Firefox process.

I suspect it's something related to Javascript or with parsing CSS as when the scroll issue starts to appear, the error console is spammed with messages such as these:

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Can't say it happens all the time, as this only happens with some websites that open on the second monitor, others work just fine.
Therefore, I can't give suggestions to reproduce this.

I can only say that I see this happening often when opening techdirt.com on the second monitor, opening 3-4 articles in new tabs on the same monitor, scroll down each article to read it and some comments and then it starts to scroll badly.
Less often, it happens with Wikipedia or fark.com

Actual Results:  
Firefox slows down, not responsive (5-10 seconds to show menus), eventually has to be killed using Task Manager even though only one CPU (25%) seems to be used by it.

Expected Results:  
Well, it shouldn't happen.

This started to happen with the latest version or perhaps with the latest couple of versions... anyway, it's at best a 1-2 weeks old problem.
