firefox stops connecting shortly after launch, then when you exit process remains active

most of the time upon booting my computer, once the wireless is connected i start firefox, and the internet connection will work for the first 10-15 seconds. after this time firefox stops being able to connect to webpages (all open tabs, sometimes pages still havent completed loading). The internet connection is still alive for other applications, just not firefox. 

When i exit it seems to exit properly, asking if i want to save session etc. but once its closed if i try to launch it again it will say there is already a firefox running, and from the task manager i can see that firefox.exe is still running. when i kill this, i can then run firefox again, and the connection is fine. occasionally this will happen again after a while but 99% of the time it's only on the first launch after booting my computer.

8. run firefox. this will now work
9. browse the internet. this will now work fine.
