the probleme is ,many many times when i want to open a site in a new tab it give me that server not found like if the site i have opened doesn't exist ,but when i update the page it work !
example: when i want to connect to hotmail.com i wrote my login and my password and then i push "connexion" but it told me that it's not workin or server not found but when i push update the page it work and it can connect to my mail..
and i observe this in mozilla firefox 3 specially ,not in mozilla firefox 2 many many times,not only with hotmail.com but with many other sites

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.when i open specialy a new tab
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
server not found

Expected Results:  
it should give me the page of web site and not tell me server not found,so i downgrade my mozilla firefox to 2 edition to not have this problem,

i think that the browser doesn't take time to have a response from the web site wich we are looking for
