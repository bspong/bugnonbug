Steps to reproduce:

Two problems:
(1) Hover over any main story except the first on news.google.com (the first is already 'expanded'). In other browsers currently and in Firefox <= 28, you see a downward-pointing chevron (double arrow) at the upper right of the story's div, which when clicked inserts more links to other sites' coverage of the same story.
Hovering over the top story should show an upward-pointing chevron.
(2) Each section (World, Technology, Science, etc.) has a link at its bottom, "More World stories", "More Science stories", etc.) When clicked, it's supposed to insert more stories in the same category.


Actual results:

(1) The downward-pointing chevron doesn't appear at all. Similarly, the already expanded top story should have an upward-pointing chevron to collapse the story, but that doesn't appear either.
(2) Nothing happens at all when clicking a "More ___ stories" link.


Expected results:

(1) You should see a downward-pointing chevron (double arrow) at the upper right of the story's div, which when clicked inserts more links to other sites' coverage of the same story.
Hovering over the already expanded top story should show an upward-pointing chevron which collapses the story when clicked
(2) When clicked, a "More Xyz stories" link should insert more stories of category Xyz into the document immediately above that link.
