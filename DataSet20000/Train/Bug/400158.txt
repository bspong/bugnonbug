Testing for Shift-button press should be done at time of link click, not at time of processing new url

Holding down Shift while clicking a link open that link in a new window. However, it appears FF does not test for the Shit key at the moment of the link click, but at a point afterwards (while it's processing the new URL?). Sometimes my system slows down when running heavy tasks and if I happen to be pressing the Shift key a second (or couple seconds) after I had already clicked a link (w/o the Shift key), that link will open in a new window, since the test for the keypress was not done at the time of the actual click, but at a later point.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run heavy tasks which bog down the system somewhat
2. Click a link but hold the shift key a couple moments after clicking the link

Actual Results:  
If timed correctly, the link will open in a new window, despite the Shift key not being pressed at the time of the click.

Expected Results:  
Link should've opened in the same window.

Not easy to reproduce, but it's obvious the shift key is not tested for at time of click because this happens somewhat frequently to me (couple times a day).
