Text on some web sites cannot be selected/highlighted with mouse.

1.   On some web sites text cannot be selected / highlighted with mouse or keys, nor can text be copied to the clipboard this way.
	
1.1   An example of a "problem site" is:  http://blogs.itworldcanada.com/insights/2008/10/29/agpl/  

2.   All three versions of Firefox 3.0.4, 3.0.5 and 3.1 beta v3 are affected in an identical manner, no other versions tried.

3.   This problem affects only some web sites, by far the vast majority are ok and work normally (i.e.:  text can be selected).

4.   The problem is present on clean default installs (no plugins, extensions and add-ons except application's defaults)

5.   Makes no difference whether Java and/or JavaScript is selected or not.

6.   Whilst text cannot be selected the LINKS in the affected region work perfectly ok. 

7.   Makes no difference whether anti virus/spyware software and/or firewall are installed or not.
 
8.   In the example site, if I try to select text from the main body of the web page (news article) and I use CTRL-A--or from mouse right button 'Copy' or 'Select All'--then all text is copied to clipboard but only ads and menu items are highlighted.  It is NOT possible to select small sections of text (i.e.:  single words or sentences etc.) with the mouse.

NOTES:

(1)   Each test installation was preceded by a full uninstall--all old profiles, Mozilla directories, registry references were removed and new ones created each time (created new profiles with and without the profiles manager).

(2)   The Firefox "problem sites" are AOK in Internet Explorer 6.0 and Opera 9.6 (which exist simultaneously on the PC).  Small sections of text could be selected / highlighted normally with the mouse using these other browsers. 




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.In Firefox 3 go to this url:  http://blogs.itworldcanada.com/insights/2008/10/29/agpl/ 
2.  With mouse, try and highlight/select a small section of text from main news article -- it should have a problem. Then go to almost any other site and check that text can be selected.    
3.  If for some reason the fault is not reproducible on the reader's machine then Google with the following or similar terms: 'Firefox cannot select text with mouse' [not quoted] and you'll confirm that there are other instances of this problem, albeit uncommon.     
Actual Results:  
In Firefox 3, mouse will not select/highlight text on specified site whereas it will on other sites w/o any problems.  (There is something about certain sites/Web pages that causes a text selection problem in Firefox but these same pages work perfectly in Internet Explorer or Opera.)

Expected Results:  
One should be able to highlight / select text with a mouse.

Selecting text with the mouse in these 'faulty' pages should, in Firefox, be identical to that as in Internet Explorer and Opera.
