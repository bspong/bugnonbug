RentACoder urls become malformed

Upon attempting to log in to RentACoder, the browser gets redirected to http://www.rentacoder.com/RentACoder/authentication/Wc.asp?lngWId=1&amp;lngIdentId=14769893 where the &amp; should be just &. The same behavior can be experienced throughout the site (when posting comments for example), where the problem is simply that an entity is placed in the URL.
The issue cropped up some time in either 3 Beta 4 or Beta 5, and only effects Firefox 3.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit RentACoder
2. Attempt to log in with valid information.
Actual Results:  
After attempting to log in, the browser will be redirected to a malformed URL, which causes the page to display Warning: Invalid input paramater. Manually changing the URL will usually continue as normal.

Expected Results:  
The entity of the ampersand in the URL should be converted to an ampersand.

I'm in contact with a web developer from Exhedra Solutions (RentACoder's owner company), and he was aware of such a problem in Mobile versions of Internet Explorer as well. As the issue does not exist in older versions of Firefox or other web browsers, I don't believe it to be a "broken web site".
