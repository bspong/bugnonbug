Flash plugin not showing some flash content

Flash in 2.0.0.7 behaves differently from other versions of firefox and IE. 

A gallery flash site I've created shows thumbnails of images. When you press the "Lightbox" button it should start to count percentages of the loaded thumbs and when a thumb hits "100%" it should display it. Percentages work ok, but the thumbnail never shows. It's there because it's clickable, as it should be, but not shown. 

This problem is only with 2.0.0.7, I've tested with 2.0.0.6 and 2.0.0.4 and it works great. It works great in IE6 and 7 as well, it would be nice if someone could confirm that the plugins for IE and firefox are different. I've tested in both Windows Vista and Ubuntu Linux with the same result. Also I downloaded a nightly build and the error reproduces with that as well.

I don't know if this is a firefox bug, a firefox flash plugin bug och and Adobe bug. If it's posted here in error I apologize, and it would be great if someone then could point me in the right direction.

Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a firefox 2.0.0.7 browser
2. Go to www.bjarholm-olsson.se/synk/main.html
3. Click on "Lightbox" once or twice
4. Repeat with 2.0.0.6 or IE to see what it should look like
Actual Results:  
Thumbnails don't show

Expected Results:  
Shown thumbnails

This has been confirmed in other forums(see link to thread below) and seems only to apply to 2.0.0.7 and nightlies.
