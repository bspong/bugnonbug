Add-on bar icons do not stay where they are dropped when customizing.

Steps to reproduce:

Customize toolbars.
Reset toolbars.
Place in the addon bar anything (starting from the far right):
e.g.:
Firebug
  ["Close" "Spacer" "Firebug"]
S3Fox
  ["Close" "Spacer" "S3Fox" "Firebug"]


Actual results:

After dropping S3Fox to the left of Firebug, as indicated by the vertical bar, it is placed to the right of Firebug instead (on the far right). ["Close" "Spacer" "Firebug" "S3Fox"]

I then had to drag Firebug to the left of S3Fox, so that it would be moved by this bug to the right side, where I actually want it.

In fact, any icon placed directly to the right of the spacer is placed instead on the far right.

I also tried replacing the spacer - the same thing occurred, when placed next to the close icon, it was instead placed on the far right.

So, I could go on for days - it happens with everything I have tried.

But, the craziest part is: when the Customize Toolbar dialog is closed - they go to where I originally dropped them. WTF!


Expected results:

The icons should be placed where I drop them and where the vertical bar indicated it would be placed, before and after closing the customize dialog.
