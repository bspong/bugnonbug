Tested on several different machines, one w/ XP Pro and one w/ Vista from different physical locations.  When logged into igoogle, click into gmail from the standard included gmail gadget by clicking either "GMAIL" or "Inbox".  Once in gmail, attempt to click back once to go back one page but it will not take you back, rather it takes two clicks on the back button to go back one page to igoogle.  When clicking back once, firefox provides the green highlighted forward button as if you have gone back one page even though you haven't.  Easy to duplicate.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into google
2. Switch ti igoogle
3. Click on the "GMAIL" or "Inbox" link part of the gmail gadget to go into your gmail client
4. Try hitting the "Back" button 1 time, see if you go back to igoogle.

Actual Results:  
* Notice 2 clicks on back button takes you back 1 page*
* Notice 1 click provides option to go forward 1 page even though you have gone nowhere*

Expected Results:  
Should have gone back to igoogle page w/ 1 click like any other page
