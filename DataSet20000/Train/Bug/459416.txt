Quirk with Firefox 3.0.3.

If I open a website (e.g., Yahoo Games (http://get.games.yahoo.com/proddesc?gamekey=spsolitaireklondike) and then click the "Play Webgame" button, or Westlaw, (sorry - can't post a link for them) open a statute and click an embedded link to a related court decision) the new page does not appear; it "hides" in the lower right part of the screen as a thin white vertical line about 3 inches high and about as wide as a sewing needle; I must go to the Firefox menu bar, under Window, click Zoom, and then the new page will pop into view. So it seems if I'm using embedded links to access other pages associated with the parent site, the new page wants to hide down off the screen, as a thin white line way to the right of the trash on the dock.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to the Yahoo Games website http://get.games.yahoo.com/proddesc?gamekey=spsolitaireklondike) and then click "Play Webgame"
2.No window appears; a thin white line appears at bottom right of screen.
3. Go to Window > Zoom and the page that should have opened up pops open from the thin white line.
Actual Results:  
As described above.

Expected Results:  
I expect a new page to open automatically and not need to go to the Zoom menu.

This only started after the 3.0.3 update. It happens on different machines.
