This may be related to the infrastructure of new zoom feature: 

I use babylon pro as my dictionary and it captures the word to be translated when i press ctrl+rightclick on the word. This feature works in everywhere (IE, notepad, word, most of pdf files) and used to work in older versions (2.x) of firefox. 

When a word is ctrl+rightclicked sometimes the next word or a nonsense character like double quotes (") / single quote (') is captured.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Obtain a babylon-pro trial and install. 
2. Open a web page with firefox 
3. ctrl+rightclick on some words to translate and see the word is not captured.  
4. Try the same with firefox 2.x or IE and see the word is captured correctly.  
Actual Results:  
sometimes the next word or a nonsense character like double quotes (") / single quote (') is captured.  

Expected Results:  
ctrl+rightclicked word should be captured.
