When scrolling the page http://home.houston.rr.com/verrett/gh/contact.htm with
the mousewheel, the page scrolls extremely slowly compared with IE 6. I rebooted
my computer, but got the same result. Although I have 396 meg of memory
installed, so it shouldn't matter, Windows 2K reports that Firefox is using
about 18K of memory when IE 6 uses about 6K for displaying the same page. Could
indicate a rendering problem with the page that is sucking up resources.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open page http://home.houston.rr.com/verrett/gh/contact.htm
2. Try to scroll the page with the mousewheel (Logitech MX 300 in my case)
3. Notice how SLOWLY and jerkily the scrolling occurs.

Actual Results:  
Scrolling is extremely slow.

Expected Results:  
Smooth, quick scrolling ("Use smooth scrolling" is turned on in "Tools"
"Options" "Advanced")

As I said earlier, when displaying the page
(http://home.houston.rr.com/verrett/gh/contact.htm) Firefox uses much more
memory than IE 6.
