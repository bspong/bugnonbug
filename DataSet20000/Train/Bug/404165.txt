This is a REALLY big problem you guys need to fix ASAP.  If Flash is published windowless then key inputs do not work correctly without an extentsive work around.

Can you atleast have your Mac Firefox and Windows Firefox be somewhat the same.  I have ran into MANY problems where you do things far differently between Mac and Windows.  Get your stuff together and man up guys.  I thought you guys were good at what you do, but I guess not.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

1.Program Key.isDown to move object 
2.Publish Flash SWF with HTML settings set at windowless
3.See that your program doesnt work
4.Get off your butt and fix it


Actual Results:  
Result: Increase in users for your program.  People start liking you a little more, especially if you make it so you dont have to type moz... crap for your opacity settings in HTML.  What type of retard sets up a browser like when there is already a set way to program it.

Expected Results:  
I got really pissed off because it is a simple problem you have working right on the Mac side but not the PC side.  So you makes you guys look retarded when I respected you.

You guys should be doing your job right the first time around.
