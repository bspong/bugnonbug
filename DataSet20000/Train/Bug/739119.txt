Audio Player freezes - works in Chrome & Safari
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:11.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/11.0
Build ID: 20120312181643

Steps to reproduce:

I'm using a DHTML window widget ( http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex8/dhtmlwindow/index.htm ) with LeanBack Player in the iframe (http://leanbackplayer.com/player_documentation.html )

Every latest browser I try seems to give me a different result. Chrome doesn't allow me to close the window but the player works great. In Firefox, the player just freezes but the window will close. In IE, the player doesn't appear. In Opera, the player gets stuck. Safari behaves like Chrome, the audio player works great but you can't close the window. In all browsers, you can't play the player twice in a row without refreshing the screen. Can anybody help me out here ? The test site is http://www.universalfather.info/Test Doc.htm or http://www.universalfather.info/Test%20Doc.htm#. Any help would be welcome and appreciated. The Zip file of all relevant files can be downloaded at the site for your inspection. I'm working on this site, without pay, in my spare time, tearing my hair out, hoping God will reward me in heaven and give me my hair back.
