Java 1.7.0.11 plug-in incorrectly blocked
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:18.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/18.0
Build ID: 20130117041235

Steps to reproduce:

Installed Java 1.7u11, made a link to libnpjp2.so
($ ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/jre1.7.0_11/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so ~/.mozilla/plugins/), start Firefox (18.0.1, on my sister's Ubuntu 12.04 machine, from the 'stock' repositories), go to a game site that needs the plugin.




Actual results:

Site claims Java is not installed. Look in Add-Ons, and it says the plugin has been blocked. The plugin is green on https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/plugincheck/ (says it's up to date). https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/blocked/p184 says it was blocked October 30, 2012, however, 1.7u11 was not released until 01/12/2013 - why are versions being pre-emptively blocked?

In https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=829111#c41 it says to file reports of 1.7u11 being blocked separately, so here's my complaint.  :-)



Expected results:

It should have worked without having to jump through any hoops, since it was blocked over 2 months before it was released, ergo not even a negative-60-day exploit was invented yet. 

Please unblock the Java 1.7.0.11 plug-in.

Thanks.
