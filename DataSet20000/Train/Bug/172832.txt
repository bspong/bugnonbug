Home button should be visible by default
I've given up this in Mozilla, but not in Phoenix. We have the button already,
now let's make it visible by default! It should be the fifth button:

[Back] [Forward] [Reload] [Stop] [HOME]

mpt: “There isn’t a “Home” button on the toolbar [in Mozilla], for quickly
returning the browser to our home page when a customer has finished. Indeed,
it’s not even an option (not that the existence of an option would be an excuse
for the poor default).”

mpt: “The [lack of a Home button in Mozilla] is especially astounding, since
it’s a deliberate design decision by Netscape, so it’s not likely to change
soon. Currently there is an optional “Home” link on the “Personal Toolbar”
(Mozilla’s stupid name for the bookmarks bar). But that would be a waste of both
time and space, since it would be a smaller target than a toolbar button, on a
bar which we weren’t using for anything else.”

Mike Palumbo: “Every other browser, including every other Netscape browser, had
home in the main toolbar. So does Chimera, Opera, IE, iCab, Galeon, K-Meleon,
Konqueror, etc. Mozilla is the only one I can think of that doesn’t.”

Chad Lundgren: “I considered using Netscape 6 when it came out. The deal-breaker
for me was the home button, or, to be more precise, the tiny, misplaced thing
they shriveled it into.”
