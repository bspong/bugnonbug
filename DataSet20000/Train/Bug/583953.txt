Just about any website that involves timed waits before downloading something does not retrieve and download the file properly
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; Windows NT 6.0; rv:2.0b3pre) Gecko/20100801 Minefield/4.0b3pre ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0E)

Whenever I try to download something from sites like:
http://depositfiles.com/en/
http://oron.com/
http://www.megaupload.com/
http://www.rapidshare.com/
the download script after the countdown is mishandled in some way.
If I click download, the file seems to be downloaded in a mere second, despite its sometimes large size. When checked, the file is completely corrupted as it ends up being merely a few bytes/KB instead of the MB that it should be. I can boot the same things into other browsers and it will work, showing no fault on the website's part.

There is an exception I've seen so far. MediaFire (http://www.mediafire.com/) is immune to this problem. I have no problems downloading files normally from there.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find something to download via the malfunctioning websites listed.
2. Wait through the countdown until the download link appears.
3. Click on the download link when it appears.
Actual Results:  
After specifically finding a Ubuntu beta download hosted on rapidshare I waited for the countdown to finish and then clicked on the download link. The file appeared to be downloaded in less than a second, the file was several MB in size. The file was corrupted.

Expected Results:  
When the download link appeared and I clicked on it, the file should have begun downloading fully instead of this odd phenomenon. It would have taken atleast 30 seconds even with a fast connection because sites like rapidshare, megaupload, etc. limit download rates for free users.
