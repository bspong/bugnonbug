On the URL given above or any of the pages that branch off here and also provide a link to the BBC iPlayer, this player, which opens in a separate window and plays radio streams, frequently causes Firefox to hang and freeze. This does not happen at a predictable point when playing the stream, but it happens almost every time I use it at some point, and it happens only with this site and application. Usually it says it is buffering data from the stream, but it does so indefinitely, and when I close the small player window, the main browser freezes and has to be killed and restarted.
This problem is rather new, it appeared since the upgrade to Firefox 3.6.7 or 3.6.8, if I recall correctly.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
Normally, the iPlayer should continue playing after some time of buffering, when buffering happened to be necessary at all. At least, one should be able to kill the small iPlayer window and restart it without having the entire browser freeze.
