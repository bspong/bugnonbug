when one chooses his own colors, several web pages become unreadable

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load "options" from "tools" menu (in firefox's menus bar)
2. in the "Option" windows choose "content" and click "colors" button in the "fonts & colors" box
3.  in the colors windows
uncheck the "Use system colors" box
uncheck "Allow pages to choose theur own colors, instead of my selections above"
click "OK" button
4.  click "OK" button in the "Options" window 

5. load a document of yours from docs.google.com (if you don't have one, go to docs.google.com, sign up, sign in an and create a new one).
assuming that now you are in the document's editor
6. fill with several characters 5 or 6 lines




Actual Results:  
1) the buttons of button bar don't appear (i.e., the background's color of buttons is the same of the foreground color)

2) if you click on "file" menu, you get a menu with a transparent background, and characters appear superimposed

Expected Results:  
1) of course, the buttons in the button bar should appear, their backgroud shouldn't have the same color of their foreground!

2) of course, characters shouldn't appear superimposed, background of file menu souldn't be transparent!

in hte last menu below, i'm gonna choose "normal" severity , it's not a cosmetic problem: several people (especially using old CRT monitors) can't stand for long time white backgrounds, thus a working options for colors becomes very important for productivity
