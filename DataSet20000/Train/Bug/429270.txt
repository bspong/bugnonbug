PDFs won't load if I try to open them in a new tab or select "bypass PDF download" using PDF Download add-on

This is similar to Bug 419345.  Upon attempting to open a PDF in the same tab, a new tab, or selecting "bypass PDF download" using the PDF Download add-on, Firefox will hang and whitescreen for 30 seconds to a minute.  It is doing some sort of processing as it's using as close to 100% CPU as it possibly can during this time.  After this, the tab you are in (or the newly opened tab in the case of opening a new tab) displays a blank page with the URL of the desired PDF.  In addition, if Adobe Acrobat was not already opened, it does open, displaying a document-less interface.

Right-clicking and saving to my computer bypasses this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. (potentially unnecessary?) Download and install PDF Download add-on
2. Click (or right-click) link with PDF
3. Choose "Open PDF" or "Bypass PDF Download" (or select "Open Link in New Tab")
Actual Results:  
Firefox hangs for about 30 seconds to a minute and whitescreens.  It uses as close to 100% CPU as possible during this time.  Eventually the relevant window displays a blank page with the target URL in the address bar and if Adobe Acrobat was not already opened, that opens with a document-less interface.

Expected Results:  
If selecting "Open PDF"- should have attempted to save the PDF locally.
If selecting "Open Link in New Tab"- should have opened a blank tab and attempted to save the PDF locally.
If selecting "Bypass PDF Download"- should have opened the PDF in the same tab. 

As I've mentioned, I use PDF Download but I doubt that's the issue as the problem occurred without using that program.
