Opening an online newspaper like CNN or USATODAY will eventually cause Firefox 3.5.5 to freeze up (become non-responsive). A CNTRL-ALT-DEL is required so the Firefox application can be "killed". It can then re re-started an used until the freeze occurs again, usually after a couple more articles are viewed in the newspaper. Very frustrating and irritating. Every few pages I must kill the Firefox application and restart it. Makes trying to surf on the web a very un-enjoyable experience.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open CNN or USATODAY.
2.Open some of their articles in other windows and scroll through them.
3.After a couple are open the browser (Firefox) freezes and must be killed, then restarted. Not how I expected this browser to perform.
Actual Results:  
Open USATODAY or CNN. Read (or attempt to read) some of the articles in separate windows. Browser then freezes and must be killed... all windows die (a bad design, Google Chrome took a superior methodology, please implement same in Firefox).

Expected Results:  
Pretty obvious.
Open USATODAY or CNN.
Open articles in other windows.
Read other articles.
Close other windows after reading of article is complete.
Continue process by opening another article to be read in another window and so forth.
