Update to 3.0 added unwanted bookmarks to Bookmarks Toolbar.

I was EXTREMELY surprised to start up Firefox 3 after the upgrade and find
4 new bookmarks in the Bookmarks toolbar that I did not put there.

All 4 go to netscape.com
 
I deleted the first two before thinking to open a bug.

Is this some funky import from a long-dead install of Netscape or Firefox?
Or is someone getting cute and deciding that I need to get advertisements
from AOL shoved in my face after having taken the new version of Firefox.

If it is the former, how can I help figure out where the bookmarks
came from?

If it is the latter PLEASE understand that doing that sort of thing is
COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!
