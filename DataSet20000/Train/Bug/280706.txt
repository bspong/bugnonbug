All text fields refuse input after Javascript alert raised when browser window doesn't have focus
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

If a Javascript alert is raised by the onchange event of a text field when the
browser window doesn't have focus, all text input fields in Firefox (including
the address bar) refuse to accept input. See the attached testcase for a
demonstration. 

This may or may not be related to bug 269207, although that bug seems to occur
under different circumstances.

Workaround: After triggering the bug, switch to another window and then back to
Firefox again. Text input controls now behave normally until the bug is
triggered again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type some text in a text field with an onchange event that raises a
Javascript alert.
2. Switch focus to another (non-Firefox) application window.
3. Switch back to Firefox, dismiss the alert, and attempt to type in any text
input control.

Actual Results:  
Unable to type in any text input control.

Expected Results:  
All text input controls that previously allowed input should have continued
allowing input.
