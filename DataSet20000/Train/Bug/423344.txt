sometimes firefox will freeze so I have to kill it and restart.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.5; Linux) KHTML/3.5.9 (like Gecko)
Build Identifier: firefox-2.0.0.12-1.fc7

I do not have any specific URL that will repeat the freeze.
Usually I have anywhere from 4 to 6 firefox windows open, 
and usually each window with at least 4 tabs.
Then I will click on some url and select to have it opened
in a new tab. And firefox will freeze. Content of those url's
can flash (which I have and is running - in fact i had already
opened a flash url which was playing music when it froze this time),
or any content which requires a handler, or even if it is just plain
html but the site is too slugish.

Some sites (which I have not saved) I can make it happen at will,
even with just one window and one tab.

Question I have is what do I need to do from a terminal
window to force firefox to dump core so That I can send it
the next time it happens? 
In the past I have tried to send it signal 11
which is supposed to force a core dump, but I could not find
a coredump anywhere.

I usually start firefox from an icon on the desktop. The icon launches
/usr/lib/firefox-2.0.0.12/firefox
