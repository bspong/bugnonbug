When starting Firefox and a session is restored, sometimes a few tabs aren't reloaded correctly.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a few windows  and a few tabs in them. Some should display file: URLs
2. make sure "When Firefox starts: Show my windows and tabs from last time" option is selected
3. exit Firefox (and confirm the dialogs; why is a separate one for each window? I know, this is already reported. And worked on, I hope.)
4. Start Windows
5. enter and OK all the dialogs that pop up (master password, page HTTP auth passwd etc... I have a few of this. Including duplicates; yep that is also already reported)
Actual Results:  
Some tabs that had file URL (to HTML documents) are not reloaded.
The page is empty. The address/URL bar is empty.
The BACK button history shows entries that are correct (other file: URLs). But if click them, again a blank page is displayed. But if I middle click them, the correct page is correctly loaded in a new tab.

Expected Results:  
tabs reopened correctly.

I also noticed, that if the problem tab is first in a window and therefore visible at start, the history ("back") button is empty (grayed out). If switch to another tab and back, the BACK button suddenly has the entries. (the page itself is still blank).
