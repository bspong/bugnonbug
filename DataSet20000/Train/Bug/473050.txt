Firefox causes CPU overload EVERYTIME a new page is being loaded
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; pt-BR; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008121622 Ubuntu/8.10 (intrepid) Firefox/3.0.5

As far as I can tell, this bug is old. It still exists though.
Using Ubuntu 8.10 32-bit running Firefox 3.0.5 and I've experienced the same issue everytime..all I can say is after Firefox is started, I can open up as many pages as I want and the problem happens from time to time. Everytime a new page is loaded, Firefox eats up to 100% of my processor power. I can say it's Firefox for SURE because everytime FF3 connects to a new site and starts loading it, the processor goes to 100% usage. I still don't know what triggers this weird behavior. Important note: no matter if the page being loaded is flash-based, even a .html page makes firefox to burn my machine. Once this problem gets started, it will be the same thing until I close Firefox. In the most critical scenario, Firefox starts loading a page, stops responding and don't get closed, burning my processor and forcing me to lose data! I wish I could help you with some more specific details (like details about FF's behavior or technical data), but I don't know how to watch Firefox through the terminal. Is there a workaround on this bug?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start your Firefox
2.Open up some pages until app.68 minutes
3.Watch Firefox burning your processor everytime it starts loading a web page.
Actual Results:  
My processor got burned after running Firefox.

Expected Results:  
FF3 should let me keep surfing without worring about my fav. browser's issues! Hell I'm on vacation!

This is the Ubuntu's default theme, so it's Firefox's default theme, since it imports the OS theme..there is no significant change here, all I do is SURF on the web..
