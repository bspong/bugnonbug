There's a problem in how Firefox 3 handles visited links on forums using the german PXMBoard software. After approximately three days, Firefox "forgets" all previously visited threads and replies and colors them as unread. Only threads/replies visited within the last approx. 72 hours stay colored as visited. This didn't happen in FF2 and has been reported by lots of users browsing those forums using FF3. As far as I'm aware, this only seems to happen on boards using that specific forum software. No guarantees on that, though.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Browse any of these sites

http://www.maniac-forum.de/forum/pxmboard.php?mode=board&brdid=1

http://www.pcx-forum.de/pxmboard.php?mode=board&brdid=1

http://pp-forum.p44.net/pxmboard.php?mode=board&brdid=3

They're all using the same software.

1. Visit any thread(s) and reply/ies, they will instantly be colored as visited.
2. Wait for approx. three days.
3. Visited links will be colored as not visited.
Actual Results:  
Visited colors forgotten after approx. three days.

Expected Results:  
Read links should still be colored as visited.

No additional info. It's still reproducible using the latest nightly version of Minefield on a newly created profile. Vista and Windows XP. (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1a1pre) Gecko/2008070903 Minefield/3.1a1pre ID:2008070903)
