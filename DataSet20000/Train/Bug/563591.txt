When focused on the tab bar and using the left and right arrow keys to switch between tabs, a focus event is incorrectly fired on the document before the focus event for the newly active tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open two tabs.
 ensuring that the document itself is focused in each; i.e. not a focusable descendant such as a link.
2. Move focus to the tab bar.
3. Select the first tab.
4. Press rightArrow.
Actual: A focus event is fired on the second document before the focus event for the second tab is fired.
Expected: Only the focus event on the tab should be fired.
5. Press leftArrow.
Actual: A focus event is fired on the first document before the focus event for the first tab is fired.
Expected: Only the focus event on the tab should be fired.



This causes annoying reading of document content in NVDA when the user is only interested in hearing the information about the currently focused tab.
