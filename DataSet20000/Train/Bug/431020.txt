surfing web through 3rd party chinese program. Works on ff2.0, doesnt on 3.0

Im not sure if this is a Java issue or whether other of these types of programs are affected, but I use a chinese tool called "dimsum" to view chinese character websites. The program seems to use some type of proxy deal to send the internet through my local port 4445, but in ff3.0 it is just blank - no error, just wont display anything. It works just fine in ff2.0. Im not sure if this problem is limited to MacOSX, but have also heard rumors that a similar problem has happened to people running vista.
Great work and thanks in advance!

Reproducible: Always

6. seems to be sending thu port 4445, but the page is just blank
7. weep in frustration
