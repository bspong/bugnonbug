I opened YouTube in Firefox. Searched for videos. Selected a video and opened it in a New Tab. Video was playing but not downloaded completely (was still buffering). Then I closed the Tab in which video was playing. Now I had only One Tab Opened. The Search Results. But The FireFox Kept on downloading (I checked it through Windows Task Manager Networking Tab).

Then I Closed the FireFox completely. And Downloading was stopped.
