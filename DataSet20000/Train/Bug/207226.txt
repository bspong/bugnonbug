DDE: strange behaviour with new "mozilla firebird" registry entries
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030522 Mozilla Firebird/0.6

Since (I believe) about 10 days ago, I have been getting crashes in Eudora when
launching an http link from a message.  In addition to Eudora generating an
exception error, Firebird would open with 2 windows.  One would have the
requested content, the other would be blank, and would not respond to entries in
the URL bar or to bookmark selection.
I did some playing around and seem to have fixed the problem.  The registry key
for the protocol's DDE application name
(HKCR\http\shell\open\ddeexec\application) has been changed to "Mozilla
Firebird."  I changed this back to "Phoenix" and all seems well now.  I'm
thinking the problem is with the space in the application name.
This wasn't crashing consistently before, so I am going to run for a day or so
with the "Phoenix" entry to see if it has fixed the problem (I'm sure
"MozillaFirebird" or "Mozilla_Firebird" would work just as well, but I assume it
was Phoenix and had been changed last week.)

Marking this as critical, although Firebird doesn't crash, Eudora does!

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.launch link from Eudora

Actual Results:  
crash Eudora

Expected Results:  
leave Eudora alone!
