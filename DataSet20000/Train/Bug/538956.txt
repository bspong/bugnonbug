While downloading a file via rapidshare or megashare etc. if the file is of 200mb
and downloading speed is slow(20kb/s) and the connection is lost for few minutes
or is disconnected thyen the downloading should pause or an error must be shown or
must wait or reconnection(as in IE) but infact it is shown that file is completly 
downloaded of 200mb and not even of the amount it has been when disconnected
this cause many times problems as we cannot get it wheather the file is downloaded completly or not..
Its the problem even in latest Mozilla 5.0 So hope its eliminated in the next version.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.make any download start typically more than 100mb
2.make short time disconnection before download is complete
3.it will show the result
Actual Results:  
it shows the file is completely downloaded with no error message

Expected Results:  
It should show an error message or it must pause the downloading process or must wait till reconnection occurs...

as it does not do it well all we downloaded is in vain....
we pay high value to service provider for dowloading files
