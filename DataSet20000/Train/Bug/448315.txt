Firefox menus only partially disappear when FF3 is skinned using windowblinds 6.2

When skinned with windowblinds 6.2 (latest version), Firefox 3 menus display, but then when you get out of a Firefox 3 menu, only the portion of the menu over the "window" disappears.  The portion of the menu over toolbars, headers, etc remains and you can't get rid of it.  The only workaround is to exclude Firefox 3 from skinning by windowblinds, but then Firefox 3 appears in "classic" windows interface.  Windowblinds 6 works fine with Firefox 2. This seems to be a different bug from earlier bugs reported where the FF3 menus don't display at all, or are blank.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Load Windowblinds 6.2 (latest version)
2.  Load Firefox 3 
3.  Click on a menu, than click on another portion of the screen so that menu disappears. 
Actual Results:  
Firefox menu disappears only over "window" portion of the screen, remains over toolbars, headers, and other upper elements.

Expected Results:  
the entire menu is supposed to disappear.
