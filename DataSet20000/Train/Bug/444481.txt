right-click on an <a> customized element brings up two context menus only the first time, then the customized context menu from then on.

On one of my web pages, I use javascript to pop up a context menu box when the right-mouse button is clicked on a link. It works fine in Firefox 2.

After I upgraded to Firefox 3.0, I found out that when I right-mouse click on the same link, it will pop up my context menu as well as the default browser context menu. I have already used the following code to suppress the default context menu, and as I mentioned before, it worked fine in Firefox 2:

evt.stopPropagation();
evt.preventDefault();

However, this only happens when I turn on PC, run Firefox 3, navigate to my web page. After the first mis-cue, everything works just like it did in Firefox 2. Even if I close my web page or even Firefox 3, go back to the same page, the right-mouse click works fine. It only happens whenever I re-start my PC.

The browser's default link context menu shows up, with my own customized context menu together, only for the FIRST TIME after I a) power up the PC, 2) start Firefox 3, 3) go to my web page and 4) right-mouse click on the link.

After that first time, whenever I right click on the same link, or other similar links, only my context menu pops up. (This is what I want.)

Even if I close my page, or close down Firefox 3, then run Firefox 3 again, I cannot duplicate the bug anymore.

If I turn off the PC, then restart it, run Firefox 3, go to my web page with the links, then right click on one of them, two context menus pop up.
