Inconsistent "new tab" behaviour

Selecting from the context menu "Open in a new tab" on a bookmark URI produces a different behaviour than performing the same action on a URI in a web page.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. For any bookmark, right mouse click and select "Open in a New Tab"
2. For any web page link, perform the same action

Note: Difference between browser response to same actions

3. Options->Tabs->"When I open a new link..." preference does not alter behaviour
Actual Results:  
When "right-clicking" and selecting a bookmark to open in a new tab, a new tab is correctly created but the browser focus is then shifted to the new tab. The value of the preference "When I open a new link..." [options->tabs] has no effect on the behaviour.


Expected Results:  
Performing the same action on a URI in a web page produces the 'expected' behaviour of opening the new tab in the background without shifting the current focused tab.


Attempted remedy...
Had "When I open a new link.." option OFF.
Turned option on and restarted Firefox - no changes to behaviour
Turned option off and restarted Firefox - no changes to behaviour
