Firefox is stuck "transferring data from" and the page never loads
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; WOW64; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506; Media Center PC 5.0; .NET CLR 3.5.21022)

After maybe 10 min, firefox will be unable to load web pages as it is stuck 'transferring data from' in its status. It's as if domain lookup has failed, or it is not recieving any data. Internet explorer does not have these problems, so I do not believe it is caused by anything external to firefox ( broken DNS, lost network connection, etc ). Quit and restart Firefox and it's good for a bit longer, tnen the problems present again.  Yahoo mail seems to be good for replicating this problem ( although it is a frequently accessed site, so that may be coincidental ) 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log into a yahoo mail account
2.Read mail, send mail, and stay logged in for 10-15 min.
3.Eventually Firefox looses the ability to contact other sites.
Actual Results:  
If sending mail, Yahoo reports a timeout message and says it will keep trying to send the email ( so maybe existing connections are not affected - as data just came back , but it looses the ability to create new ones ? ) Subsequently no other websites can be looked up and loaded.

Expected Results:  
Should have sent mail and loaded the page.

I'd classify it as a critical bug as it's flakiness has forced me to use internet explorer, which sucks.
