image caching uses incorrect expiry time

The www.openstreetmap.org site serves map image tiles from the tile.openstreetmap.org server. These tiles are updated dynamically and if you browse a tile which is old then the backend code returns a tile with a 30 minutes expiry time which gives the servers some time to re-render the tile.

It seems that FF is not caching these tiles with 30 minute expiry. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse map at http://www.openstreetmap.org in Minefield
2. Zoom in to street level in some area of the map
3. View page info and look through images in media. 
Actual Results:  
Some of the tile images are listed as 'not cached'.

Expected Results:  
Every tile should get cached for at least 30 minutes.

It appears that maybe the browser is confused because of DST which means that the declared expiry time is < clock time in UK BST. An example tile retrieved from the server:-

$ wget -O /dev/null -S http://b.tile.openstreetmap.org/15/16218/10769.png

           => `/dev/null'

[ Note: the specific URL above may well return other expiry times since it will get rendered at some point and then will get a 3 day expiry time set. ]

Above the local wall time is 19:45 BST (Europe/London which is currently UTC+01:00 due to daylight saving) The server declares the tile to be served at 18:45 GMT with expiry at 19:15 GMT. The browsers seems to treat this as uncacheable.

If I tweak the backend server code to pass back +90 minutes as the expiry then it gets cached OK. It looks like the browser is ignoring the timezone in the response date/time. Alternatively maybe the browser thinks GMT is the same as BST when daylight saving is in effect, but this is not true, GMT is effectively the same as UTC even during daylight saving.
