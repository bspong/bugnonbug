enter in location bar (URL bar) for bookmark keyword immediately followed by opening new tab sometimes loads url in new tab instead of old, particularly under high load

load simulator

I've been seeing this bug for about six months, I think, but I realized I never actually filed it.  (I think I kept thinking I'd find better steps to reproduce or a reliable regression range.  I just came up with better steps to reproduce, but I haven't yet bothered with the regression range.)  But I see it in my real browsing at least a few times a week, and it's mildly annoying.

Steps to reproduce (real world):
 1. have a Firefox session with a lot of tabs open, some of which are running a bit of javascript and which thus sometimes pauses
 2. open a new tab
 3. type something in the URL bar that involves a bookmark keyword, hit enter, and *immediately* press Ctrl+T to open a new tab

Actual results: the thing typed in the URL bar frequently opens in the new tab instead of the old one

Expected results: it should open in the tab whose URL bar it was typed in

Steps to reproduce (simulated, starting from a clean firefox profile):
 1. bookmark this page
 2. edit the bookmark to replace the name with "bug", replace the bug number in the URL with %s, and add the keyword "bug"
 3. load the attached load simulator in a tab
 4. open a new tab with Ctrl+T
 5. wait for this new tab to fully load an the caret to appear in the location bar [if you don't do this, the symptoms are different but also buggy!]
 6. type "bug 4000" and quickly press Enter and then Ctrl+T (the Enter and Ctrl+T have to be within the same tick of the 2s timer in the load simulator)

Actual results: bug 4000 is loaded in the new (current) tab

Expected results: bug 4000 is loaded in the previously-current tab, and the current tab is blank

I'm seeing this in a 64-bit Linux debug build, and have been for (very) approximately six months.
