FF displays additional Services & Features cost $2.99 per month but IE does not.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: 1.0.6 as well as 1.0.4

When I login to my account through Cingular wireless web site 
(www.cingular.com) to upgrade phone, the shopping cart automatically adds a 
undesired "FastForward Unlimited Call Forwarding" feature which costs $2.99 
per month along with the phone chosen.  There was no way to removal the 
feature.  If customer simply checks out, the additional payment request will 
appear on next month's bill.
Cingular customer service on phone traced the same procedure after logging in 
to my account and reported as no problem.  He used IE instead of FF.
Then, I have verified the fact using IE and FF.  FF 1.0.6 as well as 1.0.4 
exhibited the undesired "FastForward Unlimited Call Forwarding" feature.
Cingular homepage programmers may know the functional hole existing on FireFox.
The display difference was copied as Microsoft Word document which can be 
distributed.

5.Click No Optional Accessories.
6.Shopping Cart is displayed wrongly.

Actual Results:  
Undesired "FastForward Unlimited Call Forwarding" feature which costs $2.99 
per month is displayed along with the correct phone chosen.

Expected Results:  
Undesired "FastForward Unlimited Call Forwarding" feature should not be 
displayed.

IE works well but FF has problem sustained.
FF users will go away from FF due to such functional hole.
