Running universal x86_64/i386 binary on Leopard via command line picks the wrong arch and crashes with "dyld: unknown required load command 0x80000022 Trace/BPT trap"
Running universal x86_64/i386 binary on Leopard via command line picks the wrong arch and crashes with "dyld: unknown required load command 0x80000022 Trace/BPT trap", e.g.

$ /Applications/Minefield.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin -no-remote -P
dyld: unknown required load command 0x80000022
Trace/BPT trap
The workaround is to run the command line via "arch -i386 <command>":

$ arch -i386 /Applications/Minefield.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin -no-remote -P

I googled a bit and it seems others have encountered this problem, but the solutions are all not very good - using 10.5 SDK for the 64 bit build or having a wrapper re-launch with the correct arch:

Running Firefox from command line is recommended in many places, so if there's anything I missed, it would be great to make this case just work:

If not, I think this deserves a relnote.

Note that this also affects at least the jetpack launcher (cfx run) and likely many other launchers that end up running firefox-bin from the command line.
