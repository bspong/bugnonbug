if I have say 4 tabs open to websites and no blank tabs open in vista sp1 or xp sp3, different hardware same version firefox (3.0.4) and I press ctrl+t from keyboard, nothing happens.  I have to go to the file menu and select the new tab option.  then ctrl+t works fine unless I close all the empty tabs.  when I close the empty tabs and press ctrl+t again, nothing happens.  so now I set my homepages to include an empty tab so that I am always able to open a new tab with the ctrl+t shortcut instead of having to use the file new tab menu option.  the only thing I recall changing recently is that I had set my start options to 'show my windows and tabs from the last time'

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open firefox to default homepages
2. close empty/blank tabs
Actual Results:  
1. press ctrl+t nothing happens
2. file->new tab, then press ctrl+t and new tabs open

Expected Results:  
well it used to be as long as firefox had focus if I pressed ctrl+t a blank tab would open.  it works in ie7 so I've been using ie but I hate it so would like to see firefox working or to know what option I need to set for it to work normally

thank you for your time, I LOVE Firefox!!
