Clicking on image map area with href takes 10-90 seconds to respond
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

Once every three or four or five clicks on an image map Firefox will use 100% of
the processing time and hang for 10-90 seconds (30-50 seconds most common). We
have tried this on multiple Windows boxes, using Firefox 1.0.2 and 1.0.4 with
the same result. We have tried on Mac and Linux versions of Firefox and it works. 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use html provided
2. Fix image tag to point to valid image (works if image is broken)
3. The image map has five areas, click on each area

Actual Results:  
Sometimes after clicking on the first area, but almost always after clicking on
the thrid or fourth area, there will be a 30-50 second delay before the alert
box is shown. Firefox is taking 100% of the processor time.

Expected Results:  
I expect the alert box to popup immediately when each area is clicked.

The html is below. KEY: you must have an image, any image (we used both png and
jpeg); if the image is broken then it works. The href must have something in it.
We found the same problem with javascript (both the alert in the example and
void(0)) and with href="#" (you need to move the cursor off the area, the mouse
pointer remains a hand for several seconds then changes to a pointer).

This is a critical problem for us. If you need help duplicating the problem
please let me know.
