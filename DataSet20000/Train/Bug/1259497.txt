Site save directory info (content-prefs.sqlite) should NOT be synchronized to other machines

Steps to reproduce:

Currently, the settings about where to save files for each site will be saved into the file "content-prefs.sqlite" in profile folder and this file WILL be synchronized.

It makes no sense since user may have totally different folder structures on different machines. 

For example, I once used "save image as" function on certain site on my desktop computer to, say, "desktop" folder.

Now when I go to my second computer, my laptop, and do the same thing on that site (trying to save an image), the default folder for "save as.." dialog would be that path. However, obviously I don't or cannot visit that folder any more because the user name on two computers are not the same.

Before I thought it's about settings of "browser.download.dir", "browser.open.lastDir" or  "browser.download.lastDir" and opened an invalid ticket (bug 1244806). 

But today I encountered this bug again on my laptop, and after some investigating I found the real culprit is that content-prefs.sqlite. When I open that file with DB Browser I can see lots of entries such as 

"331"	"294"	"3"	"C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop"	"0"

in table of "prefs". Where 294 is the ID for certain site.

I use "Administrator" as user on my desktop, hence this kind of records. Apparently it shouldn't by synced to my notebook because I don't have privilege to access that folder on my notebook.
