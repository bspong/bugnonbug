I am using win XP and Serbian localized version of Firefox. 

Ctrl-l command should change focus to address bar. However it works only while Serbian (Cyrillic) keyboard is active. It doesn't work while English (Latin) keyboard is active.

Behaviour should be the same on both keyboards, as in all other localized software.

Other commands seem to work on both keyboards. For example ctrl-k works on both Serbian and English keyboard.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox in Serbian.
2. Have installed Serbian Cyrillic and English keyboard in Windows XP.
3. Try pressing ctrl-l while Serbian keyboard active. Then same with English.
Actual Results:  
On Serbian keyboard ctrl-l switches focus to adress bar (as expected). 

On English keyboard nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
Same behaviour on both keyboards.

It would be less problematic if it worked on English and didn't work on Serbian keyboard, because most of the time user needs to type Latin URLs in address bar, so if they have English keyboard active, they have to switch to Serbian, press ctrl-l (just to get to the address bar) and then to switch back to English to type the URL.
