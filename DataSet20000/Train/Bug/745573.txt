Steps to reproduce:

I went to Biblos.com website and selected the "KJP" version of the Bible from the choices listed across the top of the website page, and then, after the "KJP" version of the Bible opened, and I selected a book and chapter, some random words that should appear in black non-underscored fonts display in underscored blue font.


Actual results:

Random words within the body of the text of the selected book and chapter, that should appear in black non-underscored fonts, display in underscored blue font.  
In addition to random words within the body of the selected passage being displayed in underscored blue font, which is not really predictable, the second heading line above the text body also exhibits this underscored blue font error.  It should appear as “King James Bible: Purple Letter Edition” – and does, briefly.  Then, after a moment or so, the second heading line, changes to “King James Bible: Purple Letter Edition”; and at that same time random words in the body of the chapter will also change to underscored blue font.  This bug reporting medium doesn't support font or underscore, so I can't show that the words “King James Bible:" in the heading are now underscored blue font.


Expected results:

The words that change to underscored blue font should remain non-underscored black font, as the HTML source for this text does not contain tags calling for underscored blue font treatment.
