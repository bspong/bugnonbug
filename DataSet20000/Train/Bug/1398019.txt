Regression: favicons missing in Bookmarks toolbar
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:57.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/57.0
Build ID: 20170907220212

Steps to reproduce:

Note: Firefox was configured to display Bookmarks Toolbar.


Actual results:

When I start up Firefox, all the favicons in the Bookmarks Toolbar were missing. In fact, I can click on a bookmark in the Bookmarks toolbar to visit the site, the favicon appears in the toolbar for at bookmark, shut down Firefox, start up Firefox, and that favicon is missing again!


Expected results:

When I start up Firefox, the favicons in the Bookmarks Toolbar should be displayed for sites I had visited.

This just started happening in tonight's Nightly, Build ID 20170907220212. This problem did not exist in this morning's Nightly update.

I also ran a regression-gui, specifying to resuse the profile. First run is to customize to display the Bookmarks toolbar, then to add an item to the toolbar (I pasted in https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/ to the address bar, brought up the page, then dragged the (i) to the toolbar to add this to the toolbar; then I shut down Firefox, then told regression-gui to "retry".)

I am attaching the log and the bisection informations below for the regression run; a success means it is displaying the favicons in the Bookmarks Toolbar when Firefox starts up; a failure means the favicons were missing from the Bookmarks Toolbar.
