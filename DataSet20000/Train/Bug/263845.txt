Firefox (branch) unregisters Internet Explorer as default browser but shouldn't
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/2004108 Firefox/0.10

Firefox (branch builds since 20041008
) seems to unregister Internet Explorer as default browser (and does not 
register himself as the new one) although Firefox should not bee the default 
browser.
So after closeing Firefox and starting IE again, IE says it is not the default 
browser anymore (but only if the option to perform this check is active, if not 
it won't tell you that).

This is really annoying because links from chat windows of my IM (trillian) 
won't open correctly anymore - IE opens but shows a blank side with no url in 
the adress bar (just like the blank startpage but without the 'about:blank' as 
url in the adress bar).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.) Start IE and make shure it is set as default browser (check out the option 
in internetsettings -> programs that IE will check on startup if it's the 
default browser or not). If not, than make it the default browser again. 

2.) Close IE and start Firefox (branch build 20041008) and make shure, that the 
option for making FF the default browser is not set. 

3.) Close Firefox and open IE again. You will notice that IE is not the default 
browser anymore although Firefox was not allowed to do so. 

Actual Results:  
- links (from instant messengers or URL files) only opens an empty IE window
- when opening IE and don't making it the default browser again (because the 
option to check if IE is the default browser is not set) you can not open 
internet settings from extras menu in IE
