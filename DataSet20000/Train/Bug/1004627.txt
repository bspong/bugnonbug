Steps to reproduce:

I had started FIREFOX 2.0.0.11 WITH reset in FACTORY mode.
Then I had installed jre7u55, flashplayer_11, Adobe Reader 9.4.2, mplayerplug-in 3.55 after I had uninstall  java-1.5.0 then I had loaded FIREFOX-29.0.tar.bz2  in /opt/ ; before I had moved  firefox into firefox2 (firefox.old)
I had keep firefox 2.0.0.11 in /opt/firefox2 to run this AND THEN check for new Update automatically to Firefox2.0.0.20 (2008121709) Security Update installed on 01.05.2014 9:29:10  This Update was successfully installed.

Why not for Firefox-29.0,  [in /opt/firefox ] he latest firefox for Linux that I had installed on my EeePc 701; it gives crashreporter THIS ACTUEL BUG  [after Bugid=993349 for Firefox-28.0 who did also no work at the 8th april 2014, in /usr/lib/firefox]



Actual results:

Then THERE ARE CRASHREPORTER with various files: crashreporter, crashreporter-ini or webapprt.ini, crashreporter-override.ini (browser), plugin-container...

But Firefox 29.0 don't worked in /opt/firefox also with Run as Administrator OR with /firefox/firefox -P OR -safe-mode

Expected results:

In /opt/firefox where Firefox-29.0.tar.bz2 is installIng, the browser desktop may be running.
But it doesn't works on Desktop.
The old firefox2 in opened is runing not with Desktop launcher but with double-click and click on "Run as Administrator". It is the Firefox2.0.0.20 (Firefox2 Release) who is runing with this "stratagème"
