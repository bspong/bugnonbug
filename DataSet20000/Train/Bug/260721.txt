Firefox randomly stops downloading the content of a web-page, image, download, etc.
Seems to only occour when setup to use a proxy (i have tried different proxies).
Sometimes firefox will complete loading of the page correctly, other times it
stops at a random position.
Viewing page source code shows incomplete page source (cuts end of file off).

Happens on all web sites, servers, etc.
But most commonly on big pages with lots of content (image galleries, forums, etc).

When a download has this problem, the download manager will indicate the
download was completed succesfully, but the downloaded file will not be full size.

This is occouring with all latest versions of official releases and unofficial
builds of trunk and branches over the last few months (cant remeber exactly when
it started).

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a web page, or start a download.

Actual Results:  
Randomly a random amount of content is downloaded, and if is a web page, is
displayed.


Expected Results:  
Displayed the full webpage/image or completed the downloaded file.

All said above.
