one-time 5-minute startup hang due to deleting page thumbnails
I restart to update Nightly, and was saddened to find it was not bringing up a window.

A quick sample showed:

Call graph:
    2524 Thread_1973076   DispatchQueue_1: com.apple.main-thread  (serial)
      2524 start
        2524 main
          2524 XRE_main
            2524 XREMain::XRE_main(int, char**, nsXREAppData const*)
              2524 XREMain::XRE_mainRun()
                2524 nsObserverService::NotifyObservers
                  2524 nsObserverList::NotifyObservers
                  ...many js:blah frames...
                    2524 nsLocalFile::Remove(bool)
                      ...syscalls...

A little dtruss output made the culprit obvious:

stat64("/Users/dolske/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/xxxx/thumbnails/d/8/f5fb411e3f1eb7f722071ec9d33f8c.png\0", 0x11A3E3998, 0x1)		 = 0 0
lstat64("/Users/dolske/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/xxxx/thumbnails/d/8/f5fb411e3f1eb7f722071ec9d33f8c.png\0", 0x7FFF5FBFB400, 0x0)		 = 0 0
unlink("/Users/dolske/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/xxxx/thumbnails/d/8/f5fb411e3f1eb7f722071ec9d33f8c.png\0", 0x7FFF5FBFB400, 0x0)		 = 0 0

So, recent landing of bug 752407 which clears the thumbs from this location. 

Looking at log timestamps, this went on for 5 minutes until the browser window finally came up. That is... bad. :(

I couple days ago I noticed again that bug 754671 was hitting my hard, as my profile had ~1.7GB of thumbnails.
