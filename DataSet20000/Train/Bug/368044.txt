Wrong rendering of forms

In our CMS we generate forms, in which the user enters his content. There are combinations, where the form is displayed totally broken. Some page elements are doublicated and some form elements get inactive. The bug disappears when switching of the browser cache.

If I am reloading the page, the page will be rendered correctly, but some form content will be lost.

As the affected pages display and work perfectly once the pages were loaded with deactivated cache, I am convinced that my code is not the source of error. I reviewed my code again and again and could not find a problem.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
As the bug occurs when generating a dynamic form in our CMS, a password is required to reproduce the bug. A password can be given to developers on request.

I can reproduce the problem on different machines and different operating systems (Mac / Win).
Actual Results:  
page elements are doublicated
form elements are doublicated and some of them are inactive

Expected Results:  
correct rendering, a working form
