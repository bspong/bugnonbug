In-page navigation for frame based ActivePerl Help resets font size to default

The ActivePerl help is displayed using frames. If the page font is increased (with or without Zoom Text Only checked or unchecked) and one then follows an in-page link, e.g. file:///C:/Perl/html/lib/pods/perlfunc.html#split, the page font size is reset and the in-page navigation winds up in the wrong place as though the page positioning is being calculated using the larger font size. But if I right click on the right frame and choose This Frame --> Open Frame in a New Tab (file:///C:/Perl/html/lib/pods/perlfunc.html), I no longer have see the problem in the new tab, so it seems to be frames related. FWIW, I see this problem with the help that ships with Active Perl v5.10.0, but I suspect it happen with other Perl versions. 

It seems that this started happening in a recent version of Firefox, perhaps 3.0.2, but I am not sure about that. IE7 behaves as "expected". It is possible that ActiveState's code is responsible for this problem; I just don't know enough about frames to make that call. Bug 320379 (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=320379) may be related but that is not clear.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download and install ActivePerl from ActiveState (http://www.activestate.com/)
2. Browse to file:///C:/Perl/html/index.html  (or wherever you installed Perl)
3. Scroll down the index frame at the left side and click on perlfun
4. Bump up the font size (e.g. hit Ctrl+ a couple of time)
5. Scroll down the right frame until you see the heading "Perl Functions by Category"
6. Follow a link for one of the functions.
Actual Results:  
Font size is reset to default font size and in-page navigation lands at wrong place.

Expected Results:  
Font size is left alone and in-page navigation land at correct place.
