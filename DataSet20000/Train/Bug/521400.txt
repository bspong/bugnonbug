Firefox sometimes hangs when a page with flash is opened (Flashblock issue ?)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; fr; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; fr; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3

I think that the fact the the Flashblock extension is installed may be usefull.
When the given URL is displayed, Firefox freeze for example when I try to change the query fields or when I launch a new query on this page. Sometimes, it freeze when this page is opened and I switch to another tab.
Note that the page is only an example. I've seen the same problem on others, I think that it is related to pages with flash.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the given URL, flashblock installed, all flash animation must be blocked.
2.Do a query on this page.
3.Change fields of the query and launch again the query
=> Here it freezes.
Actual Results:  
Firefox freeze. Windows says that the application do not response.
I must kill it and restart.

Expected Results:  
It should not freeze !
