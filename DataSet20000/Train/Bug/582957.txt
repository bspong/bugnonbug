As suggested in bug 573412 and bug 578016, I'm opening a new bug entry about this.

The fix for bug 573412 was to remove the Toolbar Control ("pill") button from the Mac OS X title bar, which is against the Apple HIG, and also annoying to laptop users (13" ones, since the screen size is limited.)

This is a regression from 3.6 and 4.0b1.

Apple HIG are very explicit on this:
"The title bar should include a toolbar control if a toolbar is present in the window (see “Toolbars”)."

And this applies to all kinds of windows, not only to document ones, as it's been assumed in the bug 573412 comments.

If Safari or Opera don't follow the guidelines, thus looking "broken", why should Firefox mimic them removing such button?  If the reason is to move the tabs to the title bar in future, it's not good, per Apple guidelines:
"The only controls that belong in a title bar are the close, minimize, and zoom buttons. If a title bar is combined with a toolbar, the unified area can contain the toolbar control and the toolbar customization contextual menu (these controls are described in “Title Bar Buttons”). Do not place other controls in a title bar."
