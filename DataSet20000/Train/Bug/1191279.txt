Page scrolling can be off when linking to PDF documents with variable page sizes
STR:
Go to http://opus.kobv.de/zlb/volltexte/2010/9299/pdf/ZfB_1927_Ing_04-06.pdf#page=34

Expected result: The PDF opens at page 34, showing the map.

What actually happens: The PDF initially opens at page 34, but then scrolls upwards, so you end up somewhere between pages 32 and page 33. Because that scrolling wasn't intentional, pdf.js hasn't started rendering those pages, so I end up looking at blank space until I actively start scrolling (at which point the page indicator jumps to the actual current page as well).
Alternatively, if after opening the PDF, I *don't* manually scroll, but instead cause the viewport to resize (by opening the findbar or resizing the browser window), pdf.js jumps to the correct page.

My suspicion is that pdf.js starts opening the pdf, and as soon as it sees that there are 34 pages, it jumps to page 34. If the document is already in the cache, it even starts rendering page 34. Then it starts processing the rest of the document and realises that some pages (pp. 8 and 23) are larger than the rest, so it increases their page size. This in turn then pushes the rest of the document downwards, causing the initially opened page to scroll away from the viewport. Opening e.g. page 11 (http://opus.kobv.de/zlb/volltexte/2010/9299/pdf/ZfB_1927_Ing_04-06.pdf#page=11) seems to confirm this: There is only one large page above it in the document, therefore the final scroll position is off by a smaller amount than before.

Jumping to pages after the document has loading (by editing the URL) is working fine.

I've tested with FF39 and a recent Nightly (20150803030207).
