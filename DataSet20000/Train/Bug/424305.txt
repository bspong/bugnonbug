Search scope selecter should be drop down list in the search bar
Reporting with latest trunk nightly (2008032004 Minefield/3.0b5pre)

1. Open Places Library.
2. Type anything in the search box on the top of the Library window
3. Top-right pane will be shown and we can search with advanced rule
4. in the pane we can select search scope:
   Search: Selected Folder, All Bookmarks, Bookmarks Menu, Bookmarks Toolbar, History [Save] (-)

With default window size only a part of above selectors and buttons will be shown (in my env "History [Save] (-)" is hidden). Users have to make window very wide to show the "Save" Button.

Bug 416009 moved save button to the toolbar and we must enlarge the window to save new query (smartbookmark) now. The feature to save user-defined smartbookmark is one of the main new feature of Fx3 but with this UI if user don't enlarge the window and notice about the hidden items/buttons he will not notice about the feature.
If we enlarge default window size larger all items will be shown but it will be too wide (especially for some locales which need more width than english). If the user's display resolution is not enough large he cannot save user-defined smartbookmark at all. :(

To solve this problem, we should move search scope selectors into the drop down list in the search box like Fx's search engine bar or Thunderbird's search box on the top of the main window.
With this solution advanced search condition pane will be simpler and search UI will be consistent with Fx main window (search engine bar).
