Firefox 3.0 either will not launch or if it does it hangs.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10_4_11; en) AppleWebKit/525.18 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.1.1 Safari/525.18
Build Identifier: firefox 3.0

When I try to launch Firefox 3 (I'm using OS 10.4.11) it either won't start up at all, or if it does it freezes when I try to import bookmarks, etc. from Safari. Or it freezes during "Initial Synchronization." I can't do anything with it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.try to open firefox 3
2.Initial Synchronization page merge bookmarks - continue
3.start with the bookmarks on the server -continue
4. Ready to Synchronize - continue
5. Appears to be downloading for several minutes, but then with the status window noting "Writing to sync file..." the application stops ("Not Responding"), so I force quit which is the only way I can quit.

If i skip the "Initial Synchronization" and try to "Start New Session," and try to import my bookmarks from Safari via File and Import Wizard, I get the same results as above, but the application is "Not Responding" sooner, and I have to force quit again.

If I skip both the Initial Synchronization and the bookmark importing via File and Import Wizard, and just start a new session, I can open URLs, but I can't import my bookmarks. And the whole process is slower than Safari. 

So I give up
Actual Results:  
see above

Expected Results:  
see above

it should work. and it should be faster than Safari. But it won't import my bookmarks, won't syncrhonize my bookmarks, and the downloading is slower than Safari
