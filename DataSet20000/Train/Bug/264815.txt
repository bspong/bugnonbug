Keyboard Input Lost - Must Close FireFox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1

The keyboard stops working in firefox. This includes any opened tab and any
input (Webs ones or FireFox built-in ones, like fast-find or URL input.
The only manual fix seems to be open another form, like Options, Bookmark this
Page, etc.
This seems to happen with ANY dropdown box.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://www.webhostingtalk.com/search.php (tried on another dropdown box
and works the same).
2. With the list opened, click on any item with the RIGHT mouse button.
3. When the context menu is opened, click with the LEFT mouse button on ANOTHER
list item.

Actual Results:  
Now try to type in any other input from a Web form, or changing the URL, or
search something with the fast-find input... you simply cannot type anywhere.
Manual fix 1: Open a Firefox form like the "Options" one.
Manual fix 2: Switch to another application, when returning to FireFox the focus
sets on the URL bar and you can type again.

Expected Results:  
I see three options:
1- Run the "click" event of the drowdown box
2- Just hide the context menu and keep the list opened
3- Just hide the context menu and close the list

There seems to be a problem with the firefox focus, as it gets lost somewhere.

(Marked this as "Critical" because in some situations it can be VERY dangerous.
Some users may feel as frozen and think that closing FireFox is the only
solution, and this is not good in bank transactions or when doing special
tasks.. or just when having 15 tabs opened)

I am using the default theme.

I just tried this with three versions:

- Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10.1

- Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8a5) Gecko/20041017
Firefox/0.10.1

^^^--- Strange that this is supposed to be "Nightly" but is reported as 0.9 in
the "About" box and also does not have fast-find feature. Maybe my fault?

^^^--- Fresh download
