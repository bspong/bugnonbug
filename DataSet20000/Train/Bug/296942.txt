Complete browser crash often when navigating this bank site after logging in

After logging in to the site, there is a high probability that simple navigation
around this site will cause the browser to crash, sometimes without invoking the
Quality Agent (despite being enabled). On a few occasions, the post-login page,
which shows one's accounts etc. is drawn, immediately followed by the crash.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the URL above
2. Login with Netbank credentials (reproducer will need to be a customer...)
3. List transactions for an account, and navigate to "Next" pages (for older
transactions. Often a crash is only a few clicks away.

Actual Results:  
Browser crashes.
May invoke the Quality Feedback Agent

Expected Results:  
Reproduced the list of account transactions.

When the browser doesn't crash, the page seems to be rendered correctly.

Problem was apparent in Firefox 1.0PR for Linux.

The page seems to render correctly, and as yet I have not observed a crash with
the Windows XP Firefox 1.0.2 and 1.0.4.
