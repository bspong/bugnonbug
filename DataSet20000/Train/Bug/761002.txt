Sometimes tabs are confused when opening links
With browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction set to 0, clicking a link in a tab opens in another (but NOT new) tab. This means that the address of an already opened page in a different tab is silently modified.


For now the only site I know this to happen is at amazon.de, but the problem is always reproducible with a clean profile of Firefox. 

The author of TabMixPlus yet confirmed confirmed the issue, please see http://tmp.garyr.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=16341 (quoting: "This is not a Tabmix issue. I see the same behavior using new profile without any extensions just change in about:config  browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction to 0")



Steps to reproduce:

1. Change in about:config browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction to 0 

2. Open in the first FF tab: http://www.amazon.de/Philips-6990-16-He ... 0&sr=1-146

3,. Open in a second tab: http://www.amazon.de/Philips-AT750-16-R ... 5&sr=1-194

4. Click the shaver image (top left) in the second tab (should display a bigger image).

5. Select the first tab again.

6. Click the shaver image (top left) in the first tab.

You should notice that the last clicked image (expected to open in the first tab) opens in the SECOND tab instead, whereas nothing happens in the FIRST tab (where the mouse event originally was triggered).

With mouse events the browser should never confuse tabs, at least not if both affected tabs already show different pages.

Since this might be a security issue as well (kind of cross-tab content injection), I initially set severity to major.
