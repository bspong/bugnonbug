FF 3.5.0 onwards show the new/updated add-ons info tabs every time
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 (CK-IBM) Firefox/3.5.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

My problem is similar to this problem reported:

488096 	min 	-- 	Wind 	nobody@mozilla.org 	RESO 	INVA 	Everytime i load Firefox browser 3.1 beta 3 the add ons window pops up 

Somehow after I upgraded to FF 3.5.0 via Check for updates, every time I start up FF 3.5.x onwards it will show "FF has been updated" info tab along with any new/updated add-ons info tabs that I have added/updated after FF 3.5.0. 

Somehow during the FF 3.5.0 upgrade, there must have been a hiccup and FF 3.5.x onwards forgets to reset the info tabs after the first time.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start FF 
2. FF then shows FF updated info tab along with new/updated add-ons info tabs

Actual Results:  
1. I then have to close the tabs - very annoying...

Expected Results:  
FF should show "FF has been updated" or new/updated add-ons info tabs once only then reset to your default home page tab only on next FF start up.
