The wheel click is being sampled too frequently causing Firefox to think the wheel is being clicked multiple times. I had to go to Windows control panel and reduce the mouse sampling rate. Bonus: this same bug is the key to your unreliable wheel-click scrolling: sometimes you get the double-pointer, sometimes you don't.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Wheel-click a link like you are 50 years old (hold it a quarter second)
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Three or 4 tabs open up and they all load the same page.

Expected Results:  
One tab should open.

As I said, this same bug is the key to your unreliable wheel scrolling: sometimes you get the double-pointer, sometimes you don't. You need to change your wheel-click detection rules to ignore anything that looks like the user is clicking the wheel several times per second. I am calling this wheel-click problem a normal bug, BUT you may discover it is also causes some of the reported crashes while pages are loading.
