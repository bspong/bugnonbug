Unwanted text gets appended to a page if the same page is viewed in another tab and caching is enabled
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1

If you load a page in 2 different tabs (tabs 1 and 2) and perform some operations in tab 1 you will get unwanted html code from tab 2 appended at the end of your document.

If you disable caching the problem will go away.  

This problem is not happening on  a linux vm running Mozilla/5.0 Gecko/20060601 Firefox/2.0 Ubuntu-edgy.  The problem is also not happening with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20061218 Minefield/3.0a1


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
This is a reproducible error but my take a few tries to get it to work properly.

1.  Load two tabs in a single instance of firefox.
2.  Navigate both tabs to http://www.onlineguide.learnalberta.ca/default.aspx?lang=en-US&formID=2&navID=1
3.  On the second tab ctrl-f5 a few times.
4.  Go back to the first tab and click browse
5.  Select Grade 1 and Aboriginal Studies and click Browse Resources (for example)
6.  Click back
7.  Observer "Search Resources" may be displayed at the bottom of the page.
8.  Disable caching and repeat steps 1-7 noting that Search Resources does not appear at the bottom of the page.
Actual Results:  
The actual results vary a bit depending on which selections you select for step 5.  What 'appears' to be happening is*:
A- There is a shared buffer between the two tabs that is cached client side.  The buffer writes to the end displaying the current page and when that is finished continuing on with what ever else is left in the buffer (which in this case comes from tab 2).
B- There is some kind of buffer overflow happening here where memory from tab 2 is being copied, rendered and appended to tab 1.

* - just my best guess, you guys are the professionals.

If you view the source of tab 1 you will see that additional html code is being appended to the page, often in mid-tag and after the document should obviously end (after the /html).  

If you view the source of tab 2 you will see that the appended text matches exactly what is in tab 2.

Expected Results:  
Page renders with no code after the </html> tag.  No code from tab 2 is appended to tab 1.

To test whether or not this was a caching issue I used the WebDeveloper 1.02 plugin.  We have access to the asp.net code if you require that, but monitoring http traffic will I believe point you in the direction of this specific version of firefox.

Just in case (small chance) that this error is caused be case B above, I'm marking this as security.  I haven't looked in to the problem at all but I wonder about the possibility of a malicious user injecting code into tab 2, that would possibly get run after the rendering of tab 1 is complete.
