Soundcloud widget not loaded and shown correctly
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:48.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/48.0
Build ID: 20160817112116

Steps to reproduce:

Open a page containing a soundcloud widget (for instance https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F192354704&show_artwork=true&auto_play=false&show_comments=false&hide_related=true&visual=true&color=3b5998&maxheight=65)

I made several tests:
* the URL is correctly opened and the song played by IE11
* I launched firefox in safe-mode: did not resolve the problem - the widget is not loaded
* I created a new Firefox profile and opened the URL in it: did not resolve the problem - the widget is not loaded
* I reset the Flash player blocking list: did not resolve the problem - the widget is not loaded
* I edited the Firefox permissions database and deleted the permissions to w.soundcloud.com, then I opened again the URL; Flash asks whether to allow or block the URL. I answered either block or allow but in both cases the widget is not loaded
* Into the addons, I disabled Flash Player: in this case the widget is loaded correctly! This looks very strange because launching firefox in safe-mode should have had the same effect but didn't.


Actual results:

Firefox, instead of loading and playing the widget, shows the gray soundcloud icon (typical if the player is not loaded)


Expected results:

Open the soundcloud player and play the song
