"Check for Updates" is blocked for first attempt after restart.
Nightly (and various add-ons) may cause a pop-up that indicates that there are Updates available.
You can also use [Help] [About Nightly] [Check for Updates] to force a check for newer versions.

After the Update is applied and Nightly is restarted the Internet Connection is "blocked" when you 
use the Menu item "[Help] [About Nightly] [Check for Updates]" and the 'Spinner' simply keeps spinning
(instead of either saying "Nightly is up to date" OR (possibly) "an Update is available").

If you click on the red [X] to close the box and immediately retry "[Help] [About Nightly] [Check for Updates]"
it will check successfully within a couple of seconds. After not working the first time it will work any
subsequent times (even if you retry immediately) without problem. It needs a port-knock or wake-up to work.

It is like trying and failing fixes it, then it works (great feature! :)  ). 

I first noticed this behavior a few days ago.


Please Note: ALL Internet connectivity is not blocked since other Applications work and Nightly 
can load Tabs. It is only the Internet connection for "[Help] [About Nightly] [Check for Updates]" 
that fails to work (or so it appears from the relentless Spinner).
