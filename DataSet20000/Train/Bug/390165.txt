Can't really determine if I hit a bug in Firefox or in OSX, but I keep getting a non-functional FireFox time to time just by browsing.

If I look into my console I do see error messages exactly on the times:

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just browse
2. All of the suddon flash or images on websites won't appear
3. Firefox will do nothing anymore from this point (ie; click on anything, type anything, but browser won't browse anymore).

On session restore (after hard termination) firefox works perfect with the same site...
Actual Results:  
Not displaying IMG or EMBED and after that stop responding.

Expected Results:  
-

Strangely enough I visited these sites before without any problems.
Network here is just fine (can't be it).
