'Allow' button in Adobe Flash doesn't work

When I go to Meebo.com (an online instant messenger), and I log in with my MSN address, I start a conversation with a person, and I click the webcam icon, this means I can have a webcam conversation with the other person using Adobe Flash.
But before the webcam can start, Adobe Flash asks for permission to allow the website to have acces to your microphone\webcam. When you click the 'Allow' button, nothing happens, the asking dialogue is still there, the same goes for the 'Deny' button, whichever one you click, the dialogue isn't going away so you can't start the webcam conversation.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.meebo.com, and sign in with your MSN address using of course the MSN protocol
2. Start a conversation with somebody who is online
3. Click the webcam icon, and wait for the dialogue to pop up and find out that the buttons aren't working
Actual Results:  
Whether you click 'Allow' or 'Deny', the dialogue doesn't go away

Expected Results:  
After clicking 'Allow', the dialogue should go away and you should be able to start the webcam conversation

I've tested the Meebo webcam option with Internet Explorer 6, and it is working in that browser, in IE6 the dialogue goes away after clicking 'Allow' and you can start the webcam conversation. 

I'm using Firefox 3.0 (Dutch) on Windows XP Professional, using Adobe Flash version 9.0.124.0.
