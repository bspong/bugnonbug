Firefox thinks menubar is smaller than it is

Firefox 3, running on a Macbook Pro with an external 2560x1600 monitor attached (running as the primary display), sometimes gets confused about the size of the menubar. The menubar is displayed on the 2560x1600 monitor, but Firefox limits it to 1440 pixels wide (the width of the machine's built-in display, which has no menubar showing). This behavior seems to happen after putting the machine to sleep and re-waking it, but waking it without the external monitor does not seem to be necessary.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Attach external monitor with a higher resolution than the built-in display to the machine and make it the primary display.
2. Launch Firefox 3.
3. Put the machine to sleep by closing the lid.
4. Wake the machine up by opening the lid.
Actual Results:  
In some cases, the Menubar in firefox is limited to the width of the lower-resolution secondary display. This also causes other menubar items (e.g. the clock and the Spotlight menu) to be hidden.

Expected Results:  
The menubar should use the whole width of the primary display.
