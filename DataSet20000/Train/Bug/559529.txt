When I edit my personal persona (which on my hard disk) & click the 'OK' button, it does nothing in terms of actioning the changes.  It does show the persona but as soon as I move to another tab; after a few seconds it reverts to the default theme, which is the one I'm using.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click Fox icon in status bar
2. Hover on personal persona & click on 'Edit'
3. Make changes on "chrome://personas/content/customPersonaEditor.xul"
4. Click 'OK' button
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens when click the 'OK' button.  However, when make a change to the persona, this is shown immediately.  When I then move to another tab, the Persona shows for a few seconds before disappearing.

Expected Results:  
When click the 'OK' button, there should be a response.

This may tie in with the other bug I reported earlier reference ID: 559525.
