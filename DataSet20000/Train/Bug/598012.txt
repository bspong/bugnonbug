Provide same functionality as error console without changing prefs, e.g. by enhancing web console or adding link(s)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b6pre) Gecko/20100918 Firefox/4.0b6pre
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b6pre) Gecko/20100918 Firefox/4.0b6pre

The error console is ESSENTIAL for "in live" debugging as opposed to debugging that takes place in a development or test phase of a project.

At the moment if I receive a bug report against one of our live intranet apps the first thing I ask the reporter to do is check the Firefox error console. This will contain any warnings and errors that have happened on any page since the browser was started.

This is important because often the user won't know or remember exactly what they did, even which page they were on. Often I don't get to speak to them about the issue until a couple of hours after the problem happened. But 9 times out of 10 the messages in the error console provides a strong clue as to what's wrong.

The web console does not address these scenario well because (1) it only captures errors while its open and (2) it and the errors it contains disappear when the page is closed.

So what I'm saying in a roundabout way is that there is huge value in having the old error console enabled by default. The web console and error console are complimentary tools - one does not completely replace the other.

Reproducible: Always
