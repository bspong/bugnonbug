Text does not resize at some websites

At many websites, the text cannot be resized using ctrl-<+>/ctrl-<-> or View >
Text Size > increase/Decrease. See article above for a specimen. I have been
noticing this for at least a month.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. On certain websites, wait for page to stop loading
2. attempt to change text size

Actual Results:  
Text size does not increase or decrease.

Expected Results:  
Text size should increase or decrease.

At the site above - and other sites where this has occurred - the text is
resizable while the page is loading. If you set the text larger or smaller
during the loading, it remains at this size and cannot be changed without
reloading the page. Then it can be reloaded.

As at many of these sites, there is an ad on the right where the text is changed
while the main text is not changed.

The phenomenon has been confirmed by others. One even found a reversal of the
page's behavior - the ad's text was not changed where the main text was changeable.
