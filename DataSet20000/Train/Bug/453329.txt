Summary says all I guess, except for the fact that it only happends when adding a bookmark to the toolbar, taskbar.. workpallete, however you may call it... the always visible text/icon bookmarks. Anyways... as long as you get the fact that its not happening when you add a bookmark in your regular alt+shift+a menu. Browser lagged for a sec when i pressed add with some fast clicks, wich resulted in 2 of the same bookmarks. I tried a second time, and was able to get to up to 12 bookmarks easily with some fast clicks at once.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Rightclick your toolbar and click "new bookmark"
2.Add quite some data (preferably some lines with details too so it takes a bit longer to load)
3.Click on the "Add" button as fast as you can and as many as you can.
Actual Results:  
After doing step 3 you will notice that this is like a big memory leak or something... if you click fast enough you will be able to keep clicking the add button for as long as you desire. It sort of "hangs" and I was able to get as much as I wanted basicly I could go on untill im 20 years older hehe :P.

Expected Results:  
10..20..30..40..50 bookmarks at once with fast clicking the add button.

Just add 1 bookmark and either dont lagg/hang or add a double bookmark posting block.

More info more chance to a fix ;-)
