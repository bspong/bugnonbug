I try to open the website www.bluelandblog.com (which becomes http://trashers.portspaces.com/blueland) and it locks up Mozilla & says "not responding"

Is there a setting I need to change?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  type in the URL http://www.bluelandblog.com or http://thrashers.portspaces.com/blueland
2.  mozilla firefox (2.0.0.3) locks up & will not open the website
3.
Actual Results:  
It begins to open the page.  You either see the blue background on the website appear & then it locks up or it will open the page just a tiny bit further & you will see the words "Blueland Blog" at the top & the blogs written in the white section in the middle & then it locks up.

Expected Results:  
Should be able to open the website & view the pages.  It opens fine on my computer with Internet Explorer.  

I was running Mozilla Firefox on my old computer with Windows XP & the website worked fine.  I just got a new computer running Windows Vista & downloaded Mozilla Firefoz 2.0.0.3 & it won't open the website.
