highlighted text colors are broken after upgrade to firefox 1.5

I had been using the official 1.0.7 tarball on Linux (x86) for quite a while without any problems. Two days ago, I upgraded to the official 1.5 tarball, and that's when this problem started. 

Whenever I highlight some text on any website, both the text and the background color get changed to the same shade of red, making the text completely unreadable. Here's an example:

I've gone into Edit -> Preferences -> Content -> Colors, but no changes that I make there help at all. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.with your mouse highlight some text in either a web page or the URL/Location bar
2.the text color and the highlight color are identical, making it impossible to read the text


Actual Results:  
the text color and the highlight color are identical, making it impossible to read the text


Expected Results:  
the text color should be different than the highlight color, such that the text is readable.

Per http://www.quirksmode.org/css/selection.html , setting moz-selection in UserContent.css does workaround this problem in web pages, however does not fix it for the URL/Location bar.
