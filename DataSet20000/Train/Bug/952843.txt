Download directory not set back to default
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20131205075310

Steps to reproduce:

After upgrading to FireFox 26.0 (Windows 7-64bit) I noticed a changed behavior when I download a file.

My configuration for downloads has a default directory specified (my Desktop), but I have the button "Always ask where to save files" clicked.

Before Firefox 26.0, that configuration always reset (upon closing and opening the browser) the download location prompt to ask me for a location, with the default of the Desktop.


Actual results:

Now with Firefox 26.0, the prompting for a download directory has as its default location the last directory I downloaded a file to, even if I had closed the browser since I downloaded the file.  The previous session's download directory now seems to be persistent across browsing sessions.

To reproduce:

1) download a file to My Documents directory
2) close Firefox
3) reopen Firefox
4) download another file

 --- you will see that the prompting for the location begins at the My Documents directory.


Expected results:


--- in prior versions, the prompting for the location began in the directory configured as the default download directory in the Options dialog.
