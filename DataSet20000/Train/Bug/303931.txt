The follwing url is an example when the acrobat reader plugin gives a popup with
gives "File does not begin with '%PDF-'.":http://www.german.dhamma.org/kunst.pdf

if I set the property (in about:config) 'network.http.accept-encoding' to
'deflate' (instead of 'gzip,deflate') the plugin works fine. 

when I look on the server than I realise that the server is indeed gzipping the
the file, iff the Accept-Encoding header is set to gzip.

other servers which do not gzip pdf files are working fine the Acrobat-reader
plugin.

I have seen this at least from version firefox 1.0.4 onwards and with the old
and new Acrobat Reader plugin (5.x + 7.x) and I now people who have the same
experience on Firefox 1.0.4 > on Windows platform.

3.

Actual Results:
