Mostly when I am loading news pages, like CNN (but not only) and other large sites, if I hit the STOP button, suddenly, my internet connection is stopped as well.  This happens only with the current release of Firefox, not with Netscape or Safari and I don't recall that it happened with the previous Firefox release.  My ISP says the log shows I'm always connected or disconnect by choice, not from them.  Of course, I don't do it - it happens only, as I said above, when I hit the stop button.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open CNN's webpage. Wheel turns & turns even though page seems to be loaded.
2. Hit stop button.
3. Internet connection disconnects automatically.
Actual Results:  
As usual and as reported.

Expected Results:  
Just stop loading the webpage so I could try something else.

I'm NOT a software developer or writer or geek... so I can't write this in some sort of computer code.  I have no clue as to which module is responsible.  I only know what happens - everytime.

Please fix it.  I don't want to go back to Safari.
