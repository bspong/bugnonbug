Long time (20 -30 sec) to switch between URL's, works immediately with IE

Switching from page
http://www.herold.at/servlet/at.herold.sp.servlet.SPHomeServlet to page
http://heise.de/newsticker/ takes about 20 - 30 seconds.
I see the very same delay happening some times a day on very different urls, can
be fixed most of the time by interrupting the transfer and starting it again.
This seems like a kind of request/reply timing problem where the browser is
missing the data from the reply of his very own request.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set http://heise.de/newsticker/ as your Home Page location in 
Tools>Options>General
2. Set a bookmark with the url 
http://www.herold.at/servlet/at.herold.sp.servlet.SPHomeServlet
3. Open the bookmark from step 2 - this opens fast now with the nightly nuild
4. Click on your Home Page Icon to open the url from step 1 - now this 
operation takes 20 - 30 seconds. The very same procedure works in about 1 
second using IE.
Actual Results:  
After a delay of 20 - 30 seconds the page is displayed

Expected Results:  
Display the page within reasonable time (about 1 second)
