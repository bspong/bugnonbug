w2k3 domain roaming profiles, firefox slow to start and does not load profile
User-Agent:       Opera/9.63 (Windows NT 5.1; U; en) Presto/2.1.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

W2K3 rc2 domain with roaming profiles set up via group policy for client computers.
client computers have windows xp sp3 with jan 2009 updates,
domain users' application settings & profiles are on the server shared with the right permissions for each user.

firefox 2.0.** was previously used on these machines, after the upgrade to firefox 3.0.** problems started. 

i have tried uninstalling firefox 2.0.**, clean install of firefox 3.0.**, installing firefox 3.0.** on top of firefox 2.0.**.
since the client computer were patched in stages (not all computers received microsoft jan 2009 updates at the same time ) i do not believe that windows patches and hotfixes are the cause of this problem.

i resolved slow loading of firefox 3.0.** by starting (logged in to the client computer AS the user who uses the computer) "firefox -P" deleting the profile, while noting down the exact path to profile. copy the users profile from the server to local client computer. then create a new profile and use local path of the profile instead of unc to the server.

now firefox loads up fast and stores page settings/does not start with "welcome to firefox"



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.use w2k3 server with active directory and join a client computer to a domain.
2.use group policy to set up roaming profiles on a server eg. //server/profiles/%USERNAME%/ 
3.install firefox on the client computer with local-admin/domain-admin/power-user/elevated priveleges
starting firefox on the client computer is slow and every time you start firefox, firefox opens "welcome to firefox.." tab

Actual Results:  
starting firefox on the client computer is slow and every time you start firefox, firefox opens "welcome to firefox.." tab

Expected Results:  
firefox should be faster - as fast as firefox 2.0.** to start, and not display the "welcome to firefox" tab every time you run firefox.

i assume that either the profiles are getting corrupted/not loaded properly, or the updated firefox firefox 3.0.** has trouble accessing profiles via unc path.

this is probably not the right place to reccomend stuff but:

if mozilla would release an msi or some easyli scriptable install of firefox that can be installed via group policy silently and silently updated.
the footprint of firefox in the enterprise would increase dramatically.
