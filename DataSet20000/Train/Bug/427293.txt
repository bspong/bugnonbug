"Secure Connection Failed" makes it difficult to work in the web hosting industry

I work in the web hosting industry and when I install a web hosting control panel on a server, like cPanel, Plesk, H-Sphere, or InterWorx, the default is to use a self-signed certificate for encryption.  This provides the needed level of security for working on the system and most customers never need to buy a certificate.  The new Firefox 3 behavior means that now, rather than being able to click through to a page with up to two warning dialogs, I must now click through even more steps and actually add an exception for every single server I work on, ever.  I do this dozens of times a day and the new feature wastes a lot more of my time.

I don't necessarily advocate that this feature be removed, as it has its place for novice users, but I would like to have something I can do to either turn it off, revert to the old behavior, or create very wide exception patterns, such as all IPs in a specific range.  I can survive if the option is found only in about:config.

Reproducible: Always
