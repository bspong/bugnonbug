Firefox freezes for 15 seconds on The Independent (major UK newpaper)

mozilla.org build of firefox.

Go to
http://comment.independent.co.uk/letters/
and click on a link to a letters page. They start

Letters:.....

The user interface then freezes for 15 seconds before the page comes up.
The effect is particularly easy to see when using tabs since the
"loading tab" animation freezes too after about 5 seconds.

I am reporting this on a G3 powerbook using a cable modem,
 but the same thing occurs
to me on Linux too (Suse rpm build from ftp.suse.com) on a high end
biprocessor, 64 bit xeon- Thus it seems to be a more general than just mac os x.
Despite the great difference in performance of the machines the freeze
is still about 15 seconds. "Top" does /not/ show firefox using large
amounts of CPU.

This is a major UK web site which is very difficult to navigate with
firefox. 

Cross checking with Safari (to see that network is OK) leads to
rapid loading of page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://comment.independent.co.uk/letters/

2. Click on a "Letters:..." link

3. Try to switch tabs or open a menu

Actual Results:  
Browser freezes 15 seconds every time

Expected Results:  
Link should open rapidly

I see this on very high level linux workstations,
as well as under mac os. (Suse 10)
