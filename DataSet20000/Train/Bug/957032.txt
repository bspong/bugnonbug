Steps to reproduce:

Shortly after engraining my computer in FireFox and Microsoft 365, I began to have 127.0.0.1 acdid.acdsystems.com basically take over my machine every afternoon. I am not a programmer, but I can tell you that it has embedded itself in several FireFox file and services and appears to be now part of the firefox.exe program. It has also attached itself to several Microsoft files, several services and now Word. 

I run my business from this computer and I can only assume the worst when I see random, odd looking IP addresses accessing my computer remotely. Plus to add insult to injury, it spools up my processor to 80% - 90% and often renders it unusable. A reboot sometimes will make it go away for awhile at least, but when you have a dozen windows open and 4 or 5 programs running with active work, to have to save everything, close everything, reboot and start over is a real pain in the ass.

I know acdidsystems is acdsee, which was on the computer when I got it. I removed the program when I first encountered all of this, but it still persists. For them to attach and impersonate a valid file from Mozilla and Microsoft has got to be illegal. You can see the proof in the attachment. Not sure what to do at this point.
