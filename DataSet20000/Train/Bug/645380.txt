Clicked links sometimes do not open.

At times, not always but frequently (say for about every 15th to 20th link clicked), a clicked hyperlink that opens in a new tab does not load the intended page, but instead shows up the home page. The location bar of the opened tab contains the URL of the homepage and not that of the link clicked, so even refreshing the page doesn't take you to the intended link.

Therefore, when opening a link in a new tab, one must wait to see that it has indeed loaded before clicking another link or scrolling the original page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Tell the browser to open the links that are targeted to open in a new window in a new tab instead.
2. Open a page containing a number of links which would now open in new tabs when clicked. Open some of them one by one, say, by right clicking and pressing T (for opening in a new background tab).
3. After opening a number of tabs, say 20 to 25, check if all of them have opened the links you clicked.
Actual Results:  
One or two tabs might show your home page, with the URL also pointing to the home page. The Back/Forward buttons are grayed out.

Expected Results:  
The clicked links should have opened in those tabs.

I'm using the default theme, no persona. I'm using the extension NewTabURL 2.2.2 (along with others that do not seem relevant to the problem). I never experienced this problem in the previous versions (3.6.x and the ones prior to it).
