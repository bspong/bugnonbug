In Windows 8, GUI widgets for the search and tab bars (or interaction with wm?) have fundamental failures
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:30.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/30.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140605174243

Steps to reproduce:

Install Firefox on Windows 8 and use with multiple tabs.

I have tried to uninstall and reinstall and delete my user AppData folder (alone and in conjunction) -- this does not help.


Actual results:

Almost all the time:

I cannot switch between search engines (in the box to the right of the search bar).
I can click on the icon, and I see the drop-down selection like I should, and I can select a different search engine, either by clicking or with down arrow + keyboard.
But then nothing happens -- the icon does not change, and the search engine does not change.

After some time, this also occasionally happens:

I can switch between tabs, however, the entire tab bar does not render correctly (the background shows through when it should not, etc), and minimize and maximize/restore controls (i.e. the standard windows manager controls) are non-responsive.


Expected results:

Selecting a different search engine should select a different search engine.

The tab bar should render correctly, and the minimize/restore icons should serve their usual purpose.
