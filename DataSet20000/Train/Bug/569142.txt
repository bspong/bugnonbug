Going "back" to a page not stored in session history should show an info (error) page rather than trying to reload the page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_8; en-us) AppleWebKit/531.22.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.5 Safari/531.22.7
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3

When the user is expecting to see what they saw before, Firefox shows something new.  FIrefox also fails to provide any indication to the user that a reload occurred (unless the page is slow to load, or the reload fails), much less any indication of why it would perform a reload.

This is particularly bad when it invokes bug 160144, which brings up a modal dialog when reloading a POST request.  This bug can be invoked when going back to pages that are correctly not stored in session history, or by pages that are not stored due to another bug (e.g. bug 567365).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Note the time stamp at http://lll.lu/~aknaff/bug-reports/mozillaNoStore/no-store.cgi
2. Follow the "continue" link
3. Hit back, and see a different timestamp
Actual Results:  
The page is reloaded, showing updated content rather than the expected historical content

Expected Results:  
Either the historical content or an infopage explaining why the historical content is not shown

This is a spinoff from bug 160144, comments on which reflect user frustration from a combination of misbehaviors, of which this is one (see bug 160144 comment 161 and 162).  The demonstration URL is from bug 160144 comment 148 (more cases are available through http://lll.lu/~aknaff/bug-reports/mozillaNoStore ).  This bug can be invoked by 567365 (at least), and may be responsible for bug 496232 (back-to-redirect = failure to go back).
