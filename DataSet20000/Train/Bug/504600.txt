Private Browsing does not start
Seems that Trying to enter Private Browsing is broken..I get a blank window
with un-named tab but no PB, trying to start PB a second time it starts up. The
problem is that the sessioin is lost when you exit PB. Session can be restored
with History -> Restore last session, but not sure how long that would work
before trashing the whole session.

2 errors in the console:
Error: Exception thrown while processing the private browsing mode change
request: [Exception... "'[JavaScript Error: "this._getURIFromString is not a
function" {file:
"file:///J:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Minefield/components/nsSessionStore.js"

Looks like once you hit: Start Private Browsing you get the Dialog box pop-up
Then clicking Start PB ... it does not start leaving you with the present
session, but the errors from sessionstore.js continue to fill up the Console2

EDIT: works with new Profile, renaming sessionstore.js did not help...
EDIT: Renaming places.sqlite did not help
EDIT: Correction, a new profile does NOT fix this... just deleted all my
profiles, created a new one, and ta-da, does not work, no addons had been
installed yet.
