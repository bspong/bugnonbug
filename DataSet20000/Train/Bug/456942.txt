Any time a web page causes a new window or new tab to open, I am getting two items in teh Windows pull-down menu.  One of which is the showing the title of the page (this would be the correct item) and a blank item.
Right now I have two windows open (from a restart of the software (I had two open at quit)) and four items in the Windows menu.
Selecting the blank item in the pull-down menu does not go to anything.  Window focus does not change either.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open window (or open tab)
Actual Results:  
window (or tab) opens. window loses focus as second event occurs (not sure what is happening).  All menus other than 'Firefox' menu disappear.  If I refocus to any open window (including the one I just opened) now second item is in pull-down window.


Expected Results:  
one window opens, one item is added to menu, and window stays focused on window (or tab) just opened

Focusing on new window and then closing it via the red circle in upper left of window causes it to do to unfocused state and leaves the blank item in the menu.

As the list of blank items grows, I am finding that the browser slows down.  Performance becomes unbearable and I have to quit the program (which takes a very long time, much longer than normally).
