The Suite has two sets of options for what happens on new page loads; one for new windows, one for new tabs. On Firefox the new tab pref is:

(a) set to Blank by default, the worst choice;
(b) hidden;
(c) broken (setting the pref manually in prefs.js has no effect).

Blank pages are stupid and confusing, but insomuch as they are desired by some subset of the community it doesn't matter so much that they are available as that they are *mandatory*.

The correct way to fix this:

(a) remove the broken pref entirely.
(b) hard-code new tabs to obey the new window setting (which can be a manually-set homepage, a bookmark or blank).

There is an edge case in the form of a home page which is set to a group of bookmarks. I don't believe that this edge case is important enough to leave the current broken situation in place.

There already exists an extension which fixes this by the name of New Tab Homepage. It arguably jumps through more hoops than it should need to because the default prefs are broken.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to File -> New Tab.
Actual Results:  
A new tab opens set to about:blank. Initial reaction varies from horror (the browser is broken) to irritation (I set a home page for a reason).

Expected Results:  
A new tab opens to the page set in Preferences -> General -> Home Page, just like with File -> New Window.
