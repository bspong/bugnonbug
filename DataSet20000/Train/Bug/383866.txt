Cuurrent CVS (3.0a5) build  fails with --with-system-nss

Building a fully (or mostly) static Firefox (minimal .so files) is difficult with the current Mozilla system.  One can get close to that if one loads the archive (.a) files in the proper order.  The NSS library is problematic however due to the way certificate construction/verification gets integrated into the library build process.  (I will admit that I do not understand this process.) One strategy to avoid this problem is to build Firefox using only the system NSS .so libraries (e.g. --with-system-nss).

Using this flag with modified nss sources (as the current CVS is) without having installed the new header files results in compilation failures in at least nsNSSComponent.c and perhaps other recently modified files.

Errors include:
nsNSSComponent.cpp: In function 'void setOCSPOptions(nsIPrefBranch*)':
nsNSSComponent.cpp:998: error: 'ocspMode_FailureIsVerificationFailure' was not declared in this scope
nsNSSComponent.cpp:998: error: 'CERT_SetOCSPFailureMode' was not declared in this scope
nsNSSComponent.cpp:1001: error: 'ocspMode_FailureIsNotAVerificationFailure' was not declared in this scope
nsNSSComponent.cpp:1001: error: 'CERT_SetOCSPFailureMode' was not declared in this scope
nsNSSComponent.cpp: In function 'nsresult setPassword(PK11SlotInfo*, nsIInterfaceRequestor*)':
nsNSSComponent.cpp:2494: warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules

This is a problem with compilation rules:
1) Why is nsNSSComponent.cpp being compiled if I have selected --with-system-nss?
2) There is confusion between --with-system-nss being a compile-time vs. a link-time option.  I.e. New library sources, e.g. nsNSSComponent.cpp should *always* be compiled with the build specific header files (-I../../../../dist/public/nss) [or even less "distant" in the source tree paths]) and not the system header files (-I/usr/include/nss) which are only appropriate for whatever source version was used for compiling the system shared libraries (/usr/lib/nss).

When I specify --with-system-nss however the executable should reference thye system shared libraries (/usr/lib/nss/lib*.so*).

I believe there may be a similar problem with referencing the system headers (in /usr/include/nspr) when using --with-system-nspr vs. --without-system-nspr.

Compiling release specific source files should always use the release specific header files.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download completely fresh CVS tree (with sources changed on 29-30 May 2007 or later).
2. Setup build flags with --with-system-nss
3. Attempt to build Firefox.
Actual Results:  
Source file compilation fails in recently modified security/manager/ssl/src components.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should compile sources and load firefox-bin.
