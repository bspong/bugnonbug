Steps to reproduce:

Moving the mousepointer over an element which has a hover state or a tooltip (doesn't matter if it is a XUL element like a bookmark on a bookmark toolbar under the adress-/tabbar or a button/input on a website) and afterwards into a flash object (which doesn't have to be exactly at the previous element, but happens most often if the gap between them is very small).

See attached screenshot for steps to maybe reproduce it (happens for me 1 out of 10 times, mouse with 5k+ dpi, very fast movement/sensitivity):
Mouse from 1st tab (active) to the tabbar, clicking 2nd tab, moving the mouse over the flash video on youtube, on the way the mouse moves over the searchbar on the youtube website. The "Search (de: Suchen)" tooltip stays, the "hover" state of the icon before the input stays.


Actual results:

The tooltip or hover state of the element stays while the mouse is inside the flash object, goes away as soon as the mousepointer leaves the flash object.

Maybe some events are skipped (could be an OS issue, or firefox not polling fast enough)


Expected results:

Tooltip and/or hover state should have vanished as soon as the mouse leaves the (XUL/html) element.

The mousemovement inside the flash object/GeckoFPSandboxChildWindow should have disabled the tooltip/hover state like mousemovement does as soon as the mouse leaves the flash object and enters the firefox window again.
