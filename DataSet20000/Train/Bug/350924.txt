Logins to the service.sympatico.ca web site's "Access your Sympatico account directly" section are failing due to "a security protocol which isn't enabled".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://passport.sympatico.ca/userprofiledetection2.aspx?aot=selfcare&lang=en.
2. Enter a Bell Sympatico email address (use mine to reproduce the bug) in the 'E-mail' field.
3. Click the orange and white right-arrow ('>').
4. At the next page, enter a Sympatico 'b1' username and password -- any old one will do.  Try 'b1aaaaaa' as the username, and 'asdf1234' as the password.
5. Click 'Login'.
Actual Results:  
Firefox complains with an Alert: "Firefox can't connect securely to www.billing.sympatico.ca because the site uses a security protocol which isn't enabled."  The subsequent page, which is an account management page for the Bell user, is not displayed.

Expected Results:  
The browser should be redirected to https://www.billing.sympatico.ca/cgi-bin/iaf/iafDisplay, which complains "An incorrect Sympatico User ID and/or password has been entered.  Please verify and try again."
