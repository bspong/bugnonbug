Cookie exception button stalls for about half a minute then shows error "A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete." If I click "Continue" it proceeds like it should. If I click "Stop Script" it still shows up anyways but with nothing in the cookie block list. It does this no matter what site I am currently on.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to Tools, Options
2.Click on "Privacy" tab
3.Click on "Exceptions" button
Actual Results:  
Stalls for about half a minute then shows error "A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete." If I click "Continue" it proceeds like it should. If I click "Stop Script" it still shows up anyways but with nothing in the cookie block list.

Expected Results:  
Just go to the list without stalling or giving an error and have all blocked cookies shown.
