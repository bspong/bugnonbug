Pages are jumping up and down

Note: I'm filing this bug in the name of some other person.

Previous Firefox version was 3.5.7, then he updated to 3.6.
On a new (and his old) profile every page was "jumping" up and down a bit, as if it was scrolled up and down permanently, even if there is no scrollbar shown and no action is taken by him.
He opened new tabs which showed the same behaviour.
Then he clicked an external link (in his IRC client) which opened a new tab and suddenly all other tabs didn't show the described "jumpy" behaviour anymore.

Some other observations:
The jumping does NOT occur while the preferences or the open-file dialog are opened. After closing these, the jumping continues.
The jumping DOES occur while the add-on dialog is opened or while the focus lies on the address bar (I guess any modal dialog stops it, while any non-modal dialog does not).

I am attaching a video (WMV) which shows the behaviour.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Upgrade from 3.5.7 to 3.6
2. Create a new profile and open it
----
3. Open some site(s)
-
4. Call the running Firefox with an URL
Actual Results:  
After 3.: All opened pages are jumping up and down
After 4.: All jumping stops until the next session

Expected Results:  
No jumping at all.

The computer is a laptop, namely the Acer Aspire 7520G.
