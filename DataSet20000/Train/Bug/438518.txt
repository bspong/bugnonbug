Restart triggers blank warning box, freezes browser

After installing a new extension (I cannot remember which one, unfortunately) and selecting "restart," I encountered an empty dialogue box which I assume was supposed to contain a warning or error notice, freezing up the browser (preventing the restart and not allowing closure of the window)

A screenshot is attached, indicating which pages I was using.  Note that I was logged into Meebo at the time, which traditionally displays a warning whenever that tab is closed, encouraging users to officially disconnect from the Meebo site first.  It is possible that this was a site-specific problem, but a blank error box may be better handled.

I wish I could provide better details, and hope that this issue can be replicated and identified.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have a few tabs of Ajaxy services open (might want to especially try Meebo)
2.Try to install a new extension
3.Select restart after the extension is added
Actual Results:  
Blank error message and a frozen Firefox.

Expected Results:  
Browser window to shut down and re-open.  Perhaps encounter a brief delay for some dialogue boxes from certain sites (such as the Meebo warning).
