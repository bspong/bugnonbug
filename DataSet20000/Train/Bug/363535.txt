Navigation & bookmarks toolbars disappear, can't be reinstated with View menu

Sometimes I find that the navigation and/or bookmarks toolbars
disappear completely (only tabs remain) and I can't find any way to
reinstate either of the toolbars. Checking/unchechecking entries in
the View/Toolbars menu has no effect when FF is in this state (See
attachment for a picture that shows both of these selections checked
and no Nav/BM toolbars present.)

Note: A new window can be opened and it does have both toolbars and
they are controllable with the View/Toolbars menu checks, while the
original window remains blocked.

This bug is intermittent for me - I can't find a way to reproduce it
reliably. Possibly some website turns off these toolbars with
Javascript. But even if I open other known toolbar-friendly sites in
other tabs and switch to them, I cannot make either of these two
toolbars re-appear: the whole window (and all tabs it contains) stays
toolbar-unfriendly for these two toolbars. Sidebars and status bar
work OK and have no effects on the missing toolbars. There are no
customizations other than adding my own personal toolbar items and
folders, all of which normally work as expected.

This bug appears for me about once a week.
