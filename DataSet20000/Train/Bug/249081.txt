Uninstall of Firefox deleted my bookmarks (and profile too!)

I just updated to Firefox 0.9.1 today and decided that for once I'd actually
follow the exact instructions for updating.  I dutifully closed Firefox and
uninstalled the old Firefox.  I imagined this would delete the software, not my
user data but I was wrong.  All of the data from my profile was removed as well. 

The release notes specifically state that you should remove the old version of
firefox, amend that to say that you should back up your profile maybe.

Reproducible: Didn't try
Steps to Reproduce:
1. install a version Firefox earlier than 0.9.1, I think I used 0.9
2. create a bookmark, locate the bookmarks file it should be in your profile
c:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Application
Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\default.<salt>\bookmarks.html
3. uninstall Firefox when it tells you that you have some files left in the
directory do you want to delete them say no (all that was left were some chrome
files) 
4. look for your profile directory and it removes the profile directory.

Actual Results:  
I installed Firefox 0.9.1 and got mad when I couldn't find my bookmarks,
configuration data, passwords, etc...

Expected Results:  
I would have expected firefox to leave my profile in place and upgrade it as needed.

I'd call this a major bug because there is a lot of state that is lost when you
lose your profile.  Maybe my computer just wigged out on me.  My coworker smugly
informed me that he never bothers to remove the old version of firefox, so he
doesn't have these problems.  Heh, thats what I get for actually reading the
release notes!

If 0.9.1's uninstaller does the right thing then just make sure this doesn't
regress in future releases.
