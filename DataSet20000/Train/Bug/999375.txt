User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:27.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/27.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140212131424

Steps to reproduce:

- open firefox
- let the screen saver of Windows 8.1 blank the screen
- move mouse/press button to stop screen saver

Background:
Windows 8.1 64 bit
primary graphics card: AMD R9 270X (Asus vendor) (2 displays attached)
secondary graphics card: Intel core i5 haswell integrated graphics (1 display attached)



Actual results:

Problem: The title bar of the firefox window is transparent and the window minimize/maximize/close buttons on the top right are missing. The window menu with the title "Firefox" and the tab headers are displayed. The window title bar is transparent. I can grab it and move the window. I can not access the window close and min/max buttons.

This behaviour happens to the firefox program only. All other applications are displayed as expected.

Extra info:
I can reenable the window title bar if I grab a tab and move it to a separate firefox window. Moving now all tabs manually to the new windows closes the window without the missing/transparent title bar. This is not a real solution for the issue.


Expected results:

The window is displayed with title bar and including the windows operation buttons.
