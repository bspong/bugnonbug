Dashlane 3.6.8 stopped working after update to latest Firefox 47.0b4
Dashlane stopped working after updating to the latest beta, Firefox 47.0b3. Dashlane is a popular password manager, and has been featured and promoted significantly to Firefox users over the last year. 

The Dashlane add-on still loads and is enabled with the icon appearing in the toolbar, but it does not fully load and does not work (i.e. clicking on the icon has no affect, the green "light" within the icon does not appear, and Dashlane is not enabled on forms). 

The latest version of Dashlane continues to work fine in Chrome with no issue. 

I've included the error from the browser console below, it looks like it is not fully loading due to some issue with the addons sdk.
