When I connect to any page that uses Java's livconnect, the browser hangs anf
firefox shows 80-90% CPU usage for 30 seconds to a minute while thousands (no
exaggeration, three thousand and up!) of these messages are issued over and
over. When FF hangs on this condition, can't close firefox without using task
manager to end program.

The sites, all mainstream stuff, range from NOAA's radar loops to IBM's PC
pages, Flychicago's Midway airport hotel virtual tours, in short too many to
list. I've found none that worked if liveconnect was used. I determined this by
setting trace=5 in the Java console. 

I've removed and reinstalled FF including blowing out the program folders.

Removed and reinstalled Java, installing within Firefox and from the Firefox page. 
I've also loosened up the security settings to allow everything and it makes no
difference.
