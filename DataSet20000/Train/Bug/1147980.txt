Back button only shows message box "document expired", no way to go back

Steps to reproduce:

Visit a website with a POST form and send it.
Do this multiple times consecutively, which is typical when using some search form.
Click the back button (Tab History).


Actual results:

A message box opens (translated to English):
"
Warning
This document is not available anymore.
                        [OK]
"
No "try again" option, no way to reload the page or go one step back in tab history.


Expected results:

1.
A problem is, that after 15 such POST result documents it is not possible to jump back to before the POST documents using the tab history list via right click on the back button. Only the last 15 pages are visible at once in the tab history, although "browser.sessionhistory.max_entries" is set to much higher. I don't understand why this list is not scrollable as the bookmarks are.

2.
Although the document is not cached there should be a placeholder page with a try again button to send the POST data again. When right clicking the back button, the step back should be visible in the list.
Message boxes are mostly annoying. There was once a Firefox version where such messages were shown as a document with more explanation.
