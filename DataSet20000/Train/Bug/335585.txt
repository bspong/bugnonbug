While images still are dowloading from the webserver the current focus and shown text is jumpy (scrolls automatically) and it is impossible to read the text even if the currently viewed part of the web page does not show any images.

(could be because the image place-holders does not have pixel sizes pre-defined and the actual page "size"(length) changes during loading of images to make them fit)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit example web page (easier to se over slow connection or when the Image web server is slow)
2. Scroll to bottom (does not show any images on my 1280x768 screen)
3. Watch the web page scroll/jump up while the images above loads (you don't see the image loading since they are not part of the visible area in Firefox)
4. 

Actual Results:  
Web page auto scrolls / jumps up.

Expected Results:  
Web page should not scroll to make it possible to read the text, since text is the only thing showing on the screen. (all images are off screen)
