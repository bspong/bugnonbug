Currently I have installed window professional xp
(build 2600.xpsp_sp2_gdr.050301-1519:Service Pack 2)
I have Ricoh print/scanner/copier machine installed on the network.
I am not able to choose this printer on a few of the workstations that I have.
being when I click FILE -> PRINT ( Ctrl - P ) the printer is not on the list.
Yet it does show up on the other workstations.
I had uninstalled firefox, then the driver.
then I reinstalled the drive and then i reinstalled firefox.
Still reproduce the same results.
Is there anything I could do to look into this further.
I use to code in c++, so I have a good idea where to look at.
But I have no editor for it. I be happy to help.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open firefox
2.Go to any website
3.click FILE -> PRINT . Printer is not found in list.

Actual Results:  
Printer is not available from the list.

Expected Results:  
The printer should have been listed.
