Drag the icon next to a URL to a subdirectory in the bookmark toolbar.

Now bookmark exists in 'Organize Bookmarks', but is absent from the place I dragged it to in bookmark toolbar.  

Example screenshots shows two missing bookmarks on toolbar ('Empty') and the two bookmarks appearing in 'Organize Bookmarks'.  Er... I can't find any way to upload the screenshots, so I guess you'll have to follow the steps to reproduce to see it.  Sorry.

You need to move the subdirectory relative to the other(s): see the steps to reproduce for a full explanation.

I do this often; first I've seen it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a directory (or use an existing one) on your bookmark toolbar.
2.Add at least two subdirectories to the directory just created.
3.MOVE one subdirectory relative to the other; that is, swap places.  Don't make one the subdirectory of the other, though.
4.Visit a site.
5.Drag the icon next to the URL for the site in the url bar down to the subdirectory you just moved (attempt to create a bookmark there.)
6.Check the bookmark toolbar version: no bookmark is there.
7.Open Bookmarks->Oraganize Bookmarks.  The bookmark is there.
Actual Results:  
6.Check the bookmark toolbar version: no bookmark is there.
7.Open Bookmarks->Oraganize Bookmarks.  The bookmark is there.

Expected Results:  
Expect bookmark to be in both locations discussed above.

I am running Xmarks - that may be pertinent.  I keep Xmarks and Firefox pretty well up-to-date.  Didn't have time to test without Xmarks.  I can try on a Linux host later.
