Tab switching with Firefox 4 betas is very slow if I have a lot of tabs (5-6 or more). After I click to a tab, it takes sometimes more than a second to switch. When I close the current tab, the tab focus (and the page content) first jumps to an other tab after about a second, but the old tab (which I closed) only disappears after 2-3 seconds later.

I tried it in safe mode and with a new, empty profile too, and in both cases the problem exists. I also tried to disable hardware acceleration, but it didn't help.

With Firefox/3.6.9 I don't have such problems with 15-20 opened tabs, so I don't think that my computer is too slow.

Similar bug is Bug 594197.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a lot of tabs (about 5 or more)
2. Switch between tabs / Close a tab
Actual Results:  
Tab switching is very slow

Expected Results:  
Tab switching should be fast
