Opening a particular file from my SENT EMAIL folder on socal.rr.com (roadrunner) causes an immediate crash. Trying to restart Firefox at the same point causes the same crash. It sent you NUMEROUS reports earlier tonight.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have an account at roadrunner.com
2. Send yourself this email
3. It should be in your SENT folder. If you open it, you will crash.
Actual Results:  
System crashed

Expected Results:  
System would open the email for browsing.

This email probably contains information that should be kept secure or opened only by trusted personnel. I can OPEN the email with Microsoft IE, but if I try to open it with Firefox, Firefox crashes. 

Please send me an email address to which I can forward the particular email using IE. I cannot open it using Firefox from the sent email folder on socal.rr.com.  If you need me to, I could set up a subaccount there and send the email there so you can see if you can resend it and open it.
