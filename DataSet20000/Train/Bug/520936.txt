The highlighting is a bit buggy when combined with scrolling. Here's a picture: http://img197.imageshack.us/img197/6171/ffbug.png

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open bookmarks list. Make sure this list is scrollable. Have a folder with a few bookmarks (10 is good).
2. Position your mouse directly over the > arrow in the right of the folder name. This will highlight the folder and open its contents.
3. Without moving your mouse, scroll down a couple of ticks with the middle mouse button. The contents of the folder should still be open, and the folder should still be highlighted regardless of whether you see it.
4. Quickly move your cursor to the right, ending up over the contents of the folder.
5. If the location of the first item in the folder is different from the location of the folder, you will get highlighting that is disjointed from your cursor.
Actual Results:  
We get highlighting below the cursor, equal to the distance the folder items are below the folder.

Expected Results:  
Good old highlighting where the cursor is.

Default theme. The bug is easily reproducible so information gathering will be more efficient that way.
