Firefox asks for logged in user's credentials multiple times when logging on to a Microsoft SharePoint Server

When logging on to a local intranet site that is located on a Microsoft
SharePoint server, Firefox asks for login details to the server twice (the first
time, it says: give username and password for http://infonet [the server's
address on the intranet]; the second time, it says: give username and password
for 192.19.4.17 [the proxy server on the intranet that is physically connected
to the Internet]). In each case, entering the user name and password of the user
already logged into the intranet via Windows Networking will allow the server to
be accessed and go to its home page, so these prompts don't seem to be
necessary. Also, it is interesting to note that clicking 'cancel' when presented
with the user name/password requests makes Firefox load an error page that
states access is denied. Another interesting point is that when loading the site
in IE, there are no unnecessary user/password requests and the home page of the
site loads immediately. I suspect this is due to the locking in of one MS
product to another (SharePoint to IE).
