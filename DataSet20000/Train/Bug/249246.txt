Installer Icons for FF+TB Cause 100% CPU usage in explorer.exe

Something seems to be wrong with the FF and TB Installer Icons
(FirefoxSetup-0.9.exe and ThunderbirdSetup-0.7.exe, as well as the .1 releases).

When browsing to a network share folder containing these files, the default
windows application icon is shown (rather than the neater-looking installer
icon).  CPU usage in explorer.exe shoots up to 100% for several minutes until
the installer icons get properly generated/displayed.  Once the icons are cached
by windows, this doesn't happen anymore (use TweakUI to clear Windows icon cache
to see this bug).

Interestingly, this does not happen when the files are contained in local
folders.  It only happens when they are contained in a network shared folder.

The icons display fine for FirefoxSetup-0.8.exe and the moailla*.exe series.

I have seen this on 2 seperate machines, on 2 seperate networks, on 2 seperate
OSs (WinXP & Win2k), so it's not something on my configuration.

This is a big problem for people such as myself who are trying to deploy FF+TB
in a corporate environment by installing the apps on multiple systems from a
network share.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a folder on another machine in your network and share it.
2. Place FirefoxSetup-0.9.exe and/or ThunderbirdSetup-0.7.1.exe in the network
share.
3. From a different machine, browse to the shared folder containing those files
using Windows Explorer

Actual Results:  
CPU shoots to 100% for several minutes, installer application icons are not
displayed.

Expected Results:  
Installer application icons should be displayed immediately.  CPU should not
shoot to 100%

Screencap coming.
