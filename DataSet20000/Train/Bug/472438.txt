anchors do not respond to back or forward buttons

In the website noted above there are many pages with thumbnails that load images into a main DIV. This is done with an "id" on DIV or IMG. The images load correctly, however, when the back or forward buttons (either on the mouse or the browser) are clicked nothing happens. The address changes in the address bar to show the page_name.htm#image_name, but the corresponding image does not reappear. If one continues to click (forward or back) enough times, then the browser goes to the previous or next page.

This problem was posted in the general section of mozillazine forum in October 2008. Jefferson Scher put together a "quick and dirty" javascript that partially solved the problem but which causes other more distracting issues. I am posting this as a bug as I would like to resolve this problem; while that post has been visited more than 400 times no one else has offered any suggestion(s) or solutions.
