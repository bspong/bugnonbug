I would like a 'Show/hide toolbars' option in 'View/Toolbars/Custominze…' window

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. I open the browser the first time. The toolbars are showed.
2. I click 'View/Toolbars/Custominze…'
3. I check the checkbox 'Show/hide toolbars'
4. The next time I'll open Firefox the toolbars are open and after few (3?)
seconds they hide scrolling with a transition under the window heading, exactly
as does the MacOsX Dock.
5. When I move the mouse cursor near or on the window heading the toolbars
appear with an inverse transition. Then I can move the mouse on the toolbar and
interact with it.
6. When I move the cursor outside the toolbars the toolbars disappear again as
at step 4. (You can test if creating an invisible area of 10 pixels from the
bottom may be more functional)
7. If I have not selected an input form and I start writing more than one letter
with the keyboard (1 key is useful for keyboard navigation) the toolbars appear
and the word writing in the navigation toolbar.
