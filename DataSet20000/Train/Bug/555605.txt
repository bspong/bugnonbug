Just updated from firefox 3.5 to 3.6.2 .

Firefox hangs when selecting print, print preview or page-settings from the file menu. the print dialog is comming to front, windows title bar displays application hangs, when trying to close the popup screen for printing firefox hangs completely.

I have offline network printers, but didn't even came to the step where to select the printers.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. (Re)start firefox 3.6.2 in windows 7 32bit professional.
2. Select "File" (Bestand) menu > select print or print preview or page settings.
Actual Results:  
Firefox hangs and windows is asking what to do.. (find a crap solution on the internet etc.)

Expected Results:  
It should have opened the print file dialog / preview screen / page-settings screen and i should have been able to print.

i looked at several bugs, couldn't find exact my problem, this one looks a bit like it: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=531854
I don't have a bug with the XPS-writer though.
