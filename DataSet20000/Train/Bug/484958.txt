The settings for <textarea "cols="60" rows="10" wrap="PHYSICAL" ></textarea> are not recognised. When viewed with other browsers the input text wraps as expected; with Firefox 3.0.7 the input is displayed on a single line with scroll bars showing text being added to right. It is reproducible on any text area box on the web page in question. The problem was not recognised when using Firefox 2. Changing the wrap attribute has no effect. Removing the wrap attribute completely permits correct behaviour.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. the wrap attribute has been removed from www.clowd.org.uk/pages/clowdForm.htm now permitting the page to behave as expected
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
No special set up required

Expected Results:  
Previously text continues to be entered to right instead of wrapping, horizontal scroll bars are added instead of moving to next line

As with other browsers after the specified number of characters is entered on one line the cursor should move down a line. The sequence should be repeated until the specified number of lines have been entered, when scrollbars should be displayed. Removing the wrap attribute from the code enables correct function
