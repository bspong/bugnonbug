latest firefox not saving / creating cookies
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

After updating to Firefox 3.5.1 (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)) the computer stopped saving sites that had previously been logged into using the 'remember me' function. The system would remember the login until Firefox was turned off, then it would lose the information upon restart. When looking in the profile directory, Firefox does not appear to be saving or creating cookie files, though it is saving passwords for websites. All options to save cookies are checked in the options menu of the browser. I even sat in the directory where the cookie file SHOULD be created while creating a cookie on a website (igoogle) and no cookie file was created.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log into any website that requires a cookie to remember a login for a set period of time (Yahoo, Google, most mail services)
2.Turn off Firefox after logging in. 
3.Restart browser. 
Actual Results:  
The browser started back at the igoogle homepage without being logged in for the user, which is the standard behavior if you log in but don't save cookies. 

Expected Results:  
It should have opened the webpage at http://www.google.com/ig and been logged into my personal information, as I had checked 'remember me' during the login process.
