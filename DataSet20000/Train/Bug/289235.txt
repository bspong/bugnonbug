Starting with the object URL web page, scroll to the bottom & select "printer Friendly Version".  Any attempt to accomplish a File>Print (to PDF) produces a document that when opened in Adobe Reader 7.0, presents a page 2 with parts of the text missing.

Start with the object "Printer Friendly web page.  Select File>Print.  When the
print dialog opens, select "Save as PDF".  The resulting file opens properly
with all text when opened with Apple Preview application.  But, when opened with
Adobe Reader 7.0, the text on page 1 is OK but the text on page 2 is crowded
over to the right with 80 per cent of the text missing.  Going through exactly
the same steps with Apple Safari or the German Beta version 2.9.8 of iCab does
NOT produce the problem.  So, though it's possible that Adobe Reader is causing
 the improper formatting of the page two of the PDF file, it is only with
Firefox that the problem arises. I am using OS 10.3.8 on a Mac desktop G4
Quicksilver and the printer driver is Hewlett Packard HP Inkjet 2.5.  The
Firefox version is 1.0.1.
