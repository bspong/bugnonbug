This is happening with FF 3.5. It did not happen with FF 3.0.11.

If I try to compose a message within my webmail provider (www.mail.com), there is a text entry box at the bottom in which I type my email content.  The text entry box allows for one line of text to be much longer than what can fit on one screen. FF3.0.11 would simply allow the words to wrap, but FF 3.5 insists on putting up a horizontal scrollbar.  However, the scrollbar is not rendered at all, meaning that I cannot display the rightmost portion of each line.  A similar problem happens vertically too.  The rendering of the text box border is corrupt at the bottom and right hand side owing to the absence of the scrollbars.  Look at my screenshot for an explanation - where my mouse pointer is, the border is rendered as though there is a scrollbar at the bottom, but there is not.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Type a long sentence without carriage returns into the text box.
2.  The cursor and text that is being entered will disappear off the screen.



Expected Results:  
The text entry box should word wrap or else the scrollbars should appear.
