choosing a "monospaced" font in the Options dialog

When the list of available fonts is presented in the Firefox prefs dialog, the function GDIFontEntry::MatchesGenericFamily() is used to determine if fonts match the CSS generics such as "serif", "sans-serif", or "monospace". This is done using the "windows family" property of the fonts.

In the Prefs dialog, this is used to sort "matching" fonts into the first section of the font list, and the remaining families appear in a second section of the list.

However, many fonts do not provide the proper metadata for Windows to classify them in this way, but are simply marked as FF_DONTCARE. This is especially true for non-Latin fonts, but also for many third-party Latin fonts. The result is that these fonts appear in the first (preferred) section of the list even when this is not appropriate; moreover, they appear in the first section of the list for ALL the generics (serif, sans, and monospace).

The attached screenshot shows the font list being used to select a "monospace" font; note that the list mixes many non-monospaced fonts in with the valid monospaced ones, so that the user is given little help in making an appropriate choice.
