Web access to LiveConnect tests is broken & Moz.org should include OJI tests as part of its regular testsuite

The OJI test cases at mozilla.org (http://www.mozilla.org/quality/browser/front-end/testcases/oji/) includes coverage for: applet tag, LiveConnect, and applet lifecycle.

Of these, front end access to LiveConnect test cases:
http://www.mozilla.org/quality/browser/front-end/testcases/oji/liveconnecttest.html
has been broken.
(Possibly a regression caused by https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=360039)

The backend files behind that LiveConnect webpage is still alive:

These tests are valuable sanity check for Java interoperability with Mozilla browser and even though they are labeled OJI, they're actually generic for all Java Plugin.

Please put front end access back for these LiveConnect tests.

Plus, please consider including all OJI testcases as part of Mozilla's regular manual or automatic testsuite if it's not already the case.
With large volume of bugs reported in the area of Java Plugin operating with Mozilla browser, Sun is in the process to work with Mozilla.org for better way for both sides to QoS our products.
Fixing access to these existing testcases and adding them as part of Mozilla's regular test would be a nice start. Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.mozilla.org/quality/browser/front-end/testcases/oji/liveconnecttest.html. None of JS-J and J-JS can be accessed from web front end.
2. view of back end files for those tests is here: http://bonsai-www.mozilla.org/rview.cgi?dir=mozilla-org/html/quality/browser/front-end/testcases/oji&cvsroot=/www&module=default
