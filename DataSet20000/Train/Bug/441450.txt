Fails to render text file while accessing via in-url FTP access (including user:pass formatting)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

When I attempt to access a private text file, I am prompted with a directory list (containing no files), and the text file being requested is not rendered within the browser. So for example, if I were to request - ftp://user:pass@12.34.56.789/myfile.txt - the file will not load.

However, if I use a backslash *after* the file being requested, the text does load. So, the request will work if I use the following format: ftp://user:pass@12.34.56.789/myfile.txt\

While I'm certain that backslash serves no purpose at actually rendering the document properly, it obviously does interrupt the normal course of action undertaken by the browser.

I can't speculate as to why the text file isn't loading and if this also happens with other files.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set up a password protected FTP account
2. Request a private file using that FTP account information (ftp://user:pass@1.2.3.4/file.txt)
3. Request the same file but add backslash to end of URL to work properly
Actual Results:  
I'm sent to the FTP index ("Index of ftp://user@11.22.33.44/file.txt/") and I'm presented with an empty directory chart of "Name / Size / Last Modified" with an option (link) to move up to higher level directory. The request is rendered properly when adding a backslash to the end of the URL.

Expected Results:  
Loaded the text file within the browser.
