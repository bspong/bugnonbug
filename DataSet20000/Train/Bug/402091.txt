Fonts looking squeezed and smaller in a page not in English

I created two screenshots for you: you can see Safari in MacOs on the left, Firefox in MacOs on the middle and Firefox in Vista on the right. 

--------------------------------------------------------- 
1. Showing English page:

as you can see - there's no problems at all - all fonts look similar and the positioning is as correct as it should be 
---------------------------------------------------------- 
2. Showing localized (Russian) page:

and here you may notice that Firefox in MacOS has some serious troubles with fonts looking "squeezy and smaller" and the possitioning goes to hell. At the same time Safari and Firefox in Vista shows the page the way it should be. 
---------------------------------------------------------- 

Also I would like to point out that 
1. I never changed any font settings for Firefox in MacOS from its defaults 
2. As you may see Safari in Mac Os shows the page exactly as Firefox in Vista so all fonts needed are present and fine
3. Problems with fonts and positioning for localized pages in FireFox for Mac go way further while surfing more complex pages which makes it almost impossible for comfortable browsing

Reproducible: Always

1. just navigate to any russian site
2.
3.
Actual Results:
