No sound at all, and no icon available in mixer (64 bit only)

I'm running Firefox Nightly on Windows Vista Home Premium x64 on an HP Pavilion m9458f, all original hardware.  Firefox Aurora and previous versions all have sound, however Firefox 7.0a1 (2011-05-30) has neither sound nor an icon in the Volume Mixer.  I have verified all of my out-put channels, and there is no icon whatsoever for Firefox.

This issue is reproducible on every audio site I have tried up to now.  Ex.: HTML Audio tag, HTML 5 Video tag, YouTube with Flash, Google Translate.  Another interesting phenomena is Grooveshark.com, where audio will not even begin playback in Firefox Nightly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox Nightly
2. Goto any site that should have audio (whether built-in HTML 5, or plugin with Flash)
3. Try to play sound, and check volume mixer.

Actual Results:  
No sound is played, and no icon is present in the Mixer.  This is only the case with the latest release of Firefox.  All previous version work fine.

Expected Results:  
I expect sound to hear sound, obviously, and I would also expect there to be an icon in the Windows Vista sound mixer.
