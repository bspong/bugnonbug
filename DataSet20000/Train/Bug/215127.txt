After downloading a file the pages main scroll bar will no longer respond to the
mouse wheel and can no longer be dragged up and down.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on the download link
2.Enter the path to save the file and click save
3.Return to the web page
4.Download window pops up informing download finished


Actual Results:  
The scroll bar would only respond to the arrow buttons at the top and bottom
clicking on it and dragging or using the mouse wheel have no effect on it. Other
windows and tabs seem uneffected.

Expected Results:  
Continued to function as it had before the download, ie. scroll bars responding
to dragging and mouse wheel

I am not sure exactly when the scroll bar stopped working whether it was after
the download started or after it was done. It seemed to occur, however, just
after the download window stole focus to say it had finished so I suspect it had
more to do with the focus change than the download itself, but this is only
speculation.
