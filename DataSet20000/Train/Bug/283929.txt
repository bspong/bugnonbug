REPRO
The trick to repro'ing the bug is having a Windows (File) Explorer open to the
folder .
ex. C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Application
Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\lv2e3i8u.default\Cache

I have repro'd on a few WinXP Pro + SP2 computers .  On one WinXP Home + SP2 I
was not able to repro .


USER SCENARIO

In IE , there is an option to view the "Temporary Internet Files" Folder .  With
IE you can "view" , and while "viewing" clear it successfully .  A paranoid ,
*advanced* person might do the eqivalent in Firefox . 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox
2. Navigate to a few sites
3. Press WinKey+E 
4. Enter path , ex. C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Application
Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\lv2e3i8u.default\Cache .
Note: "cache" is included in path .
5. Click Tools -> Options
6. Click Privacy -> Cashe -> Clear

Actual Results:  

The folder will be deleted , and Windows Explorer window will close .   My guess
is it is a file lock issue .

The same behavior is experienced in Firefox 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 .


IMPACT
The impact is that once the folder is deleted , no caching will take place to
file until the folder is recreated after shutdown and restart of Netscape .

Also , the Clear button is not disabled while the option window stays open .

Expected Results:  
The cache should be cleared without removing the folder .  Nor should Windows
Explorer be affected (ie closed) .
