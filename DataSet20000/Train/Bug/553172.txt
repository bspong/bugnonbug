ff36 immediately quits (no crash!) when quit and started for 2nd time

When migrating from ff3.5 i can start ff3.6 only once.
When I try to start it the second time, ff3.6 exits with exitstatus 1.
ff does not crash! it just terminates

When I disable all extensions ff3.6 seems to become restartable again,
but i cannot pinpoint any particular installed extension/theme.

However I observed, that at some point when re-enabling extensions
the stdout/err of ff shows messages like this

** Message: GetValue variable 1 (1)
** Message: GetValue variable 2 (2)
** Message: GetValue variable 1 (1)
** Message: GetValue variable 2 (2)
** Message: GetValue variable 1 (1)
** Message: GetValue variable 2 (2)
** Message: GetValue variable 1 (1)
** Message: GetValue variable 2 (2)
** Message: GetValue variable 1 (1)
** Message: GetValue variable 2 (2)

the problem will commence. Starting ff35 shows the same message with
the same extension set, but runs normally.

I repeat that i cannot pinpoint any particular extension as i tried to
install/uninstall them in different orders. The only constant seems to
be that ALL extensions have to be removed.

Removing/reinstalling instead of disabling/enabling extensions seems to
make no difference. Themes count as extension, whereas plugins don't.

The most peculiar thing is that after starting ff35 once, i
can start ff36 *once* again. Restarting ff36 with the "restart" button
from withing ff36 does not count as a second start.

Reproducible: Always




i am running debian/lenny i386
