Existing window has toolbar icons only; open new window shows icons and text
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

I just upgraded to Firefox 4.0.  I configured my toolbar to display the "icons" choice instead of "icons and text" and indeed, no text is displayed next to the toolbar icons.  Then I press the "New Window" icon in the toolbar.  A new window opens which shows the same toolbar but with "icons and text" displayed. Using the customize dialog I can switch it back to only "icons", but every time I open a new window, the new window displays both "icons and text".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox.  Configure toolbar buttons to only show "icons".  Ensure that one of the toolbar buttons is the "New Window" icon.
2. Press the "New Window" icon.
3. A new window is popped up that displays text with the icons in the toolbar.


Expected Results:  
The new window should have only displayed the icons in the toolbar, not the icons and text; I expect the new window's options/configuration to be exactly the same as the original window that launched it.

I am using the default theme.  I have the web developer add-on, the firebug add-on, edit css add-on, inspect add-on, JSView add-on, Addblock Plus add-on, and a few other add-ons.
