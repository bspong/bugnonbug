Since upgrading to Firefox 3.6 I have noticed that after visiting the forum where I am a moderator, the history menu is clogged up with links from the ad banners (described only as "ads"). The links to the banner ads were never opened. This never happened in earlier versions, and since I never opened the links, they should not be listed anyway.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to GHPF (see url).
2. Move to another site or the home page (I use blank).
3. Click on History to get the drop down menu.
Actual Results:  
Links to several banner ads (described only as "ads") appear on the history menu that were never visited are listed.

Expected Results:  
Only links to places that I actually have visited should have been listed.

The history settings that I use are:
