Let a privileged page allow users to enable the video casting preference
(I was talking with WesJ about this and he indicated that browser casting to Roku is disabled because people were concerned about the browser pinging the router for devices.)

I didn't see the Reset discussion, but I'm guessing the in-page preference prompt was added as a way to expose non-obvious/hidden functionality as well as providing explanation.

If casting is not a preference that will be toggled on by default in the near future, a similar approach could be advantageous.  Create a privileged page which can bring up a prompt to enable casting.

This could be really nice because:
a) The first thing many people do when encountering a question is to do a search. Better to have the top landing page actually *contain* the solution than instructions on how to make the change - especially as the solution currently lies within about:config.
b) Streaming product providers (such as Roku, Matchstick, TVs?) could link their users directly to this page - and not have to worry if the instructions are up-to-date.
c) We can include an explanation and a short usage tutorial (with pictures or video).

An additional thought is to set up redirection URLs such as firefox.com/casting and /fling (etc).
