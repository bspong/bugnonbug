CPU hogging in version 3.0.5

CPU hogging bug in version 3.0.5 is MUCH worse than in 3.0.4. This is a chance to understand this particular bug by examining the differences between 3.0.4 and 3.0.5.

Possibly the bug is in the keyboard handler, or the way the keyboard handler interacts with Windows XP SP3, all patches applied up to January 12, 2009.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open many windows and tabs, a common occurrence for those who do research.
2. Hibernate the OS several times.
3.

Actual Results:  
After the CPU hogging starts, when opening a new window, it takes about 15 seconds until the new window will accept typing into the URL box. Until then, no keyboard input is accepted.

This bug also slows all computer operations.


Expected Results:  
Normally a new window accepts keyboard input immediately after it is opened. 


Process Explorer version v11.32 shows in the "CPU Time" column that Firefox CPU usage is far greater than any other program that is running. At present, on the computer I am using to file this bug, Firefox is peaking at 77.8% CPU usage with no activity, shown in the "CPU" column. There is sometimes a delay between the time I type a character and the time the character is displayed.

Process Explorer is available free:

Firefox 3.0.4 was not perfect, but it was far better than 3.0.5. The old 2.0 versions of Firefox were far worse.

This bug is different than the CPU hogging caused by faulty interaction with Flash-based videos (.FLV file extension). (Yes, I know that Flash has a history of being very poorly written.)

These things seem important: 

1) There is the likelihood that finding what causes this bug will be far easier because the problem became abruptly worse in the transition from 3.0.4 to 3.0.5.

2) This bug has existed since the 0.9 versions of Mozilla, the old name for Firefox. In those versions it was much more severe.

3) Firefox's CPU hogging bug causes the destruction of laptops. The CPU hogging causes laptop fans to operate far more than they otherwise would. The CPU fan is normally the first part in a laptop that fails. The fans are generally very expensive to replace. Many users just buy a new laptop.

4) Possibly some resource is being overused. In this installation that is failing, the bookmarks.html file is 2,498,314 bytes. The places.sqlite file is 7,278,592 bytes.

5) Since this bug seems to concern a major misunderstanding of how Firefox works, it seems that fixing it may cure other problems also.

6) I recently completely removed Firefox 3.0.4 from this computer and re-installed it. That cured a bug of not being able to display Google maps.

7) Conditions: Default theme. Windows XP SP3, all patches applied except those provided by Microsoft last Tuesday, 2009-01-13.

Add-ons: Adblock Plus, Colorful Tabs, DownloadHelper, Firebug, Flashblock, JSView, NoScript, PDF Download, Session Manager, Tab Mix Plus, Web Developer, Web of Trust. All the latest versions, except Adblock Plus and DownloadHelper are the versions just before the latest.

However: Web Developer is disabled. Web Developer, JSView, and Firebug were added since Firefox 3.0.5 was installed.

8) If this bug is blamed on Add-ons, then there needs to be a way users can troubleshoot Add-on CPU use.

9) This bug is several years old, and in the past always occurred with no add-ons. Improvements in lessening CPU hogging occurred with improvements in Firefox. 

10) It is VERY inconvenient, before the research is finished, to close all the tabs and windows and restart the Windows OS to regain control of the computer. In the past, letting Session Manager reload the Firefox windows and tabs only brought back a CPU-hogging session. I have not tried that often, because in the past Session Manager would throw away URLS if they took too long to load.
