In our intranet site, we have css drop-downs that occur in the menu. On one
page, we embed flash under the menu. The menus drop-down fine and we can roll
over them. As soon as the cursor hits the flash object, however, the menus
disappear. We have noticed that this doesn't occur on ie on a pc.

http://www.target.com seems to have partially solved the problem, but when their
flash object plays or loops, the menus disappear for them as well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. http://www.target.com
2. mouse over a menu item
3. drop down into the flash object, still hovering over the menu

Actual Results:  
The menu css menu disappears when you enter into the flash object or exit out of it.

Expected Results:  
Allowed me to continue seeing the menu and choose the area!

We tested this in different themes and it was the same in all. We tried it on
three different macs (osX) and it was the same for all.
