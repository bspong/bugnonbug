I am indicating that this is a major issue.  I have experienced memory leaks with Firefox for a very long time, but I have been respectful of the developers' time by not posting bugs without detailed information.  This has finally reached a critical point of frustration for me, and I will try to provide as much information as possible.  The significant majority of my leaks are experienced during difficult-to-reproduce circumstances which include a combination of extensions, preferences, and browsing history that would cause a developer to reject the bug despite its seriousness.  Instead I will present low-magnitude leaks such as the above, so that there is no excuse for disregarding pleas for help from users such as myself.  However I expect this to be taken seriously, because otherwise I can have no hope that the other problems I experience will ever be addressed.
