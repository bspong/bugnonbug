Error message when launching app with url from start -> run and other methods (DDECache reg key)
This does not affect the trunk for some unknown reason... perhaps a change in MSVC8. Changing the following in nsNativeAppSupportWin.cpp fixes this bug but is obviously wallpaper. If this is used #ifdef MOZ_PHOENIX should probably be added as well. Even if the app is still running removing this key does no harm though I suspect there is a slight perf impact. I have not been able to find any info about the DDECache reg key addition.

     mw.Destroy();

         // Undo registry setting if we need to.
