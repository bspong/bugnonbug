External deletion of cache causes problems
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090630 Fedora/3.5-1.fc11 Firefox/3.5

I have a daily backup script that deletes my Firefox cache before updating the backup copy of my home directory.  This happens while Firefox is running, since I usually have lots of tabs open.  It is undesirable to backup caches, because they are large, constantly changing, and their contents aren't needed in the event of a restore.

The problem is that every morning I must manually flush my cache from within Firefox in order for cached pages to load properly.

It would be nice if either there was a way to flush the cache properly from the command line, or if Firefox handled missing cache files without any user intervention.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
* Load a page in Firefox.
* Close the tab the page is in.
* Delete ~/.mozilla/firefox/xxxxxxxx.default/Cache
* Load the page again.

Actual Results:  
Firefox cannot load the cached content.  For HTML pages, this often results in the page not displaying at all.  For CSS only, the HTML gets rendered without CSS being applied to it.

Expected Results:  
When the content is not available from the cache, it should be reloaded from the network.

Bug 107322 describes the same problem, but is filed against Mozilla Core.  It is pointed out there that cache files can also go missing as a result of software or hardware malfunctions.
