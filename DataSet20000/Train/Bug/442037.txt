Zooming in/out on large images using keyboard functions unexpectedly

When viewing an image greater than the size of the current window, it is automatically resized to fit.  In this situation, pressing the keyboard shortcuts for zoom in/out (ctrl+plus, ctrl+minus, respectively) does not work as users would expect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ensure your FF window is smaller than you test image
2. Open a large image - see example URL
3. Observe that the image is resized to fit your window
4. Press ctrl+plus five times
5. Observe that the image gets larger
6. Press ctrl+minus with the intention of zooming out slightly
Actual Results:  
7. The image jumps back to about 90% of its original (fitted) size

Expected Results:  
7. The image is reduced in size slightly, to a size equivalent to having pressed ctrl+plus exactly four times in step 4
i.e. pressing ctrl+minus should be the exact opposite of pressing ctrl+plus (as it is when zooming entire HTML pages)

- this only affects images which are automatically resized to fit the window
- this problem appears not to happen when you use the View->Zoom menu instead of the keyboard, which strikes me as a little strange
