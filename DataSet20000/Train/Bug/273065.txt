If I wana make a scroll on one webpage the middleclick occurs when over an link,
when you just wana make a scroll and a new tab opens without my consens.
If middle click will have no funtion then even if you just wana make a scroll
and missclick on middleclick button you will not have to close tabs that open
rapidly, and it is  more easy to rightclick on an opened tab to close it instead
of middleclick.
