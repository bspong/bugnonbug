Build ID: 20150806001005

Steps to reproduce:

log onto a clean version of firefox ... open face book ...
scroll it, read some stories and look at some photos...

during the use of facebook the firewall reports repeated invasions/port scanning...

this only happens with facebook (verified) including happening after ip change from ADSL adapter reboot (but only after opening facebook)


direct memory manipulation and driver injection suspected...


Actual results:

kernel errors ... security key mismatch... system closedown/crash...
driver error, memory leak, registery fail with inability to boot windows...

multiple fails, the last of which made me re install windows because it failed my update to windows 10 and windows no longer worked...

i found a cure but it involves manually altering system files before boot in hirans bd
because the error happened to windows 10 and the first time it did both my system restore points and my registery where fucked...

at that time there where no restore points (i had made about 15 by then because of what happened to windows 8.1)

i suspect a virus but no virus found....
direct memory manipulation and driver injection suspected...


Expected results:

clean system
