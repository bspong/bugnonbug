Qwant icon not correctly displayed on about:home and about:newtab
To reproduce, install the Qwant plugin from https://www.qwant.com/ (https://www.qwant.com/opensearch.xml).

1. Notice that the Qwant icon is displayed fine in the searchbar, both when Qwant is a one-off button (http://i.imgur.com/WkrNn6m.png) and when Qwant is set as the default (http://i.imgur.com/57mqTM6.png)

2. On the about:home page, the Qwant icon fails to display as a one-off button, we display a generic glass icon instead (http://i.imgur.com/1TuiyDW.png). It also fails to display when Qwant is set as the default, and in that case we even fail to display the fallback glass icon (http://i.imgur.com/AZR2N6A.png).

3. When changing the search default to Qwant while the about:home page is already loaded (eg. by using the "Set As Default Search Engine" context menu item of a one-off button in the panel of the search bar), the search panel of the about:home page keeps displaying the icon of the previous default. Eg. in http://i.imgur.com/XARDKIY.png the DuckDuckGo icon is displayed next to Qwant's name.

4. The about:newtab page also fails to display the Qwant icon, but displays a different globe icon as a fallback: http://i.imgur.com/LY8oFHh.png
