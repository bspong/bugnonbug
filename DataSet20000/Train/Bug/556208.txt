"return" button of Hotmail does not perform well with Firefox3.6.2
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; fr; rv:1.9.2.2) Gecko/20100316 Firefox/3.6.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Since Firefox 3.6 has been released, hotmail has no longer been working properly.
Difficult or impossible to foraward messages or answer messages (the original message was not displayed on the screen).
This seems to have been settled.

But remains a major problem : the return button does no longer allow to go back to previous page on hotmail.
Was working perfectly well on Firefox 3.5.7. 
I have checked with IE8 : no problem at all.

The usage of the "return" button is a "must" with hotmail, especially when you are keeping messages in files.
When you open a message that is in the middle of page 3 of a file, only the return button allows to, at least, go back to page 3. If you click on he file, you go straight back to page 1.

The most annoying thing is that I there was no problem whatsoever with Firefox3.5.7.

I am not too sure that the problem is coming from Firefox. I have tried Opera, and they are having the same malfunctions.
But I am sure that there is NO problem on IE8.

This has been going on for weeks already, I have sent you lots of warnings.
I even had the chance to have Microsoft France on the phone.

But days after days, weeks after weeks, problem(s) persist(s).

Reproducible: Always
