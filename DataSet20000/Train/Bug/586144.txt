Pages using google javascript files take incredibly long to load when behind a proxy server
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042708 Fedora/3.0.10-1.fc9 Firefox/3.0.10
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042708 Fedora/3.0.10-1.fc9 Firefox/3.0.10

I'm currently on a network behind a simple proxy (Squid) which limits access to some pages and offers some caching services. I have already checked the proxy configuration files and it does not block the google websites in any way. Bypassing the proxy makes the pages work correctly, setting Firefox to use the proxy makes all such pages take an incredible amount of time to load (over a minute for the google homepage). I have checked proxy settings and they are correct, the page does display but only after an incredible amount of time. 
Checking the Squid access log, I noticed a lot of TCP_MISSes, but more importantly the proxy server seems to be spending a great amount of time between TCP_MISS/302 (HTTP redirects). 
This problem did not occur in IE8 and Konqueror and seems to be an issue with Firefox. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup a Proxy server in the network using Squid
2. Configure Firefox to use the proxy
3. Try connecting to google.com, google-analytics.com or other such sites
Actual Results:  
webpages only load after an incredible amount of time (more than one minute for the google homepage, others do not progress in tens of minutes...)

Expected Results:  
Load the webpage in a reasonable amount of time ( IE8 loads this page in less than one second, as well as other such pages)
