Actively update bookmarks file so it can be shared by multiple profiles

if you use multiple profiles but use 1 bookmark file,
ex  ~/.phoenix/default/xxxxxxx.slt  uses bookmark file ~/.phoenix/bookmark.html
    ~/.phoenix/default2/xxxxxxx.slt  uses bookmark file ~/.phoenix/bookmark.html

by setting in prefs.js in both profiles prefs.js files:
user_prefs("browser.bookmarks.file", "~/.phoenix/bookmark.html");

then you create a bookmark in profile default2 and close default2 firebird, then
close default firebird the bookmarks you created in default2 are lost.  But if
you create bookmarks in default2 firebird then close default firebird then close
default2 firebird it works the way expected...but if you create booksmarks in
both profiles you are kinda screwed...

i would assume the cause is the browser isnt saving the bookmarks until exiting
but this kinda causes a problem because it will overwrite the other profiles
changes...tabs are great but sometimes a new browser is nice too.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.configure 2 profiles of firebird to use same bookmark file
2.create bookmarks in both profiles ... and exit all firebirds
3.you lose which ever firebird exits first bookmarks

Actual Results:  
which ever profile i close first looses the new bookmarks i created

Expected Results:  
save both profiles' bookmarks

its pretty simple ... you are having the browser save upon exiting but by doing
this you will over right the changes made by the first profile that exits.  you
should save to the bookmark.html file when a bookmark is added not when exiting. 

even cooler would be if the bookmarks access button would actively check the
bookmarks file for changes, but this might cause a slow down and having to exit
to reload the bookmarks isnt a big deal.  of course i also check my mail every
5min and that doesnt seem to cause a slow down.
