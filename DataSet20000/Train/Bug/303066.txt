Installation of Firefox 1.0.6 breaks Flashplayer & Shockwave functionality
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Firefox/1.0.6

I ONLY see this issue with Firefox 1.0.6, Opera on the same system - using the
same installed plug-ins is perfectly fine. When visiting sites that use either
Flashplayer, or Shockwave Media plug-ins via Firefox 1.0.6 none of these
features work. The Flash Media Buttons at sites (*.swf) are not viewable in the
way they are intended, and sites where Shockwave media is running - i.e.
http://www.macromedia.com - all I see are the panels allocated for the media and
a "Quicktime Q" with a "?" over the top. I have Quicktime installed, and
operational 

Flashplayer is v. 7.0.19.0
Shockwave is v. 10.1r11

Both are the latest available from the sites (I have also tried the Beta v8 of
Flashplayer - to no avail)

Re-installation of Firefox 1.0.4 and removal of Firefox 1.0.6 resolves the issue

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Firefox 1.0.6 over an exixting installation of Flashplayer and Shockwave
2.Visit http://www.macromedia.com - observe failed function of both flash & shock
3.

Actual Results:  
The Flash Media Buttons at sites (*.swf) are not viewable in the way they are
intended, and sites where Shockwave media is running - i.e.
http://www.macromedia.com - all I see are the panels allocated for the media and
a "Quicktime Q" with a "?" over the top. I have Quicktime installed, and
operational 

Expected Results:  
I would expect to see "flash media buttons" and "shockwave media" to be
played/observed as I do in Firefox 1.0.4 and Opera 8.02
