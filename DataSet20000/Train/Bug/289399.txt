Activity indicator does not stop, URL bar problems

In one tab I loaded some page and noticed that the activity indicator of the
tabs (not the common one in the menu bar, but the on in the tab "ear") was still
spinning.
I loaded another (simple) page and the indicator just kept on spinning.
No matter what I loaded (successfuly) , the indicator does not stop.
I load pages in other tabs and there is not problem, just the first tabs
indicator is always spinning.

Also there problems with the URL bar of the problematic tab :
 - does not expnad URL: I enter "foo", it loads "http://foo", but keeps
displaying "foo"
 - no matter what page I visit, the favicon of the first page is always displayed
 - sometimes, if I look at another tabs and then go back to the first, the
favicon of the other page is still displayed
 - if I open a HTTPS page in another tab and go look at the first, the URL bar
keeps the yellow backround,  even if the page is plain HTTP

(first tab=the problematic tab, with the spinning indicator)

I am not sure how to reproduce. Maybe a site that loads slowly or times out
triggers it.
