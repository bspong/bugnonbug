Firefox crashes anytime that you try to launch the Oracle JInitiator with any version of firefox outside of 3.5.2

Even on that version, some recently updated to it, will not work. When opening up the program "Banner" used for school records for a university. 

The software at first was working on Firefox and IE. Later IE 7 stopped supporting it, and IE8 does not support it at all. Leaving Firefox to be the only one left. Over time, since Firefox has updated, it stopped supporting it as well. Forcing us (computer techs) to put on an old version of Firefox (sometimes going back to v2.20) in order for it to work. I know that because of the newer features I've managed to get it to work at 3.5.2, as a way to also install the AdBlocker Plus add-on. Now with 3.6.11 being out, we would like to upgrade all of our systems (over 500 users), but we cannot.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://webbanner.nova.edu
2.Click on the "Launch Banner" button
3.Firefox will crash.
Actual Results:  
Firefox Crashed and required restart.

Expected Results:
