A new tab is opened and at the time of opening the url/awesome/location bar is hidden(tried placing it on both menu and navigation bar). Unhiding the awesome bar's menu(or navigation) bar, the cursor for writing url is not there. Clicking on the bar places the cursor on the line "Search Bookmarks and History" instead of clearing this line. Writing something shows in the same thin, italics font as the line "Search Bookmarks and History". The problem solves by clicking on the bottom part of the browser(anywhere on the new blank page) and clicking back on the awesome bar. Though I use ToggleMenubar for using hotkey to hide the toolbar but it cannot be causing the issue as I tried placing the awesome bar on the navigation bar and hiding-unhiding manually.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Hide the toolbar(navigation bar by default) having the awesome bar
2. Open new tab
3. Try clicking on the awesome bar(the line 'Search Bookmarks and History')
Actual Results:  
The line "Search Bookmarks and History" doesn't disappear

Expected Results:  
The line should disappear and present blank awesome bar

I use the default theme. I think the problem is in the newest version of firefox as earlier versions didnt have the default line "Search Bookmarks and History" in awesome bar
