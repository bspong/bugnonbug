browser.urlbar.trimURL should default to false
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:7.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0.1
Build ID: 20110928134238

Steps to reproduce:

Upgraded to Firefox 7.


Actual results:

http:// in Location Bar stopped appearing.


Expected results:

browser.urlbar.trimURL should be false by default.  While it is a nice looking feature, and does make it look cleaner, it will cause more difficulties long-term than the benefits.

First, it will make invalid URIs when copying and pasting.  Email, IM, and other clients may then not interpret it correctly unless the one pasting manually puts the http:// back in each time.  If they do not, then everyone receiving it may be forced to manually copy and paste it into their browser instead of having a clickable link.  And for long URLs that may not be possible if the client splits it up over multiple lines because it did not recognize it as a valid URI.

Second, I do tech support over the phone.  A large amount of the time I ask someone to type a simple URL into their browser, they put it into the Search Bar instead of the Address/Location Bar.  The only consistent cross-browser way I can have them find the correct spot is to "look for the line near the top starting with 'http.'"  This feature will make it harder for the very people having the most difficulty and least understanding of the browser.  Which in turn makes it harder for me. :-)

However, advertising this feature in some manner, and letting those that have a comfortable understanding of how their browser works and its components choose it, I feel would be a better means of enabling it.
