Under Windows XP, the Operating System's "right click on file in explorer.exe" select "open with" and choose submenu "choose program" feature can have a very long delay before the "Open With" Dialog is presented. It is extra slow the first time you do it after a fresh reboot.


If you visit this Page:

there is a link to a video here: http://videos.amddevmedia.com/bulldozer/BulldozerFinalwebstream.mp4 if you click it then (it would have been nice if VLC had opened it since I have the plug-in but that was not to be) you can choose "Other" but after some time this Dialog will popup:

-----

A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete.

Script: chrome://global/content/appPicker.js:154

[Continue] [Stop Script]

-----

IF you [Continue] the Script twice (sometimes three times) then the Windows XP Operating System's "Open With" Dialog will (finally) appear and you can choose VLC. Control then returns to Firefox, the file is downloaded and then opened in VLC.


Thanks,
