I'm on my own personal computer which no one else uses, so I have it set where all sites I go to auto-saves my passwords and i'm always logged in on them.
Since I've upgraded to Firefox3.0.3 Every time after I restart my computer and open FireFox, all my sites I've logged into have logged me out...
Personally, I hate having to go through the login steps each time I first a site that I have to log into.
I never had a problem when It came to this before, since I upgraded to FireFox3.0.3.
If I just close Firefox and re-open it without restarting, the sites I logged into will still have me logged it, the problem only happens when I restart my Computer.
Either the problem is in the area of the security section, or it's a problem with the recognizing of site cookie data.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log onto site that requires a User/Pass with Firefox.
2. Close Firefox.
3. Restart Computer.
Actual Results:  
4. Open FireFox again.
5. Not logged in anymore on that site I entered the User/Pass

Expected Results:  
Login on site should have been still logged in.

It's not a theme or plugin error, becasue i've disabled all of them and it still does it.
