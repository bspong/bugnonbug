Scripts apparently slowing browser in 3.6. - 3.5.7 OK.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6

Upon visiting the example site, *something* slams the CPU to 100 percent for up to several minutes, effectively stalling the browser and making even mouse movement unresponsive.   Note that you do not need to actually log in or have an accunt...the home page demonstrates the issue.  

This same page works fine and remains responsive in 3.5.7.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to www.usaa.com
2.move mouse around and scroll up/down the page with wheel or slider bar
3.Note CPU usage jump for excessive time (up to 2 min on a 550 Mhz Pentium 3 w/266 megs ram. has been observed.)
4.Wait until CPU drops to 'normal' levels.  Repeat #2. Symptoms re-occur.
Actual Results:  
Browser becomes unresponsive as CPU is maxed out.  Nearly impossible to recover by moving away from the site as mouse basically stops.

Expected Results:  
Continued responsiveness to mouse and keyboard.

The example page appears to have multiple scripts and at least one flash instance doing who-knows-what.  

I have reported the problem also to USAA as this is a banking/insurance site that has a lot of users who will be affected.

Happens even with a 'virgin' FF 3.6 (all history/cookies removed) and only one tab in use.

If it's a buggy script hogging the machine, FF needs to escape the trap by killing the errant process so the user maintains some semblance of control.

Listed as critical since older version does not seem to have the issues, machine hangs, and it hopefully can be addressed before 3.6 is in wide use.
