ASK appeared as a default search engine on Firefox start up page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 GTB6 (.NET CLR 2.0.50727)

Suddenly the FireFox search provider changed from Google to ASK. From info on Mozilla support,I tried to change back to Google,by entering "about.config" in the new tab, typing "keyword.url" in the filter text box, double clicking on "keyword.url", selecting change, and typing the default value as: "http://www.google.com/search?q=". The system does not recognize this change, and when I bring up FireFox,"ASK" still comes up as the default search engine. I have checked, and my change still shows in keyword.url.
I have tried ASK, and it really stinks in comparison to Google. It's almost like ASK is a virus that does not allow change. Where did ASK come from? Was it contained in one of your updates?
