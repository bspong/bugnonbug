The keyboard navigation indicators (the underlines you find in Windows) in Contents Pane in Options window are duplicated.  specifically:

1.  Load _i_mages automatically and S_i_ze

2.  _D_efault font and A_d_vanced (for Fonts & Colours)

(NB. Above underlines depict where the underlines are located.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load option windows
2. Attempt to use keyboard to navigate to "Load images automatically" (alt-I) OR to "Default font" (alt-d)

Actual Results:  
Focus goes to "Size" and "Advanced" (for Fonts and Colours) respectively.

Expected Results:  
Focus goes to "Load images automatically" and "Default font" respectively.

The bug affects ALL VERSIONS OF WINDOWS (and probably Linux too - but untested).  (Any operating system which uses keyboard navigation indicators).  It does not affect Mac OS X.

I am using en-gb -- is this reflected in non-English or American English (en-us) builds?

It is a NORMAL bug but should be quite critical for Firefox 2.0 final -- this is a usability issue which affects users with disability and Firefox should be an accessible browser.
