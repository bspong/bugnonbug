I have been saving pages from http://affiliate.zap2it.com/tvlistings/ for later reviewing. These pages are in a grid form. Yesterday, I noted that the saved pages no longer display correctly. Things are not in their proper positions. I have noted the following:

I saved some of these pages using Firefox 1.5.0.8, later (as of 05/23/08) Firefox 2.0, later (as of 06/20/08) Firefox 3.0.

I noted that as of 05/21/08, the file size of the saved pages was less than the file size of previous pages. The older pages with the larger file size still display correctly. The newer ones do not. (I will forward copies on request).

Pages saved using Internet Explorer (which are even smaller than the Firefox pages after 05/21/08) display correctly.

The only add-on I have is No-Script. I suspect that the No-Script add-on may be the culprit in this case.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.load saved page
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
page displays incorrectly. Things are not in their proper location.
