Clicking on "About Me" picture terminates FireFox 3.0.3.  No warnings, task just disappears (crashes).  When page is loading, if "Waiting on i3.ytimg.com..." shows, page loads successfully.  Last message is "Loading s.ytimg.com", if completes, task goes down.  If task remains up, click on "About Me" picture opens up http://www.blog.co.uk/user/rajtakhar has similar results.  It crashes less if right clicking and selecting "Open link in a new window" with tabbed browsing on.  However, I turned off Tabbed Browsing, restarted FireFox and even opening a new window by clicking picture crashes task.  There is something different about these pages that causes the crashing.  So far, it has not happened on any other site I have visited, all FireFox versions for past 3 years.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open http://gp2xwiznpandora.blog.co.uk/
2.  If status bar shows "Waiting on i3.ytimg.com....", FireFox remains up.
3.  If status bar shows "Loading s.ytimg.com....", FireFox crashes shortly after.

Actual Results:  
FireFox task crashes without warning, just disappears.

Expected Results:  
FireFox should successfully load page.
