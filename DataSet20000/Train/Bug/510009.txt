Clicking a link with "mailto:xxx" opens an infinite number of tabs.

This has happened with multiple websites, including those I am running from my local machine.  

The link is to "mailto:xxxx".  It should attempt to open the default mail server. Instead, it is opening multiple tabs over and over again.  I closed the browser, and it opened itself back up.  I had to force quit Firefox to terminate the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an html file with <a href="mailto:someaddress@xxx.com">Email us</a>
2. Click the link.
Actual Results:  
Many, many tabs opened up and paraded across the browser screen.  I had to force quit Firefox to some the process.

Expected Results:  
Mailto links should open the default email server.  If no email server is established, it should present a message box to that effect.

I'm a user of Firefox, not a developer.  I actually work on mainframes.  The problem is annoying, but is probably restricted to the Mac version I am running.  I don't think I have a default mail server setup anywhere on the system, but I'm not sure.  I use Internet mail exclusively.
