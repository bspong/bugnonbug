I have been watching this for some time now (almost a year) to see if this ?bug? would be reported or fixed in future version and, still no go. Thought it was about time that i report it. See bug 289692 https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=289692 for possible related issue. This page shows a normal legend tag and the way it should look like. Then displays a heading tag (in this case a <h2></h2>) nested inside a legend tag being rendered possibly incorrectly (not sure if this is the way firefox was supposed to render this setup). Then further displays a font tag nested inside a legend tag, this time being rendered correctly. Have tried this html code inside FF v.2.x and v.3.x and on various os (Windows & Linux) all with the same results. IE, Opera, and Chrome all display the heading correctly inside the legend. Only FF shows it as part of the fieldset. 
p.s. Using firebug it clearly shows that it opens the fieldset then open/close the legend then displays the h2 content then closes the fieldset. When you view source you can see that it is supposed to open fieldset, open legend, heading content, close legend, close fieldset. 
I also understand that i can correct this using preferred stylesheets but i am just making you aware of the issue.
