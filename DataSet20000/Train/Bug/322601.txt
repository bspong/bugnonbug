First, you need to be aware that MySpace clusters will give you a different Flash Jukebox more or less randomly, depending on luck of the draw and what version of their jukebox you get.

That right there is not gonna be fun.

Next, it only seems to crash SOMETIMES, and it's not real common.

So, let's focus on this:  How about getting the audio to actually work consistently.  The same band page, one re-load to the next may or may not work, depending on the Flash movie you get.

Oooooh.  The audio not working is way way way more common on Linux.  Maybe focus efforts there first.
I've tried ReHat 8, RedHat 9, FC3, and FC4 with the last two versions of Flash player.

The more recent versions of all that "work" more often, but not always.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Surf to MySpace.
Listen to lots and lots of music (mostly bad, unfortunately)

Actual Results:  
Sometimes the audio does not work.
Sometimes, less common, it crashes the browser.


Expected Results:  
Audio should always work, and Firefox should never crash.
Yeah, okay, that wasn't real useful, was it?...


Apologies that this report isn't as specific as it could be, but there it is.

PS I have a Talkback Agent report queued up, but it's not getting out to your server, and I can't find a way to get the stack trace out of it. :-(
