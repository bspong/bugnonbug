I CANNOT OPEN A LINK IN A NEW WINDOW, ALTHOUGH I CAN OPEN A LINK IN A NEW TAB.  I WAS ABLE TO OPEN A LINK IN A NEW WINDOW EARLIER TODAY.  THEN, I DOWNLOADED THE NEWEST VERSION OF ADOBE READER (VERSION 9) FROM THE ADOBE WEBSITE.  AFTER THAT, I WAS UNABLE TO OPEN A LINK IN A NEW WINDOW AND MY FIREFOX FREEZES AND THEN I HAVE TO CLOSE FIREFOX IF I OPEN A PDF FILE ONLINE. I AM SEARCHING FOR PDF ARTICLES ON THE EBSCO HOST (ACADEMIC SEARCH ELITE) AT THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY WEBSITE (UVIC) FOR MY PROFESSOR.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. OPEN FIREFOX
2. GO TO UNIVERSITY LIBRARY WEBSITE
3. LOG ON
4. GO TO DATABASE - EBSCO HOST
5. SEARCH FOR APPROPRIATE ARTICLES
6. RIGHT CLICK TO OPEN PDF LINK IN NEW WINDOW
Actual Results:  
NOTHING - NO NEW WINDOW OPENS
I CAN OPEN THE LINK IN A NEW TAB, BUT I LIKE TO DO OTHER SEARCHES AT THE SAME TIME WITH MULTIPLE WINDOWS TO KEEP EVERYTHING MORE ORGANIZED

Expected Results:  
NOTHING

A NEW WINDOW SHOULD HAVE OPENED
