Left click on some buttons highlight them but do not activate them

Steps to reproduce:

I clicked on a login or submit button and it highlights the button then shoots the cursor to the upper left-hand corner of the browser but does not actually make the button work. In essence left-hand clicking on some buttons and by buttons I mean boxes with words and like login or submit or create or whatever that you were supposed to click on to get into a new site or whatever. Do not function. They function fine with Internet Explorer. So the problem is not with the buttons or the website but with the Firefox program itself. So I would click on a button like "login" "submit" "create" or whatever.


Actual results:

The button is highlighted, then my cursor is sent to the upper left-hand corner of the browser. But the button does not activate meaning it does not take you to the login site or the create site or whatever


Expected results:

The button should have activated sending me to the next page or next site or whatever. It does not happen on every button. Some buttons you can click seemingly more of the internal buttons of a particular process, but the initial button and generally speaking, the completion button do not function. You have to click on it so it is highlighted, then hit enter to make it function. Please fix this and let me know when it is done. It should be done by the next update. I would think.
