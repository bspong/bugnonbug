When go to my mail box on solve360.com the inbox contents are displayed in the left column. With firefox 1.5 this column does not get fully displayed only about 1/3 of it displays and the scroll bar does not work.  I then have to click on a format button and it works fine.  Has worked in all previous versions and I checked deer park 2 and does not work.  I have the some problem with bookmark manager on solve360.com however there is no format button in that sections so I can not use.
