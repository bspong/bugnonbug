Recursive session restore not reverting back to normal.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:30.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/30.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140211030201

Steps to reproduce:

In fact these are several errors at the same time but I'm not able to pry more information out of the situation.
First, after an unknown condition firefox did not revert back to normal session restore. It always shows "This is embarrassing ...".
Second, after an second unknown condition, firefox shows about:sessionrestore as one of the tabs to restore. If I restore that session restore the real session to restore is shown and finally restored.
Third, the restored session is several days old.

What I have done:
- removed sessionstore.ini -> no effect, file is not recreated
- removed sessionstore.js -> no effect, file is recreated
- cleared cache -> no effect
- reset all shown setting for session restore in about:config -> no effect
- removed user.js -> no effect

Where the f... are the session restore info taken from?

BTW the addon about:sessionrestore shows an empty restore list but sessionstore.js is about 24 MB large.


Actual results:

Firefox does not revert to normal session restore.


Expected results:

After the "Embarrassing" window firefox should automatically revert back to normal session restore.
