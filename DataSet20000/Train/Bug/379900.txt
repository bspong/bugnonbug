"Bookmark this page" saves too much meta name="description" content, no way to limit or disable

According to my bookmarks.html file, at the beginning of March 2006, the "Bookmark This Page..." action began saving meta name="description" content, but this addition was not accompanied by an about:config preference to disable or limit it to a specified number of characters.  Some Web pages like the one above abuse the meta description, causing bookmarks file bloat.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Navigate to a page with a large meta name="description" content, like the one above.
2.  Perform "Bookmark This Page..."
3.  View the <DD> clause in bookmarks.html with a text editor.
Actual Results:  
723 characters of <DD>

Expected Results:  
0 characters of <DD>

There should be an about:config preference such as:

     browser.bookmarks.maxchars_meta_descr_add default integer 40

or at least

     browser.bookmarks.save_meta_descr_add default boolean false

This should not affect the user's ability to save description manually with Properties or New Bookmark, only the "Bookmark This Page..." adding function.
