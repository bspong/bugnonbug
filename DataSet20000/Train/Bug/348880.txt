If you enter the fullscreen mode [F11] you will see a strange white and a grey line on the top of your screen. I prepared a page where you can see nothing but a picture. 800 pixel width, 600 pixel height. It's completly black, but there is a red line on the bottom of the picture, it's 1 pixel in height. The picture starts on the most left and on the most uppest pixel of the screen (or at least it should if firefox would do what the source code tells him to do). So you should see everything black, but the red line on the bottom of your screen if your screen resolution is 800x600. Instead, you see a white and a grey line on the top of the screen but not the red line on the bottom. you can see the red line, if you scroll down with your mouse wheel. No you can't use the scrollbars, they are disabled in the source code, so that they don't waste space and a picture of 800x600 can be displayed if your screen resolution is also 800x600.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.ontheserver.de/temp/Mozilla/Firefox/fullscreen
2. change your screen resolution to 800x600
3. press [F11] to enter the fullscreen mode in firefox
4. don't see the red line at the bottom but the white and grey at the top

Actual Results:  
you see a grey and a white line on the top of the screen.

Expected Results:  
The white and the grey line shouldn't be there. But you should see the red line on the bottom of the screen.

I am using the default theme. Maybe it has something to do with the theme.

Firefox doesn't provide 800x600 pixels in fullscreen mode, only 800x598.
