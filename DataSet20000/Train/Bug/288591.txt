Crash [@ nsDocShell::GetRootSessionHistory] on URL provided on opening DOM Inspector or clicking (right or left) on whitespace surrounding the map.
When clicking with either the right or left mouse button on the whitespace in
the center frame surrounding the map on the main map screen of Kingdom Of
Loathing latest-trunk will crash.  I am unable to determine exactly what is
causing the crash.  It only occurs in the 20050331 trunk build.  I also tried
using the DOM Inspector from within latest-trunk and it crashed then as well.

I used the DOM Inspector from another Firefox install to inspect the area, and
the only values listed are
Node Name: Center
Node Type: 1

I have a handful of Talkback IDs for this crash, as I attempted to reproduce
several times.
