Adding a new node using the + button in the inspector toolbar should keep the parent selected
STR:
- open any page
- open inspector
- select any node
- click on the + icon in the inspector toolbar
- click again a second time

Expected: I would like these 2 new elements to be siblings, direct children of the element I selected in step 3

Actual: the new created element gets selected, so the second element becomes its child.

UX discussion: this feature was added in bug 1261781 and it was decided that the newly created nodes would get selected because this way users can modify them further. 
Because the node gets selected immediately, you can delete it by pressing the DELETE key, you can press enter to edit the tagname, or tab to add an attribute.

If we decide here that it's better to *not* select the newly created node, then those things won't work, you'll first need to navigate to the node to do this.

Having said this, I've used this feature quite a bit already, and every time I wanted the new nodes to be siblings, not children of each other.
And because that didn't work, I was either reselecting the parent and then pressing + again, or just creating one element only and then using the "duplicate element" context menu item.

Gabriel has also said that it would make more sense to keep the parent selected.
