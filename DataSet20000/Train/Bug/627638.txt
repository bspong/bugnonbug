You do not have access to write to the installation directory.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b8) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b8) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b8

The installer runs as administrator (comes up using UAC to ask if I want it to make changes), but tells me I do not have access to write to that directory. At first it defaulted to C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox 4.0 Beta 9\ (just like expected), but to keep the beta upgraded, I removed the 9 so it was just Firefox 4.0 Beta\ in order to upgrade from 4.0b8. Which is when I first got the message. I next ran it using standard settings, and it installed to C:\Users\Adam\AppData\Local\Mozilla Firefox 4.0 Beta 9\ -- now what it defaults to.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run setup as normal
2.Select Custom settings
3.change to directory where a previous version of Firefox is already installed
Actual Results:  
Received a message: "You don't have access to write to the installation directory. Click OK to select a different directory."

Expected Results:  
Began installation and run the upgrade to replace 4.0b8 with 4.0b9.

Nothing has changed since the last time I tried installing 4.0b8 except a running 6 GB RAM instead of the 4 I was using previously. That should have to do with it. I've done this exact same procedure since 4.0b6->b7->b8 and it's worked flawlessly.
