Ditto summary. Add to that the fact that these same buttons once worked under earlier (about a year or so) versions of Firefox. Regrettably, I don't know and cannot give you the specific rev/rel number of the last working Firefox version. These buttons *do* currently work under Safari, however, which suggests to me (at least) that the website itself is not the sole cause of this problem. I called usaa.com's online tech support about it tonight. Their tech said the latest version of Firefox doesn't play well with their D@H pages and this is well known. Apparently others have had this problem with Firefox (only) under both WinDoze and Mac OS/X. He didn't mention anything about Firefox probs. under Linux, but didn't say there weren't any, either.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. join usaa.com
2. login to your account via the current version of Firefox for Mac OS/X.
3. try to deposit a check from home by means of usaa.com's Deposit@Home feature.

Actual Results:  
Fail to find the green file-upload button. Fail to upload your check.

Expected Results:  
There should be a green button visible at Step 3 of the D@H process. Pressing it pops-up a standard open-file dialog.

usaa.com's tech support folks are aware that 'the latest version' of Firefox is at the eye of this storm. For my part, I think this problem has been around longer than that. I've had this prob with usaa.com for at least five or six months now.
