Steps to reproduce:

http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:GTLS

This page fails as does any website with Flash on it. But they only fail after I have logged into Google.  If I sign out of google ALL pages work fine.  Seems to be an issue with Google.


Actual results:

1. Navigate to http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:GTLS 
2. Page displays as expected, including Chart.
3. Select Login link on top right corner. Login to Google Account.
4. Navigate to http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:GTLS 
5. Page hangs and user is told Shockwave Flash is not responding. Prompted to wait or stop plug-in.
6. After navigating to ANY webpage (YouTube), the Flash plugin is not working.
7. Sign out of Google account.
8. Navigate to any page with Flash, plugin is working again.



Expected results:

All pages with flash should work, even when signed in with google.  I am using Firefox 25.0.1 and Flash 11.9.900.152.  Flash works fine in both Chrome and IE when logged into Google Account.
