|FF3 does not display athe "buy now" button on ebay sale pages - previous versions did work properly

When I click the "buy it now" buying option on ebay, all the items available to purchase immmediately without having to bid are listed.  I notice, first, that the little "buy it now" icon next to the item does not display as before.  Then, when I click on the sale item, the blue rectangular "buy it now" button does NOT display at all.  Previous versions of Firefox worked properly.  Internet Explorer works properly.

YOU MUST FIX THIS IMMEDIATELY OR MILLIONS OF EBAY USERS WILL STOP TRYING TO USE FIREFOX.
