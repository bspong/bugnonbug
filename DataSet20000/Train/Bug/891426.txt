Firefox becomes extremely slow or non responsive since upgrading to v22.0 (20130618035212)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.8; rv:22.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/22.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130618035212

Steps to reproduce:

I had approximately3-5 windows open with lots of tabs on my MacBook Pro v10.8.4, and all of a sudden I was unable to navigate anywhere else, whether it was Firefox or a different app.  It simply took a long time to navigate between the Firefox tabs or Windows, but once I was able to get to another application it quickly worked as it should




Actual results:

I checked Activity Monitor and saw Firefox was using about 43% CPU, while Firefox (I believe it was) Add-ons  was using about 40%.

I closed each tab, then each Firefox window.  It took anywhere from 10 to 45 seconds to close each of the Firefox tabs & windows. I closed whatever other apps I had open including Mail app.  I then rebooted by Mac

This has happened about 3-4 times since I upgraded to v22. I only checked Activity Monitor on the first time it happened.

I didn't have this problem before I upgraded to v22.


Expected results:

Navigation between Firefox tabs/windows should happen quickly
