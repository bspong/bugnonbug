[Prerequisites]:
- Latest Activity Stream add-on version (v1.0.18) was previously installed on an old profile.
- Have enough History and Bookmarks in the profile so when scrolling is performed, a new batch of History items is listed.

[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Open the browser with the profile from prerequisites. 
2. Open Activity Stream Timeline from the browser toolbar.
3. Zoom out the Timeline page at lest 50%.
4. Refresh the Timeline page.

[Expected result]:
- Websites that were not displayed in viewport are listed while scrolling.

[Actual result]:
- Websites that were not displayed in viewport are not listed while scrolling because the scrollbar is not available.
