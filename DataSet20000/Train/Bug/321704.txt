Firefox 1.5 breaks Shockwave content on non-us systems

The system locale settings influence variables inside Shockwave running in Firefox 1.5. If the system locale setting for decimal symbol is set to anything but a period (.), float values may be unrecognised as such in certain common cases. 

Mainland european, as well as some asian locale settings have the comma (,) set as the decimal symbol by default.

Works fine with a period decimal symbol, gives shockwave error dialog with a comma

Can pan and tilt the camera with a period, just won't tilt with a comma (or - if you're lucky - display upside down)

Press the button in the lower right corner. Name tags fade in, which are misplaced when a comma is used

You can pan spin the mini with a period, but the view is stuck with the comma 

The same content works as expected in Firefox 1.0.x

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to the system Control Panel and open the 'Regional and Language Options'
2. on the first tab, press the 'Customize button'
3. in the Numbers tab, change the 'Decimal symbol' character to something other than a period (.), eg a comma (,)
4. apply these settings and restart Firefox

A Shockwave movie is available to highlight (some of) the problems:

The left box has the values Shockwave creates dynamically, which apparently depend on your system Locale setting if you are using Firefox 1.5. The middle column shows what the values should be, and what they are in any browser but Firefix 1.5 with the 'wrong' Locale settings. The last column is a reference that shows what the values look like if the decimal symbol is set to a comma.
