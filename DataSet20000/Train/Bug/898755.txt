Remove _resume_session_once_on_shutdown code from SessionStore
This code has been added back in bug 600545:

> // The original "sessionstore.resume_session_once" preference value before it
> // was modified by saveState.  saveState will set the
> // "sessionstore.resume_session_once" to true when the
> // the "sessionstore.resume_from_crash" preference is false (crash recovery
> // is disabled) so that pinned tabs will be restored in the case of a
> // crash.  This variable is used to restore the original value so the
> // previous session is not always restored when
> // "sessionstore.resume_from_crash" is true.
> _resume_session_once_on_shutdown: null,

So the whole _resume_session_once_on_shutdown code is there so that pinned tabs are restored when Firefox crashes for people with resume_from_crash=false. It's quite obvious that we don't need this code as it works fine without it. Looking at nsSessionStartup.js:

> // set the startup type
> if (lastSessionCrashed && resumeFromCrash)
>   this._sessionType = Ci.nsISessionStartup.RECOVER_SESSION;
> else if (!lastSessionCrashed && doResumeSession)
>   this._sessionType = Ci.nsISessionStartup.RESUME_SESSION;
> else if (this._initialState)
>   this._sessionType = Ci.nsISessionStartup.DEFER_SESSION;
> else
>   this._initialState = null; // reset the state

If we have a valid state and we crash with resumeFromCrash=false we will always end up in the third branch and we will have a deferred session. That means only pinned tabs will be restored as desired.
