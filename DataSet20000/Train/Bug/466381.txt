After opening the All History window and doing a search there, after I close the history window and starts to open new websites, Firefox hangs for some time while opening that new page(s). This can be checked by trying to scroll down/up while the page is loading. It seems that the history search keeps running after I close the history window and it keeps redoing the search with the new history information I just provided by opening those new pages, as if the history where open with the search yet. Note that this seems to also happen if I just open and close the history window without doing search there, but the hang is very quick (seems that it refreshes the history which would being shown on the screen if the history window were open, but it is not).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a reasonably big browsing history. When you search something in the history, it must take some seconds to show the response (4-5 secs).
2. Having that in step (1), open the "Show all history" window.
3. Type something in the search field.
4. Wait the search to end.
5. Close the history window.
6. Open a new tab and load some page (e.g. www.terra.com.br or www.uol.com.br)
7. Scroll up and down while the page loads. The browser will hang for some seconds and then recover.
8. Restarting the browser ends the problem.
Actual Results:  
Firefox hangs for some seconds, showing the "processing mouse icon" in the screen, and then it recovers and works as expected.

Expected Results:  
Should load the pages without hanging.
