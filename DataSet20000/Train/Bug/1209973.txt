dns locker adware resides only on firefox but not detected, possibly by maintenance service
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; Trident/7.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; rv:11.0) like Gecko

Steps to reproduce:

during the last 2 days orange firefox and firefox for developers were infected by DNS Locker adware. other browsers including Edge, IE11 and Chrome are completely intact and clean.

PC uses ESET nod, fully protected. there was no risky web surfing, no infected emails, no new applications installed.

checking the system according to guides... there were no suspicious applications in Programs and Features, no unknown add-ons and extentions on browser(s). also, all suggested registry keys are clean and valid.

The most recent installs in Programs and Features are Mozilla Maintenance Service, only two days before malware started to show up. also "Block reported attack sites" section of options only contain two default firefox related domains as exceptions, add-ons and market place.

the above increases the posibility that this malware has been installed by firefox updates and is limited to it, maybe as a hidden add-on.



Actual results:

after reviewing many guides and how-tos and performing many checks, I uninstalled firefox, delete all related folders and cleaned registry, then installed a fresh copy. in the second run dns locker showed up! 

the only thing i could do was bloking related ad links via NOD: 
*.adnxs.com
*.amazonaws.com
*.atemda.com
*.bestpriceninja.com
*.bidswitch.net
*.clkmon.com
*.cloudflare.com
*.contextweb.com
*.criteo.com
*.dnsqa.me
*.eshopcomp.com
*.gmdelivery.com
*.icontentkey.com
*.k1wmm.com
*.ltmmty.com
*.metrigo.com
*.quantserve.com
*.smartadserver.com
*.teracreative.com
*.visadd.com
*.yabidos.com

this prevents ads to activate but firefox CPU usage is too high.



Expected results:

if there is an add-on it must be visible in Add-ons Manager, at least in safe mode. so what is this?
