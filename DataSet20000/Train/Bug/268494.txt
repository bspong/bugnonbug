"Set as default browser" should preserve context menu options for files in explorer (shell commands)

This problem exists in Firefox 0.10 with Mozilla 1.7.3. It did not exists in the
previous version of Firefox that I used (I think it was 0.09 with Mizilla 1.6.8.)

Since Firefox does not contain a composer, when you set Firefax as the default
browser it does not list Edit (to edit HTMP pages) as a menu item in Windows
Explorer's. So I created one and set Mozilla in composer mode as the application
for this menu item. I also created "Edit with Netscape" as another menu item
with the corresponding Netscape's composer as the application.

Some time later I changed the default browser to Mozilla. The two editing menu
items were present and usable following this change.

When I reset Firefox as the default browser both menu items for editing HTML
pages were removed.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set the default browser to Mozilla or Netscape.

2. Create Edit action for the HTM, HTML file extensions In Windows' Explorer.

   2.1. Verify that when Right- clicking on HTML file the new action you created
such as "Edit" or "Edit with Mozilla" or "EDit with netscape" are present and
functional.

3. Set the default browser to Firefox.

   3.1. Verify that the editing actions on right click are gone.

Actual Results:  
The editing actions on right click are gone from Windows Explorer's right-click
menu.

Expected Results:  
The menu items should remain visible, active and functional.
