Even with domain guessing off, address bar flashes guessed domain
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:22.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/22.0 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:

1. Turn off domain guessing as per http://www-archive.mozilla.org/docs/end-user/domain-guessing.html - i.e. set:

browser.fixup.alternate.enabled = false
browser.fixup.alternate.prefix = an empty string
browser.fixup.alternate.suffix = an empty string.

2. Into the address bar, enter a domain without the "www." prefix.  For example, "example.com".  This domain must serve content from http://example.com/ (i.e. not be a redirect.)

3. Press Enter.


Actual results:

The address bar changes from "example.com" (what the user entered) to "www.example.com" for a short period of time [1] and then changes to "example.com".

[1] I'm not sure what the "short period of time" is exactly.  Is it until a connection is made with the server?  Until the first byte is received?  Until the page is rendered?  etc.  I don't know.


Expected results:

The address bar should not change from "example.com".

Additional notes:

It *doesn't* appear to be the case that Firefox changes the address bar to www.example.com, then loads www.example.com, encounters a redirect to example.com, then changes the address bar to example.com.

At least, using the "Live HTTP Headers" add-on, Firefox never requests www.example.com, and only requests example.com (what the user entered.)  So this appears to be some UI weirdness, rather than e.g. not respecting the user's domain guessing settings.
