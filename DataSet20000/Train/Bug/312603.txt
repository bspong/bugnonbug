pdf attachments sent to AOL users not readable
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Firefox ver 1.0.6

When using Firefox as the browser and sending a pdf attachment to AOL users 
among others, the AOL people do not see an attachment( only a red x in a box) 
and the file type is shown as a image.  Testing with my own AOL account I find 
that switching over to Internet Explorer to send the pdf attachment, I can 
receive the pdf attachment in my AOL account.  I use SBC Yahoo to send mail.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Send email with pdf attachment. 
2.AOL users see the email and text but no attachment.
3.

Actual Results:  
AOl users see the received file as an image file which has no attachment to 
down load when sent using Firefox as the browser.  When using IE ver 6+ as the 
sending browser AOL users see a downloadable pdf attachment.

Expected Results:  
AOL users should be able to download the pdf attachment

Using Netzero's browser and AOL browser to send the pdf attachment, AOL users 
can see the pdf attachment and download it.  Sent the pdf attachment to all 
users on Septmber 15th, all users could see the pdf attachment.  Sent a 
similar pdf attachment October 15th, only AOL users were unable to see the 
attachment.
