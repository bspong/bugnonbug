Opening pages - mainly from vg.no - and the next level - means trying to choose a specific page to read more, I'm being forced into a google result refering to a twingly-result - example of page I'm forced into in the url above 



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.try a page on vg.no
2. click on a specific subject: about Lumix camera - which I wanted to read
3.was transferd to the page - see link above.


Actual Results:  
Trying to reproduce, the twingly takes over at an earlier stage... now I end up here - before I get further down into the page on Lumix camera ...

Expected Results:  
I expected to get back to the URL above - but was taken to another twingly-result - next URL above

I have experienced the same problem from other pages than vg.no - but mostly from this outspring. Have been in contact with technician on VG, but she couldn't reproduce the problem. Have been using foxmark - have now uninstalled my former version of Firefox and reinstalled - after deleting all information at uninstallation. 
Installed vers 3.6 - and trying to go to the page on Lumix camera - this was what happend. Also with the new Firefox version. 

Having bought a new laptop which I get today, I don't know if I dare to install Firefox - which I simply adore using. The technician at VG.no suggested I had had some kind of a bug. Do I? Is this Firefox-trouble? How do I handle this situation?
Beware:
Opening the pages in Opera - I succeed in getting to the page about Lumix - staying here - http://www.vg.no/teknologi/artikkel.php?artid=583896 -
being able to read - and no transfer to twingly-google-page...

all the best...
