plus 7 text only pages opened from local disk with file:///Volume/... URLs

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Opened the above web pages
2. Let Firefox sit idle for 6 hours


Actual Results:  
Firefox became very slow. Switching between open windows took 10-15 seconds.
Opening bugzilla main page took 30-45 seconds.

Expected Results:  
No open window had any large graphics, so Firefox memory should have been less than 500MB. 

Firefox CPU at 99.4%, real memory at 7.73GB and virtual memory at 8.07GB.

I monitored Firefox's CPU for several minutes and it varied from 99% to 100.5%.

After force quit and restarting the same set of open pages:
Firefox CPU at 16.8%, real memory at 754.5MB and virtual memory at 523.5MB.
