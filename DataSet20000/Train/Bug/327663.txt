I'm not sure where I should be adding my experience to this report so I might insert it in a couple different places just to be sure it gets to you-all.

I too am occasionally having this problem and am getting the "Error Launching Browser window: no XBL binding for Browser" message.  Today what happened was my wife closed all Firefox windows, then opened IE, then logged onto her work computer and checked her e-mails.  She then closed her e-mail program (Outlook), then logged out of her work computer, then closed IE and informed me that the computer was now mine again.

I clicked on the Mozilla Firefox icon and that's when the "Error launching..." error message came up.
