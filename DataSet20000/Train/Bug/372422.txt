Link wont work to a (win) remote-mounted web page from a non-local web server page

Say I have a web page on a disk remote-mounted to my PC:  \\fileserver\index.htm
and I put a link to this on another machine's web page:  my.corp.com/!~me/foo.htm
If the link is either:
   \\fileserver\index.htm
   file://///fileserver/index.htm
Firefox won't follow it, but IE will follow either.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make a remote-mounted web page, eg, \\fileserver\index.html
2. Put file://///fileserver/index.html as a link into the web page of a remote apache server (in an 'a href=...' tag)
3. Open the remote apache server's web page
4. Click on the link
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
I expected FireFox to open the remote fileserver's index.html

1. Make a remote-mounted web page, eg, \\fileserver\index.html
2. Type it into the location bar- it works! and becomes file://///fileserver/index.html
3. Put "file://///fileserver/index.html" as a link into a local html file
4. The link works
5. Put "file://///fileserver/index.html" into a web page on a nearby apache server.
6. It doesn't work.  Both this link and \\fileserver\index.html work in IE, but not in Firefox
This has been a long-standing bug.
