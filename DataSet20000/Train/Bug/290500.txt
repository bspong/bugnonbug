Quicktime plugin: Authentication window for embedded Quicktime movie not receiving keystrokes

An embedded Quicktime movie from a password-protected directory (with a qtaccess
file, similar to .htaccess for Apache) on a QuickTime Streaming Server pops up
an authentication window for username/password. (The username/password for the
testpage mentioned above is test/test.)
With Firefox 1.0.2 on a Mac it it not possible to type any text in the
authentication window, so it is not possible to view the movie. It seems that
Firefox doesn't give keyboard focus to the authentication window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure that Quicktime is installed
2. Go to http://janpieter.xs4all.nl/firefox_test/
3. Try to type username/password (test/test) in the authentication window.  

Actual Results:  
Not possible to login because text fields in the authentication window don't
receive keystrokes.

Expected Results:  
Should make it possible to type text in the authentication window and send the
credentials to the server when clicking OK button.

Also reproduced the bug in the Mozilla suite and in the latest Firefox 1.0.3
nightly build.

I filed the bug under 'OS Integration' because I have the impression that the
nonresponsive authentication window is generated by the Quicktime plugin, not
Firefox itself.
