Not sure if this is a bug with Yahoo or Firefox. But just thought to bring it to your notice so you can work with Yahoo! on this.

I can provide you with a screenshot if you would like one.

FYI: The new site for hotmail (Windows Live) has a similar interface, but does not have such errors even for Firefox.
