Firefox 30 causing BCCode 9c with reboot in Windows XP SP3?
User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; Media Center PC 4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Steps to reproduce:

Started having problems with my Windows XP SP3 computer about 3 months ago.  I don't remember if the problem initially started with Firefox browser 27,28,29 install or not.  Anyway the problems got so bad with BSOD issues that I had to reformat my hard drive and do a system restore from my 2008 restore disc.  After restore I still had issues with error messages.  As of right now the system is fairly stable and operates with few problems; with the exception of Firefox 30.  I have updated drivers, cleaned registry and startup files.  Mostly, my problems are confined to trying to use Firefox 30 browser.  Firefox will open but is very unstable and causes the BCCode 9c and reboots the computer.  The reboot option is set for errors.  Since the problems at this point seem to be confined to Firefox 30 I would like to know if there are issues with Firefox 30 running in Windows XP SP3?  I've used Firefox for several years and don't want to give it or my XP machine up anytime soon.


Actual results:

Fire 30 very unstable and crashes on my Windows XP SP3 machine.
outputs BCCode 9c and reboots computer.


Expected results:

No errors.
