Ordered lists not displaying bullet numbering when list items are long

We auto generate a list of files as part of our update/commit process. The
hyperlinks are broken up such that you can click on any part of the file or path
and it will either open that folder or show the path but due to our [ perhaps
somewhat unconventional ;) ] - file naming method these list items can end up
being quite large.

It would seem that when the file names are sufficiently long (i.e. ones
particularly far down the directory structure) and cause our hyperlink generator
to create a list item beyond a certain length, the number for that (ordered)
list item does not appear.

Will attach a .png showing the Firefox display and the source HTML. In this
particlar example, the fourth list item does not have a bullet number.

(Have searched for existing cases of this bug but not able to find anything).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Will attach example HTML
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Missing bullet number (see attachments)

Expected Results:  
Displayed the number 4 at the start of the line.
