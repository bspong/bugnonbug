I find this happens on numerous websites, on multiple computers, sometimes when I right-click a link in firefox, it does not respond and jumps from 30mb of ram to 140mb-160mb of ram, and it uses 100% of my processor, the only way to get out of this is by using the task manager (ALT+CTRL+DEL).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
It just seems to be random, it happens to alot of websites, I originally thought it was just my computer, but it has been happening to alot of other websites, my latest one that I can remember was realestate.com.au
Actual Results:  
I right clicked a hyperlink, then the shadow of the form appeared and the form was just blank, then ram and cpu usage went up really high in a few seconds.

Expected Results:  
Just normally right-clicked.

I was using the normal firefox theme with a add-on called Download Helper (gets flv videos).
