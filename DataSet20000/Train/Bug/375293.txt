When I login and my homepage is displayed, page loading will usually stall. It seems to have something to do with either multiple image loading or loading objects from multiple URLs, as picture thumbnails/albums on Facebook appear to be  sourced from different servers. Clicking on Refresh sometimes reloads the page to the point at which the stall occurred, other times it will not load anything at all and the Status bar will say "Looking up www.facebook.com..." with no network activity indicated on my router. After a few minutes page loading usually resumes. Attempting to load other web pages into new tabs while in the "stall" phase will result in the "Looking up xyz.com..." status bar message.

This bug can also be reproduced with Yahoo! Mail Beta.

Disabling all add-ons made no difference, though the bug seems to have come about with FF 2.0.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login
2. Watch page loading to see if stalling occurs
3. If page loads completely, navigate to a friend's album and browse pictures, stalling should occur while browsing
4. While stalled, open a new tab and attempt to open different URL. If the new URL won't load, the bug has been duplicated.
Actual Results:  
Page loads partially or not at all, will not open any new URL

Expected Results:  
Completion of page loading and ability to browse to other URLs
