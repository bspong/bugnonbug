After upgrading to FF 3.0.3-de I can not access my stored password in password manager or use them on a website. I had secured the password manager wit a master password. When entering a site I had stored a password for, i get asked for my master password but after that the login form is not automatically filled.

The password manager is completely empty, no stored sites or passwords (see given URL)

I am not sure if I upgraded from FF 3.0.1-de to FF 3.0.3-de or from FF 3.0.2-de to FF 3.0.3-de
