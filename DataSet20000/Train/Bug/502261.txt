Firefox 3.5 won't start if browser locale is set to en-GB
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090624 Firefox/3.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090624 Firefox/3.5

If the general.useragent.locale proprty is set to en-GB Firefox 3.5 fails to start. A popup window is shown, containing the following XML parse error notification:

XML Parsing Error: undefined entity 
Location: chrome://browser/content/browser.xul 
Line Number 36, Column 1:

<window id="main-window"
^

(sic - note the "window" tag is unterminated).

The problem may be worked round by starting in safe mode and using about:config to set general.useragent.locale to en-US (or other locales, not en-GB)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set general.useragent.locale to en-GB (either via about:config or using something like the Quick Locale Switcher extension)
2. Restart Firefox 3.5

Actual Results:  
Firefox fails to start and an error popup is seen containing


XML Parsing Error: undefined entity 
Location: chrome://browser/content/browser.xul 
Line Number 36, Column 1:

<window id="main-window"
^


Expected Results:  
Normal Firefox startup
