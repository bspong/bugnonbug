after downloading your free browser software, NOT FOUND came up
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; YPC 3.0.3; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; yplus 4.1.00b)
Build Identifier: 

I have hotbar attached skins to selective websites. I cannot access google and 
didn't know you were associated with it. So there's nothing you can do, I 
imagine. I also cannot access yahoo.com, amazon.com, borders.com, IE.com, 
Netscape.com. My husband wanted a comprehensive browser and I was hoping you 
were the one, but this hotbar thing seems to have really screwed things up.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.type in URL and click go
2.go to search for any of the above websites and click go
3.click on a link in email from some of above websites

Actual Results:  
Always get one of three replies: "soon..." or "NOT FOUND" or "FORBIDDEN"

Expected Results:  
Obviously, I should have been able to access all websites. 

I'm a 57 yr old grandmother/writer and I just want to be able to search the 
internet properly. I don't know all the technical stuff you wanted to know in 
reporting this bug. I've been working on this problem with hotbar for three 
weeks and no one can help, other than to tell me to destroy my hard drive and 
reinstall everything...I just downloaded your free browser this morning and 
found it too cannot be accessed. I'm pretty fed up.
