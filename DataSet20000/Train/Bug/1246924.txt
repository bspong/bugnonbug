Feature Request:  Tab grid view similar to tab groups view
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:44.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/44.0
Build ID: 20160205155049

Steps to reproduce:

I'm requesting a feature similar to tab groups view in light of tab groups being removed in Firefox 45.  I don't care about tab groups themselves, but I'm requesting a feature that will display all open tabs in a grid and allow me to select one of them with the ability to do this using only the keyboard.  This would have a keybinding of CTRL-SHIFT-E or similar.   


Actual results:
