Auto-Login Doesn't Work on Sites

There are a number of sites (of which boardgamegeek.com is one) that offer auto-login features. In other words, once you login, you are logged in until you choose to log out. I have Firefox 2.0.0.3 installed on my home laptop, home desktop and work laptop. On both laptops, this functionality works correctly. However, on my home desktop, approximately every 36-48 hours, when I return to a site, I'm presented with a login page (as though I'd not been to the site before).

Once I enter my user name, the password auto-fills in (and, on some sites, both the user name and password are already filled in) -- all that I need to do then is hit the "login" button. Obviously, this is not a password manager issue.

Even still, this only happens on my home desktop - both laptops do not have this problem. I'm auto-logged into the sites with no prompting.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Go to site - every 36-48 hours, it happens
Actual Results:  
Every 36-48 hours, I'm logged out, and have to hit "login" to get back.

Expected Results:  
Should have logged me in automatically, before drawing the first page I see

I'm far from an expert with computers - I know enough to get by...

I have created text files of the prefs.js files from my work laptop and home desktop, to compare. Unfortunately (as mentioned above), while I can see differences between the two, I lack the knowledge to do something with that information. :)
