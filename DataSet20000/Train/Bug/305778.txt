Firefox problem with Win XP Multiple Desktop Powertoy - unwanted resizing when FF moves to different desktop

When using Firefox on XP with the Multiple Desktop Powertoy from Microsoft
installed a number of problems are present. One such is where Firefox is open on
one desktop and an application triggers a page to open in another desktop.
Firefox opens the page by switching its current instance to the currently
displayed desktop. In doing so, it resizes to be really small in the top-left
corner of the screen, even though it was maximised on original desktop.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Multiple Desktop Windows XP Powertoy. Set the "SHARED DESKTOP" option
to OFF. (No problems occured when I tried this with shared desktop setting to on)
2. Run Firefox and maximise. Set open links from other applications to open in
new tab in current window.
3. Switch to different desktop, open application which allows you to click links
which will open in Firefox. (Verified bug opening links from Google Desktop
search and Outlook mail messages)
4. Click on link to be opened in Firefox


Actual Results:  
Firefox opened the links in a new tab in the current window. The current window
switched so that it was displayed on the current desktop. It was resized so that
it occupied only a small percentage of the screen-space available instead of
being maximised.

Expected Results:  
Switched the Firefox instance to the current desktop, while maintaining the size
of the existing window.
Alternatively, switched windows to the desktop on which Firefox was already
opened and displayed the page maximised there.
