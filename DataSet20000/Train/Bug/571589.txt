Firefox hangs (almost) completely. Oddly enough - at least to me, is that the window will minimize and restore, but it won't repaint itsef. I another window is above it then removed, the visual contents are still within the firefox window.

When this happens, I open gnome-system-monitor, and it shows firefox in a "futex wait" state. This is always the case!

I have tried to see if there are any correlations to specific apps or actions, but it does seem very random, although it a tab is loading, and you try to scroll or open a menu, or even switch to a different tab, this seems to cause the problem a lot, but on some occasions, this has happened when sending the tab to a new URL.

FWIW: I typically have two or three tabs open, and I know at least one of them auto-refreshes ads on it.
