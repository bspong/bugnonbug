As shown in the example URL, some textarea elements may add line feeds to default text when they are displayed. 

e.g.
'********
********'
becomes
'********

********'

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load page given - http://www.ushrakhan.com/alliance/edk/lineFeedBug.html
2. Scroll to bottom of textarea
3. Look for extra line between the rows of *'s
Actual Results:  
...
There is only one line feed between the next two lines
**********************

*************


Expected Results:  
...
There is only one line feed between the next two lines
**********************
*************


Changing the number of characters between the start of the element and the point where the extra line is added prevents the new line being added. If there is not a line feed at that point then the extra line feed is not added. In the text between the start element and the point where the extra line feed is added any character may be exchanged for another. The exception is that \r\n is equal to one character.

This was seen in other examples as well. No correlation between the examples was found, unfortunately.

The same file downloaded from http://brightentheworld.org/stuff/lineFeedBug.html does not show the extra linefeed. Downloading that file via ftp and loading into the browser locally now shows the extra linefeed again. 

The behaviour was duplicated on a different pc running the same version of Firefox.
