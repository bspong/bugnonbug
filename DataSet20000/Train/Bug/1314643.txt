[One-off searches] Changing the default search engine from Search bar does not work first time
[Affected versions]:
Aurora 51

[Affected platforms]:
All

[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Open Aurora 51 and type something in Search bar.
2. Right-click on a one-off searches icons. (e.g. Wikipedia).
3. From context menu click "Set as default search engine". 

[Expected Result]: 
The search engine should be set as default.

[Actual Result]: 
The search engine is not set as default. Repeating this with other engines does not set any of them as default engine until the Search bar is closed and reopened. 
This happens only for the first time the user starts Firefox or any time he opens a new window and opens the Search bar.

Probably regressed by Bug 1297976 - Fix accessibility for the unified one-off search buttons in the urlbar and searchbar

[Notes]
[1] This reproduces on Aurora where the oneOffSearches from Awesomebar is disabled.
[2] This was reproducible also on Nightly if the "browser.urlbar.oneOffSearches" was set to false UNTIL bug 1297374 was fixed. So bug 1297374 fixed this issue, but only on Nightly. I think the easiest way to fix this is to uplift the fix from bug 1297374 to Aurora.
