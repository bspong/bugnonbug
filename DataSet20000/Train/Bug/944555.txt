Tab menu is amazingly slow and scrolling is buggy
Sorry, too lazy to file these separately.

1. Open 30 tabs or so.
2. Click the 'v' menu in the tab strip.
3. Observe the horrific slowness as you move the mouse:
  * The cursor highlight runs like an injured tortoise after the hare-like pointer.
  * Visible beneath the menu is the link-hover pseudo-toolbar showing the destination URL. This lags, too.
  * Hover scrolling (i.e., hover over the up/down arrows at the top/bottom of the list is jerky and slow.

For extra emphasis if, like me, you're on a machine with enough horsepower to hide perf problems: start an eight-core build, then see how bad this gets.


Second issue: scrolling in this menu is incredibly unreliable. I've observed the following:

* The menu scrolls on its own, fighting with my mouse scrolls, even with my mouse pointer in the middle of the menu. It's as if it hasn't figured out that I'm no longer hovering over the 'up' bar, which you have to cross to get from the button to the middle of the menu. To get this to go away one has to point at the 'up' bar again.

* The menu scrolls in reverse, as if I were using an earlier release of Mac OS X -- finger scrolling up moved the menu up, not down. This went away when I closed the menu to file this bug.


Possibly related to Bug 943385, but my history menu doesn't have a scrollbar, so I can't verify.

* And, of course, scrolling is slow.
