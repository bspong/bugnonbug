Firefox 1.0PR Does not load properly from Macromedia Dreamweaver
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Prior to installing Firefox 1.0PR, I could select "Preview/Debug in Browser"
using Macromedia Dreamweaver MX 2004, choose Firefox, and the browser would load
my page in a new window. Now however, Firefox simply sits minimized on the
taskbar if there was an instance of Firefox already running. I have to click it
to open it. While I agree this is not a reason to call out the National Guard,
it does ad an extra step each time I need to preview my work. Netscape, Mozilla,
and IE pop a new window as did Firefox 0.9, 0.8, etc.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open an instance of Firefox.
2. Add Firefox to Dreamweaver's Browser list. Choose Site, open an HTML file for
editing.
3. Click "Preview/Debug in Browser" dropdown list, choose Firefox.

Actual Results:  
The page to be viewed sits on the taskbar, minimized

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have poped a new window, or at least poped the existing instance.

I am using the default theme
