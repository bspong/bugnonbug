second or higher pull down select in line loses focus immediately when mouse up, while selecting

I made a webpage with a row of 7 dynamically created pull down selects.
<select id=1>...</select><select id=2>...</select>...<select id=7>...</select>
When I want to choose an option from the second (or third to seventh) select, the focus is immediately returned to the first select in the row instead of showing me the list of options of the chosen select.
I can only use the pull down select if I don't release the left mouse button.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to webpage.
2. Mouse navigate to (click) second pull down select (showing "B/B").
3. Release left mouse button (this is normal pull down select usage).
Actual Results:  
The focus immediately goes to the first pull down select in line.

Expected Results:  
The focus should remain in the select of choice, and the list of available options should show.

adding an event to the select-item, such as onFocus=focus() does not help.
