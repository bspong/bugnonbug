Flash Player X/Java no longer work.

I have to use IE to play my flash games ie. CafeWorld, CityZen, Island Paradise and the like. Nothing pops up, no loading screen, no error, nothing. It's like Firefox blocked out Flash Player X. This has been going on for the past 3 days. What's peculiar is that the IE plugin for Firefox works like a charm as far as the Flash Player X working. How is that?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Tried reinstalling Flash Player X.
2. Tried closing and restarting Firefox.
3. Checked to see if it's my computer and not the browser. Upon inspection, it is not because IE would have the same issue.
4. Disabled plugins and addons.
5. Updated Java. Which was already up to date.

Actual Results:  
Gave up on using Firefox. Planning on downgrading the browser to see if that works. If it does then that just reassures me that it's the version of Firefox and not my computer.

Expected Results:  
Slow recovery in fixing this issue.

I have done nothing significant that would cause this type of issue to ensue. Haven't change virus protectors, haven't changed any settings in Firefox, etc. It seems like this issue only affect Facebook. On other sites, there are the occasional Java issues though.
