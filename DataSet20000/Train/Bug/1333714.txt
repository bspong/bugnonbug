Grid highlighter doesn't hide when the DOM it is highlighting is removed/reloaded in jsfiddle
STR are a bit complicated, maybe there is a way to make this easier somehow.

- Open jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/
- In the HTML pane, enter:
<div id="grid">
  <div id="i1">a</div>
  <div id="i2">b</div>
</div>
- in the CSS pane, enter:
#grid {display: grid;}
#i1 {grid-row: 1;grid-column: 1;}
#i2 {grid-row: 2;grid-column: 2;}
- press the "run" button at the top
- now, with the inspector opened, select the #grid div from the output pane
- in the rule-view, click on the grid icon to highlight the grid
- now, in the HTML pane, add one more item:
  <div id="i3">c</div>
- and in the CSS pane, one rule that goes with it:
#i3 {grid-row: 3;grid-column: 2;}
- press the "run" button again --> This will remove the output iframe entirely and construct a new document.

==> The grid highlighter stays visible on the page, even if the grid element it was highlighting was removed and a new one was added.

==> If you select the #grid element again and click on the grid icon in the rule-view again, then everything goes back to normal.

I think the grid should be hidden when the document gets removed.
The other solution could be to update the grid when the new node gets created, but it means we'd have to listen for mutations, and find the right node, which would be complex (also, what if you changed the id of the grid container in the HTML pane in the meantime?).
