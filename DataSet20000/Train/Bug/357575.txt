Page is filled with jargon when click log in (repairs itself when reload), but Browser Crashes after logging in members area

This is a Banking Site.
When I click "log in" the page appears as "source code" but clicking "Reload" fixes the problem & you get the username & password spaces.
Entering the username & password, it takes you to the main page but as soon as I click the detail link (a page where it shows account summary & I think its Java), the browser crashes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to http://www.beebank.com/ then click "log in" under members.
2.New page appears scrabbled but clicking "reload" fixes it.
3.Enter username & password & you get taken to the main member's page & is ok.
4.click the link "Quick statement" where you normally would get a sliding small window (that lets you view account activities on different dates) and the browser crashes right away. This happened on both, Mac Power pc & Mac intel.
Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes.

Expected Results:  
allow you to view a page that has a small sliding rule that you can use the mouse to slide old & new information up & down (bank account summary). I think its Java.

Using Mac's Safari, it can't enter members area altogether.
I have tried it both with the original theme with no other theme installed & with the halloween (my fav.) and the results were just the same.
I also would like to point out that when I restart firefox, the site doesn't allow me to log back in saying that my session is still active & I have to wait for it to time out or to log out of the previous session.
