When multiple tabs are open, closing the last tab (tab furthest to the right) causes the focus on the tab to slowly move to the left, 2-5 tabs, changing the document contents to whichever tab it lands on.  Occurs only under specific conditions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a scrollable document.
2. Open a bunch of blank tabs.
3. Bring your document into focus so you can scroll.
4. Scroll around with the mousewheel.
5. Left click on the last tab (furthest to the right) to bring the tab into focus (not the document, anything that creates a change in the document negates this bug. ie: moving your mouse into the document after bringing it to focus, assuming there is a document there, negates the conditions - using empty tabs makes it more easily reproducable
6. Middle click the tab in focus (last tab, furthest to the right) to close it.

Actual Results:  
Moves the focus to each tab to the left of the closed tab up to a maximum of 5 tabs (that I have observed).  As it traverses the tabs it repaints the contents of the tab brought into focus in the document window.

Expected Results:  
Moves the focus to the tab that last had focus and repaints that tab only.

MX 5000 hardware with latest Setpoint drivers, have not tested with additional hardware to eliminate that as a possible cause (unlikely as it is very specific)
