If you insert a subfolder into a bookmark folder, and then you insert a bookmark inside this subfolder, when you click it with your scroll wheel, it freezes the navigation bar fields, instead of opening it in a new tab ; then, you can't write anything into the address bar or into the search field for a certain time. As far as I can remember it's an old bug that is really annoying. After this little time, you're able to write into these fields again. This bug occurs about 50% of the time.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new bookmark folder into your bookmark toolbar
2. Create a subfolder into this bookmark folder
3. Insert any site into this subfolder
4. Try open it in a new tab clicking it with the scroll wheel

5. If the bug occurs, anything happens
6. Try open a new tab, and see you cannot click the address bar and the search field

7. If the bug does not occur, I don't know how to make it happen. Maybe try another website...
Actual Results:  
- The new tab is not opened.
- You cannot write anything inside the address bar and the search field

Expected Results:  
- The bookmark should be opened in a new tab
- The address bar and the search field should always be accessible
