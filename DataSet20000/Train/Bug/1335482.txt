32-bit FF 51.0.1 - tab switching drops horribly after about 2 hours
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:51.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/51.0
Build ID: 20170125094131

Steps to reproduce:

I've tried to NOT reproduce this, but it keeps happening!


Actual results:

On 1/30/2017 my office computer updated to 51.0.1, 32-bit.  After about two hours of use, the tab-switching became glacial.  Instead of instant, it would take 30 seconds or more to move to a new tab on which I'd clicked (granted, I have >30 open tabs, but I have always had this many).

When I clicked out of FF (the X in the upper right of the browser window) I noticed that I could not again start FF.  Opened the task manager, and the APPLICATION instance of FF was gone, as expected, but the PROCESS instance was still there.  Memory usage was about 1.0 gigs, which is less than it had been in earlier versions (computer is Win7 with 4gig of RAM).

I had to stop the FF from task manager's process tab, and then I could reopen it.

This cycle (slow tab switching after two hours, FF process remains open after x-ing out) repeated yesterday afternoon, then this morning.  Each time I get no more than 2-3 hours out of FF.


Expected results:

FF should remain responsive and tab switching instantaneous.

X-ing out of FF (click X in upper right corner) should terminate both the application and the process in task manager.
