This is identical to the closed bug 403887 (but I saw no way to change the status from FIXED...also, it's not just linux but Vista and XP).  If you grab the exact edge (bottom right) of the firefox browser and resize, it resizes correctly.  If you grab further up and left (still using the diagonal resize), the window will not resize vertically correctly.  It seems like you have to go 2x the distance up and down to make the browser resize 1x.
The window also shakes it's vertical size as your mouse moves.  Every pixel you move up or down with your mouse the window will alternate between one of two incorrect window heights.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Grab the bottom right resizer (but not all the way in the corner...up and left of it)
2.resize (can also get worse if you, while dragging, wiggle the mouse around and then continue resizing as normal)
3.resize vertically/horizontally
Actual Results:  
The vertical resizing only changes by 1/2 the distance your mouse moves.  Also, every pixel your mouse moves, the window alternates between two incorrect window heights (to give a flashing effect) this can be worsened by first wiggling the mouse around when you first grab the resizer.

Expected Results:  
It would be expected that the position you grabbed the window at would follow the mouse exactly (plus or minus a few pixels).

I first thought this was a problem just for my Vistax64, but I'm having the problem here at work on XP as well.
