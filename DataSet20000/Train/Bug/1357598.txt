Poor performance and high memory usage in Firefox after waking up computer from sleep
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:51.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/51.0
Build ID: 20170125094131

Steps to reproduce:

Open Firefox and begin opening new tabs, memory usage increases on each new tab opened, memory usage does not appear to reduce to previous levels after closing tabs based on Windows Task Manager data. Sites like Facebook, LinkedIn or YouTube that have a heavy media load will use up memory faster then more text based sites and it will be more apparent that not all memory is released when a tab is closed.

I ran 2 separate memory tests run on about:memory done about 7 minutes apart. The first test shows the test shortly after launching Firefox, the 2nd after deliberately opening and closing a number of tabs on varoius social media sites (for this test I used Facebook and LinkedIn)

*I tried attaching the files but couldn't as the files were too big and would take too long to upload, I'll add the data from the logs in a reply.

Based on my tests, it does not matter what site is used, as long the page being opened consumes enough memory to make a noticeable change in Firefox's memory usage.


Actual results:

Memory usage (RAM) gradually increases whenever Firefox is allowed to run continuously, such as during daily work usage or long video watching or social media sessions.


Expected results:

When a tab is closed, all memory that tab used should be released back to the OS for general usage. RAM usage of Firefox should only be dependent on how many tabs/windows are open and the type and amount of contents on those pages, not how long it's been running for.
