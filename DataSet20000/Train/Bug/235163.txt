I'm a moderator on Devshed (DrGroove), and noticed that this post causes some
kind of 'negative feedback loop' w/in Mozilla Firebird v0.7. 

This link should bring you right to the post in question:

Viewed in Mozilla 1.6, Opera 7.23, or MSIE 6.1, this post isn't an issue. There
is a point w/in the post that an HTML entity is used; however, the post caused
the output loop in Firebird prior to the entity, so I'm not sure that its the
issue. 

Firebird continues to function after this output loop occurs; navigating to
another page and back causes the same problem. Closing Firebird and visiting the
link causes the same problem. Something is definitely funky here. 

I hope this helps - I'm a staunch advocate of Mozilla Firebird/fox, w/ a link to
it in my Devshed signature; you folks make the best browser(s) on the planet.
