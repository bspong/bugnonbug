Steps to reproduce:

With homepage set to Google.com, navigated to washingtonpost.com and closed web browser, then quit application from menu bar in OS X.  Regardless of settings being configured to open home page on app launch, Firefox attempts to restore previously viewed page (washingtonpost.com) and gives error.


Actual results:

1.  (Verify your settings are configured to "Show my home page" when Firefox starts) Open Firefox version 20 browser and let it load your home page.
2.  Navigate to a site other than your homepage, for example: washingtonpost.com.
3.  Close the Firefox browser window by pressing the red close window button.
4.  Quit the Firefox application from the menu bar by selecting Firefox->Quit Firefox.
5.  Launch Firefox and you should see the following error or it will open the page you last navigated to instead of your homepage


Expected results:

Firefox should have opened the homepage instead of giving the error attached.
