Firefox has high CPU ~1m after startup which requires a force quit to shut down
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0.2pre) Gecko/20110531 Firefox/4.0.2pre

For a while after starting up Firefox, CPU usage is normal. But after about a minute of browsing (or idle time) with several tabs open (e.g. Gmail, Google Calendar) CPU shoots to 100% and never comes down even after several hours (or days) of idle time. Logging off requires a Force Quit as Firefox won't exit normally. Normal browsing is not affected by the high cpu use but other programs sometimes are.

I've also noticed that during these periods of high CPU use the location bar does not return any results, but immediately after startup the location bar works properly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox.
2. Browse/idle a few minutes
3. Watch activity monitor / top

Actual Results:  
CPU use goes to 100% and stays there

Expected Results:  
CPU use should probably come down at some point

I am on an older 10.4-era white iMac. This does not occur on the newer 10.5-era iMacs that I've tested on with the same profile.
