When drawing constantly on a canvas element (such as in animations), switching globalCompositeOperation modes repeatedly causes massive memory loss, and eventually a crash. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an animation function that copys an images on to a canvas element
2. Make sure that this function draws once, in "source-over", switches modes to "destination-atop" and draws again.
3. Call the function repeatedly (say 10000 times or with setInterval)

Actual Results:  
Browser looses memory in large chunks until it crashes (or system kills it due to "out of memory" error).

Expected Results:  
Browser should draw images without rendering the system useless

Problem seems to affect Macs only. Short testing on Windows did not cause this behavior. The effect is actually quite intense as the system tries to allocate virtual memory to accommodate, the whole system becomes unresponsive and slow.
