Firefox shuts down on only two web pages.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.18) Gecko/2010021501 Ubuntu/8.04 (hardy) Firefox/3.0.18
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.18) Gecko/2010021501 Ubuntu/8.04 (hardy) Firefox/3.0.18

I have only seen Firefox shut down on me when I had a dozen busy web pages opened, and I believe this is a similar problem, caused by a single web page. This may also be affected by my dial up internet connection being slower than broadband. I am using Ubuntu LTS(updated) and a fully hardware serial port modem, which normally works flawlessly(4 years now?) save when my ISP fails. I have never seen this happen with a single web page loading. There are a lot of links to videos and it takes a long time to load, then Firefox so far shut down every time. Here are the two web pages with the same article mirrored, I have been wanting to read:

AND:

Perhaps this is some kind of time out error?


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox.
2.Go to the specified web page.
3.Before done loading Firefox shuts down, or occasionally I get a "Page Load Error" and Firefox stays open.




Expected Results:  
Loaded the pages in question without Firefox shutting down.

I do not allow 3rd party cookies. I control cookie allowing manually. I use Adblock Plus and NoScript. I had removed all cookies and cleared the cache but the problems still occur.
