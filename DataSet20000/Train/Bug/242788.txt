Hovers not working in menus within Firefox or for links on web pages
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

Firefox 0.8 worked fine for 2 months but just yesterday, hovers stopped working
in the Firefox menus and on web pages.  What happens is the menu item will
highlight briefly and then go back to normal within a second.  On links in web
pages the cursor will remain a pointer but any kind of hover event like
colouring or putting the link in the status bar will reset within a second just
as in the menu items.  I can honestly say that I did not install anything
yesterday.  I am running Windows XP Pro SP 1 on an IBM Thinkpad T23, 1.13GHz
with 512MB of RAM.  I tried running the install again hoping that I could reset
FF but to no avail.  I will try uninstalling and reinstalling next.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
My cube neighbour has not yet experienced the same problem.  I am pretty sure
that this is an isolated incident but IE works just fine and the menus in all of
my other applications are responding normally.



Expected Results:  
Highlight menu items and web links until you have clicked or moved off.

No crashes or themes... clicking on the link or menu item does the expected
action (goes to the correct page or runs the function), just the hovers aren't
working properly.  It greatly reduces the functionality of some web sites,
a:hover is a standard event to code styles for, but basically it is just a nuisance.
