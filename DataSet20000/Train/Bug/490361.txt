SSLStatus.cipherName not accessible with "partial encryption"

On a page with "partial encryption, the SSLStatus attributes cipherName and secretKeyLength expire after a short period (10-15 seconds or so, before they resolve to "null").

I have an extension that relies on these attributes, and I don't believe that because the content is "mixed," that the cipher name and keysize (eg. "AES-256") for the base of the page should be completely inaccessible to developers.

They are already hidden on a "Page View" of a mixed-content page, so normal users would not see them, which does make sense.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Query gBrowser.securityUI.QueryInterface(ci.nsISSLStatusProvider).SSLStatus.cipherName on an SSL mixed-content page.
2. Wait 10-30 seconds.
3. Attempt to query it again.
Actual Results:  
On the first query, cipherName returns (for example) "AES-256"
On the second result, cipherName returns null.

Expected Results:  
Returns "AES-256" always, as that is the cipher of the base of the page, regardless of mixed-content status

I'm not proposing that the UI change for end-users, just that I should be able to access the data from an extension.
