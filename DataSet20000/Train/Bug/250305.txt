Firefox will hang with heavy CPU utilization on (incomplete?) web pages
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040626 Firefox/0.9.1

When you attempt to load at least the above "friends" page, Firefox will
occasionally hang and crash; the CPU utilization goes to 100% (or 50% on my
hyperthreaded-Pentium, which I'm not sure if it has anything to do with it. I've
tried using only one CPU and it doesn't seem to help much.) 

Livejournal Friends pages may be a good test for engineers at this time;
especially between 10PM-1AM EST they tend to be slammed and often seem to break
up as incomplete. It seems like this sometimes freaks Firefox out for some
reason. I can't get this to happen consistently, but I can get it to happen
sometimes. My postulate is that incomplete images, or HTML pages (that abort
before they load), may cause Firefox to crash on occasion.

I have found that the application seems to hang a *little* less when you switch
the application to Windows 2000 compatibility mode; it doesn't seem to help much
on the web page end, but seems to allow for more incomplete images to pop up.

I have found no other page that Firefox hangs on at this time.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the web page during a high traffic time. Tonight I've found that it will
crash about 1 out of every 4 or 5 times loaded.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
One out of four to five times, the application will hang and CPU utilization
will go to 100% (well, 50% in my hyperthreading PC)

Expected Results:  
Not hang. :)

No themes loaded, but an extensive array of extensions. I have not tried
creating a new profile yet with no extensions to test the results.
