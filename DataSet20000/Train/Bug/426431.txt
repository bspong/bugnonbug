Pages with a table that has a background image do not display properly if the background image spans behind multiple rows / columns.  It will not display the image behind the table using CSS.  However, Internet Explorer shows this by setting the rows and columns to "Background: Transparent", allowing the actual table's background to be displayed.  I am working on a website that has not yet been uploaded, if that may somehow effect that.  I will update this later with the URL as soon as the page is uploaded.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.In a webpage editor, create a table that has many columns/rows with a picture as a background coded using CSS.
2.Type some text in those columns/rows.
3.Using CSS, set the value of the columns/rows to "Background: Transparent".
4.Open in Firefox and Internet Explorer and compare the two.
Actual Results:  
Firefox fails to reproduce the desired results that Internet Explorer 7 does (for once).

Expected Results:  
The background image should appear behind the text.
