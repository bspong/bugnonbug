Gnome proxy ignore list ignored (Type mismatch in nsGConfService::GetStringList)

I don't know if the problem comes from gnome or firefox. So I report here, tell
me if I am wrong.

First, in Firefox, Edit > Preferences > Settings > Advanced > Proxy settings...
I choose "use system settings".
In System > Preferences > Proxy, I choose the proxy, ok, it works. Firefox use
correctly the proxy system settings.

Except for one point : in advanced configuration in gnome proxy settings, I can
choose the hostlist to ignore, for example "localhost", which is a good point.
But those settings are totally ignored by firefox : if at work I go to
localhost, it tries to resolve "localhost" connecting to the proxy (and doesn't
resolve it).

If in firefox, instead of "use proxy system settings", I use "manual
configuration", and copy EXACTLY the same settings than those in gnome proxy
settings, especially in "no proxy for", I put "localhost", and it works.

So... there is a little bug somewhere... gnome? firefox? Don't know at all...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use a proxy.
2. Configure proxy system settings in gnome, with "no proxy for : localhost".
3. Configure "use system settings" for proxy in firefox.
4. Launch a server (apache) on your system for example
5. Try to connect to localhost...
Actual Results:  
It tries to connect to the proxy and resolve "localhost".

Expected Results:  
To directly connect to localhost (it is defined in /etc/hosts)
