I would like to report a problem I'm having with Firefox 3.5, with respect to the high consumption of memory and processor, have a computer with 1 GB of RAM, a Celeron processor 2.26 GHz, and is almost impossible to work with Firefox, because it occupies almost 50% of memory and 80% of the processor with simple things, like watching a video from youtube.com or access my hotmail, already tested with only the flap open and in use is still the same problem, I have many plugins and toolbars to justify the high consumption, I love firefox, however I can not compromise my machine with the use of it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open firefox 
2.Access the page or hotmail.com youtube.com 
3.High consumption without any special configuration
Actual Results:  
Firefox closes or crashes.

Expected Results:  
Load the page or close without crashing and without consuming much memory and processor.
