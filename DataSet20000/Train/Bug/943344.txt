firefox stops responding to file download clicks when max number of file transfers for a server is reached

Steps to reproduce:

i tried downloading files from there: http://press.liacs.nl/mirflickr/dlform.php



Actual results:

after clicking some 6 files (and all are in progress) i was no longer able to click more files and the browser did not respond any more on my clicks.


Expected results:

the browser should have offered me a download target location and let me continue with selecting more files.

its supposed there is a server limit for ongoing transfers. but then when that limit is reached its falls back on the UI behaviour of the browser by making it partially in-responsive to any click. i would rather expect to allow the browser to queue those my requests including my desired file target location and start over with the additional transfers one after the other _on its own_ when some other transfers have finished or on some timed shedule.

blocking the UI's responsiveness is probably sub-optimal. so i hope that can be improved in one way or the other.
