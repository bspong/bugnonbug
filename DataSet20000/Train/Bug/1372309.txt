Flip photon structure pref on nightly to get automated test coverage as well as nightly visibility / user testing exposure
We should flip the pref on nightly so we get more testing.

To do:
- Test failures (see https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=4414fdff7cbac8170706e341a4861c1f30d4153e )
-- jetpack tests need to have the pref disabled. We don't care about fixing them as we'll get rid of jetpack support for 57, I think? (Andy, can you confirm?)
-- I forgot to update this line:

https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/981da978f1f686ad024fa958c9d27d2f8acc5ad0/browser/components/uitour/test/browser_UITour_availableTargets.js#8-9

as described, because the patch that landed that ended up landing after the other bug. This will fix browser/components/uitour/test/browser_UITour_availableTargets.js
-- browser/base/content/test/sync/browser_sync.js - not entirely sure, I expect it's just looking at the wrong label.
-- browser/components/extensions/test/browser/browser_ext_browserAction_popup_resize.js - as noted in bug 1354109 comment 20, this is a result of the difference in height between the overflow panel and the main menu panel. I intend to disable photon during the test (as we do in a number of CUI tests and will be doing for jetpack) and file a separate webextension bug on the issue, which also affects pre-photon code (just not in situations the test is exercising).

- Talos pushes. I don't expect any surprises, but then, they would be surprises, so we best make sure...
- Ensure cedar flips the pref back to false so we continue testing non-photon there in all tests that don't explicitly flip it on/off. CC mconley for this.
