"Mark As Read" action is not working in yahoomail and hotmail
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050908 Firefox/1.4

When I tried to checked my yahoomail and hotmail using firefox 1.5 beta1 I found
that whenever I tried to set the Unread messages as Read Messages using the
options given in hotmail and yahoomail but it does not take in effect even after
the browser is reloaded after the click.
I did not experience the same problem with gmail
Please consider this problem. I couldnot find any one who has reported this problem.
I guess this could be because of some JavaScript action is not considered properly.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.login to hotmail or yahoomail account
2.try to set the unread messages as read messages using the "Mark as Read"
option given
3. You can see that nothing is effected even after the browser responded to the
click

Actual Results:  
If such a step is followed in old firefox and all the state that shows that the
message is and "Unread" must be changed to a the state of a messages is already
"Read".

Expected Results:  
Browser did not change the state of the message of the Unread Message to a Read
Message state.

The browser did not give any error message. I guess this must be related to the
way in which the scripts are handled in the firefox code.
