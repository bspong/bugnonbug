Recently Firefox malfunctions on this page. This did not happen in the past, so perhaps a recent update has caused it. The page still works perfectly with Internet Explorer and almost perfectly with Google Chrome.
When one goes to this page using Firefox, a number of the audio files begin downloading immediately. The talks are located on the bottom half of the page. This continuous data stream interferes with opening the print files that have links on the top half of the page. It also interferes with opening the Video Presentations link in the middle of the page. 
The two video presentations used to be on this page, and they would start playing (simultaneously!) shortly after the page was opened. They were moved to a new page in the hope of eliminating this problem, but problems still remain.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://www.catherinecollege.net/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?id=620
2.Scroll down and see files downloading for some of the talks.
3.Go to the web page using Internet Explorer to see how the page ought to work.
Actual Results:  
The little circle of dots on the page tab keeps turning, indicating a continuous stream of data.

Expected Results:  
Only this page should load. Nothing else should download unless a link to it is clicked.

Use Internet Explorer to see how the page should work.
