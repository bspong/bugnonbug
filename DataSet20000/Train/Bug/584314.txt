When trying to navigate to previous page, the Back icon in the address bar and the Back option in the right-click context menu are disabled, as if there was no previous page.
The backspace button still causes the browser to navigate to the previous page.
I've just discovered whilst filing this bug report that changing tabs causes the back button to work again

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open web page
2.Click on link to open another web page in same tab
3.Back option disabled, so can't go back to first page (backspace key still works)
4.Change to different tab in browser, then change back
5.Back option enabled again, allows navigation to previous page
Actual Results:  
Opened web page
Clicked on link, new page loaded successfully
Back option disabled, as if no previous page was accessed
Changed tab to another tab, then back to first tab
Back option enabled again

Expected Results:  
Back button should always allow navigation to previous page, where there is a previous page

I always have several tabs open, and preserve browsing session when re-opening browser.
