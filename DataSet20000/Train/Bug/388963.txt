CookieSafe and NoScript should be part of the core Firefox product
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20061201 Firefox/2.0.0.4 (Ubuntu-feisty)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20061201 Firefox/2.0.0.4 (Ubuntu-feisty)

I think that the combination of the CookieSafe and NoScript extensions is exactly how cookie and script security should work in Firefox:

* No scripts and no cookies by default.

* If I want to allow cookies for a site, I go to the site, and it's two clicks (and no typing!) to allow cookies for that site, and that site only.

* If a site needs JavaScript, again it's two clicks to enable script for that site, and only that site.

The default when Firefox is installed could be "cookies for everyone / script for everyone" to make advertisers and newbies happy. Then a couple of checkboxes marked something like "Restrict cookies to sites you trust" and "Restrict JavaScript to sites you trust" could switch to secure mode and turn on the UI controls equivalent to NoScript and CookieSafe.

I wrote up some <a href="http://meta.ath0.com/2007/02/02/firefox-hint/">notes</a> on NoScript and CookieSafe on my web site for anyone who doesn't know how they work.
