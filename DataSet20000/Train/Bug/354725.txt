Scroll bar jump feature not present in Linux -- makes comparing items on long page impossible

Konqueror and Internet explorer have been doing this for as long as I can remember.

 When the scroll bar on the side is gripped, and then moved, the page scrolls... when the cursor goes significantly away from the scroll bar, the page should jump back to where the reader started.

This is as essential featuer for "cat proof computing" because a reader can easilly loose a couple of minutes trying to find where ve was .

(I'm specifically comparing a list of graphics cards, and am comparing the top one with a few selected ones on a non-disclosed web site).


I looked in about:config for options to turn this feature on, and found none.
Thank you.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load long page
2.scroll with scroll bar to item far down in page
3. move curosr away from scroll bar

Actual Results:  
page does not jump back to begining

Expected Results:  
page position should change... (the new location can be brought back by simply moving the cursor back over the scroll bar)

Not marking as minor, as the work arround is tedious.
