The slowest auto-scroll speed is too fast to have the page scroll as you read.
(Espcially when the text spans the entire width of the page and is of a highly
technical nature or is poorly written.)

The ability to set minimum and maximum scroll speeds as well as the distance
increments that determine when to move up to the next speed would give auto
scroll more use than just scanning through a page or quickly jumping around.

It's just a number... bury it in about:config if you must but please let us
change it. Thanks for reading.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Middle-click to initiate auto-scroll.
2. Move mouse down ever so slightly until the page begins scrolling.
3. Read the page as it crawls by.
Actual Results:  
Middle-click again to stop the auto-scroll when the text you are trying to read
is scrolling off the top of the window.

Expected Results:  
Ability to set the speed range of auto-scroll to span from "slow" to "laughably
slow" to make it easy to hone in on a speed that allows me to keep the line I am
currently reading near the center or the bottom of the page.
