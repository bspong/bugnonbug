Bookmarks overwriting - too many bookmarks?
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.9.1.4) Gecko/20091016 Firefox/3.5.4 ImageShackToolbar/5.2.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Sometimes when I bookmark a page it will display a different title and have a folder preselected - generally its a bookmark in that bookmark folder with that title. If I'm not careful to rename and select a different folder - the bookmark will overwrite the old one. Also some bookmarks seem to be getting overwritten by other links I have clicked on. I have over 200 bookmarks and was wondering if that could be part of the issue.  - I tried organizing the bookmarks into separate folders to hopefully stop it from happening but it persists. Longer URLs may have an effect on this reoccurring also.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Pull down bookmark menu
2.Click bookmark this page
3.Check to see if the title and bookmark page match or not
Actual Results:  
Sometimes Firefox will preselect a folder and a title of a bookmark already in that folder and will overwrite that bookmark.

Expected Results:  
Most of the time Firefox enters the title of the webpage that I want as the bookmark title and defaults to the bookmark folder
