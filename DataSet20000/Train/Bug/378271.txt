Font kerning support (TTF embedded kerning information)

True type fonts have embedded kerning information within them. This information is currently not being used by Firefox when rendering the fonts.

The CSS Text Level 3 Working Draft 6 March 2007 mentions support for "Fullwidth Punctuation Kerning: the 'punctuation-trim' property" but leaves kerning support to the Fonts module ("'kerning-mode: contextual'  has been replaced with 'punctuation-trim: adjacent'. Any further controls for kerning will likely be delegated to the Fonts module.") 

The Font module (CSS3 module: Fonts; Working Draft 2 August 2002) is still quiet about kerning as of today.

I suggest full kerning support for True Type Fonts in Gecko 2.0 for Firefox 4.0.

Sorry, many of the posters here are wrong: most of the current browsers do not do kerning.
You are confusing kerning with proportional fonts.

Try this:
AVAVAVAVAV
AAAAAVVVVV

If your browser does kerning, and the fonts has kerning info, the two strings should NOT have equal width.

Now try this in MS Word. Still equal.
Then select "Format" -> "Font" -> "Character Spacing" tab, check "Kerning for fonts" and choose a small size (let's say 3 points and above).
Words will start doing kerning.
Then try various fonts. Arial and Times New Roman have kerning info. Arial Unicode MS does not.

Mihai is correct; browsers generally don't respect kerning information. If you have a Mac and Safari with the debug menu enabled, you can get a dramatic demonstration of that by just turning on the "Use ATSU text" option, reloading the page, and watching what happens to the AAAAVVVV strings posted above. In addition to that, browsers have lousy justification algorithms and none of them, as far as I know, have hyphenation algorithms. (Firefox won't even respect manual "hinting" with the soft hyphen entity!)
