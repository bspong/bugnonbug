Currently there is a preference "browser.fullscreen.animateUp" which stops the animation when moving INTO full screen mode. However there is also the reverse animation when moving OUT of full screen mode, which does not seem to be covered by this or another preference. It would be good to be able to prevent this animation too. For example:
* There could be a "browser.fullscreen.animateDown" preference, for coming out of full screen mode.
* or, there could be a "browser.fullscreen.animate" preference, which applied to both going into and out of full screen mode. (since it is likely that people either want animation, or don't want animation - the subset of people who want animation in one direction but not in the other is likely to be fairly small).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open about:config and set browser.fullscreen.animateUp to 0
2. Press F11 to enter full screen mode. Observe no animation.
3. Press F11 to exit full screen mode. Observe there is animation.
