about:sessionrestore switches button placement
This is one of those issues that we are going to get flamed on: the new about:sessionrestore dialog switches the location of the new/restore buttons.  While making UI is all about breaking cartons of eggs, I really think this is one carton we are breaking for no obvious benefit.

In the old dialog:
|------------------------------|
|                              |
| <text><text><text>           |
|                              |
| New Session   Restore Session|
|-------------------------------

In the new dialog we get:
|------------------------------|
|                              |
| <nifty new tab list>         |
|                              |
| Restore Session   New Session|
|-------------------------------

So, the issue here is pretty obvious.  We've trained people to click one or the other of these buttons based on their usual preference (Mine is to always restore the last session).  Now, when they click on their usual button, the opposite action will happen.  I don't see any clear UI win on this shift whatsoever; it just looks like we are in progress with this dialog.

== Expected ==
The dialog can look new shiny and beautiful but keep "New Session" on the left and "Restore Session" on the right.

== Actual ==
The buttons are backwards from the previous version.
