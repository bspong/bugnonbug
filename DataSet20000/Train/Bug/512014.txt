Firefox on Vista does not give the correct error message when a client certificate is expired

If you connect to an SSL web server configured for mutual authentication, but your personal client certificate has expired, the error message thrown is wrong.  On XP, the correct error is displayed (certificate expired).  On Vista, the error name is "ssl_error_handshake_failure_alert", which doesn't tell the user what actually happened.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have an expired personal certificate
2. Connect to an SSL mutual auth webserver, from a Vista client (not XP)
3. Wrong error message.
Actual Results:  
Error code: ssl_error_handshake_failure_alert

Expected Results:  
Error code: ssl_error_expired_cert_alert. 
The instructions at the bottom of the alert should also be more helpful, such as telling the user that their cert has expired and needs to be replaced, instead of the current message (contact the web site owners).

I have screen shots of both systems, XP (correct message) and Vista (wrong message) if that would help.
