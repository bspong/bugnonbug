Does it take much to add the "Keyboard shortcut" (or accelerator) editbox into the "Properties" dialog box that could be accessed for bookmarks via right-clicking them by the mouse?

This kind of functionality is native for various development environments, where you can assign your own shortcuts for most favorite tools. I think this could be a really useful feature for those who navigate to certain predefined sites often. Imagine: Alt+W - and your at the wikipedia.org in an instant, Alt+M - and you are at your gmail account..

Just some ideas to mention
1) as bookmarks do multiply in time, single keystroke might be not enough - e.g.  MS VisualStudio allows to define some 2-clicks sequences like {Ctrl+K, B} or {Ctrl+K, E} to trigger the function
2) many people use national keyboard layouts that they often switch between (e.g. ru <-> en), so keyboard shortcuts better be defined in key scan-codes rather than currently active alphabet codes.
3) if tab-page/window with the same bookmark loaded already exists, the shortcut could just activate this tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Access wikipedia/gmail/dozen_of_your_favorite_sites often
2. Become bored of using mouse to pick up the bookmark
3. Crave to have keyboard shortcuts defined for bookmarks
