After clearing browsing history which had not been cleared in a long while (sorry, no details on how large it was), FF 3.6.8 repeatedly crashes, usually within 2 minutes, regardless of url, restarting, rebooting, disabling addons, ect.
After browsing my crashes on /crash-stats.mozilla.com, seems that all of my crashes were related to sqlite3VdbeExec.  Upon further research looking at sdwilsh comments for bug 523405 at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=523405#c14 I linked my clearing of the browsing history as the possible cause, and deleted my places.sqlite, which fixed the crashing problem - So this might be a continuation of this problem or some other sqlite file corruption issue.  I haven't tried to reproduce, because I assumed this had to do with the buildup of the places.sqlite over a long period of time.
It ranks as 29 for now.  http://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/list?range_value=2&range_unit=weeks&date=2010-08-27%2010%3A00%3A00&signature=sqlite3VdbeExec&version=Firefox%3A3.6.8
