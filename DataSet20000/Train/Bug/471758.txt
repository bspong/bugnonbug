This does not seem to be an easily reproducable problem. But has happened probably twice a week. When browsing around, all is woring well, and then all of a sudden the rendering of the pages seems to break. Once this happens I go back to google (which seems to look ok), then I do a search, click on a search result and nothing happens. Well, the little spinner shows for a split second, but I am still on the search results page. I then click my home button (google) and then do the search again, still cannot click the links. So I do a few refreshes and then I seem to be able to click the link. Again, this this is not an exact science to get it to work. Then I go to my page and the page is not rendered correctly. The CSS does not seem to be parsed and applied, and some images are not displayed. I then try another site and it does not work. So back to google again, do another search and seems some pages start working. But another website down, and the display has gone again. Now I have left the browser open for about 10 minutes, doing nothing, and all seems to be fine? I realise this is going to be hard to reproduce, so I think I should say about how I use my MacBook. I generally do not switch it off, maybe it gets restarted once a week or two. I usually, just close the screen and let it go to sleep, then just open it up, wait for airport to reconnect and start browsing. I can only think that this could be related to how OSX handles going to sleep. But it is weird, how leaving the browser for around 10 minutes seemed to solve the issue? Otherwise, I quit FireFox and restart which solves the problem.
