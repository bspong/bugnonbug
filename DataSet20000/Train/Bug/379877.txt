Bookmarks Manager - 1) drag& drop opens bookmark, 2) NEW WINDOW commands different

1) In Bookmarks Manager when I reorder the bookmarks by dragging and dropping in a new location, the bookmark OPENS if it is a single bookmark OR gives me a dialogue asking me if I really want to open all ## bookmarks if it is a bookmark file.

2) To open a New Window in FIREFOX, it is a FILE pull down item entitled NEW WINDOW.  To open a New Window in Bookmarks Manager it is a WINDOW pull down item entitled MOZILLA FIREFOX - this is unnecessarily confusing - change to Bookmarks Manager to match Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Select Organize Bookmarks form BOOKMARKS menu
2.Select individual BOOKMARK to relocate, drag and drop in new location
3.That Bookmark is automatically opened.  If Firefox ONLY has the Organize Bookmarks window open, it refreshes that window with the BOOKMARKED Page. If another window is opened, it overlays that page with the moved Bookmark page. 


Expected Results:  
1) When you organize bookmarks, all you want to do is move them to a new location in the pull down list - when moved, they should not open unless you double-click them as an OPEN command.

2) the same command should have the same name and be under the same pull down whenever possible.
