On Win2KPro SP4 FireFox any version 3 and up, some pages with FLASH make 1.5GHz P4 machines run worse than a 486! The mouse hardly moves whiel flash loading and the entire PC is slow to respond to mouse clicks. This happens on my other machine running Win2KPro SP4 aswell. It doesn't happen in Linux and it certainly doesn't happen in Internet Explorer. I'm a big FireFox fan but I'm ready to throw it out and not consider it for Win2K installs anymore with flash being common place now on most sites.

www.orcon.net.nz while loading mouse can hardly move. This has happened on a few adobe flash latest releases on me. As soon as I switch tab to a non-flash site FireFox runs like a charm again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Win2K Pro SP4
2. Load www.orcon.net.nz
3. Wiggle mouse try and do ANYTHING with the flash page on screen laoding... CPU goes through the roof.
Actual Results:  
Grind teeth to the gums and switch to Internet Explorer to visit same page with same version of flash.


Loaded as fast as it does in Internet Explorer, extremely quick, and can move the mouse and click on things while page is loading without gridlock on the CPU and system.
