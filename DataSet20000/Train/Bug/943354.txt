Expected results:

interested developers that are skilled for a certain topic should jump on that topics first and care for them by e.g. subscribing to the bug, checking its contents for what to do or at least helping to find some more skilled person(s) to resolve it. - this type report shall help them to faster locate what others thought is an important fix, change or feature for the project.
