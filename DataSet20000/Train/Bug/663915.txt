The page is not displayed correctly by Firefox 4.01 on my Windows7 system. I thought it was a problem in the html of the page and reported it at LibreOffice. However it turns out that Firefox 4.01 under Windows 2000 or Windows XP displays the page correctly. I would expect the same version of browser to display a page the same, regardless the html is correct or not. So I think you should have a look at this.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://help.libreoffice.org/Main_Page in FF4.01 on Windows7 system

Actual Results:  
The caption "LibreOffice Help" on the top is somewhat shifted to the left and most of the first letter L is obscured.

Expected Results:  
The caption "LibreOffice Help" should be aligned with "Page" below it and be fully visible. 

My system is AMD Phenom II X4 910e with Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit (Dutch).
Internet Explorer 9.0 on this system displays the page correctly, as does FF4.01 on a Windows XP system.
