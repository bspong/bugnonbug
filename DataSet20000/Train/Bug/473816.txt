Extensions not installed after restart

I've had this issue happen on two different Vista machines now.  When I first install Firefox, installing additional extensions works fine for a while.  

Now, whenever I try to install an extension, it downloads the extension and tells me I need to restart Firefox to finish installing.  Firefox restarts OK, but it forgets the extension that was installed - it doesn't appear in the Add-ons control panel nor anywhere else.

If I re-try the above procedure, it does the same again - after restarting the extension is forgotten, resulting in me not being able to install any more extensions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install extension from Mozilla Add-ons (e.g. Flagfox)
2. Click Restart when Firefox asks me to
3. After restart extension is not visible in Add-ons, nor installed
Actual Results:  
After restarting Firefox, the installed extension is not installed.

Expected Results:  
After restarting Firefox, the installed extension should be installed and functioning.

Upgrades to extensions *appear* to install OK, it's just new extension installations, and it's only present some time after the installation of Firefox.

When I had this on my other PC, I tried deleting and re-creating my Firefox profile, and re-installing Firefox completely, but had no luck.  I ended up reinstalling Windows, and then it worked for a while, now it's broken again.

The computer I'm now on (a new laptop) I've been using for less than 10 days, so it starts happening less than 2 weeks after Firefox has been installed.
