Streaming a radio station does not work.

I have tried with two separate radio stations to listen to their online broadcast.  Neither has worked.  I tried both of them in IE and they both played fine there.  

I had the same problem with the "Coraline" video trailer example Firefox provided when I installed the beta.  I get a gray box where the video should be, but no video or audio.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to http://www.kfbk.com/cc-common/ondemand/player.html?world=st
2. Should begin streaming radio in a few seconds but doesn't.
3.
Actual Results:  
When going to the link above, the browser window resizes.  There are a few "connecting..." and "transfering..." message that flash on the bottom information bar.  The logo for KFBK NewsTalk 1530 radio is displayed.  That is as far as it gets.

Expected Results:  
Should happen just as described in the Actual Results section, but then a short commercial should play followed by the streaming of the radio broadcast.
