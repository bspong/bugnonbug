Sorry if this is mis-categorized, no "Enhancement Bug" category per the directions on the FAQ.

Suggestion - disable all potentially harmful active content (Javascript, etc.) on links that have never been visited before until the user approves the site, probably via a popup window or toolbar window. Similar to how popups are approved on a site, just for all the potentially harmful tech at once. 

A short display of the site's specifics (real domain, country of origin, etc.)  may be presented to assist the user in their decision.

This is a "brickwall" technique- no matter how good the bad programmers are, it will stop the execution of harmful code until the user decides that the site is trustworthy. 

The list of user-approved sites would have to be maintained separately from temporary files (cookies, etc.) to avoid having the list cleared when the cache is cleared. Sites may be able to "register" with an organization to automatically approve the use of potentially harmful content, which would shortcut the process. The user's list of sites may also be kept with that organization and checked via the browser.
