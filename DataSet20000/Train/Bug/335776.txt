I took a 1024x768 window, set it to full screen mode, changed resolution to 1280x1024.  Full screen window did not change to fit the new resoultion.  This is a common enough issue so not very important (though should be looked at), however if you then change it to normal mode, then back to full screen, then change the resoultion from 1280x1024 to 1024x768 and exit full screen mode the browser does not shrink to fit the available space, the upper and right of the program is off the screen by the amount of the resoution change - this is a problem.  Can be resolved by minimizing the window via the start bar and restoring it however this should not be necessary.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go full screen in a large resolution
2. Change resolution to lower resolution
3. Exit full screen mode.

Actual Results:  
Upper and right part of the program is off the screen by the amount of the resolution change

Expected Results:  
window resizes to available area
