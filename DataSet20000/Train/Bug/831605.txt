Proxy configuration script fails to install
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:17.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/17.0
Build ID: 20121128204232

Steps to reproduce:

Firefox version 18.0 does not load the Proxy Configuration script. Whether “Auto-detect proxy settings for this network”, or “Automatic proxy configuration URL:” is used. Error console window shows the error message: "PAC file failed to install from http://wpad/wpad.dat". IE and Google Chrome successfully retrieve and execute the proxy configuration script using the same URL.

I tried reinstalling (including removing all preferences), and rebooting.

I have tried this on Windows 7 (64-bit), Windows XP SP3 (32-bit), and LinuxMint 12 (64-bit). All have failed with the same error. On LinuxMint 12, I also tried a local file copy.

Firefox version 17.0.1 is the latest version I've tried that works on the same platforms.

I maintain our company's proxy.pac (wpad.dat) file, and have been since Netscape 2.0. So, I'm fairly familiar with these settings in our environment.




Actual results:

Firefox returns an error web page similar to:

Unable to connect
Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at 
www.linuxmint.com.




Expected results:

The intended Internet web site would be retrieved through the configured proxy.
