PDF files won't open properly if url doesn't contain .pdf extension

When a simplified url is used to open a pdf document, firefox doesn't add extension to the file, and so doesn't open it with Preview or other PDF reader.

Firefox saves the file without extension.
In the url above, it will generate a file named "bugzilla".
If we add a slash at the end (http://eagleweb.be/bugzilla/), the name will look like "Fb6LCL7P.pdf(2).part".

When you open the file, a warning message appears : "... is a Unix application downloaded from the internet..."

Only Firefox on Mac has this behavior. Other browsers are fine.

I experienced the same problem with other files that uses the same technique (apache url rewriting).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the url http://eagleweb.be/bugzilla
Actual Results:  
Downloads the file, but without a proper extension, and so can't open it.

Expected Results:  
Downloads the file, with the proper extension, and opens it as a pdf file.

Code used for redirection:
RewriteRule ^bugzilla/?$ 	firefox-3-6-reviewers-guide.pdf
