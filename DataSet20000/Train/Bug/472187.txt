"Try Again" attempts to load prior URL instead of the last attempted URL.

When two different URLs fail to load consecutively, and the "Try Again" button is clicked once the second URL fails to load, Firefox attempts to load the first URL.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Attempt to load a URL which would not load (eg:- http://127.0.0.1:3010/ ) by typing it in the location bar and hitting enter.

2. The "Unable to Connect" page should appear along with the "Try Again" button.

3. Now attempt to load a different URL which would also not load (eg:- http://127.0.0.1:3030/ ).

4. Once again the "Unable to Connect" page should appear along with the "Try Again".

5. Click the "Try Again" button and Firefox would try to load http://127.0.0.1:3010/ instead of http://127.0.0.1:3010/.


Actual Results:  
Firefox would try to load http://127.0.0.1:3010/ instead of http://127.0.0.1:3030/

Expected Results:  
Firefox should try to load http://127.0.0.1:3030/

The TCP requests have been monitored using TCPView and have revealed that the former  URL (3010 in the example) is in fact being requested, and not simply displayed while the latter (3030 in the example) is requested.
