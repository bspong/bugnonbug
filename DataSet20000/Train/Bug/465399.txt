xmlhttp request object not working in 2.0.0.18 update (in this case, for a dynamic chat system)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.18) Gecko/20081029 Firefox/2.0.0.18
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.18) Gecko/20081029 Firefox/2.0.0.18

After restarting FF after the 2.0.0.18 update, my chat system (as well as the similar systems at www.kingdomofloathing.com and www.twilightheroes.com) has stopped updating. The user can still send messages in my system, but in the other two the chat simply does nothing (i.e., the xmlhttp request failed to send the message). It seems to be making only one request, and then dying. It doesn't appear to happen on all instances of 2.0.0.18, but it's occured on several right after updating (both my laptop and my desktop, as well as a few of my friend's computers). Other examples not involving chats- myspace's friend updates feature, forumwarz's navigation system are both broken and use xmlhttp requests.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install FF 2.0.0.18
2. Visit a site with xmlhttp request JS object
Actual Results:  
Object does not work.

Expected Results:  
Object works.

It happens every time if it happened at all after you updated to 2.0.0.18, but it doesn't appear as though it will happen if it didn't immediately happen after updating.
