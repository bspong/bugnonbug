Can't Save Message Text to Disk in Yahoo Mail using Other name than default

When trying to Save Text from a Yahoo Mail page
(http://us.f511.mail.yahoo.com/ym/ShowLetter/), the Save Message Text option
opens an Opening file.txt dialogue box.  When I try to select Save to Disk, the
options are "txtfile (default)" and "Other".  It seems to be able to save
"file.txt" as a default, but there is no option to create an alternative name
for the saved file.  When I try to select "Other", it brings up 
"Choose Helper Application" -- the default Look In is a "Mozilla Firefox"
folder.  There does not seem to be a Save to Disk -- Other option wherein you
could create a file name and save the textfile to disk.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open an email file under Yahoo Mail.
2. Click on "Save Message Text in the lower right corner of the page.
3. Choose the Save to Disk button and it indidates you have chosen to save
"file.txt"
4. When the Opening file.txt dialogue box appears, if you select "Other", it
takes you to the "Choose Helper Application", but there is no option to rename
the file or save it. 

Actual Results:  
The only options are to save as "file.txt or to go to the "Choose Helper
Application" with no apparent way to rename and save the file.txt.

Expected Results:  
There should be a "Save As" option when the "Save Message Text" appears or when
"Save to Disk" is selected.  The Save As option should allow you to create a
filename and save the file to disk.
