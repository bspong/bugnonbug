Can't cancel download that was not initiated "properly"
>>>   My Info:   Win7_64, Nightly 49, 32bit, ID 20160526082509
STR_1:
1. Open https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/skins/contrib/Mozilla/tabzilla.png
2. Clear cache in about:preferences#advanced -> Network, disable internet connection
3. Switch to the tab opened in Step 1
4. Right-click on the image, click "Save Image as...", press Enter to save image
5. Open downloads panel or "All downloads" (Ctrl+J)
6. Click close button near the download item created in Step 4
7.(bonus) Enable internet connection

AR:
 Step 4 - new download item is created, it only shows progressbar
 Step 6 - no visible action 
 Step 7 - downloads is canceled, and the item displays text "Canceled"

ER:  
 Step 6 - downloads should be canceled, and the item displays text "Canceled" (i.e. result of Step 7)


Note:
1) I run into this issue on different sites from time to time, but never was able to reproduce
   it reliably, until I tested STR_1, and it was 100% reproducible.
2) This happens when I want to cancel download before connection is established. Actually, I don't
   know what happens in back end, but it's obvious that download stays in pending state and only
   displays progressbar until something happens. I referred to that "something" as a "propper
   initialization" in the summary. Please improve the summary with appropriate definitions.
   Anyway, sometimes it takes up to 20 seconds for download to start, so I don't have to be super fast
