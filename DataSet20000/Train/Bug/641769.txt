Segmentation fault when try to watch some flash video.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; it; rv:1.9.1.16) Gecko/20110107 Iceweasel/3.5.16 (like Firefox/3.5.16)

Sometimes i get this error from shell:

The program 'firefox-bin' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'GLXBadContext'.
  (Details: serial 1596712 error_code 144 request_code 135 minor_code 4)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox
2. Watch the first video (it happens more times on www.repubblica.it)
3. Try to buffer another video on a new tab.
Actual Results:  
Firefox exits.

Expected Results:  
Buffer the video and make me possible to watch it.

I use Debian on a 64-bit architecture, I don't use themes.
