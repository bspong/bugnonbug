Cannot switch off new tab thumbnail generation
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:18.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/18.0
Build ID: 20130116073211

Steps to reproduce:

I have been trying to disable thumbnail generation, but this seems impossible to do.

in about config, I have:

browser.newtab.url > Set to about:blank (also tried leaving empty, and "Google.com")

browser.newtabpage.enabled > false

Created: browser.pagethumbnails.capturing_disabled > true

services.sync.prefs.sync.browser.newtabpage.enabled > false

Still Firefox creates thumbnails for every non-https page I view. This includes full readable text of all of my private emails typed in mail2web, my search queries in Google, visits to medical sites, and everything else.

Turning on Private Browsing makes no difference. I have the cache set to zero, and "Do not remember history" enabled.

The thumbnails can either be read from the AppData Firefox folder, or thumbs older than about an hour are insecurely deleted by Firefox, so can be easily recovered from my hard disk using free Recuva software. I see about 600 insecure deletions per day, which forms a history of everything I've ever looked at or typed into Firefox for at least the past few months just sitting on my hard disk.

This behavior was first noticed by me in Firefox 17 and 18. I am using Vista, which Firefox is supposed to be compatible with.

I'd be grateful for any help, as this is a massive privacy issue.
