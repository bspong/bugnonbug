Firefox is not exiting after being closed under Windows XP Pro SP2
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404 Firefox/2.0.0.14
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404 Firefox/2.0.0.14

I updated Firefox to 2.0.0.14 on 2 Win XP Pro systems.  Both gave error messages after the restart saying that some files could not be updated, please close all applications and retry.  It took me several attempts to notice that Firefox was still shown in the Windows Task Manager and that each retry had added another copy of firefox.exe.  After explicitly stopping all instances of firefox.exe using the Task Manager, FF restarted without any warning messages.  However, now when I close all FF windows, firefox.exe is still shown in the Task Manager Process list and is still taking up memory.  This problem did not occur before the update to 2.0.0.14.

The following add-one are present on my systems:
Cooliris previews 2.6.3; DOM Inspector 1.8.1.14; DownThemAll! 1.0.1; Firebug 1.05; Foxmarks Bookmark Synchronizer 2.0.45; Greasemonkey 0.7.2008121.0; M3U Ripper 1.5; NoScript 1.6; PicLens 1.6.2.1605; Talkback 2.0.0.11; YSlow 0.9.4.

I believe that I had updated NoScript to 1.6 shortly before updating FF to 2.0.0.14.
