When using "Save As PDF" selection from the pull down menu in the Print window in OS X.4.11, FF 3.5.2, the entire web page isn't saved as it was in FF 3.0.11. This is especially true with pages like http://www.hardcoreware.net/reviews/review-372-5.htm. If I save the page as html the entire page is saved. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Press Command-P to get the Print window

2.Select "Save As PDF" from the Pull down menu in the lower left corner of the Print window.

3.Click on the saved item in the location you Saved it in and it opens as three pages the first and last are mostly empty except for the ads and the second page contains part of the web page
Actual Results:  
Just a small portion of the page is saved.

Expected Results:  
Every image/graph and all text should be saved in the pdf. From some of the web pages in this article the pdf should be five or more pages long.
