This is the log into my account at Amazon.com page.  If you see this the way I do it doesn't allow us to see the background image, the center of the page is blank, all the options are either on the left or right to choose from but they are all in black text and white background no visual buttons to see.  Links do light up in blue but trying to log in is impossible.  I've reported this problem to Amazon.com but they said they are operating just fine.  Its been four months now nothing has changed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  go to amazon.com
2.  click on my account
3.  the page appears just as described.  try logging in the log in button doesn't recognize users account.
Actual Results:  
 loop.  Doesn't recognize user.  Page keeps re-appearing as log in failed.


should have read the my account page properly with the actual background of the Amazon.com logo and page information in color, the log in buttons and the pictures and advertisements on their log in page.  The log in button should connect with their server and recognize my log in information and connect me to my account page so I can proceed with orders and purchases.
