When client authentication is true in Apache SSL cannot view the web page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011913 Firefox/3.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011913 Firefox/3.0.6

Once Client Authentication is enable in Apache SSL, when I viewed a particular web page in firfox2 it says "Certificate presented has invalid signature" and once I confirm message I'm getting a blank page.

Same as in Firefox after adding Exception it says

Secure Connection Failed

An error occurred during a connection to 192.168.1.106:8443.

Peer's certificate has an invalid signature.

(Error code: sec_error_bad_signature)


This is same for Google chrome, Opera browsers too but works fine in IE 6,7.
Once I have disable the client authentication part in Apache SSL I can view the web page without a problem.

For signing purpose I have used SHAwithRSA and for client authentication I'm presenting Ikey 2032 token. In IE it prompts a dialog box to select the certificate and after selecting the certificate in token it ask for token password. If the certificate presented is valid I can continue to the web page.
