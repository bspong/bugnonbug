I have a dualscreen setup and one big 19" and a small 17". That is why I'm running both on different resolutions. Most of the times when I maximize firefox on my smaller screen (the primairy) it uses the resolution of my bigger one (where my taskbar is) and hence the top falls of the screen. This is unworkable, so I have decided to downgrade firefox to 3.05, where I never had the problem.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open firefox on the small screen
2.minimize (preferbly via the taskbar on the bigger screen)
3.maximize or restore via the taskbar

if this fails, try the following:

1.open firefox on the small screen
2.minimize (preferbly via the taskbar on the bigger screen)
3.close firefox
4.open firefox
5.maximize or restore via the taskbar


Actual Results:  
The first three steps failed to reproduce the bug, the second 5 steps did reproduce it.

Expected Results:  
The topbar of firefox shouldn't be `falling of' my monitor. It should remember on which monitor it pops up and set the resolution correct acording to the monitor
