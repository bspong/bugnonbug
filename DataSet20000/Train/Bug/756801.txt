No way to stop automatic Firefox Update checks, Yahoo Toolbar, and connection to Firefox Welcome (I am a veteran user of Firefox!!).
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:12.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/12.0
Build ID: 20120420145725

Steps to reproduce:

I've tried disabling all Add-ons, Extensions, unchecked Yahoo toolbar from View in Menu Bar, as well as uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox 12 twice. I've also changed options in Advanced, Tools to "Never Update". 


Actual results:

Firefox 12 STILL opens with 3 tabs: my default homepage (last to load), the unwanted "Firefox Welcome" page (for which I've submitted umpteenth time the brief survey question on whether I know Mozilla/Firefox is non-profit, etc.), the automatic Firefox Update checking Add-On compatibility (first to load), plus the Yahoo Toolbar page opening with additional windows. Extremely annoying, after I've been such a long time, loyal, exclusive user of Firefox (I detest Microsoft). But I am on the verge of not using Firefox on my desktop (Windows 7 Professional 64x). Strangely, these problems DO NOT occur on my laptop (Windows 7 Home Premium 64x).



Expected results:

Well, I should have expected just my default Homepage to load on Firefox startup, of course!
