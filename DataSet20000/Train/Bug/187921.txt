Any "help" related link on eBay site brings up a popup window. This window is
either blank (white) or displays for part of a second then clears. 
Some URLs are:
http://pages.ebay.com/help/buy/search_tips.html
http://pages.ebay.com/help/account/my_ebay_bidding.html
http://pages.ebay.com/search/items/basicsearch.html
I've tried others and they (help links) all seem to not display.
Displays correctly in IExplorer 6.0.2800 and Netscape Communicator 4.8


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on eBay help related link
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Popup window appears, labeled "eBay Help Hub - Phoenix"
Sometimes it fills with color and text, for less than a second, then goes blank.
Other times it pops up white and remains white.


Expected Results:  
Popup window should appear, fill with color and text.
NOTE:
IExplorer 6 fills with color, yellow, and text which remains.
Netscape Communicator 4.8 fills with color, yellow, and text which blinks on
then off then returns and remains after a short delay (1 - 2 seconds).


I noticed it originally with build .4 yesterday.
Couldn't find any other help popup window sites to check them.
