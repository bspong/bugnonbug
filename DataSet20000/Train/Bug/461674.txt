Firefox uses a tab already in use to display search results from built in search box instead of using new opened tab

I opened a new blank tab. Then I typed something in the built in search box and hit enter. Instead of using the new tab I opened to display the search results it uses at tab that I already have open and using on another site to display the search results. It has been doing this all day. I cannot figure it out and it has been doing this all day.  Also when I right click on a link and then click on open link in new tab nothing happens.  Then after trying a few times the link finally opens in a new tab.  Why is it doing these things and how do I fix it.
