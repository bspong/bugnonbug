Having problems using Firefox on Mac OS 10.4.

When typing in text boxes - a common activity - the focus seems to be lost after every few characters.  I have to click back inside the text box to get the focus back.

By focus being lost I mean the usual things, i.e. typing no longer works and the flashing cursor disappears.

Does not happen 100% of the time, but once it has started, it doesn't go away of its own accord.  Quitting Firefox and relaunching doesn't seem to solve the problem.  Restarting the machine usually (but not always) fixes it, at least for a while.

Sometimes drop-down menus fail.  I can select another item from the list, but the original selection is retained.

Makes the product almost impossible to use a lot of the time.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
I haven't found a way to reproduce it reliably.  On launching Firefox the problem is absent (e.g. right now it's fine) but once the software has been running for a while, it usually starts to happen spontaneously.  I have no idea why.
