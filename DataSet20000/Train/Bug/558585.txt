Window flashes white when a new tab is made, despite settings

I have both browser.display.background_color and browser.display.focus_background_color set to '#000000'.  Additionally, I have 'When Minefield starts' set to 'Show a blank page'.

Despite all this, when a new tab is made the window flashes white then turns black.  It should never flash white with these settings.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Set browser.display.focus_background_color and browser.display.background_color to something dark (such as #000000)
2.  Make a new tab
3.  Notice the split-second white flash
Actual Results:  
The main window flashed white for a short period of time

Expected Results:  
The window should have remained the set background color

I use this black-background setup along with a dark GTK theme and 'use system colors' when in a low-light environment.  The sudden bright flashes in an otherwise dark environment are unpleasant and hurt my eyes after a while.  With previous versions of Firefox which did not flash white when making a new tab this was not the case.
