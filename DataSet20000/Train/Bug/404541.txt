When trying to install Firefox 3 Beta 1 under a Standard User in Windows Vista, upon getting to the "Choose Install Location" section of the installer, clicking "Next" gives the error that "You don't have access to write to the installation directory.  Click OK to select a different directory."  If I right-click the installer and choose "Run as Administrator" and enter the appropriate credentials, it installs just fine.  On a similar note, the installer did not ask to be elevated as most installers for Vista do by now.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to Windows Vista under a Standard User Account.
2. Download the Firefox 3 Beta 1 installer.
3. Run the installer.
4. Proceed through the installer until the "Choose Install Location" dialog.
5. Click "Next" to accept the default directory.
Actual Results:  
A popup dialog exclaims:
"You don't have access to write to the installation directory.  Click OK to select a different directory."

Expected Results:  
The installer should have asked for elevated rights upon execution and run the installer as such.
