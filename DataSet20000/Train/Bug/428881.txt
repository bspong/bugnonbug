After visiting the mentioned URL, the page loads and the openlaszlo demos on the page appear to work correctly. The processor usage climbs after loading to 100% usage. After closing the tab containing the page, processor usage returns to normal idle usage.

Tested on a Vista machine running Firefox 3 beta 5 public release and this problem was not occurring.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Direct the browser to the following URL: http://www.openlaszlo.org/lps4/docs/developers/tutorials/views-tutorial.html
2. Check CPU usage
Actual Results:  
CPU usage was at 100% for the particular thread the firefox process was running in.

Expected Results:  
The browser should load the page and return CPU to idle (this is the case with Firefox v2)

This occurs regardless of my extensions being enabled, running in safe mode, or using the latest nightly build (Build 2008041306). No crashes occur. I have only tested this with multiple tabs open. Running Windows XP SP2 32bit.

This was also tested on a separate machine running Windows Vista 32bit (running Firefox 3 beta 5 public release), the problem was not reproducible.
