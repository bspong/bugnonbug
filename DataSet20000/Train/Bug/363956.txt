Tabbing between the .tif documents and the original search eventually freeze Firefox.

Retrieved images are returned as .tif, .pdf and the like in new tabs (instead of making a new copy or overlaying, as before... In addition to being a pain in the butt not having the alt-tab option, allowing more than a few .tif tabs to exist results in the Firefox "freezing".  The workaround is to cancel the Firefox 
using the Windows Task Manager and start a new Firefox, taking the "Recover" option.  The last images and any Delphion/Japanese/PTO searches appear and the problem appears to go away - until the next time .tif tabs are allowed to accumulate.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Retrieve a patent
2. go back and retrieve another
3. flip between the retrieval menu tab and the two results tabs until Firefox fails to respond.

Actual Results:  
firefox fails to respond and must be restarted

Expected Results:  
the image is available for reading, extracting, etc.  Ideally, the documents should be able to be "hot-keyed" back and forth with alt-tab as before, rather than using the pointer to as the new Firefox 2.0 tabbing requires

I may have to revert to earlier Firefox versions or switch to IE7 or Opera and learn to incorporate them into our procedures if this continues.
