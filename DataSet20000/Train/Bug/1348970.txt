Tab outline/text shines through from other tabs if tabs overlap (some pixels at the edge of the tab shape are transparent but shouldn't be)

Steps to reproduce:

(This is probably a nitpick but it bothered me enough to now report, please close if irrelavant, however if I get some pointers where to look at to fix it I am happy to invest time.)

This is using the default theme on the current nightly 54.0a2 (2017-03-19) but is there since some time now.

Open at least two tabs, then hover over the tab next to the active one and see the tab borders slightly overlap OR drag'n'drop a tab from the tabbar and move it across the bar. The rendering issue is seen the screenshot.


Actual results:

It appears that the tabs in the tabbar contain a semi or fully transparent pixel line at the edge, just inside the borderline, causing icons or text from other tabs and the outline of a hovered tab shine through.


Expected results:

I am not sure if there was a reason for having that transparent pixel line (or maybe a gradient on the edge), but on hidpi screens it looks simply a bit broken, which is unfortnuate as otherwise the tabs look very nice.
