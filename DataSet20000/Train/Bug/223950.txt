Provide UI for configuring/disabling keyword.URL functionality

A competing browser that I will not mention by name, the last time I used it,
had an annoying default feature.  Where that browser could not contact the uri
entered or, if the uri is not valid, it will transmit the uri to the web portal
branch of the browser provider and perform a web search.  I am informed that
this feature can be deactivated in the advanced preferences dialogue pane for
this browser.

I was unhappy when switching from Mozilla Seamonkey to Mozilla Firebird that the
search from location bar feature had been replaced.  Instead of having the
choice between different engines and being directed to the search results page I
am forced to use google and sent to the first result page (I didn't realise
exactly what it was doing at first).  The more worrying 'features' are that,
unlike SeaMonkey, you do not explitly perform the search and I could not find a
way to turn this off.

What I think Firebird should do differently as soon as possible:
  - Give the user the option to disable this feature from the standard
preferences dialogue box (Tools -> Options...)
  - Tell the user, when they enter their first malformed URL, what will happen
and maybe give them a box with buttons labelled: [Submit to Google] [Cancel
Search] [Disable Feature]

What Firebird might do eventually:
  - Allow the user to configure an arbitary "Quick Search" bookmark as the
target for the malformed URL searches.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:





The automatic search from the location bar can be reconfigured using the
preferential extension.  It can be disabled [pref("keyword.enabled", ...)] or
have the search URL changed [pref("keyword.URL", ...)].
