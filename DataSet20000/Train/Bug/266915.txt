navbar button with target in other frame opens the page in the navbar, not target.

This is similar to other frame related bugs like 235824, but they seem to have
too many "worksforme" as the last action on them.  I cannot accept that.  This
is a MAJOR problem that affects my ability to generate a website that is FF
compatible.

This definitely fails in FF, but works in IE 5.5, 6.1 and Netscape 7.1, 7.2 and
AOL. Two of my sites using frames on (RedHat, QuadCPU, MySQL, PHP, Apache).  One
site (http://www.badronaldstattooing.com) where the main page navbar using
.shtml pages sent from a button push in "bar" to open in "main" works fine. When
 pressing "galleries" button, the second set of frames for picture galleries has
16 buttons sending .php files to the "main" frame. All work except for two. 
They are all coded nearly identically.  The one odd thing is that the two that
fail have the word "face" in the GET string, and nothing else is different from
the other button statements.

My current addon to the kickstart-1 webpages is the extraction of a .5 gb Adobe
document into individual webpages of each catalog page.  I made buttons in the
nav-bar frame to open a set of page thumbnail buttons for the appropriate
document section in the target window.  When you click a button in the target
window, it brings up an image of that page of the document where a person can
then enter page #, catalog#, of an item in the shopping cart.
I've barely got a skeleton of the 1100 pages started, a main entry with three
buttons on left frame to open coverpage,eventspage and TOC in main window.  TOC
brings up an "index" page where area maps of some numbered items at top of index
page section are in the main window and a couple dozen section buttons on left.
  Sections buttons match areamapped text at top of TOC page for target code. 
All left frame section buttons from initial page of three buttons and second
level section buttons fail 100%.  



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.1. go to http://www.kickstart-1.com/dragpages/index.php
1.2. see left frame with DragSpecialties logo and three page thumbnails. Right
frame contains catalog cover image.
1.3. push any of the left frame buttons.
or
2.1. go to http://www.kickstart-1.com/dragpages/indexPages.php
2.2. See orange buttons in left frame, TableOfContents mapped image in right frame.
2.3. In right frame, press in area of "1. Windshields, Dresser and Touring  22-59"
You should see a new page of page thumbnails appear in right frame. That is the
correct output.
2.4. Press the orange "Windshields, Dresser & Touring" button in the left frame.
Do not try any other buttons because they are not programmed yet.  I'm just
setting up the skeleton right now.

or
3.1. go to http://www.badronaldstattooing.com/
3.2. see all left panel buttons open pages in right frame correctly.
3.3. press the Galleries button in left frame.
3.4. new set of left frame buttons and new right frame appears with right frame
items matching those buttons in left frame.  All left frame buttons work
correctly excepting the "Faces/Figures" and "Skulls" buttons.

Actual Results:  
section 1.  All of the three page thumbnails open their target pages inside left
frame instead of right frame.

section 2.  Orange Windows button opens target page in left frame instead of
right frame.

section 3.  All left from buttons bring up targets in right frame correctly
except the "Faces/Figures" and "Skulls" buttons, which open their target pages
inside the left frame.

Expected Results:  
section 1.  First button should duplicate initial entry with 3 left buttons and
catalog cover in right, second button should bring up Events page in right,
third button should bring up page of multiple index page buttons in right frame
and orange buttons in left. Don't know where orange buttons went.

section 2.  Left frame orange "Windshields" button should have opened up page
full of three initial left frame thumbnails and several thumbsize indexpages
buttons in right side frame. and reloaded all orange buttons in left frame.
Instead, the right frame contents come up in left nav frame and orange buttons
go away.

section 3.  The "Faces/Figures" and "Skulls" buttons should have brought up
their targets in right frame just like other buttons do. Instead they open in
the left frame.

The "Faces/Figures" and "Skulls" buttons both have the word "face" in the
SearchCategory string sent to the target PHP code for the target frame.
    <TD NOWRAP ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=TOP><A onClick="setImage('FACES');"   
HREF="/imagedb/redirect.php?searchcategory=Faces/Figures"       
TARGET="main"><IMG SRC="/images/facesfigures.jpg"    NAME="FACES"    ALIGN=TOP
WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=30 BORDER=0></A></TD>
    <TD NOWRAP ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=TOP><A onClick="setImage('SKULLS');"  
HREF="/imagedb/redirect.php?searchcategory=Skulls/EvilFaces"    
TARGET="main"><IMG SRC="/images/skulls.jpg"          NAME="SKULLS"   ALIGN=TOP
WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=30 BORDER=0></A></TD>

These are coded identically to other buttons and having slashes is not unique.
The onClick function simply sets/clears red or green button image in left frame.

Windshields, Dresser and Touring buttons are coded identically to others that do
work.

In the kickstart-1 pages, all frame declaration pages use this header:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Frameset//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/frameset.dtd">

All target code sent to target frames uses this header:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/loose.dtd">

I read other bug descriptions where people have suggested things are not
enclosed in double quotes like they should be.  I've tried versions where there
are no things quoted or all things quoted and behavior is same.

I worried that calling the "navbar" as "navbar" and the main window frame as
"main" and the footer frame as "foot" may have been interfering like the word
"face" does in the tattoo site, but I renamed them to navWin, dspWin and tailWin
and the exact same errors result.

IE, Netscape and any other browser I have access to, works.  Maxthon performs
them correctly, then complains it can't find "self", but I do not use "_self" or
 "self" anywhere in my code.
