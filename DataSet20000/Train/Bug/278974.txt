Home Page GROUP is not saved after closing. Always reverts back to random single home page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040617

In Firefox 1.0 under Linux (Slackware) when I try to set a home page with a
group of pages/tabs ("use current group"), I go through the process and when
closing Firefox and reopen it the home page settings have reset back to a random
single page. If I set the home page as a single page (any page) OR a blank page
and close and reopen, the settings are kept correctly. Problem is obviously only
when saving a home page as group. The problem can be duplicated indefinitaly.

I have tried to reinstall Firefox multiple times with and without the Mozilla
Suite installed (1.7.3), I have deleted and created multiple new profiles, both
for Root and for a normal user, I have removed ALL traces of anything related to
Mozilla/Firefox in the Linux box ( in case some old profile was "hidden"
somewhere), and problem still appears every time. The Mozilla Suite is NOT
affected (in my case).

Any other information you need, please don't hesitate to let me know.

Thanks and keep up the excellent work!

notices it before installing any other theme and working just wiht the default one.
