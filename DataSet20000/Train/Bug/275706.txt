Firefox does not identify itself correctly to iListen voice rec application (Firefox.app vs firefox-bin ?)
IListen is the only currently developed and supported voice recognition
application on Macintosh, and is 
very useful to those of us who cannot type for various reasons.

In iListen you can create custom command sets for applications, and iListen
recognizes when and 
application has been started and activates its respective command set. You can
create a command set 
for Thunderbird, but iListen does not then recognize when the application has
been started and so does 
not ever activate its command set. The iListen developers have this to say:

"We detect that a program is running by a notification from the 
operating system of a "Application Switched" event. We get the 
program's PSN from the event, then from that we get the PSN 
information record. That record has the application's name. We use 
that name to match against the available application-specific command 
sets. If we find a match, then that command set is loaded.

The program name must exactly match the command set name. Now Mac OS 
X likes to hide parts of the name - the extension. So that program 
might really be called "Thunderbird.app", but you see "Thunderbird".

If we can't get a program name because the application does not have 
a PSN (process serial number) or a corresponding PSN information 
record, we can't load the command set."


Mozilla and Thunderbird have the same problem, but Camino does not.
