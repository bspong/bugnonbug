Hide the quit dialog box when the user is in private browsing mode
When the user is in private browsing mode, the quit dialog will currenlty still ask if they would like to save their tabs.

mconnor suggests that this might be a good time to ask the user if they would like to restart Firefox and load their previous session, or just quit.

After giving this behavior some thought, I think we should quit without using a dialog box when the user is in private browsing mode.  The rationale is that reading the dialog box and making an informed choice imposes a time cost on every user, regardless of what their goal is.  I think in both possible use cases, a series of direct actions will be faster than the conversation and thought involved with a dialog box.  If the user's goal is to quit, not asking is obviously faster.  Also, if the user's goal is to return to their previous session, closing the browser and reopening Firefox might actually be faster than reading the dialog and making an informed choice.

Another significant consideration is that if the user is attempting to close a private browsing window, there is a chance that they might want to close that window rather quickly, in which case a modal dialog box (slightly obscuring what they were looking at) may cause the user to have a strongly negative reaction to our interface, as they are caught by someone looking accessing information that they obviously wanted to keep private ("hey, why are you shopping for rings?").
