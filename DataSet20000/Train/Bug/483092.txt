Odd delay while Yahoo retrieves mail (slow)

I use the "classic" of yahoo mail, which was revamped slightly about a week ago.

Now, when clicking on checking mail, instead of showing activity using the Fox Circling Icon, in the upper right, Yahoo generates a "LOADING" notation at the top of its window.

In and of itself, that is not bad.  This new method, however, causes Fox to focus 100% of its effort on whatever is going on [javascript...???] for 7+ seconds, so that you can't even get to another tab.  Even if I switch tabs, while yahoo's new system is doing its thing, I am blocked from scrolling, clicking -- everything.   The problem is slightly amplified if my internet connection slows.

I'm not sure if this is a "bug" in the standard sense.  It seems that Fox shouldn't have a situation where one URL locks up like this; and I wonder if Yahoo even realizes it.

Note:  I have a second email account, in 'classic' mode, and that version of the classic was -not- changed.
Note:  This new version of the 'classic' also wound in a Yahoo i.m.; annoying since i don't use Fox for yahoo's i.m., and i am bombarded every now/then with a spam message.  Not a FireFox issue, but i do wonder if the i.m. polling has something to do with what is going on...

Wondering if a contact to Yahoo might be worthy to see what is going on.
