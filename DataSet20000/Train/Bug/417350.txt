Large bookmark folders fail to display on extended desktop "above" regular desktop

This problem also exists in Firefox 2 on Windows XP.  When Firefox is displayed in an extended desktop, bookmark folders with a large number of bookmarks will not display.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure Windows to use two displays in extended desktop mode, with the extended desktop above the base desktop (instead of to the right or left)
2. Open Firefox in the extended desktop or move it there
3. From the Bookmarks menu, attempt to open a bookmark folder/submenu of sufficient size that displaying all the bookmarks would take the menu below the bottom of the display; because of this, the actual number of bookmarks required to trigger the condition depends on where the folder is positioned in the Bookmarks menu.
Actual Results:  
Bookmark subfolder does not display bookmarks.

Expected Results:  
Bookmarks should display.

Problem occurs with the default theme and other themes I have tried in Firefox 2.0.0.12 and 3.0b3.  The problem does not occur if the extended desktop is to the right of the main desktop or if Firefox is on the main desktop.  Current resolution of extended desktop monitor is 1440x900; resolution of main monitor is 1280x800 (both are widescreen).  Computer is a Dell Latitude D830 laptop with Intel 965 Express graphics chipset.
