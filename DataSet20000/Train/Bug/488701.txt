Using back button to get back to My Yahoo puts you at top of the page instead of the scrolled position of when you left.

So, you know when you have a large web page, and you scroll down, click on a link, read stuff then hit "Back", Firefox is nice enough to put you at the same scrolled position you were in.  Well, that doesn't work with the My Yahoo page.  Let's say I click on a News link at the bottom of My Yahoo page.  Then when I click "Back", Firefox puts me right at the top of the My Yahoo page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. my.yahoo.com (and login)
2. Scroll down some.
3. Click on a link (eg a News Item) that takes the page to a new address.
4. Click on Back.
Actual Results:  
The My Yahoo page is scrolled to the top.

Expected Results:  
Browser should have scrolled the window down to the position in the My Yahoo page that it was in when it left.

Only Firefox does this.  IE and Safari do not.  I cannot remember which 3.0.x version started this. Also, this only happens with the My Yahoo page.  For other web pages I have tried, Firefox does the right thing.
