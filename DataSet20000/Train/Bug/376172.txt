Every time I open Firefox it either freezes or crashes.

Since latest automatically downloaded upgrade of Firefox, it will not work. It loads, than either freezes and can only be closed by the use of "Force Quit" or re-booting, or it crashes and a notice appears asking if I want to report the bug to Apple. I don't. It's not Apple's problem. There is a bug in the latest downloaded upgrade, and Firefox is now unusable untill it's fixed. In the meatime I have switched to Mozilla as my browser, which works fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Turn on computer
2.Click on firefox in dock to load browser
3.Firefox loads then freezes; rainbow sphere in place of cursor begins to turn; impossible to quit Firefox. Only solution is to use "force quit", but this doesn't always open because cursor does not reappear, in which case I have to re-boot. If it doesn't freeze, then as soon as I select any program to open, it crashes and I get a notice saying it has unexpectedly quit and asking if I want to report it to Apple.

Actual Results:  
Same as above.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have functioned normally.

This is only since the most recent automatically downloaded upgrade of Firefox, just a few days ago. Since then, it is unusable. I have switched to Mozilla as my browser, which works normally.
