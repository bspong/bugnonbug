User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; rv:33.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/33.0
Build ID: 20141113143407

Steps to reproduce:

Its rather random issue, only since 33.1.1 update :
It happens mainly upon manipulating tabs : opening, closing, getting in focus...
mainly with several tabs opened
But truly, I don't recognise any specific origine.
It seems to be really random.


Actual results:

User actions on UI doesn't display any more.
Everything works (commandes, links, tabs, etc.) but any change on UI doesn't display any more. So the core program doesn't recognise there is a problem. No error checked.
Just no more display.
I can do whatever action in Firefox it "works" but the display is freezed on the last state. I can close everything and then restore the session. Than the display will be OK, until next random issue...


Expected results:

As actually Firefox (30.1.1) doesn't report any error, (just doesn't display the UI change), and it seems to be time/memory related, might it be a "java" issue : plugin, addon ? (I have only a dozen of them, not more, and plugin chech is disabled, because i need a specific java version 7.0.450.18)
I use is a portable version.
I'll check again specifically without any addon and the less possible of plugins and will come back to you with more info.
And I update right now to v34.
