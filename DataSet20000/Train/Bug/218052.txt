Basic Auth details are not sent pre-emptively

RFC2617 says "A client MAY preemptively send the corresponding Authorization
header with requests for resources in that space without receipt of another
challenge from the server."

All versions of IE, Netscape, Opera, and Mozilla *do* choose to preemprively
send Auth headers.  Firebird 0.6.1 does not; instead, it only ever sends auth
headers in response to 401 challenges.

The behaviour causes broken behaviour in the Zope CMF, and probably other web
applications which assume pre-emptive auth headers.  You could correctly argue
that these applications are broken in their assumptions, but (a) why change from
the default behaviour in all other browsers, and (b) always waiting for a
challenge is wasteful and will increase latency.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. visit a site which uses basic auth
2. log the HTTP headers
3. note that in Firebird, any request to that address / realm will always need
two requests, because credentials are not sent pre-emptively.

Actual Results:  
Digest of HTTP Headers:

> GET /Firebird.html
< HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized

> GET /Firebird.html
> Authorization: Basic AWRtaWrtZmJHLHltdxJXZ1I=

< HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Expected Results:  
> GET /Firebird.html
> Authorization: Basic AWRtaWrtZmJHLHltdxJXZ1I=

< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
