Background color and image are blacked out if there are too many images on the page

My web pages have a lot of photos on them, until recently this was never a problem. I believe that after the last update, this problem has developed. Almost all my pages now have a black background instead of the background image.
Try this, the last page I created:
http://www.stam.org.il/shvil/034.html
I removed 8 images and the page is OK (7 images were not enough)
look at these two pages
http://www.stam.org.il/shvil/b.html - here I randomly chose 8 consecutive images somewhere in the middle of the page and deleted them, no other change was made and the bacground image appears, page has no problems
http://www.stam.org.il/shvil/c.html - here I just randomly picked 8 images all over the original page and deleted them - again the page has no problems.

I hope you can fix this
Good hunting!
