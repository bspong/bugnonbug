I don't know how Firefox chooses the proposed repository when the user wants to save a web page. There should be some locality-related algorithm, but I don't know which algorithm. 

IMHO it would be interesting to associate some addresses with a specific repository.



Reproducible: Always




While saving a lot of web pages on my hard drive, I feel reluctant to click a lot to select my target repository where my files are going to be saved. It would be better if Firefox would give me the capability to associate with some url (or regular expression matching some urls) a specific repository so that I won't have to select it myself. A more sophisticated way may be to let Firefox predict the target repository according to the visited web page, but it's a little more complicated mechanism while options represent a simpler way to follow for the job.
