Read topics randomly become marked unread when clicking any of its replies and then doing a forum refresh.

Here's a way to reproduce it:

http://www.pcx-forum.de/pxmboard.php?mode=board&brdid=1

Click on any topic and any of its replies in the middle frame. Then do a refresh of that forum area. The topics of the replies you've read will suddenly be marked as unread. If you only click on any topic without reading any of its replies, these topics will still be marked as read. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse any forum that's using PXMBoard software.
2. Click on any topic and any of its replies in the middle frame.
3. Do a refresh of that forum area. The topics of the replies you've read will suddenly be marked as unread.
Actual Results:  
Read topics will be displayed as unread.

Expected Results:  
The topics should be marked as read.

Nothing else important, I think. Been trying Minefield for two weeks now and this bug hasn't been killed since then. Everything else works cool, but I'd really like to see this being fixed. Cheers, guys! :)
