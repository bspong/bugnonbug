I opened firefox and downloaded a newer version than the one I had, but then I saw an offer for firefox3 and I thought, sure! why not? it'll most likely be faster, better, stronger, well, you get the idea. so I downloaded it and then i tried to open the setup thing (basically replacing my old version with the newest one) and it came up with the general windows xp error window thing that pops up and it said exactly, word for word "File is corrupt" and an "ok" button so i clicked on it and deleted the firefox3 entirely from my system because i'm always scared of getting viruses. so then I thought. "what if this happens to someone else?" so I wanted to report it to you. I hope you can fix it! i love you guys forever, firefox RULES!!!!
