User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:16.0) Gecko/16.0 Firefox/16.0 (Nightly/Aurora)
Build ID: 20120711030538

Steps to reproduce:

1) write URL 192.168.10.2333 (fail pressing a key)
The address isn't valid (obviously i miss a number)
2) write URL 192.168.10.233 (right adress)



Actual results:

The result are 2 wrong things:
error 1) "The address isn't valid "
error 2) the url is rewrited with 192.168.10.2333
(why the number is corrected)
Using Konqueror i can manage the router ( that ip is the router IP), so no there is network problem.
I try add more data at end of URL bar ( Like 192.168.10.233/, http://192.168.10.233/,http://192.168.10.233/index.cgi and allways i was redirected to 192.168.10.2333

Thinking that "wrong ip was cached" i do:
Clear cache (history is not negotiable cleaning)
Close the tab, & open a new tab with no fail number and i get:

error 1) "The address isn't valid "
(here there is no address rewrite)

I try close firefox / #rcnscd restart / activate deactivate proxy / 
 allways the answer is:
error 1) "The address isn't valid "




Expected results:

I must enter to admin page

In the picture you can see konqueror browsing, and firefox refusing.

The fail is not the first time that happen and is reproductible:

Wrote an url that there is out from history www.domain.comm Try to fix and let in into web site.
