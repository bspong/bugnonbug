After opening several tabs/windows and then closing them, Firefox does not "give back" used RAM and slows considerably when holding the memory.

After opening several tab/windoes, firefox keeps a substantial amount of ram (up to 1MB for 15-20 open tabs/windows), and then keeps that as windows are closed. When Firefox takes most of the RAM available, all activities slow substantially -- sometimes 1 minute to switch between windows. It is not possible to close some windows, continue to use others and then open new windows.

PowerBook G4 1.33Ghz 1.25MB RAM (max) 6S 10.4.11

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open several windows/tabs -- 15-20 total.
2. Use all, then close some or all of them.
3. Opening and closing windows over time also appears to induce an accumulation of used memory that is not released.
Actual Results:  
RAM held by Firefox interferes with its own running as you continue, necessitating restarting firefox and/or restarting OS.


The software should release the RAM it is no longer using and make it available for opening new windows and/or running other applications. In its current form, Firefox slows down substantially and it or the machine must be restarted.
