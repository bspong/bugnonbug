I open the bookmark menu in this new? 1.5 build and I get a very wide bookmark menu.  Internet Explorer has it at the appropriate length. And don't tell me to do a browser hack.  You said that last time.  Are there any developers still working on this browser?  It looks like everyone was scattered all over the earth in search of a hole to hide in.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open bookmarks
2. See bookmarks are not as short a width as internet explorer
3. Talk to Asa
4. I control the world's drug supply, why can't we see the developers working on this browser?

Actual Results:  
Bookmark menu way, way, way, too wide

Expected Results:  
1. bookmark menu would look like internet explorer
2. more bickering over this unwanted feature

No crashes.  The browser is holding up better than the Nasdaq. Joke - I'm making sure everything crashes.  Google crashed once.  I actually invented the word google as a company name in 1988 at Westcliff Elementary school in Mrs. Kaisers class in third grade off of the Iowa Standardized Test in Fort Worth, Texas. My teacher said "Do you think google would be a good company name?" and I said "Yes." Do you think I can own stock?
