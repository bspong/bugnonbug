User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:9.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/9.0.1
Build ID: 20111220165912

Steps to reproduce:

latest java 6.0.30 compatibility needed.  

I recently updated to Firefox 9.0.1 and now the Java Console 6.0.30 in add ons is disabled with a message "incompatible".  This Java app is needed to run some features in Ancestry.com and needs to have the compatibility issues resolved. I have been corresponding with Ancestry.com tech support and they stated that it needs the latest version of Java 6.0.30 in order to work correctly.  Coincidentally, everything worked fine in my previous version of Firefox prior to this 9.0.1 update.  


Actual results:

The problem is [while using Firefox 9.1.0] that I must click the "save" button in Ancestry.com and repeat the next pane command to "save as" multiple times before Ancestry.com actually responds in order to initiate the actual "save" function from the examples I posted.  It functions normally in IE, Google Chrome and previous versions of Firefox prior to the update of 9.0.1. 


Expected results:

 When I click the "save" button in Ancestry.com and the next pane command to "save as" pops up, it should execute the command immediately.

Likely other programs online who are dependent upon Java 6.0.30 are affected as well.
