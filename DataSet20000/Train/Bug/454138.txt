Firefox won't launch after upgrading from 2.x to 3.0.1
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070206 Firefox/3.0.1

On 1-Sep, I tried to upgrade the version of Firefox from 2.x to 3.0.1 on my wife's Macbook.  After completing the installation, double clicking on Firefox application does not launch the program.  The computer behaves as though I did not double click the application.  No error message and no Firefox.  

I have been running v3.0.1 on my Macbook and on my iMac without problem.  In fact, I waited until now to upgrade my wife's to make sure there were no bugs.  But now it doesn't work.  

She is running MacOS 10.4.11 as am I on my Macbook. Our iMac is running MacOS 10.5.4.  I did notice that while the creation date of the application on iMac and the faulty Macbook are the same (2-Jul-08), the size the applications are different (46,191,531 on iMac) but (46,774,794 on Macbook which doesn't work).  
The creation date on my Macbook is 10-Jun-08 and has a size of 46,921,818.  Is it possible that the downloadable copy corrupted on 1-Sep-08? 

I tried to delete the Firefox application and re-download and install another copy two more times but got the same results.  Finally, I downloaded the older v2.x and installed that, which worked fine.  She is still running this older version of Firefox.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download Firefox 3.0.1
2.Install
3.Attempt to launch
4.Nothing happens
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.  The computer sits there as though we had not attempted to launch Firefox.  

Expected Results:  
Open Firefox window. 

It appears, based upon the inability to launch Firefox and that the application size is different than on our other computer, that the download was corrupted.
