When firefox is invoked in windows by clicking on an html file, it first checks whether addons need to be updated. In the case that they do, the update process seems to interfere with the process of opening the file and a file not found error box is generated. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Backup your entire profile directory.
2. Wait for an addon to be updated (This may take ... some ... time. Browse normally for a couple of days and keep an eye out for the update dialog.).
3. Exit firefox.
4. Restore the backed up profile directory. You now have an out of date addon. 
5. Click on an html file to open firefox
Actual Results:  
A file not found error pops up. Once this is dismissed the addons update box appears. The local file does not load. Only when all addons are fully updated will clicking on the file load it as normal. This is a minor annoyance to people like me who use firefox a lot to read locally stored html files. It could pose a more serious problem for applications like web kiosks.

Expected Results:  
The addons should update; then the file should load.

It seems that firefox initiates opening of the file through the file system, but then the addons update dialog stalls everything causing the opening of the file to fail gracelessly with a misleading error message.
