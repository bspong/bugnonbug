Using profile option (-P) in file associations, while using "-osint" prevents files from loading correctly

If you change the command line options in the file association for htm or html extensions to include a specific profile with the option -P, and the option -osint is also used, then when you open a file with one of those extensions while Firefox is closed, an error message saying the file can't be found is thrown. That's what happens in my Windows XP every single time (whit firefox 2 or 3).
If I do the same on Windows Vista, the file opens fine, but Firefox thinks it isn't the default browser anymore (which isn't true). I guess, it's checking for the whole command line to see if it matches the default one.
By now, I removed the "-osint" option (security implication here) in Windows XP
and disabled the default browser check on Vista.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.In Windows, change the file association for html or htm files to include a specific profile with option -P (while leaving the -osint option intact).
2.Close any open window of Firefox.
3.From explorer, launch any html file with firefox.
Actual Results:  
In Windows XP: an error message saying the file can't be found is thrown.
In Windows Vista: Firefox thinks it isn't the default browser anymore.

Expected Results:  
Open the file correctly in Windows XP.
Don't show the "Default Browser Check Alert" on Windows Vista.
