When opening new tabs with the new tab button, the button should not move away from under the mouse until the mouse has moved away, signifying the new tab button is no longer wanted.

One possible solution could be that the new tab button stays in place, while the new tabs open to the left. This would be much like the behavior when the tab bar is full.


Obviously these possible solutions could adversely affect users. It may be most other users do not open multiple tabs like this and it's just me, and the behavior now is the most efficient for most users.

Another possible solution could be a permanent re-homing of the button to the far right hand side of the tab bar.
