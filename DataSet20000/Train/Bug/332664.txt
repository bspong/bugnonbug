Firefox does not support .NET Passport redirecting magic - IE is OK

Majority of attempts to log in through .NET Passport fail with following message:
The page isn't redirecting properly
Firefox has detected that the server is redirecting the request for this address in a way that will never complete.
This problem can sometimes be caused by disabling or refusing to accept
    cookies.

Obviously the radirecting mechanism is recognized properly by Internet Explorer.
