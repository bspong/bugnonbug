bookmarks and bookmarks toolbar vanish (and firefox 1.5 upgrade offered) when booting up at remote location
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

When I clicked the Firefox link, all bookmarks and bookmark toolbar links and home page records were gone as if I had just installed Firefox for the first time. In fact, Firefox 1.5 Start became the default access point. 

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Disconnect laptop from home office and transport to alternate access point
2. Boot up from alternate location
3. Connect Firefox for normal operation

Actual Results:  
Perhaps I should be taking another trip to see if it happens again, but I don't ever want to have to replace all my bookmarks ever again. I would have to access the program from an alternate site. After plugging into a hotel's internet access point, I used their authorization key and accessed the net. Then I clicked on the Firefox link. Once gone, bookmarks could not be recovered from anywhere, even lost from saved folder on my system. 

Expected Results:  
Firefox 1.0 (?-my original version) comes up with several years worth of IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL bookmarks from research in various areas of my career, interests and education. Now I have to recreate everything I have done for three years to have the links and information at my fingertips.
