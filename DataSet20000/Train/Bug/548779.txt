JavaScript-generated (GWT, GWT-Ext, Ext) modal window partially rendered incorrectly behind Adobe Reader plugin IFrame
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

In a AJAX application we are developing we are opening a file upload dialogue using the GWT and GWT-Ext frameworks. It's meant to be modal, overlaying the underlying page contents. If the Adobe Reader plugin (in the test Adobe Reader Version 9.3.0.148) is active (in an iframe within the AJAX application) when opening the dialogue window its frame borders are overlayed by the Adobe frame in Firefox 3.6 in Windows XP and Windows Vista.

The same site displayed (i.e. the same code run) in Firefox 3.5.8 displays the modal window correctly overlaying the Adobe Reader content. The same also renders correctly in Internet Explorer 8. Hence we believe this is a (new) rendering bug in Firefox 3.6.

Please see the screenshots attached.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have Adobe Reader Plugin display a PDF document within the browser (in an iframe).
2. Open a "modal" dialogue window using GWT-Ext.
3. Overlap the dialogue window with the iframe contents.
Actual Results:  
The frame borders of the dialogue are overlayed by the iframe/Adobe plugin contents.

Expected Results:  
The frame overlays the contents of the Adobe plugin.

Currently we cannot provide a reasonably short piece of code displaying the problem because of the interdependance of the several frameworks (including our own). If necessary we will try to reduce the code to display the bug using as little third-party framework code as possible (ideally only JavaScript/Ext).
