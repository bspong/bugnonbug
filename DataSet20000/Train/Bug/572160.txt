By placing tabs into titlebar users, especially on netbooks, can save vertical space. This feature is higly demanding among users and they are expecting it.
There are several scenarios how to handle this:
1. Chrome/Opera way: Tabs are partially in title bar when window is unmaximized and fully when maximized.
2. Standard (or new, Firefox... go figure): Tabs are fully in title bar when window is maximized and fully out of title bar when window unmaximized.
Personaly, I'd go for number two; it offers an easy way how to switch between two states.

For basic idea how it would look like, see mockup from Stephen (it's picture number two).

We need figure it out how to handle situations:
1. When another items in title bar appears, e.g. edit tray.
2. Tabs should be touching edge of window? If so, how to handle window dragging?
3. Should have tabs same size, or get smaller?

There may be more questions, feel free to write your concerns and ideas.
