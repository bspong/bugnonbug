If you have a misspelled word, and paste over part of it, still leaving at least the first letter, but still going over the end of the word, the pasted part will never be marked as misspelled, but the un-changed letters will always be marked as misspelled.  A period must also be at the end of the paste for this to occur. The only way to clear it is to remove the period

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Copy any random text to the clipboard with a period at the end
2. Paste it over any misspelled text, not pasting over the beginning of the word and you must paste over the end of the word
Actual Results:  
The letters not affected by the paste will be marked as misspelled, but the letters affected by the paste will be marked as correctly spelled, even if they aren't. This will not be corrected unless the period at the end is removed and put back in.

Expected Results:  
The spell-check should check the entire word, and either flag it as entirely correct or incorrect
