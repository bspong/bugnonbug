I use the mouse cursor trails option for my cursor. The latest build I just updated with Firefox causes the tracking of the cursor to jump and become unresponsive sporadically. It only occurs in Firefox 2.0.0.6. Using a cursor without cursor trails enabled under Control Panel>Mouse, the problem goes away. 
Simply enable cursor trails and you'll see the bad tracking problem, especially if you move your cursor rapidly in your Bookmarks list.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to Control Panel>Mouse>Pointer Options and enable cursor trails, The longer the trails option is set too, the more it is visible.
2.Run Firefox and move the mouse quickly within Firefox and you'll see the problem, especially under Bookmarks 
3.
Actual Results:  
I use the mouse cursor trails option for my cursor. The latest build I just updated with Firefox causes the tracking of the cursor to jump and become unresponsive sporadically.

Expected Results:  
It should track without the hesitation and jumping.
