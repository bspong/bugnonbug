Refactor style sheet switching code in browser.js
As is well-known, browser.js is just a little bit of a mess. Lots of old global functions, lots of... well, lots and lots of just stuff.

As a first step towards fixing the madness, seems like it would be good to start grouping together bits of related functionality into methods on a new gRelatedStuff object. To retain backwards compatibility, we can keep the old function identifiers as pointers into the new object.

Example:

  function bar() { ... }
  function baz() { ... }

becomes

  var gFoo = {
    bar : function() { ... }
    baz : function() { ... }
  };
  var bar = gFoo.bar;
  var baz = gFoo.baz;

Eventually, window.bar and window.baz could go away, and gFoo can be migrated to a Foo.jsm. (I suppose the steps are technically independent).


Risk here is fairly low, the two main issues I can think of are:

* Need to watch for places where |this| is affected (was |window|, now |gFoo|). Given low test coverage of some of the more crufty code, this will need manual verification. But it's pretty mechanical.
* Addons that override / intercept / alter the functions that move would need to update sooner rather than later. Otherwise code calling |gFoo.bar()| directly would not be caught.
* Code blame will be off, but that's going to happen anyway if/when we split things into JSMs.
