The bug causes input text fields on a popup window non-accessible after sending 
focus to this window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Create a new webpage:

2) Make this:
<body onfocus="popup_focus();">

3) This is this function:

function pupup_focus(){
  if(newWindow){
    newWindow.focus();
  }
}

4) Now open popup window:

newWindow = window.open
("news_select.php,"","toolbar=0,location=0,directories=0,status=0,menubar=no,scr
ollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=800,height=765");

As you see - all this forces popup window to stay on top of the opener window 
what is frequentlly requested feature of web applications.
Actual Results:  
The problem is:

Presume you have a form with several text input fields on the popup window. 
Presume you have this popup already opened. Now, if you incidentally click on 
the opener window, the popup window is brought to front again by the popup_focus
() function of the opener window. Unfortunately, since now it is impossible to 
write into input fields on the popup window any more, unless the popup window 
is minimized and then restored what is nasty.

Expected Results:  
Input fields of the form on the popup window should stay accessible. This is 
the result obtained on Internet Explorer.
