When opening a group of bookmarks in tabs (from Bookmarks-> Open in Tabs) it
will fail to open any bookmarks in the list if they are after a missing local file.
No tab or bookmark extensions are installed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make a group of bookmarks, which includes at least one local file (e.g.
file:///C:/test.html) which is inbetween normal external url tabs.
2. close browser and move/rename local file.
3. restart browser, select bookmark group from menu and then Open in Tabs


Actual Results:  
Tabs are opened as expected, in order, up to the missing local file. A tab is
opened with "File Not Found Error" as expected.
However, no subsequent tabs from the group are then opened.

I.E. A group consisting of links to:
google.com
bbc.co.uk
file:///c:\file.html
mozilla.org
slashdot.org

where file.html is removed and the browser restarted.
will open the first three tabs, giving an not found error for file.html, will
not open the forth tab (or any after it)

Expected Results:  
Opened all tabs, displaying errors for missing pages, including subsequent ones
in the group.
