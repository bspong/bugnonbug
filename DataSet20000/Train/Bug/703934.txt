Small Images Don't Match Larger Picture.png

Steps to reproduce:

Go to (http://www.nbc.com/chuck/exclusives/awesome-and-ellie/#item=204487) and look at the photo viewer in the middle of the page.  Notice there are duplicate pictures on the bottom (small versions) which don't match the larger image.  When clicking on these smaller versions, the large version pictures are actually all different.  The site displays correctly in Internet Explorer.

This problem also occurs on the other three sections in the middle of the page ("Awesome & Ellie's Photos"):
1) Awesome's Expectant Father's Guide
2) What's In a Baby Name?


Actual results:

Smaller versions of the photos don't match the actual larger versions or are duplicated on the bottom.


Expected results:

When the smaller images are loaded, they should be all different and match the larger picture being shown.  See the side by side comparison with Firefox on the left and Internet Explorer on the right along with notes on the images themselves.
