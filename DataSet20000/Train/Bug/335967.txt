Preferences dialog has no way to configure plugin directories. Plugins are typically installed to a variety of locations, and the same plugin can be installed to different locations on different operating systems, and even different distributions of the same operating system. This makes it important to be able to configure a list of directories to search for plugins.

This vital functionality is missing. In my specific case, Flash7 was installed to /usr/X11R6/lib/linux-flashplugin7/libflashplayer.so, but Firefox only searches for plugins in /usr/X11R6/lib/firefox/plugins. I have not been able to find any Firefox interface to add additional search paths.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See details.

Actual Results:  
Cannot add or modify plugin directories.

Expected Results:  
User should be able to add or modify plugin directory locations.

As a comparison, look at the Konqueror configuration dialog. Undocumented "gconf-style" keys are unacceptable. Usability isn't about making the interface stupid, it's about making it usable. If there is no way to configure plugins, then plugins are not usable.
