When entering a keyword, the "feature" that prefixes and suffixes the word with modifier keys+enter cannot be permanently disabled by preferences.

As a normal user, I don't want the program changing what I type.  If I wanted to type www.whatever.com I would have done so.  The shift key is right next to the Enter key, and even as a somewhat accomplished typist, I hit it quite often.

Yes, I could use the "URL Suffix" add-on, or change the js chrome (I've done both...every update breaks the chrome tweak, and 3.0 broke URL Suffix long enough for it to be disabled), but this should EASILY be a user selectable setting (and I would argue bitterly one which should be turned off by default).

I'll be good and submit this as an enhancement, even though I consider it a huge flaw.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enable keywords
2.Type keyword(s)
3.Accidentally press shift-enter (or ctrl-enter or alt-enter [on windows])
Actual Results:  
Firefox prepends http://www. and appends .com (or .net or .org) to the word(s)

Expected Results:  
Either allow this to be disabled by about:config, or don't prepend http://www. and append .com (or .net or .org) to the word(s) at all.
