The Windows Live Photo Gallery plugin does not work

I cannot view thumbnails of my photos to select and add them to my Hotmail emails or my Photo Albums.  The MSN photo upload tool that is included with the Window Live Photo Gallery plugin does not work on Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to hotmail and login
2. open/compose a new email
3. click on attach and a drop down should appear to select either File or Photo.
Actual Results:  
Firefox does not give the drop down. You can only select Attach and then you have to Browse for the file you want to attach.

Expected Results:  
You should be able to select Photo from the drop down list and the photo upload tool will show you thumbnails from your My Photos file to select and upload all at once,instead of having to add each one individually.

Can you contact me when this is resolved or if you know how to fix it.  I looked for the plugin to see if I could reinstall it, but was not able to find.  Actually I don't know how to uninstall it either.  I just see the button to disable or enable. I tried disabling it, shutting down Firefox and then re-enabling it to see if it would work, but to no avail.
