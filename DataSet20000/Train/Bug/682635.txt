When I click "Search updates", Firefox does not show me updates, and he updates from his own will, although he is set up not to.
Hello,

Firefox 5.0. Mac OS X 10.6.8.

Way too often, Firefox shows me a window - in front of what I am doing ! - telling me to update. This is very impolite. I close the window, and soon it comes again. I am used to that.

Now, I am ready, I decide to update Firefox to 6. Now, for once, I want this update window. I look in the menus for a way to call it. No way. In th Firefox menu, I choose "About Firefox". Usually, the "about" dialog is a rather nice place, far from danger. There is a button "Search updates". I click it. Firefox starts downloading an update. That is not what I asked. The download finishes. Firefox has not said what version he has found, although the button said "Search updates". He is secretive.
But the worst is yet to come.
Firefox does not say anything about installing the update, so I close the window.
I continue using Firefox as normally.
I quit and relaunch Firefox.
Firefox installs the update from his own will !
I never asked him to update, and I never allowed Firefox to update.
This is fucking wrong.
In my Firefox pref "When updates for Firefox are available", "Ask me what to do" is chosen, "Automatically download and install the update" is not chosen.

Installing stuff in secrecy, against the user's choice, is malware behaviour.

Please make Firefox stop that irritating behaviour,

Thanks,

Nicolas
