On OS X multiple "pane" dialogs should never be shown

On OS X Firefox sometimes shows multiple "pane" dialogs which should attach to the top of the Firefox window.

This often results in 

 - the top dialog not responding because the dialogs are modal and another dialog grabs the focus
 - one of the modal dialogs hiding under the Firefox main window leading to Firefox not responding to keyboard events
 - used dialogs not closing but staying as blank windows instead

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open multiple tabs that open dialogs (ie password prompts or "store cookie" prompts when cookie prompting is on in prefs)
2. set Firefox to "show windows and tabs from last time"
3. restart Firefox

Actual Results:  
Firefox bombs you with "pane" dialogs which sometimes leads to issues described above.

Expected Results:  
Firefox shows one pane, and delays any tabs that would require opening another pane. This would have the added benefit that it would display the prompt for the same password or cookie only once and not as many times as there are tabs/iframes that require that password/cookie.
