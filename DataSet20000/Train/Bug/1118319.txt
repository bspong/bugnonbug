Can't connect Browser Console, Browser Toolbox (local or remote) to Nightly instance
ehsan got himself into a weird state, and I wanted to help him debug it. When he tried to open up his Browser Console, nothing happened (he tried both the key shortcut and the menuitem). He wasn't able to get the console from any of his open windows.

He flipped the prefs required to do remote debugging, and I attempted to connect my machine. He got the prompt that someone was trying to connect, but after pressing OK, my machine's connect page just showed a spinner and didn't do anything.

We telnetted to the IP of ehsan's machine at the port we'd opened for devtools, and this is what we got:

587:{"from":"root","applicationType":"browser","testConnectionPrefix":"conn0.","traits":{"sources":true,"editOuterHTML":true,"pasteHTML":true,"highlightable":true,"customHighlighters":["BoxModelHighlighter","CssTransformHighlighter","SelectorHighlighter","RectHighlighter"],"urlToImageDataResolver":true,"networkMonitor":true,"storageInspector":true,"storageInspectorReadOnly":true,"conditionalBreakpoints":true,"debuggerSourceActors":true,"bulk":true,"selectorEditable":true,"addNewRule":true,"getUniqueSelector":true,"noBlackBoxing":false,"noPrettyPrinting":false,"getUsedFontFaces":true}}

And that's it. Not sure if there's anything actionable in here.
