This happens with plenty of websites for me.  I scroll down using the mouse scroll wheel or the side scroll bar, but when I try to scroll up, the page gets all mashed up, the links move, none of the buttons work, because everything is out of place.  I then have to go to another tab, and click on the existing page to see it displayed correctly.  This only happens on my mac, not on any of my windows machines.  I could send a screen shot of what it looks like.   

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open Firefox, go to www.digg.com
2.scroll down using mouse wheel or side scroll bar
3.scroll up using mouse wheel or side scroll bar

Actual Results:  
the top part of the page stays static and the bottom parts of the page are mashed into it.  The links and button do not work and have moved.

Expected Results:  
the software should have scrolled smoothly up without mashing the page, and the links, buttons, etc should have stayed in place and worked.

I am using the blue shift theme, with no script extension, however the sites this happens at all scripts running are allowed.  I manually OK each script.
