Besides the disturbing glaring colored words that get randomly highlighted when searching, to the point of making the page almost unreadable, when going to additional web/browser pages, random words on the page are also randomly highlighted. Ex.: Go to web page - every time the word "for" appears, it appears highlighted in a vivid, glaringly bright color. Sometimes it might be the letter "a" vividly highlighted. Started with just the search results pages randomly highlighting. Now it's random additional web pages.

Actual Results:  
Still happens. It's happening on this complaint page as I write to you. The word "for" is highlighted in bright blue everywhere on this web page.

Expected Results:  
Displayed search results with normally 'bolded' search terms on each page. Ex: search - Mountain Gorillas - search page results: bolded words 'Mountain' or 'Gorillas' in each suggested URL search result.

Each search result is extraordinarily difficult to read due to the vivid, contrasting color scheme used on each and every URL search result (often bright blue right next to bright yellow - sometimes, every other word is vividly highlighted in each URL description. When you can't read your search results, EVERYTHING takes longer to finish.
