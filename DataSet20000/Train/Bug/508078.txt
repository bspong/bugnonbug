I get this error on 3 different computers. One had XP pro the others win2k. Intermittent problem. One might think the problem is specific to hardware.
Seems to be specific to the firefox browser.

2. 
3.
Actual Results:  
I had to reinstall firewall software running locally on the workstation.
In this case it was zone alarm. Running Firefox without firewall software
resolves problem.


Ask user to shut down firewall software.
Running Firefox without firewall software resolves problem with Firefox in this particular instance.
This happened on my win 2k workstations.

Firewall software must be uninstalled and machine rebooted.
Install firewall software and that will fix the problem.

In a different environment at work I get the same error running win xp pro.
There is no local firewall software running on the workstations.

Desktops running in windows classic mode.
