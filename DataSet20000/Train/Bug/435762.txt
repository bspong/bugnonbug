Memory leaks to a point where Firefox locks up

Folks: Memory leaks have been dismal in version 2 and appear to be as bad in Version 3 RC1. The app starts out at about 28mb and quickly balloons to 100 mb (just load one of the CNN videos). The memory does not get released after closing the tab or window, the browser gets slower and slower and at about 250-300 mb, the browser no longer loads new pages, just sits there loading and needs to be killed. Once restarted, those pages load fine and quickly. Until it's up at 200 mb again...

My system has a dual core AMD 2.8GHz with 4 GB of RAM, so there is not problem here....

I strongly suggest to not release this browser until these memory leaks are fixed. Opera can do it, we should be able to do so, too. After all, we want this to be the best and fastest browser on the market, no?...

Thanks and keep up the good work! Vs 3 is very fast when it works....


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start browser
2. Load any pages, particularly those with multimedia content (it happens with all pages, multimedia just speeds it up)
3. Watch the memory footprint. Keep running until it hits around 250-300 mb
Actual Results:  
Browser sits there no longer able to load new pages or links

Expected Results:  
fast performance throughout, regardless of how many pages were loaded and closed.

Release all memory of previously loaded pages
