Some minor styling issues in the hamburger menu

Steps to reproduce:

(Please ignore the 'steps to reproduce,' 'actual results,' 'expected results' headings, if any, on this bug)

1) The `>` arrow indicating subviews on items like Library, Web Developer etc. isn't vertically centred.
Moving the arrow down by 1px (or even 2px) visually centres it and looks noticeably better. Please see gif for a before-after: http://i.imgur.com/Apnr5FV.gif.
The style currently in use is:
`.PanelUI-subView .subviewbutton-nav:-moz-locale-dir(ltr)::after { transform: scaleX(-1) }`
What vertically centres it is:
`.PanelUI-subView .subviewbutton-nav:-moz-locale-dir(ltr)::after { transform: scaleX(-1) translateY(1px) }`

2) The 'Sign into Sync' and 'Exit' buttons have unequal spacing on their top and bottom, and compared to all the other items in the menu.
Changing the margins on `photonpanelmultiview .panel-subview-body` from `4px 0` (currently in use) to `6px 0` fixes this. As per the Invision spec (https://mozilla.invisionapp.com/share/ZKBC94BPQ#/screens/229252106), the separators have spacings of 6px on top and bottom, so the spacing before the first item and after the last item on the hamburger menu should be 6px as well. It looks better too - here's a before-after: http://i.imgur.com/C38dtlg.gif.

3) The `+` and `full screen` buttons have smaller right and left spacing, respectively, than top and bottom. The two buttons have 6px spacing with the top and bottom separators, so they should have, at least, this same spacing with the vertical separator. See gif: http://i.imgur.com/H0gdn9u.gif. Current margins are 4px and 5px; setting them to 6px and 7px looks better. Note that the spec actually says 10px spacing (https://mozilla.invisionapp.com/share/ZKBC94BPQ#/screens/230516723).

4) I really dislike how tiny the clickable areas are on the cut-copy-paste buttons, especially when compared to how all the other entries (well, except zoom) are much easier-to-hit targets. There is so much empty, non-clickable space on the Edit row. Can't this be improved? I think Chrome uses the space much better - here's a comparison: http://i.imgur.com/8Y3M1Ps.png.
