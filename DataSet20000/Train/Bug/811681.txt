Actual results:

I've been using the Internet since 1993 before and during the first year browsers came out. Back then the scroll bars seemed as wide as your finger.

As time has gone on, screen resolutions have continue to increase, but each time this happens the browsers scroll bar gets more and more narrow on the screen. It seems to maintain its pixel width, but at higher resolutions its physical width continues to narrow.

At this point, I find myself wanting to enjoy higher resolutions, but at the same time, I want things to be bigger at those higher resolutions.

It has finally gotten to the point, that I find the width of scroll bars too narrow, requiring too fine-grained of a mouse-control-effort for simple web page navigation, such as:
1) Clicking the scroll-bar's up button
2) Clicking the scroll-bar's down button
3) Dragging the scroll-bar's slider.

Although a scroll-wheel is a helpful workaround, it remains an issue that the scroll-bar itself continues to require ever increasing fine-grained-effort to use. It is finally gotten to the point that I consider it a cumbersome control.

I suggest doubling its size by default in future updates and releases of Firefox. Or at lease making the scroll-bar easy to scale-adjust its size (without the user having to understand CSS style sheet modification). Perhaps it would be good to make the scroll-bar right-clickable and providing a "Adjust Width" option in its context menu.

Many desktop applications could learn a thing or two from touch screen interfaces. Notice how bluntly (widely) they make their buttons and selectable options. They do it out of necessity because they know a person is going to be using their finger to select that option. However, even with a mouse, the bigger something is, the easier it is to select. Just because a mouse-cursor comes to a fine point, doesn't mean that controls ought to be barely bigger than that point.

I believe we have finally crossed a threshold. While before, we've always been trying to maximize the browser's screen real estate, now we've got plenty of width at higher resolutions, and it is time to increase the width of scrollbars and make them require less fine-grained-mouse-control-effort to use.
