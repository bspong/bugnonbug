Headless process on quit; on relaunch, Location box blank, busy spinners persist after loading
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1

After quitting with multiple tabs and relaunching in the same session, tabs load slowly and busy/loading spinner persists even after pages fully loaded.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Check no firefox.exe process running.
2. Launch Firefox and open lots of tabs.
3. Quit Firefox.  A check of Task Manager shows headless firefox.exe process still running.
4. Relaunch Firefox. See Actual Results below.
5. Quit FF, kill headless process, relaunch.  Tabs load normally and there are no problems.
Actual Results:  
Loading tabs takes forever, and busy/loading spinners persist on all tabs even after all tabs reloaded.  100 percent CPU consumption, and ever-increasing memory grab.  Unresponsive to input, cursor/pointer jerky.

Expected Results:  
Main process and all supprocesses, threads, etc. should have halted and unloaded on quit.

Should have just reloaded all tabs on relaunch within a reasonable time, especially as many would have been cached. No hanging, no CPU and memory grab.

Occurs on Windows XP SP2 and SP3.
Large number of tabs open: 10 to 40 at different times.
