From a browser window, using java script, I am launching another browser without titile bar. The new window contains html pages in the first half, and the second half contains an applet(page is divided into <frame>s. On clicking on some button on applet, popup a awt dialog. This dialog consists of java.awt.TextField to collect a password from user(setEchoChar() called).

Simple text fields are working fine. But the password field is not accepting any characters from keyboard.

The password field works fine, if it is directly placed in the applet panel.

Note:- My application is constrained to use only awt but not swing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load an applet in the browser.
2.Popup a java.awt.Dialog (Modal or Modeless) from the applet (on some event). This dialog should contain a java.awt.TextField with setEchoChar('*') called on it.
3.Try entering password into the text field.

Actual Results:  
The password field does not accpet any characters. It does not show any thing. It is not responding to any key event. You cant even navigate out of it using keyboard.

Expected Results:  
The password echo character should be displayed with each character entered. You must be able to navigate out of the field using keyboard.
