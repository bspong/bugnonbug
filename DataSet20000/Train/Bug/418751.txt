drop down display:"Mozilla <1.3 Beta not supported"  "But will try..." This occurs even tho I've not opened Firefox but am trying to "fwd" email message using Safari; the sent message is present but interspersed with copious alpha numerics.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/523.12.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.0.4 Safari/523.12.2
Build Identifier: Firefox 2.0.0.11.dmg

If I open with Firefox instead of Safari the forwarded messages are not garbeled.  I went thru my Mac with Apple Support and could not find difficulty in Mac.  A related problem?--With Firefox I cannot attach files to emails  Centurytel, my ISP, produces error message "..cannot send message using server: mailcenturytel.net, etc, etc"  Tech support there says there's something wrong with Firefox.  Safari works fine for attachments.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Safari
2. click "forward" on opened email message
3.
Actual Results:  
drop down message:" Mozilla <1.3 not supported.  But will attempt to send."  Click "ok". When "send" clicked, message is sent but the message sent is embedded within lots of alph numerics making text almost impossible to decipher.

Expected Results:  
Clean message should be sent.  This does happen when I open with Firefox.  But Firefox appears to interfere with email operation-fwd- when using Safari. (And converseley, Firefox doesn't allow attachments to emails; for that I have to use Safari.
