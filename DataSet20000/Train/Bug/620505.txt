I use grease monkey on this application which is required to reload the page. It keeps opeing a dialog box asking for permission to do this

The script for Kingdoms of Camelot that I run is supposed to be able to reload the page on its on. I have searched in firefox and in options changed it to not need permission to reload or redirect information but yet it still asks for permission which halts the automation of grease monkey while I am at work. Which was the whole reason I got firefox was really for just that one application and Kingdoms of Camelot. Is there a setting somewhere i missed. That can make the box not pop up asking for permission for firefox to resend or reload a webpage?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.load kingdoms of camelot Run greasemonkey
2.tell it to auto attack
3.it reloads a few times fine than brings up that ? box
Actual Results:  
It does it every time. It cycles thru fine a few times than asks for permission

Expected Results:  
Same results

It should have permission to run the scripts on greasemonkey which need to reload the web page for it to work properly.
