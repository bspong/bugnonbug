when clicking next page on some web sites that show multiple pages, sometimes firefox 3.5 rc 3 shows the loading wheel but never loads anything.  I have to click back button and then forward button again to load content.  On www.rocketdock.com when I click to go to next page sometimes (just as frequently as neverending load) it shows a blank page and I have to click back then forward to get the page to show.  It happens one out of about every six times I try to go to a next page on the deviantart.com and the rocketdock.com websites - haven't tried it on other go to next page type sites.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to deviantart.com or rocketdock.com
2.do a general search or browse a category
3.click next page multiple times and eventually you will get unending loading or blank page
Actual Results:  
firefox never shows a blank page on deviantart.com just the unending loading wheel and nothing comes up.  It never shows the unending loading on rocketdock.com it just pulls up a blank white page sometimes.

Expected Results:  
The pages should load as normal and I know it's not a server issue because I can immediately hit the back button and forward button and pages then load quick and normal.

I didn't notice any specific bug report on exactly what this does when going page to page on websites but if there was one I missed then I apologize for the repeat bug report.
