Usually at wakeup but mostly on initial bootup when clicking on a Firefox icon (no browsers open yet) the timer (hourglass) will indicate that it is opening and then it doesn't. The timer just goes away. Opening Task Manager indicates that the process is not running. Several clicks, same results. Then after 30-45 seconds, clicking several times (in frustration) waiting 10-15 seconds or so, three or four browser windows will open in sequence (according to how many times I clicked the icon).
Once the first window opens, Firefox is quick to open (1-2 seconds)
I suspect that this may not be a Firefox problem but one of my system as the other desktop icons sometimes respond (or fail to) the same way, i.e., clicking on an icon produces the hourglass for 5 to 10 seconds (up to 30 seconds) and then just goes away.
Rebooting sometimes but not always solves the problem.
