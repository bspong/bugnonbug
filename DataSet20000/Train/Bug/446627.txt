The browser correctly opens plain/text files in its window when the file does not contain any particular text-enhancing code (for instance mIRC colour codes and such). However, when the plain/text file contains codes (like bold, underlined, colours), the browser displays the download window and systematically asks the user to choose between opening the file in an external application or to download it in a folder.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create two files : One with colour/bold/underline codes (example : with mIRC or any other software able to integrate such codes), and another just with raw text.
2. Save them (make sure the colour codes are present in the test file)
3. Upload them on a server.
4. Open the text files not containing colour codes : it displays normally in the browser.
5. Open the text file containing colour codes, it opens the download/open window systematically.
Actual Results:  
The result is systematically the same : plain/text files with codes fail to display in the browser window, whereas "normal" files open normally.

Expected Results:  
The software should simply open the text files regardless of colour codes in it, even if it were to display missing spaces, or "wrong" UTF codes.

The browser does not crash.
