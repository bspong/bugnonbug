Can't open any page, Address bar is not working
User-Agent:       Opera/9.64 (Windows NT 6.0; U; en) Presto/2.1.1

I restarted Firefox earlier to install latest Flash Player when Firefox came back on, it did an Mozilla update. Now, when I type any url into Address bar, it does nothing. I tried clicking on links from previous session pages, clicking works but URL bar is not doing anything.

Error console generates this output as soon as I type URL and press Enter:

Error: Cc['@mozilla.org/updates/timer-manager;1'] is undefined
Source File: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox/components/nsSearchService.js
Line: 3009

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type URL into Address bar
2.Press Enter
3.
Actual Results:  
Basically nothing, browser became useless for the moment.


I have bunch of extensions installed on Firefox but I do not see any conflict / error caused by these addons.

I uploaded the screenshot of the addon list:
