won't open link to mail address

when I click on an e-mail address in a web site, nothing happens.  When I go to "tools" and try to click "read mail," also, nothing happens.  I use Entourage, but also Google.  This problem doesn't occur in Opera, though I've hooked up with Opera e-mail service.  Must I use Thunderbird to enable an e-mail address to open up an e-mail service -- is Firefox dedicated to Thunderbird?  I'm sorry if this is a question that's been dealt with already but I did search for the problem.  A lot of the time, I didn't understand the "programming" kind of language.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  click on highlighted e-mail address
2.  nothing happens
3.  sometimes, depending on the web site, I can't highlight the address so that I can copy it, or go to my e-mail server, or enable any process so that I can easily link from the e-mail address on the page to send e-mail.  

Actual Results:  
go to any web site and find e-mail address in the page.  Try to open it, such that it opens in any e-mail service provider that I have.   Nothing happens.  I don't see where I can add the service in preferences, and I've looked many times.  

Expected Results:  
That I could highlight the e-mail address and click onto an e-mail service provider and send e-mail.

It always happens, no matter what page, etc., I'm in.
