search box hijacked by outfit called creative commons, which directs all searches to its pages
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Firefox/1.0.4

During the last week of May, I noticed that the search box in Firefox 1.0.2 did
not display the usual Google icon. Instead it displayed what turned out to be
the creative commons icon and directed all searches to its pages.

I access the net as a limited user under XP so that software cannot be installed.
When I realized that something was wrong, I logged in as administrator, ran
Spybot, fixed the problems, updated Spybot, ran it again, and it came up clean.
I ran it again in the limited user account and it came up clean.

I then uninstalled firefox, downloaded version 1.04, and installed it as
administrator. Started firefox, no problem, the Google search bar appeared every
time. Logged in as limited user and ran firefox. It came up clean the first
time, but on second use, creative commons was back in charge of the search box.

I searched creative commons directly with Google, bypassing the search box. It
comes up as a non-profit corporation involved with any number of benevolent
sounding projects. Nonetheless, these people have somehow hacked firefox to
install their search engine. I didn't invite them and I don't want them, but at
this point, I am stymied in my efforts to get rid of them.

First, you should know about this and second, please help me to lose these
people. Than you.
