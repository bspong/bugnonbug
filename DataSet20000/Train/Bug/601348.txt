Master Password prompt should contain an icon - indicator of the current keyboard layout

When you type in your Master Password you see it as a stars, so it's
hard to get know what is the current keyboard layout is chosen. That
leads to more mistakes caused by writing password in the wrong layout.
Showing password with plain text (not as a stars) is insecure.
The only way - is to look at the windows' language bar/language
indicator, but what if a user, in order to save some screen space,
disabled showing the whole windows taskbar or is browsing the Internet
using Firefox in a full-screen mode (F11)? 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press F11
2. Do something to make firefox show you an "enter master password" prompt.
3. Play a game trying to guess which is current layout, since all the entered symbols are shown as wildcards and there is no layout indicator. So in case you have 3 (or even more) layouts enabled in your system - this game will take a long.
Actual Results:  
You will make many attempts trying to enter the correct password.

Expected Results:  
Current keyboard layout indicator should be drawn, so you'll easily type your master password correctly from the 1st time.

Another "who the hell will fix this?" bug.
This time I bet that at least 6 years will pass until it gets fixed. (Or cheat like "WONTFIX" will be applied.)
