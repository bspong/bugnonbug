If bookmark file not available when Firefox starts, Firefox window bounces up and down slightly

If the bookmark file is not available when Firefox starts (ie is deleted or if
on a disconnected network drive), the Firefox window bounces up or down, or
shimmies up and down.  This occurs whether the bookmarks sidebar is displayed or
not.

I can also confirm bug 251692.  My bookmarks are on a network drive.  One of my
PCs had trouble connecting to that drive.  I'd opened Firefox (it started to
shimmy), followed by Windows explorer.  I then clicked on the missing drive,
which restored the connection.  I then exited Firefox, which wrote a blank
bookmark file over top of my shared bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Delete bookmarks.html and bookmarks.bak
2.Start Firefox
3.

Actual Results:  
Firefox showed a blank bookmarks sidebar.
The firefox window shimmied, ie everything below the title bar bounced up and
down slightly.  It was like the menu bar height increased and decreased at half
second intervals.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should show a blank bookmarks sidebar.
The window should have been steady.
Firefox should not overwrite a bookmark file with a blank file if the blank file
was created because a drive mapping did not exist when firefox started but was
restored before Firefox exited.

My drive mapping problem was due to an improper entry in my Hosts file.  That's
fixed now so drives map properly on login.  I restored my bookmarks file from a
backup so nothing was lost.
