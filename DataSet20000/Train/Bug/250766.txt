The image given in the URL above does not show up (it is blank) if given in an
IMG-tag, like this:

<img
src="http://maps.eniro.com:80/servlets/se_MapImageLocator?profile=Main&center=1313493;6197140&zoomlevel=3&size=383x372&symbols=star;1313494;6197141"
width="383" height="372" border="1" >

However if the blank image is right-clicked it is displayed if "View Image" is
choosen.

(Unfortunately I can not test this with the Mozilla browser, only with Firefox.)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make a html file with the IMG-tag above
2. Just view the page, the image will be blank with a border
3. Right click the page and choose "View Image" to see the image

Actual Results:  
The image will be blank in step 2 and shown in step 3

Expected Results:  
Show the image

The image is from a company showing physical location for entries in a telephone
catalog. I expect that many people in sweden are using this functionality. The
company is probably international and the same behavior could perhaps be found
for the same services in other countries.
