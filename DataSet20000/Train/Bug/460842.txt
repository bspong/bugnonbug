Mouse coordinates over Flash movie not recognized correctly when scrollbar is moved
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Media Center PC 5.0; .NET CLR 3.0.04506; .NET CLR 3.5.21022)

When flash movie is embedded in an HTML page that has scroll bars, Firefox does not take the scroll position into account when communicating the mouse position to Flash. If you move your mouse over a flash movie that responds to a specific location it will work fine so long as you don't scroll the page. If you move the scroll bar and move your mouse over the same location on the Flash movie, there is no response. The example works fine in IE.

If you scroll the page again the problem is usually fixed.

This problem seems most related to Bug #362193, but I couldn't determine if it was the same problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to http://tour.mapsalive.com/flashscroll/FlashScrollTest.htm
2.Move your mouse over the star on the Kentucky map.
3.A popup window should display with a Google map image in it (not a live Google map)
4.Move the scroll bar down a little
5.Move your mouse over the star again and the popup does not display. 
6.If you move the scroll bar up to the top again or if you click on the map, the popup displays again.
Actual Results:  
see above.

Expected Results:  
I would expect that FF and Flash would communicate the correct mouse coordinates so Flash gets the message to display the popup.
