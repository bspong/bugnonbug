corrupt places.sqlite

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1a2pre) Gecko/20080825031951 Minefield/3.1a2pre

With the attached places.sqlite the places Library window is blank. When I try to open the library I get the following error:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE) [nsINavBookmarksService.removeFolder]"  nsresult: "0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/places/utils.js :: anonymous :: line 1123"  data: no]

If I click anywhere in the window I get (3 times):

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE) [nsISupports.QueryInterface]"  nsresult: "0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/places/tree.xml :: get_view :: line 35"  data: no]

It's not clear to me if this is the same bug as some other places.sqlite corruption bugs such as bug 404171 or bug 445565 because there are different circumstances. Perhaps these bugs will all be fixed by bug 431558 but I've filed a new bug in case the specific corruption is interesting.

Other information:
This places.sqlite comes from a profile I occasionally use for testing. It was created with a pre-places version of Firefox and has been probably been used with various alphas, betas and nightlies of Firefox along the way. I haven't manually edited the file as in bug 404171.

I have no idea how the file came to be corrupt, though I've probably crashed Firefox a few times with this profile.
