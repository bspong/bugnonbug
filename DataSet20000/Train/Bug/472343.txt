Managing multiple bookmarks in the Library is very slow

Hello,

I recently upgraded to Firefox 3.x. I found the following bug. It stayed even after disabling the bookmark extension I had.
Drag & Dropping bookmarks into another folder in same left pane is very slow, takes 5-7 seconds and all of firefox freezes over.

This did not happen with Firefox 2.x

Maybe the size of bookmarks matters, my places.sqlite is 13 MB+ and has 24,363 bookmarks. There are 1839 folders in the bookmarks, many of them about 6-9 level deep and about 10 folders at each level. The result of using netscape\mozilla\firefox for more than 8 years and collecting a lot and organizing.

I did not find any bug mention this as a new bug in 3.x, hence I filed this one

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Organize bookmarks. Select a bookmark folder, about 2 levels deep with about 20 URL bookmarks and a few folders.
2. Select 5-10 bookmarks using mouse in the left pane
3. Drag them into another folder in the same left pane.

Actual Results:  
Everything will stop and it will take a while, about 5-7 seconds to start using firefox again.

Expected Results:  
About 1 second response time would be great.
