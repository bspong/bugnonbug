Once there are many tabs open an arrow appears to the left and also to the right of the tabs to allow you to scroll through the open tabs.  If you scroll through the tabs by rapidly clicking the arrow the browser then opens a new tab.  I believe this is occurring because of the functionality that seems to exist if you double-click on a tab it will open a new one for you.  I do not believe this double-clicking behavior should be used for the arrows that allow you to scroll through your tabs since it hinders the functionality of scrolling through your open tabs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open many tabs (20 or so)
2. scroll to through the tabs using the arrows.  Don't scroll by clicking and holding, but rather by clicking the arrow repeatidly.
3. Don't put a big pause between you clicks, pretend you are trying to scroll through your tabs quickly
Actual Results:  
The arrows that provide the scrolling through the tabs interpret my repeated clicks as double-clicks and open a new tab.

Expected Results:  
When the arrows are double-clicked it should scroll through two tabs in the direction of the arrow you clicked.  In other words double clicking on an arrow should scroll twice, not open a new tab.

This is just pure speculation on my part but it appears to me that the the arrow tabs look very much like normal tabs, but very narrow.  It may be that these tabs are inheriting all the functionality of a normal tab, but it should not be inheriting the "open a new tab on a double-click" functionality.
