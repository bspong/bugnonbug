Provide a checkbox in the customization palette to toggle Keyhole appearance
The purpose of this bug is to decide if we should have a checkbox in the toolbar customization palette near "use small icons" that says "combine back and forward."   While the keyhole design has the advantages
of making firefox look new, building product identity, and making the back
button easier to hit, and while it seems to be getting in general a positive
reaction so far, some people still really hate it.  The solution of "let's make
a pref" is often inferior to choosing the correct default, but in this case I
think the change is polarizing enough that we should use a pref to help
mitigate risk.

A related issue, is deciding if we want to produce the keyhole design in the tango style.  We believe that integrating with the OS theme is more important on Linux that cross platform identity, so we would definitely leave this checkbox off by default.  However, the option to use keyhole would be available for anyone who likes the design on other platforms.

Dao points out that we would need to still have a single element, and the only way to pull this off would be to do just a visual change of the back/forward buttons.  This means that you couldn't have other buttons between back and forward anymore, but that doesn't strike me as too much of a problem.  The fact that the two buttons are the same element would otherwise be transparent to the user.

This change would also introduce a compatibility issue with every existing theme.  Themes would need some way of indicating that they support the pref.
