Dragging a tab (slightly) outside of the tab bar should still just reorder the tabs

I have noticed that dragging tabs in Firefox does not work like in other gnome apps.

Basically, you can drag tabs along the tab bar to change their order, like in so many gnome apps. But you can also drag them up and down: if you accidentally drag them up and drop them on the bookmark bar, you add a bookmark for it. and if you accidentally drag it down to the browser area, you load that page again.

As you can see in the attached screenshot, the "good" area is quite small compared to the "bad" areas, so it's actually very easy to miss and drop the tab on a wrong place, and perform an action you didn't want. I propose that tabs in Firefox should behave just like gnome apps, and be able to move only left or right.

If you don't agree because you like being able to easily adding a bookmark or loading a page, think that the same exact effect can be achieved by dragging the favicon instead of the tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Drag a tab left or right
2.Accidentally miss and unadvertedly move it up or down
Actual Results:  
The browser opens the URL / a new bookmark is created

Expected Results:  
The tab changes places with other tabs, either left or right.
