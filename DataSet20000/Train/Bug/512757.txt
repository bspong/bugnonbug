Firefox 3.5.2 renders window contents too wide after javascript:resizeTo(500,781)

I created some resize convenience buttons on the bookmarks toobar, for various window widths. The URL/Description is typically 

javascript:resizeTo:(width,height)

After updating from Firefox v2.0.0.14 to Firefox 3.5.2, the resize buttons create the right size windows, but Firefox thinks the window is wider than it really is, and centered objects, form fields, and scrollbars get sized too wide, or moved right, and cropped by the right window edge.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create new bookmark on bookmark toolbar
2.Name it "500" and Description "javascript:resizeTo(500,781)"
3.Navigate to a page with a centered table on it, or even this bug report page
4.Ensure the window is reasonably wide, say 800 pix or so
5.Click the "500" bookmark to resize the window
Actual Results:  
The window resizes to the size specified in the command. Centered window contents, form fields, and scroll bars are rendered to some larger window width, and typically are cropped by the right edge of the window, instead of being centered and fully visible as they should be.

Expected Results:  
The window resizes to the size specified in the command. Window contents should resize and recenter to the new window width.

Using default theme. If I first resize using the LR "resize" window corner, it works OK. Once the javascript resizeTo command runs, even dragging the resize corner doesn't produce the desired results any more.
