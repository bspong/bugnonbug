Back up prefs.js to avoid situations where Firefox "forgets" my options

I realize that a number of firefox updates are for security.  Nonetheless, after 45 years as a programmer and having been clobbered numerous times by updates to products that broke them, I prefer to decide for myself if I wish to update.

So, of course, I have firefox set up that way.  Nevertheless, from time to time firefox surprises me and I curse mightily because it declares that it has downloaded an update.

It seems to be very easy for the automatically check for updates flag to get set without the user realizing it.  I think this probably happens if firefox loses its context data, or whatever you call it, if a system crashes or loses power as happens to mine out here in the boonies.  Sure, I am slowly training my brain to remember that I have to go back in and set this, but it is very easy for it to slip by if you don't have a distinct home page or just happen not remember that firefox is going to pull the rug out from under you.

Firefox saves bookmarks in a backup area.  It ought to save the settings of various options also, and if when it starts up it can't find the flags and bookmarks wherever it looks, it should restore the most recent ones.
