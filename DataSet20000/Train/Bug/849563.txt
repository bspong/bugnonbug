With OS WinXP Prof. SP3 (older system, hardware) no problem.

This problem only occurs with Win7 Prof. 64-bit and Win7 Ultimate 64-bit.

I load the following page http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/portals/data, it will all be displayed in gray.
I move the cursor over individual fields or across the screen, suddenly the fields are visible.
But once I click on the right scroll bar (down) then the page is displayed correctly.

1) FF in Safe Mode work correctly
2) Hardware Acceleration disabled, FF runs in Normal Mode. FF work correct

Steps to reproduce:
1. the page, above, open in a new tab
     Result: the page is displayed incorrectly, it will all be displayed in gray
2. disable Hardware Acceleration
     Result: everything will immediately be displayed correctly
3. then immediately enable hardware acceleration again
     Result: everything is properly displayed, subtitles are displayed correctly even
4. open the page again in a new tab
     Result: everything is properly displayed
5. delete the 2 tabs and open the page again in a new tab
     Result: everything is properly displayed
6. Open a new FF window and repeat step 5
     Result: see result step 5
