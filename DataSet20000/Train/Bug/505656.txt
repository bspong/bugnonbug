The bookmarks backup JSON file created daily in the profile directory is not valid JSON.  It contains a trailing comma, which makes JSON parsers barf, including http://code.google.com/p/json-framework/ (Mac OS X/Cocoa) and http://www.jsonlint.com/ (Web).  A similar bug was reported for the built-in JSON serialization facility: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=426718 .  That bug is no longer reproducible (i.e. fixed?) on the latest nightly.  However the bookmarks backup code still uses manual JSON generation.  

The problem function appears to be serializeNodeAsJSONToOutputStream at mozilla/toolkit/components/places/src/utils.js:1490 .  I believe that the offending comma is written by line 1626 of that file.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new profile
2. Remove all bookmarks via the bookmark manager
3. Choose "Backup" from the bookmark manager toolbar
Actual Results:  
An invalid JSON file is produced.  I will attempt (as I've never used bugzilla before) to attache this file to this report

Expected Results:  
A valid JSON file is produced.
