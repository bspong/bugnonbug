Random substitution of the @ and " characters for each other
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.2) Gecko/20100316 Firefox/3.6.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

At random moments and usuall after I have been browsing for about an hour, but sometimes much less, Firefox begins to show the " when the @ is typed, and vice versa. I have looked for what might cause this, but it seems to be random. There is no particular URL, etc., that triggers the behaviour, AFAICT. I've googled and tried searching your bug lists to see if anyone else has the problem, and nothing has yet appeared. I usually clear the problem (make " key show " and @ key show @) by exiting Firefox (closing all Firefox windows), leave 10 seconds, then re-start Firefox, but just now, that did not work. I did it a second time, and it did work then.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. It happens again at random intervals.
2. I have tried repeating accesses to the last few sites, etc., to no effect, yet.
3. Restarting Firefox almost always clears the fault, but on two occasions it did not.

Actual Results:  
Typing " (the double quote) shows @ (the at symbol) within Firefox, in any place where one can type, including the Google search window and URL bar, or in any Web form. And vice versa - typing  @ (the at symbol) shows " (the double quote).

Expected Results:  
Typing the keys gives the expected symbol.

I am using the default theme. AFAIK my computer's configuration is standard (Win XP with current updates). I have set "Minor" as bug  severity, it is irritating, though might be more than just irritating for a disabled user.
