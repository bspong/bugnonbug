This site uses Java for enhanced web experience. I am using J2SE runtime version 2 build 1.5.0_06-b05. Whenever I try to open this particular page Firefox hangs and I can't use windows. Sometimes navigation can be done by keyboard (Ctrl+Tab) but mouse is totally disabled. I have no option but to restart and when I close firefox and try to restart it says "Firefox is already running" . I have to go to task manager and then kill the previous instance then only I can restart. I have tried older builds of Java also but this problem persists. This URL is temporary and may not work for more than 5 days, but to reproduce to go www.cricinfo.com and open any link that says "live scoreboard" and problem is producible.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.cricinfo.com
2. Find link that says "Live Scoreboard". It may not be there all the days depending upon the schedule of the games.
3. Click the link and firefox hangs if Java is installed

Actual Results:  
Firefox hangs itself.

Expected Results:  
Instead of hanging it should've run normally as it does if Java was not present
