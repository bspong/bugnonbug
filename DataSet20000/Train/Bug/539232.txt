Bookmarks Toolbar empty for Linux Ubuntu 9.10 & Firefox 3.6rc1 (with Firefox 3.5.7 profile present)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7

While using Linux Live CD of Ubuntu 9.10 with Firefox 3.5.7 profile saved in /home/ubuntu/.mozilla; installed Firefox 3.6rc1 in /usr/lib/firefox-3.6rc1 and set /usr/bin/firefox executable via symbolic link to /usr/lib/firefox-3.6rc1/firefox.  Then launched Firefox 3.6rc1.  Bookmarks Toolbar was empty, i.e. No Send Feedback, Most Visited, or Smart Bookmarks and no RSS feeds (100+) displayed.  Selecting View>Sidebar>Bookmarks or View>Sidebar>History turned up blank as well. Apparently, the Firefox 3.5.7 profile was not picked up by Firefox 3.6rc1 or is incompatible in some way.  If not fixed at release of Firefox 3.6, then Release Notes should indicate something like export of previous version of Firefox used Bookmarks file, and import of the Bookmarks file into Firefox 3.6 (hopefully, the exported/imported bookmarks file is compatible between Firefox 3.5.7 and Firefox 3.6).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Save profile from previous Linux Firefox version (e.g. Firefox 3.5.7 in /home/ubuntu/.mozilla in a bzip2 compressed tarball file) onto a disk.
2. Boot up Linux Live CD of Ubuntu 9.10
3. Install saved Firefox 3.5.7 profile in /home/ubuntu/.mozilla
4. Install Firefox 3.6rc1 as described in Details above and launch Firefox 3.6rc1
Actual Results:  
Blank Bookmarks and RSS feeds toolbar results.

Expected Results:  
I tried 2 previous Firefox 3.6 beta releases, and the same thing happened.

The Linux profile (if it has not changed from Firefox 3.5.7 to 3.6rc1) should have been picked up, i.e. the profile exists, but does not work with the release candidate.
