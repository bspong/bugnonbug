Pictures, images and other graphics are displayed not correctly or even are missing completely

Hello.
The problem Im reporting about also was a bug in Firefox 1.5.x
But in the Version 2.0 of Firefox it's a frequent occurrence.
I have the problem on some sites in the web.
Some examples are www.eBay.de (no product-pictures), www.AllTheWeb.com (since Firefox 2.0 no preview prictures by picture search, only links), landgaya.plusboard.de (missing headline banner) .......
Insted of showing pictures there are only little Symbols which should reprensent the pictures. Sometimes I can solve the problem by pressing F5 as long as the graphic is loaded correctly. But in most cases I have no chance to display the pictures right. Sometimes it is also the case that the website isn't displayed at all. When I press F5 or reload the page, FireFox will show it finally.
I hope you can solve the problem quickly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
You don't need to configure anything.
Just type in one of the URLs I reported and load the page.
Actual Results:  
In most cases the pictures are displayed as symbols, but not as the pictures themselfe. Try to use F5 to reload the page and sometimes it will work fine, but sometimes you still have the problem.

Expected Results:  
FireFox should display pictures instead of showing links or little symbols represnting that the file (picture) supposed to be missing. But if I try the Internet Explorer all the sites are working fine.
