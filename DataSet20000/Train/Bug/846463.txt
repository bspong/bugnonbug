Android Nightlies fail to build due to missing /services/sync/locales/Makefile
The moz.build transition broke Android Nightlies:

14:38:37    ERROR -  make: *** ../../services/sync/locales: No such file or directory.  Stop.
14:38:37    ERROR -  make[1]: *** [chrome-cs] Error 2
14:38:37    ERROR - Return code: 2
14:38:37    ERROR - Failed to add locale cs!
14:38:39    ERROR -  make: *** ../../services/sync/locales: No such file or directory.  Stop.
14:38:39    ERROR -  make[1]: *** [chrome-da] Error 2
14:38:39    ERROR - Return code: 2

The reason is https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/locales/Makefile.in#165 references /services/sync/locales/Makefile. Since MOZ_SERVICES_SYNC isn't enabled on Android, /services/sync doesn't get included in the build configuration and thus /services/sync/locales/Makefile does not get built.

We need to first assess which mobile products need /services/sync/locales and then change the build system to include it for those products. Perhaps this means moving the offending line in the Makefile.in into a per-app directory instead of the shared /mobile/locales/Makefile.in. But, I'm not really sure how all this stuff works in mobile land, so I dunno.

We have about 12 hours to fix this bug before tomorrow doesn't get a new Nightly and people start yelling.

Over to rnewman to figure out what mobile products use Sync's locale files. Please reassign as appropriate.
