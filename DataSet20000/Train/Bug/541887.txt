The screen goes blank when a video on the associated  IBM Slam Tracker is updated

The problem may be the same as problem 524347 above. The bug is reproducible. Go to the URL http://www.atpworldtour.com/ and click on "Live Scores" to open the IBM Slam Tracker window. As soon as the video in the bottom of the Slam Tracker window runs the http://www.atpworldtour.com/ screen goes blank. As a result I cannot follow the Australian Open with FireFox and must use Internet Explorer. I have also noticed this problem with other web sites. This problem must be fixed soon or you will lose many users.I have noticed it for the last few versions of FireFox. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.atpworldtour.com/
2. "Live Scores" to open the IBM Slam Tracker window
3. Observe the video display on the IBM Slam Tracker window. As soon as a new video is loaded http://www.atpworldtour.com/ goes blank.
Actual Results:  
http://www.atpworldtour.com/ went blank.

Expected Results:  
Nothing to change the http://www.atpworldtour.com/ display. It should not be affected by the updating of a video in another window.
