FireFox generates "connection partially encrypted" warning for pages that contain secure content from multiple domains
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3

All pages on my website use Google AJAX API.

When the page is viewed on http connection, the API is loaded from http://www.google.com/jsapi?key=

When the page is viewed on https connection, the API is loaded from https://www.google.com/jsapi?key=

User sessions normally start from http pages and at some point they are sent to https page for login and/or credit card entry. First time such a page is opened, the page behaves as some of the content is insecure. The indications include:

* The favicon not turning blue
* An exclamation icon over the padlock icon
* Right click > View Page Info shows "Connection Partially Encrypted" message
* Refreshing the same page fixes the problem.

Google AJAX API is used on various websites and it is probable that two websites might be using same set of files. In such case, above behavior can be observed when user clicks a link on http://domain.com/regular.html to https://another-domain.com/secure.html; the secure.html page will appear as partially encrypted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Need a webserver that is https capable. See attached html files. Where to place the files and how to reproduce the error is documented in the files.



(a) I believe it has something to do with "caching"... Google AJAX APIs send aggressive caching instructions to the browser and may be the browser tries to use http cached version of the file on https pages.

(b) The problem looks very specific but eventually it wont be that way as gurus are recommending to switch to Google CDN servers for dispatching JavaScript libraries.
