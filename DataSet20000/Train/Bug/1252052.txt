Browser Toolbox Debugger stops working while initializing
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0
Build ID: 20160225234551

Steps to reproduce:

1. Build nightly from mozilla-central

2. Ensure that the Browser Toolbox is enabled (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Browser_Toolbox)

3. Open the Browser Toolbox (Ctrl+Shift+Alt+i on Windows)

4. Click 'ok' on the Allow incoming connection prompt.

5. Once the toolbox loads, click the "performance" tab and "Start Recording Performance".

6. Immediately open the scratchpad and type and run the following:
window.allocations = [];
function loop() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
    window.allocations.push({});
  setTimeout(loop, 1);
}
setTimeout(loop, 1);

7. Wait for about 20-30s and then "Stop recording". You should see a list of rows indicating timeouts and GC events. Click on any of them to display a sidebar pertaining to that row. Because the toolbox does a lazy loading of js files, steps 5-7 will ensure that the marker-utils.js file would have been loaded.

8. Now go to the debugger tab and search for the marker-utils.js file from the search bar. Type something like "marker-utils.js:12" to go for example to the 12th line.

9. Or, you can also look for the file marker-utils.js in the left sidebar of the debugger tab.

NOTE: This problem doesn't happen all the time.


Actual results:

The search bar is non-functional. It doesn't show the marker-utils.js file.
In fact, the search bar is non-functional even before going beyond step 4. Try searching for anything like "Show all" which should list a couple of search results, but this doesn't happen.

Also, the sidebar doesn't contain this file.


Expected results:

The search bar should navigate to the 12th line of the marker-utils.js file.
Also, the sidebar should contain this file.
