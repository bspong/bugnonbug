When you perform 'System Restore' on win XP, session restore does not work properly, or restore only few windows
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2

This problem occurs when you perform 'System Restore', depending on how far into the past you go with system restore(critical criteria).

Session restore in Firefox does not work properly.  Session restore is a key reason for users like me to use Firefox.

In my case the restore session window listed the history of all windows, but it opened only 1 window of 11 windows open.
On first attempt it only showed 1 window and opened only 1 window.  Then I performed a force kill and luckily it showed the 11 windows.  When I showed the 11 windows, I asked it to restore all 11, but it restores only the first window in the list NOT the 11 windows.

--------------------------------------

Another related bug, is when you add add-ons to firefox and try to restart firefox by forece kill, here again session restore gets into problems.  Plus the new software installation (add-ons complete) window never stops to appear in active windows open, even if you shut it repeatedly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Perform a system restore in XP when you have several windows open
2.
3.
