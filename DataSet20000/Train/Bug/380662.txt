Hello,

within the bookmark manager, if I opened a folder and want to insert a bookmark (either with "New" or by "Paste" from a copied one), the bookmark isn't inserted in the open folder, but to the root of bookmarks.

This seems to be a similar effect to 321092 (Creating menus) or 272626 (pasting bookmarks).

Obviously, the currently shown folder is not a kind of context. (By the way: A context menu would be very comfortable. ;-) )

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open the bookmark manager
2.click onto a folder in the left pane (so its bookmarks are shown)
3.create a new bookmark (or paste it with Ctrl-V)

Actual Results:  
The inserted bookmarks are listed at the root of bookmarks.

Expected Results:  
The inserted bookmarks, folders, etc. should come into the currently marked (or open) folder.

The inconvenience here is, that to get them into the correct folder, you have to drag and drop them in a second step after creating them. Especially if you enter many bookmarks, thats extra work.

Take a look at Thunderbird or Mozilla Mail. I think, if you create a new subfolder or move mails, you are asked, into which folder this action shall happen. As well, a context menu is available for creating and pasting, I think.
