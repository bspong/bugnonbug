Opening the netmonitor slows down requests on the page

Steps to reproduce:

1) install this js app from web
git clone git@github.com:cegeka/library_app.git
cd library_app
git checkout 03cb865
cd spa
npm install -g grunt
bower install
npm install
grunt server

2) open app in Firefox and Chrome (fresh profile, addons disabled and safe mode) and point both browsers to http://localhost:8000/

3) go to network tab for both, clear the results and edit the file "library_app/spa/app/index.html" Each edit reloads all the files in both browsers. In FF it is much slower than in Chromium 2.27 seconds vs 268 miliseconds

Actual results:

Firefox loads the files much slower than Chrome. This is a normal web developer workflow. Each time I hit save in my source code this happens and sometimes it even goes to 5 seconds. I seen this happen even with fewer 404 requests (this example and this commit was specially crafted for this bug but this is common on a normal project).

Also Firefox loads the same file several times. There are more requests on FF than on Chromium.


Expected results:

Firefox should load files in a few houndred miliseconds
