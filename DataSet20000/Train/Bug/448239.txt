PHP $_SESSION[' '] variable not passing between pages properly

On my website, I allow visitors to contact me through filling out a contact form (which includes a verification field). I generate a random set of numbers / letters which is collected and assigned to a PHP super global variable ($_SESSION['variablename']). When the user finishes filling out the form (and punches in the verification as shown), the contact page is refreshed and checked against the information submitted. In current up-to-date browsers (Opera 9.51 [win], IE 7, Safari 3.1.2 [win]) they all correctly store the session variable, which means assuming the rest of the form is filled out correctly and the user has entered the correct verification sequence, the PHP mail function is called and the mail is sent to my website. Currently, Firefox 3 does not contain the proper php session variable (as the other browsers do).

To further test this, I have displayed the current PHP $_SESSION super global variable in the resume page (http://www.olsenportfolio.com/v2/resume/resume.php). This variable can be found near the top of the page (just underneath today's date (listed beside the 'home' link which is part of a mini navigation list)).

With all the other major browsers I listed, when you visit the contact page, you can take note of the current verification code, then go to the resume tab (right next to contact) and see the same code displayed as described above. But with Firefox, the code displayed does not match the code [previously generated] in the contact page.. thus sending me an email through my site is currently impossible via Firefox 3. Prior to Firefox 3, Firefox 2.x handled this all correctly.

Cheers,

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. visit http://www.olsenportfolio.com/v2/contact/contact.php and enter bogus yet valid email address and enter some test message.
2. finally, enter the verification code as seen and submit (try this with multiple browsers to confirm this is a firefox 3 specific problem). Firefox 3 will not send an email, due to an error in the user's verification input (even though input is in fact correct).
3. You can further test this by visiting the contact page, make note of the verification code, then visit the resume page and compare against the same outputted $SESSION super global variable near top of page (on firefox 3, this will NOT match,  but will on all other browsers). Take note that every time you revisit the contact page, a new code is generated.
Actual Results:  
the verification code is not correctly matching what PHP has generated and stored in a $_SESSION superglobal variable.

Expected Results:  
no email is sent, due to mismatched user input vs assigned codekey generated.

If Firefox 3 stores $_SESSION['variablename'] properly (as it does in Firefox 2.x), the email would be sent to my website.


Current Firefox 3 theme: Qute 3.3.6
