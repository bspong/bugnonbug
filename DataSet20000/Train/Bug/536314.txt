Firefox ignores administrator settings, restores defaults for each user
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091201 Firefox/3.5.6

An administrator installs Firefox to C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox (a path only an administrator can write to), opens it, goes to Tools > Options > Advanced > Updates and unchecks all values under "Automatically check for updates to".

A limited rights user then opens that same Firefox install, goes to that same configuration screen, and the "check for updates to Firefox" setting is checked (ie enabled) but grayed out.

about:config shows that app.update.auto == true and app.update.enabled == true.

This obviously isn't right. I didn't check what would happen should an update be triggered (I'd need to hunt down an older FF and check for updates), but it's probably one of the following:

1) Worst case scenario: the luser downloads the update to the temp folder, but cannot perform the update as he does not have the permission to modify the existing Firefox install. Result: a lot of wasted bandwidth quota (or even tons depending on the backoff delay).

2) Best case scenario: FF checks write permissions to the install folder before downloading the update, spits out an error message or not.

(Note: whether it's wise to disable autoupdate is irrelevant to this issue)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure FF not to check for updates using a Windows admin account
2. Log on a limited rights user account (aka standard account)
3. Check updates settings
Actual Results:  
Firefox will check for updates on the limited rights user account

Expected Results:  
Firefox should not check for updates. A limited rights user would not be able to install the update anyway.
