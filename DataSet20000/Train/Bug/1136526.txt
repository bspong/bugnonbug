Replace silhouetted versions of Firefox logo with unbranded logo
Bug 1073240 added some images for use in the about:customizing theme selector and for the default theme icon in the Add-ons Manager:

These are silhouetted versions of the Firefox logo, which means they're covered under trademark. As such, they need to not be part of the build unless --official-branding is enabled. If that isn't enabled, we need to use images that do not contain a version of the Firefox logo.

So those images need moved into /browser/branding/official

I suggest that we add images to the other branding options in browser/branding, using a similar silhouetted version of the relevant logo.

While we're at it, we should do an inventory to ensure there are no other such images in the tree that are similarly affected.
