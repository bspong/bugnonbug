loading anidb.ent as mistype, stopping with X button fixing typo and loading http://anidb.net . I see page for about 2 seconds when tab is hijacked with anidb.ent reporting "Page not found" - i already pressed "X" stop button. This bug is recreatable on my setup.

Other details - OS Datacenter 2008 X86 SP2
Other bugs noticed

Further complains - "Submit file" html form calls for "file browse" window when i'm pressing on address, i can't correct address that way, i must hand select correct file, can't empty form. If i have lot's of files in directory, it's faster to handtype right name than go to correct file in filebrowse window.

Sometimes forms tend to dissapear literally after clicking on them. Probability is very small, can't reproduce.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.type not working address / select upload file into random imageboard or imageshack
2.while loading wrong address press STOP "X" button, correct address, load right address / Try to fix address of file by changing certain address characters by hand (did work in 2.5 firefox)
3.Right page loads, wrong page report hijacks later / you are presented with filebrowse menu, must select file - can't blank form.
Actual Results:  
Bugs are reproducible on my setup, can't find other setup to test. Missing forms are not reproducible very often

Expected Results:  
After canceling request manually for wrong page and loading right page it should stay that way, faulty request must not be processed further / I must have ability to handtype or "copypasta" address of file into "filebar", worked on previous firefox, works on IE.

Using default theme, default stuff, first install firefox (no uninstall reinstall).
