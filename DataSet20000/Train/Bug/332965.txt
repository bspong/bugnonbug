Ability to define default Subscriptions folder (other than Bookmarks Toolbar)

It seems that new Subscriptions are placed along the Bookmarks Toolbar and cannot be moved. Also, I couldn't find a way to place Subscriptions into another folder.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a site with a live feed (e.g., http://planet.mozilla.org/) and click on the  "Add Live Bookmark" icon in the URL bar. (the Feed Folder is added to the Bookmarks Toolbar)

2. In Places, try to define another default location for added feeds

3. Try dragging the new Feed folder to another location, either from withing Firefox's main window or within Places.
Actual Results:  
1. Feed is added to the Bookmarks Toolbar.

2. Can't define another default location from Places or Bookmarks menu.

3. Can't drag created Feed folders to anywhere else, neither via Places nor via the Bookmarks Toolbar.

Expected Results:  
1. Feed added to definable default Feed Folder (e.g., Bookmarks / Web Content / My Feeds)

2. (Easily findable) UI to define default Subscriptions folder.

3. Ability to D&D Subscriptions to other locations (optional, as this might break the seeming all-Scubscriptions-are-in-one-location paradigm).

Please fix soon, as my Bookmarks Toolbar is already full! ;-)
