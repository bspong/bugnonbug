firefox becoming slower and slower after some days until not usable anymore

I have two displays, and use 10 screens in KDE. I have about 10 firefox windows open, each having up to 10 tabs open. Together about 60 different web sites are open all the time.

The problem: I login to KDE, open firefox. That opens all websites. I installed the "Active Stop Button" plugin and use it to stop all activity on all windows. Then I just have to wait several days (I never logout of this system, it's my office workplace) and firefox is becoming slower and slower every day. Writing this text means the letters jump on the screen in groups, and the general usability is really ugly, as all the time there are massive delays for a click or entering a text.

I created an strace of firefox now that it's been running 2 days, almost without anything done as it was weekend. Would be nice if someone could tell me what the problem is. 
Is there a way for me to find out if a plugin is misbehaving, without having to try to disable and see what happens?

I attached an "strace", does that help to see what happens?

Memory usage is also becoming higher each day:
# ps axuw|grep fire
zmi       2935 50.3  9.2 1265492 758224 ?      Rl   Apr23 2059:09 /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox --sm-config-prefix /firefox-zUbZOA/ --sm-client-id 10e5cf7475000127079778100000033010123 --screen 0


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open firefox (about 10 windows, overall 60 tabs)
2. wait some days
3. firefox becoming slower and slower
Actual Results:  
too slow to use after some days

Expected Results:  
should stay fluid, not use too much ram.
