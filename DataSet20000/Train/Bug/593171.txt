In all other Firefox menus, it is easy to tell the difference between a menuitem which is a button and an expanding menu.  Because these items are different things, users expect different results.  Clicking on the name of an expanding menu will open up the menu.  Clicking on a menuitem name will launch the action.  While some users *may* click on the arrow to open expanding menu's, I'm willing to bet that most associate the name with the menu and either hover their mouse over the name or click it to expand the menu.  Because visually the new split-menuitems look identical to a traditional expanding menu, this may cause general confusion, even for users who are aware of the difference.  This can also cause confusion for users who hover the mouse cursor over a menu name expecting it to expand another menu, as nothing will happen.

While there is a slight difference in how the button is highlighted, I don't think it is enough of a difference for users to notice.  I propose the addition of a simple vertical separator between the menuitem button and the expanding menu button.  This should make it immediately obvious for both first-time and experienced users which items are traditional expanding menus and which ones have a new behavior.  As far as I'm concerned this kind of visual cue is just as important for the split-menu item as the arrow is for the traditional expanding menu.
