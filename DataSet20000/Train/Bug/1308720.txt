Extreme CPU usage caused by amazon advertisment
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:49.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/49.0

Steps to reproduce:

I go to youtube (Germany), and get an advertisement for Amazon Prime for Mr. Robot on the start page. The URL of the ad iframe is:
https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?ad_rule=0&d_imp=1&gdfp_req=1&impl=ifr&iu=%2F4061%2Fcom.ythome&scp=dc_yt%3D1%26kbsg%3DHPDE161008%26kga%3D-1%26kgg%3D-1%26klg%3Dde%26kmyd%3Dad_creative_1%26ssl%3D1%26ytdevice%3D1%26ytexp%3D9434677&sz=970x250&correlator=87278349405267

The problem also happens when I load this URL directly in a new tab. However, if I disable ALL Firefox extensions, the problem doesn't happen. I've tested all extensions seperatly, and it seems like no matter what extension I enable, if at least one extension is enabled, the problem occurs. Tested it with: Firebug, ColorZilla, DNS Flusher, Web Developer, Greasemonkey and many others I installed randomly for testing. 
On a side node: I've tested this with different computers having different OS (but same version of Firefox) and it happens on all of them.
I've tested Firefox Nightly 52, same results. I'm not sure if it would happen in older versions of FF though, as the ad just came up recently.


Actual results:

The CPU usage immediately sky rockets and uses one CPU core completely. Firefox is at this point extremely sluggish on every tab. It's practically not usable until I close the page with the add, or remove the Ad-IFrame from the DOM


Expected results:

It shouldn't use a whole core, but just use 0-0.4% of the CPU as usual
