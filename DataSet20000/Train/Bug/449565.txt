First, web page rendering works ok.

The problem is the texts on the toolbar or any button is missing.
Also some text in a popup describing plug-in compatibility was weird, I guess
it is a font problem.

(This problem is also reported to Debian BTS #493076.)

Here are some snapshots that shows the problem:

This happens only on one machine. The other installations works ok.
I've tried to remove ~/.mozilla completely, no difference.

So I guess it has something to do with fonts, but I
would like some clues on where to search.
