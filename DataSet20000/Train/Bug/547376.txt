When downloading a program from the internet, Firefox freezes and will not download it.

Mozilla version 5.51? with Windows XP,  The last few days my iTunes and my Incredimail2 will not open.  When I started to download either, I get a window with where to put it.  The window opens and shows everything in that place and when I hit OKAY or start (whatever it says) the whole screen of that file goes blank, and stays that way for hours.  When I shut down the Mozilla Firefox, and restart it a window comes up and says I'm sorry there was a problem.  Click on what you want to restart or start a new session.  This has been going on for 3 days.  I cannot load iTunes, or open Incredimail.  When I tried to download skype it did the same thing.  I'm at my wit's end.  Please help.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to a web site - iTunes
2. click on Free Download
3. It suggests where to put it, and I click on Okay
4.  Screen where the box to be placed (eg My Documents)turns blank while the rest of the screen has the site.
Actual Results:  
Download does not download all the way.  It was in the box called Downloads when I checked it, but none would open or work.


Expected Results:  
The program would download, and I would be able to use it.

I can no longer use iTunes and my iPhone to sync with each other.  Cannot find all my email addresses, as Incredimail does not open and cannot be re-downloaded.
