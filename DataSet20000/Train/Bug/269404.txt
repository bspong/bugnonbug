This site uses Javascript and insists on opening in Bookmarks pane (if bookmarks
pane is not open and URL is entered the bookmarks pane opens) The site runs fine
but you cannot exit except by closing Firefox completely. Also on reboot the URL
opens in bookmarks pane again. The only way to stop this seems to be delete
bookmarks.html and then copy (saved file) across.  Although a couple of times I
had to delete application data and start over.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.insert URL address (or click on bookmark)
2. the problem than starts
3.

Actual Results:  
as in details

Expected Results:  
opened in main window to complete speed test. I would also expect crash reporter
to start (because on exit, closing Firefos, the crash message appears, but the
reporter doesn't initiate)

using JRE1.4.2 with patch 04-b05. I also not that many site running Jave seem to
clog the Browser to a crawl (try www.telegraph.co.uk/  but you will need to log on )
