Performance very slow with vBulletin WYSIWYG editor

Hi,

the performance is very bad if you are using the WYSIWYG editor on vBulletin. The standard editor is normal fast and IE8 hasn't the problem with the WYSIWYG editors.

And if you write with FF 3.5.2 with a WYSIWYG on a vB forum, the words are messed up like this:

Type in:
Hello world

Output after "loading":
dlrow olleh

And it is nont my hardware, because I have an AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 6000+ (2 x 3,0 Ghz) and 3GB of RAM.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start a new thread or answer to a thread
2. Write in with the WYSIWYG editor
3. See the problem :)
Actual Results:  
If you have more than 1 tab open and you swith and switch back to the forums where you write, the page is broken - everything is gray / white / etc. (background color) and you have a square what should be your editor, anything else isn't shown and it causes some hangs of the software.


This happens only with firefox on vBulletin and not with IE8.
