nsiShellService.openApplication() Fails Reading Registry

I have written an addon (ThunderbirdBiff) that makes use of the openApplication() method for starting the default mail client. This has worked well enough on FF2 but FF3 breaks it.

I have found that under FF3 and using Sysinternals RegMonitor, the registry entries being read to find the default mail client are just dead wrong. In FF3, the code attempts to open HKCU\Mail followed by HKCR\Mail.

The correct locations are HKCU\Software\Clients\Mail followed by HKLM\Software\Clients\Mail. Using RegMonitor, I have been able to confirm that FF2 is doing the right thing. In looking at the CPP code online, it appears that the FF2 code is far more robust in addition to being CORRECT (in this issue anyhow). I cannot understand why this has been lost in moving to FF3.

Finally, I have seen some bugs listed here suggesting that the class should be removed. This would break my addon and several others.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.In error console
2.Place the following in the JS evaluation area:

Components.classes["@mozilla.org/browser/shell-service;1"].getService(Components.interfaces.nsIShellService).openApplication(Components.interfaces.nsIShellService.APPLICATION_MAIL);

3.Press Evaluate key
4.An exception is tossed - NOT AVAILABLE
5.The exception comes from OpenKeyForReading() inside the class. This is because the sought registry key is not (and should not) be found.
Actual Results:  
Get exception thrown. Wrong registry key(s) being sought.

Expected Results:  
Should succeed in starting the default mail/news client.

Code should look for correct registry keys. See FF2 version of the class for correct usage.
