The never button in 3.0.13's software update doesn't appear to do all it should.

In 3.0.13's software update choosing never for the 3.5.2 update does not stop the update from appearing when I click check for updates from the help menu. Also after choosing never for the firefox 3.5.2 update the tiny popup please update to 3.5.2 message still appears.

I think after the never button selected the update shouldn't appear in software update's check for new updates [Maybe add a button for ignored updates] and the popup needs to go away when I choose to never update to a specific update.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.In Firefox 3.0.13 click help check for updates.
2.Choose never when the Firefox 3.5.2 update shows up as the result.
3.
Actual Results:  
Firefox 3.5.2 still show up in the check for new updates tool, and the tiny pop-up message still appear, after choosing to never update to 3.5.2

Expected Results:  
The 3.5.2 update should no longer appear in the check for updates tool after selecting never [maybe add a show ignored updates button]

The tiny pop up in the bottom right of my screen should no longer appear.
