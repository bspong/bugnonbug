Organizing bookmarks is very slow in the library with a large bookmarks collection (many folders)

Some operations like "Paste", "New bookmark...", "New Folder..." and "New Separator" are very slow in the library under certain circumstances. I have circa 3500 bookmarks in 250 folders and these operations take circa 10s with 100% CPU on the top level (Bookmarks Menu) in the library. (My system: Ubuntu 7.10, Windows XP, Athlon XP2500+, 1GB Ram)
These operations are almost instantly in the bookmarks menu, or on the deepest folder levels in the library.

The attached test file shows a similar bad performance like my normal bookmarks. I tried some different configurations and the performance seems to mostly depend on the number of folders on the current level and below, the number of bookmarks had a much lesser influence.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a new profile and import the bookmarks.html test file
2.Open the library
3.Copy bookmark "bookmark_2580"
4.Paste it on the same level

Actual Results:  
The browser hangs for some seconds

Expected Results:  
It should be fast like in the bookmarks menu
