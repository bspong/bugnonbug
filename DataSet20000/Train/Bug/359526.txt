Firefox is not responding, will not force quit

Last night firefox got hung up on ca.answers.yahoo.com.  I waited a while, then tried to quit, and when that failed, tried to force quit.  Nothing happened.  Eventually through all the means available to me, I got the browser window closed, but the applcation is still running, though not responding, and not showing up on the activity monitor.  I have tried to force quit ennumerable times, to no effect.  I left it overnight, hoping it would get done whatever it was trying to do, to no effect.  It still won't quit.

It is installed on an external hard drive which I can not shut off while files are running from it, which negates the option of restarting my computer - all my back up files are on the XHD, and I don't want to lose them.

I have experienced hanging for a few days, at random - no specific sites or "other" applications running.  Also, occassionally I have to force quit the application in order to shut down my computer, but it will usually respond to the force quit command.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Since I can't get it to quit, I can't see if it will happen again.
2.
