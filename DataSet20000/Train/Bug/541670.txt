Browser does not open a second time.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-GB; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I am having problems with Mozilla Firefox.  This happened after I upgraded to Version 3.6, but could be due to some other bug, as it affects both the Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers.  I am running Windows Vista.

After booting up, the browser will work.  But when I exit it, and try to go onto Internet again, nothing happens, the browser does not even come up.  I then have to reboot to be able to access the internet.  Also, when Firefox opens, it returns the following message.

Well, this is embarrassing. 
Firefox is having trouble recovering your windows and tabs. This is usually caused by a recently opened web page.
You can try:
    *             Removing one or more tabs that you think may be causing the problem
    *             Starting an entirely new browsing session

Clicking on the "Start new session" opens Firefox on the default home page.

I receive the following message in the Error Console in Firefox:
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIStringBundle.GetStringFromName]"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: XStringBundle :: getString :: line 17"  data: no]

I also tried Internet Explorer, it also works first time, but not the second time.  However, the second time it does open a blank page and then eventually reports "Not Responding".

PLEASE HELP!!
