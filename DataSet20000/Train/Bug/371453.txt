On Mac OS 10.4.8, Firefox 2.0.0.2 (and earlier), if one moves a window from a main display to a secondary display with smaller resolution, subsequent new windows open truncated, both at the top and bottom. This leaves the window without a place to be dragged or resized. 

When one sets the displays to have equal resolutions, this problem does not occur. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set up a Mac with two displays. In my case, an iMac with a 1920x1200, and and Cinema display at 1680x1250
2. Open Firefox, drag a window to the secondary display
3. File -> New Window

Actual Results:  
A second window opened, as expected, on the secondary display, with its top and bottom truncated. 

Expected Results:  
A second window should open, sized correctly for the screen.

Opening the Mac display preference and resetting resolutions redraws the window correctly.

This behavior seems limited to Firefox. Safari opened the second window correctly sized under similar circumstances.
