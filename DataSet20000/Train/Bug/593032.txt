I have not been able to reproduce the problem.  I just used a link from Mail using a URL.  The Window failed to appear.  I tried to open other windows and could see them in the windows list but saw no window. Minimize and Zoom were faded.  I quite without saving and restarted and got windows after clicking on the now darkened Zoom.  THis has happened four times but seemingly random.  When I reproduce the steps that I think I took just before the event, the problem is not repeated. 

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Actual Results:  
I have not been able to reproduce the problem but it has occurred several times in what seems to be randomly.  I always find the Zoom and Minimize under Window to be dimmed.  I can recover, once I get Zoom to be darkened by clicking Zoom.  Once I actually saw a reduced window in the upper lefthand corner of the screen and got the window back by clicking it.

Expected Results:  
The window should simply appear

I am sending you this report via Safari which has not exhibited the problem.  I have however gotten Firefox to run again and so far today it has not repeated.
