When Firefox installs it offers to import settings from Internet Explorer, including proxy settings.  However, some proxy settings which IE supports are not supported by Firefox.  Specifically, IE allows entries of the form "foo*" (trailing asterisks) in the "no proxy for" list.  Firefox allows asterisks only at the beginning, not at the end, of host names. (See Bug 260883.)  However, it happily imports the "foo*"-style entries, and then later misbehaves by trying to use the proxy server when accessing, say, <http://foo123/>.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set up Internet Explorer to use a proxy server, and specify "foo*" in the list of hosts to be excluded from proxy connections.
2. Install Firefox and accept its suggestion to import settings from IE.
3. Try to visit a URL which matches an entry in the proxy exclusion list.
Actual Results:  
4. Firefox tries to access the site through the proxy.

Expected Results:  
2a. Firefox should have raised a warning dialog at this point indicating that it was unable to import some or all of the proxy settings from IE, and that the proxy settings should be checked or imported manually.
