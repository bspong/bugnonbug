Firefox default home page causes firefox to hang and become unresponsive for a period of time.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20131205075310

Steps to reproduce:

Today I opened firefox and noticed it would display (Not Responding) while opening the firefox default homepage. I only use two extension, AdBlock Plus 2.4.1 and NoScript 2.6.8.13. I attempted to disable hardware acceleration after restarting firefox with AdBlock Plus disabled and noticed the issue was still occurring. The default homepage is sluggish to load, cursor movement is non responsive over bookmarks I have saved to the bar. I only open with one tab and that is the default home page. I then started firefox in safe mode. The sluggishness and unresponsiveness was mediated a little bit but it was still noticeable. Prior to today firefox loaded quickly and I had no issues. I changed my home website to https://www.google.com and with all addons loaded firefox started quickly and did not become unresponsive.


Actual results:

Firefox continues to lag at the default homescreen and become unresponsive for a short time. I noticed that at the approximate time firefox becomes responsive again, the widget at the bottom of the page is fully loaded. A different home site did not cause any hangups. 


Expected results:

Previously firefox was working as intended and did not become unresponsive upon startup.
