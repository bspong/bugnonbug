Every time I open a new window NONE of the icons I selected for my toolbar are there.  Just one or two default ones, I guess they are default, I did not select them.  EVERY time.  Do you have any idea how much time I waste having to REselect the icons I want, place them where I want, remove the ones I do not want EVERY time I use Firefox ... and another thing ... wherever all those icons go, well so do all my Yahoo! toolbar icons.  I have to reinstall that bloody thing after I pull up their website because I don't have any Yahoo! icons to use.  Then I have to download it AGAIN, sometimes more than once a day.  What is the matter with you people.  Firefox used to rock, now I want to crush it with a rock.  I loved Firefox, now ... I just don't have time for all this crap I have to go through just to have a couple of cool add-ons the other browsers don't.  Holy Mary mother in the manger ... fix it, for crying out loud.
