Thirdparty backups fail because places.sqlite-stmtjrnl cannot be copied

I use SyncBackSE for nightly backups of my home directory. It sometimes fails to backup this file:

C:\Documents and Settings\rhuffman\\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\default.kx6\places.sqlite-stmtjrnl

It cannot backup this file because it is in use by another process, presumably Firefox.

This backup occurs nightly at 3:00 AM, when there has been no activity on my computer for at least three hours. I can think of no reason an application should have a file open when there has been no activity for that long. Shouldn't Firefox be closing this file?

Note that I could probably get this to work if I enabled shadow volume copy. However, i don't want to do that.





Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Leave Firefox open.
2. Run a third-party backup that does not use shadow volume copy to access files opened by other applications. (Perhaps a plain ol' cp would fail, too.)

Actual Results:  
Backup failed on the places.sqlite-stmtjrnl file.

Expected Results:  
Backup should not fail, particularly if Firefox has not been used for three hours.
