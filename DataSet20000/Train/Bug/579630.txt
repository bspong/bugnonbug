Tabs with page titles containing mixed RTL and LTR text display incorrectly when selected
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:2.0b1) Gecko/20100630 Firefox/4.0b1 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When a page is loaded which has a page title containing a mix of LTR and RTL text (in this case, Latin-alphabet text and Hebrew), and the text is broken at a break between the two directions of text, the text shifts around when the tab is selected (focused).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
(This exact case probably only works on XP Luna theme)
1. Set screen resolution to 1280px wide.
2. Maximise Firefox.
3. Open lots of blank tabs
4. Load http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%94_%282.svg into one tab
5. Open lots more blank tabs (so the tab-bar scrolls) 
6. Switch to a blank tab. Notice that "File:2) <four hebrew letters>.…" is displayed on the tab
7. Switch to the loaded page.
Actual Results:  
Notice that the tab text changes to "File:<four hebrew letters> …".

Expected Results:  
"File:2) <as many of the four hebrew letters as can fit>…" on the tab.
