I can get the pogo.com website no problem but when I try to enter a game room the room appears to lock up and when I click on it I get a "not responding" message and I have to close Firefox down.  I've had no trouble with any other website I've visited with Firefox.  Have pogo.com set as "allow" so that shouldn't be the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Sign into pogo.com
3.Try entering a game room
Actual Results:  
The pogo.com website loads properly and so does the games room list, but when I click on a room to enter it, the screen for the room opens up but does not load.  It just stops loading and says "not responding",and I have to shut down Firefox. 

Expected Results:  
Game room loads and I can play the game.

I haven't had problems with other websites and can access the pogo.com game rooms on Internet Explorer but I prefer using Mozilla Firefox.
