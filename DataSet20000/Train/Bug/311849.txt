With multiple tabs, Firefox asks me whether close or cancel with 'confirm close'
dialog box. But, when this dialog is open, I added a new tab by clicking some
url from other applications(eg. IRC), and I clicked the cancel button to see it.
But Firefox is closed!


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firefox and open multiple tabs.
1-1. Make sure tab options : 'a new tab in the most recent window', 'Force links
that open new windows to open in : new tabs', 'Warn when closing multiple tabs'
are selected.
1-2. Set Firefox the default web browser of your system.
2. Press X button of the title bar. (Then 'confirm close' dialog is pop-up.)
3. Open any url from other applications if Firefox is set to be the default
browser. (This is opened in the new tab on the background of the dialog box.)
4. Press cancel button of the dialog box.
Actual Results:  
Firefox actually closes!

Expected Results:  
Just the dialog is disappeared and Firefox doesn't close.
