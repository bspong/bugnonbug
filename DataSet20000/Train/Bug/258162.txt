windowed plugins are flickering, because FF windows don't have WS_CLIPCHILDREN & WS_CLIPSIBLINGS styles

Windowed plugins, which are updated by timer (real time simulation, etc.), are
flickering when Firefox window is being repainted. This happens for example when
user clicks inside a plugin and then outside a plugin (when focus changes). I
figured out, that at that time, a message WM_PAINT is posted to FF and plugin.
But because FF windows don't have WS_CLIPCHILDREN and WS_CLIPSIBLINGS styles, FF
window is repainted also on plugin's part of window, and that is wrong and
annoying. 

If I make a workaround and (at plugin's initialization - I wrote some plugin)
traverse through all FF's windows and set those attributes to them, then there
is no flicker anymore. But I think, this should be done in original build of
Firefox.

Those style attributes don't slow down a computer so much that avoiding them
should be reasonable.

(Windowless plugins don't have flickering problems, because are drawn into FF's
buffer. But windowed plugins should be also working without a problem. Fix it!)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Build a normal HTML page. Could be blank.
2. Add some windowed plugin to it (<embed>). Don't use Flash, as it is windowless.
3. Periodicaly click inside and outside a window.


Actual Results:  
Windowed plugin blinks every time.

Expected Results:  
Windowed plugin should not blinks, as it is drawn in its own window, which
should not be overdrawn by Firefox!

A proven solution is to set WS_CLIPCHILDREN and WS_CLIPSIBLINGS attributes to
the windows, in which a plugin is shown (windows that displays page).

This style attributes are not required for toolbars etc., only for the main page.
