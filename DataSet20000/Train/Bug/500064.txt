High Memory (Peak: ~ 1GB) and CPU Usage

Very high memory, normally 150mb, now it's at least 300mb-1GB maximum. Abnormally high CPU usage, causes lagging in typing and flash applications. This happens in particular after watching flash videos with enabled hardware rendering. I had a lot of tabs open, but firefox used to maintain a 150-200MB memory use mark. I assume that the flash task/thread/ or application isn't removed from memory. My memory is rising at the moment. 670MB's at the moment, with 8%-30% of cpu usage on a Core 2 Duo. When I restart, it usually functions normally again.

If high enough memory takes place, firefox runs out of resources to store images, and sometimes crashes when memory is bad.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Work with any flash application/ or watch a video (preferably in hardware rendering which is what I tested.

2. Stop watching/ or close the tabs.

3. High CPU Usage and memory takes place.
Actual Results:  
High CPU Usage and memory takes place.

Expected Results:  
While watching the flash video, high CPU usage is expected, partly due to the fact of hardware rendering. But memory should have not gotten higher than 300MB's. When the flash application was terminated, it should have stopped using resources.

Intel Core 2 Duo T8100 @ 2.1ghz with 2 physical CPU's
4094MB's of R.A.M @ DDR2 800 mhz.
Nvidia Geforce 8800GTS.
Microsoft Longhorn Visa.

Number of actual crashes from memory loss: 2.
