in the bookmark manager, when for a bookmark I add a new(never inserted before) tag in the Tags textbox, when I switch to another control in the window, without closing the window (other textbox, etc.) and the Tags textbox looses focus, the tag checkbox list isn't updated with the new inserted tag.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open the bookmarks manager
2.choose any bookmark
3.in the "Tags" textbox, add to it a new tag never inserted before on your browser
4.click on another control in the window(without switching bookmark), for example the "Name" textbox, to make the "Tags" textbox loose focus
5.watch the tag checkbox list : no change
Actual Results:  
when I make the Tags textbox with the new tag loose focus, the new tag isn't added to the tag list

Expected Results:  
I would have expected the checkbox list to be updated even if I don't switch from a bookmark to another (in this case it IS updated correctly), but simply when I'm finished editing the textbox. But perhaps the current behaviour is better, I'm not totally sure if this is really the best.

I think this is a minor design issue, so it could be opportune for mozilla designer to state precisely what the browser should do in this marginal case; if not necessary it's better to leave things as they are
