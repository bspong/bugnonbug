Browser has wrong scale on drawing area after changing window size
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:2.0b7) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b7

As shown in the picture, the left size is when the firefox has just been started. After I change the window size by taking it out from maximize, the drawing area scales incorrectly compared to the area it uses. The mouse actually registers components according to the actual area, but the window itself is drawn on smaller area. If I restart firefox, it uses that size for the windows as base, and does the wrong scaling according to it.

This problem has something to do with NVIDIA drivers, because when I installed new drivers from 197.77 to 260.99, the time after the windows uninstalled older drivers, and I didn't have any driver at all, the firefox was working properly, but after the new version of NVIDIA drivers were installed, the problem reappeared.

My guess is, that this has something to do with the NVIDIA drivers, and using non-native resolution. Since I am using VGA-cable, I have no option to distinct between using NVIDIA own scaling, or letting my monitor to do the scaling for me.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start firefox
2.Change the window size
3.
Actual Results:  
The area reserved for firefox was bigger, than the area where the image of the webpage was drawn.

Expected Results:  
The drawn area should be same size as the window size, not scaled wrongly.
