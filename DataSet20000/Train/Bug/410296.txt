Hi folks,
I am not sure if this is a bug of Firefox or of the rendering engine gecko (or what it's called). Anyway, here are the details:

If you create a website, add some text and make paragraphes (<p></p>). Sometimes it happens that the break between 2 paragraphs is missing. If you reload the website (sometime you need to reload it a few times) the break is suddenly there!

Now here is what I have noticed so far regarding how to make it likelier that the bug appears (and no break appears):

1.) If you use <p></p> only for every second paragraph. Like this:

Text text text, bla bla bla

<p>Text text text, bla bla bla</p>

Text text text, bla bla bla

<p>Text text text, bla bla bla</p>

I didn't notice a case where the bug appeared when you use the <p></p> for every paragraph.

2.) If you use <table>s and/or <div>s in the paragraphs, like this

<table border=5>
	<tr>
		...
	</tr>
</table>

<p><div>Hello world</div></p>

<div>Text text text</div>

<p><table>
	...
</table></p>

and so on. Good luck in fixing.
