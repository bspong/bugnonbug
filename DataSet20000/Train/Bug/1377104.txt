User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:56.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/56.0
Build ID: 20170629103102

Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch Nightly 56.0a1
2. Navigate to Preferences -> Privacy & Security 
3. Open an url in a new tab(you can open the index.htm attachment and you can use it in the next steps)
4. Persist the site from step 3 and store some data
5. From the already opened Preferences tab observe the "Site Data" section
6. Without refreshing the page click the "Clear All Data" button displayed next to the "Site Data" section and then the "Clear Now" button
7. Refresh the page
8. Continue to store data via indexeddb
9. Refresh the page


Expected results:
After step 5: The "Site Data" section dynamically updates and shows the amount of bytes stored.
After step 6 and 7: The amount of bytes stored is equal to "0".
After step 9: The amount of bytes stored starts counting from "0".

Actual results:
After step 5: The "Site Data" section does not update dynamically. Without page refresh the amount of bytes stored is equal to "0".
After step 6 and 7: Data has not been cleaned up(displays for e.g: 2GB)
After step 9: Data displayed is cumulated(displays for e.g: 3GB)

Notes: 
Issue does not reproduce if the "Preferences" tab is refreshed before deletion.
Issue reproduces also if the site is not persisted.
The "Cached Web Content" section does not update dynamically also.
