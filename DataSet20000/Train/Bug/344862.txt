This bug does only occur when the option dialog is open.
When the option dialog is open and you click on a link in an other application such as an IRC client, that would launch the clicked link in Firefox.
It does launch the link in Firefox, but it does not display the URL of the page in the address bar, instead the address bar is empty.

Seems that it fails to put the URL in the address bar when the option dialog is open.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the options dialog in Firefox 2.0 beta1. (Tools > Options)
2. Keep the option dialog open.
3. Click on a web link in example, IRC that opens the page in Firefox.

Actual Results:  
The address bar is empty, it doesn't contain any URL.

Expected Results:  
It should have displayed the URL in the address bar.

This bug does not exist in version 1.5.0.4 of Firefox.
This bug does exist in version 2.0 beta1 of Firefox.

The bug appears to be pretty harmless, and it doesn't crash Firefox or anything.
