ACTUAL BEHAVIOUR
User is not prompted for certificate selection, when server requests my personal ceritificate. Server page, which requires client certificate, always loads last used client certificate.

EXPECTED:
Option "(Edit->Preferences) tab Encryption/Certificates -> When a server requests my personal certificate -> Ask me every time" is enabled, and when page is loaded, which requests client certificate to select, it should prompt which client certificate to be selected from user side, then such page is loaded.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable Option "(Edit->Preferences) tab Encryption/Certificates -> When a server requests my personal certificate -> Ask me every time"; Close
2. Open page, which requires client certificate page
3. Last client certificate used is loaded, but should not, and user must be prompted which client certificate to load, while several different client certificates are available
Actual Results:  
User is not prompted for certificate selection, when server requests my personal ceritificate. Server page, which requires client certificate, always loads last used client certificate.

Expected Results:  
Option "(Edit->Preferences) tab Encryption/Certificates -> When a server requests my personal certificate -> Ask me every time" is enabled, and when page is loaded, which requests client certificate to select, it should prompt which client certificate to be selected from user side, then such page is loaded.
