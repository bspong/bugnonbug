Search engine override of last one used does not work.

Steps to reproduce:

I'm having a problem with the search bar. Whenever I use something other that my default search engine (Google). such as Webster or Wikipedia, and then return to Google.




Actual results:

 my setting in prefs.js 
"user_pref("browser.search.defaultenginename", "Webster")"; and "user_pref("browser.search.selectedEngine", "Webster")"
 remain at whichever of the other engines I had selected temporarily in the last session when I log back on, not the last engine I had selected, Google.  About:config entries do not fix this, they seem to be changing properly




Expected results:

I understand that FF is supposed to start up with the last search engine that I have selected at the time I exited FF (why?). My problem is that the entries in prefs.js don't recognize that I 've changed back to Google before exiting FF.

Now this is a FF problem and the forum responses sending everyone to run an extension to correct it every time it occurs is stupid. It's time this was fixed.

Also, If I remember right, in the good old days, we had a check box under the Manage Search Engines which allowed us to set a default without editing the about:config. We need that back also.
