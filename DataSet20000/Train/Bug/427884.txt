I am still experiecing this issue.  This problem just started for one of our
users about 2-3 weeks ago according to them.  Unfortunately the error is
occuring on a secured site so I cannot give anyone access to it.  I verified
this problem and IE7 works fine.

I am using 2.0.0.13 (latest downloadable version) on Windows XP.  I attatched a
screenshot just in case that helps at all.  Since I can't give access to anyone
here, please let me know what information or steps I can provide to help fix
the problem.

There is a javascript popup that is opened when a button is clicked on.  This window has a form.  Once the user submits the form the window closes and a value is passed back to the parent window.  Shortly after this (seconds) this problem pops up.  This system has been running for a few years now and this problem just started happening.
