I can login to my online banking fine and everything seems to work until I go to pay bills. After logging in, I can select the "Bill Payment" option and it goes to the next page fine. However, the next step is to select "View and Pay Bills". When I click that, instead of going to my screen to pay bills, it goes back to a login screen. If I enter my username and password again it states that I am already logged in to the system. I have to switch to Internet Explorer to pay bills now. This problem has just started since I upgraded to the newest version of Firefox....my previous version worked fine with all aspects of my online banking.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to www.bancorpsouthonline.com and click on "homesite" in top right corner then login.
2.Select "Bill Payment" on the next screen.
3.Select "View and Pay Bills" on the next screen....then the problem results.
Actual Results:  
After selecting "View and Pay Bills" I am reverted back to a login screen as opposed to my screen to actually pay bills.

Expected Results:  
It should have taken me to a page to pay my bills.

I have tried other themes and the problem still exists. I have tried turning off the pop-up blocker and still the same result.
