Since Firefox 3.5.4 upgrade earlier this week, can't access my bank account secure password page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.4) Gecko/20091016 Firefox/3.5.4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Since the Firefox 3.5.4 upgrade this week, the password page on my online banking website throws an Apache Tomcat Status 503 error, This application is currently not available.  The version of Apache Tomcat is 6.1.16.  This is happening on all of my computers and yet I can log into the bank's website using Internet Explorer.

*** I will not divulge any specific steps related to my banking access ***

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bring up Bank non-secure page to enter login name
2. Next a secure page is supposed to come up for my password
3. Apache Tomcat Status 503 is displayed.
Actual Results:  
Apache Tomcat Status 503 page is displayed.

Expected Results:  
The banks secure password page

Nothing else from what I explained above.  I have already tried everything the bank webmaster suggested ruling out any problems, except with the latest Mozilla Firefox upgrade to 3.5.4.
