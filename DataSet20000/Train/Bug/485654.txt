This is an internet-based e-mail retrieval program.  Firefox does not properly detect the type of attachments.  It characterizes MS Word and Adobe pdf documents as Firefox documents.  Consequently, attachments do not open properly.  I could not even find MS Word in the list of programs to use (in Browse) to open an MS Word document.  I gave up and accessed the e-mail through IE8, which worked properly.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log on to Charter e-mail at www.charter.net
2.Open an e-mail with an attachment.
3.Try to open the attachment.
Actual Results:  
You have chosen to open 
abc.doc 
which is a Firefox document
from http://ssomail.charter.net
What should Firefox do with this file?
  o  Open with Firefox (default)

Result was garbage

Expected Results:  
Should have opened as a Word document, or at least have had Word as an option,


When I saved the attachment, it saved as a Word document, and I was able to open it.  However, I get many e-mails with attachments, so I am being driven back to Internet Explorer.
