WebCT is the course management system used to deliver online blended and Web enhanced courses at Montgomery college.  

I have preferred using Firefox because it is faster. However, since perhaps July 15 I have been completely unable to upload files into WebCT because the Java applet feature for uploading is completely missing.

normally in the WebCT file manager there is a computer icon that is available to click on to enable one to upload files into one's course site.  When Java is not properly loaded there is a red X instead of a computer icon. that error I am quite familiar with.

The current error is completely different the my computer icon in one clicks on to upload files is simply missing. As if it never existed.

I noticed the problem sometime around July 15 and I think it was related to the upgrade to Firefox 3.6.7.

I am still able to upload normally using Internet explorer. That leads me to believe that the problem is not with WebCT but with a new feature in Firefox 
that began with version 3.6.7.

This is a critical issue because whole lot of institutions use WebCT to deliver online courses.

If you wish to contact me, I can be reached during the day at 240-567-6006.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to WebCT
2. go to the File Manager
3. click the Get Files button (to upload)
4. Normally, I would click on the My Computer icon to upload files from my computer or a flash drive.
The my computer icon is now completely absent.
Actual Results:  
same as always, the ability to upload files into WebCT is missing. However I am able to upload files normally using Internet Explorer.
