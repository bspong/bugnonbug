Firebug stays disabled when switching back from Beta to Aurora

I'm not sure if I've categorised this correctly. I saw the post this morning about testing the Channel Switcher. I'm currently running on the Aurora channel and so tested switching to Beta and back to Aurora. The switch back and forth was fine, but there was an issue with Firebug. 

In Aurora I was using Firebug 1.8.0a2 from the getfirebug site. When I switched to Beta it was disabled as being incompatible. When I switched back to Aurora it was still disabled. I tried to check for updates with no luck. Reinstalling the addon from the getfirebug site fixed the issue. 

I'm going to try again and see if it happens every time and will update the bug once I have. 

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firefox Aurora with an addon for it installed (Firebug as an example)
2. Use Channel Switcher to Switch to Beta
3. Use Channel Switcher to Switch back to Aurora


Actual Results:  
Addon now disabled and needs to be reinstalled

Expected Results:  
Addon sould have re-enabled on switching back.
