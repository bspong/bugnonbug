Firefox adds dashes to start and end of filename,e.g. when downloading a PDF file
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.20) Gecko/20081217 Firefox/2.0.0.20 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.20) Gecko/20081217 Firefox/2.0.0.20 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When you try to download or open an Acrobat file with a PDF extension from many websites, Firefox adds a "-" character to the start and end of the filename. This results in a file extension suffix of "*.pdf_" which of course means the file won't open unless you rename the file after downloading it.

(This bg occurs in FF3.5, and there's a similar problem in FF4 Beta which adds underscores rather than dashes. I suspect this FF bug may be triggered by certain MIME types. This does not occur in any other web browser.)

P.S. This Bugzilla website is very slow and pages frequently time-out. I notice it uses CGI. Please upgrade your bug reporting web app! I strongly reccomend ASP.NET MVC.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to an affected web page, e.g. any SkyDrive page where you can download a PDF file.
2. Click on the link to the PDF file.
3. Observe that Firefox adds dashes to the start and end of the filename, preventing the file from opening normally.
Actual Results:  
Downloaded PDF file has "-" at the start and end of the filename, and cannot be opened.

Expected Results:  
Downloaded PDF file should have the correct file name!

This problem only occurs in Firefox. The problem does not occur in any other browsers I've tested, including the latest versions of IE, Chrome, and Opera.
