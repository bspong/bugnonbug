Firefox behaved as if there was a fresh upgrade when started.   The first issue I noticed was that the cardgames extension was reset and that downloads were slow.   I reconfigured cardgames and later exited.  I then opened Firefox and went to add a bookmark and noticed that my bookmarks were truncated.   I looked up how to restore bookmarks. I exited firefox.  I deleted the localstore.rdf file and replaced the bookmarks file with a backup.  I restarted Firefox and found the bookmarks file truncated.  I tried importing using the bookmark manager the backedup bookmark file.  Inspecting the bookmarks in the bookmark manager, the restored bookmarks are truncated.

Earlier in the day, I had run microsoft update and updated the root certificates, NET 3.0 frame work and the drivers for my TV card.
