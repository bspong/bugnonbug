"You have chosen to open" non-modal dialog looses focus and can't restore it (keyboard navigation)
>>>   My Info:   Win7_64, Nightly 49, 32bit, ID 20160526082509
STR_1:
0. Open file manager (Win+E) or any other applicaion
1. Middle-click this link (or focus it and press Ctrl+Enter):   attachment 8721809
2. When (not modal) save dialog will appear, press Alt+Tab, then Alt+Tab

AR:  Save dialog covers part of the page. It's not focused, there's no way to focus it with_keyboard !
ER:  Either (X) or (Y) or (X+Y) or (Z) 
 X) There should be a way to focus save dialog with keyboard.  E.g. something with F6, like Ctrl+F6
 Y) The dialog should be focused after Step 2. I.e. "modal" for keyboard people. Reference: STR_2
 Z) Modal save dialog should be opened in separate normal window (don't know if that's appropriate)



STR_2:  (reference of good behavior)
0. Open file manager (Win+E) or any other applicaion
1. Middle-click this link (or focus it and press Ctrl+Enter):   attachment 8721809
2. When (not modal) save dialog will appear, press Alt+Tab, then click on Firefox button on Taskbar

AR:  Firefox window becomes focused. Save dialog is still focused, just as expected.


Note:
 I try to use the most obvious reason why a bug should be fixed. If there is a magic hotkey I'm not
 aware of, this bug should be renamed to "Save dialog inconsistently preserves/loses focus" and
 resolved based on information above. "No way to focus" should be read as "User has to focus it again"
