firefox sync stops working after few days, weekly server maintenance seems to fix it for few next days again
The sync of all in settings checked stuff stops working after a few days.
And based on my observation from the several past weeks I have a feeling that a sync server maintenance always seems to fix it for the few next days, when the sync stops working again, and I have to wait for another server maintenance again.

The sync wheel is spinning normal and stops as expected after it got fixed via bug 1006360, and as was discussed in there, I already enabled the following options for more verbose logging:
	services.sync.log.appender.file.logOnError;true
	services.sync.log.logger.engine.history;Trace
Unfortunatelly, when I notice that the sync stopped working again (most notably the history sync ain't transferred to another station, last week I noticed passwords sync mismatch too, but it could simply be all the sync checked stuff), absolutely nothing is writted down in the logs (~/.mozilla/firefox/my profile ID/weave/logs/), even the log files aren't created.


As already said above, I have the feeling that the sync server maintenance seems to fix it for the few next days.
So my guess is that there might be something broken on the sync server side, as it always gets fixed after the maintenance.

I have no idea whether I'm the only one being affected, or if there are more users affected like this. If there are more of you, please people for your additional confirmations.
And though I filled in the bug form my OS: Linux, this problem could be OS independent if there is some issue on the sync server.
The lenght of when sync starts working (after the server maint. message is shown in the browser) till it stops (a mismatch is noticed) is various, sometimes it is 1-2 days, the last week I think it could've been about 4 days.
