crash when compiz is enabled (X Error: BadImplementation)

Firefox crashes with the following message:

open dsp: Device or resource busy
The program 'firefox-bin' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadImplementation (server does not implement operation)'.
  (Details: serial 35 error_code 17 request_code 146 minor_code 5)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)

everytime I try to connect to websites with javascript (like gmail). (Perhaps it is also flash's fault)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run compiz on a linux machine
2. Open firefox
3. Login to a gmail account
Actual Results:
