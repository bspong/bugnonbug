my school uses lotus notes for the school email.  i am able to check my mail on
firefox, however, none of the menu bars load inside of the page (the "compose",
"send", etc buttons). firefox tells me there is a plugin needed to view the full
content on the page.  when i click to download the missing plugin, it searchs,
then tells me there isn't a suitable one for the program.

currently, i am running windows xp, sp2. i have firefox 5.0

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to www.eaur.wnyric.org, click "email"
2. log in with my username
3. no menu bars show up for email
4. when i click the "install missing pluggins", it searches for the plugins to
download.
5. no plugins are found and there still are no buttons on the page.
Actual Results:  
there weren't any buttons.. 

Expected Results:  
the plugin should've been found, downloaded, installed, and i should be able to
not have to change to another browser just to check my school mail.
