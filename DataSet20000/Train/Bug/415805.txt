after about an hour of use, ff seems to take up more than its fair share of the processor. it isnt uncommon to see 95% load from firefox alone, after the browser has been open for over an hour.    I can close ff and re-open all the sites i previously had open, and the cpu load is rarely above the mid 20s.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open firefox
2.open multiple tabs
3.leave it open for more than an hour.

Actual Results:  
pc slowed to a crawl. Authoring in flash becomes very slow and unresponsive.

Expected Results:  
the software should have stayed in the 20s range for processor load.

default theme, mostly default settings.
