No RTL aligment possible in "plain" textbox

The plain textbox (either single line or multi line) used in most sites (such as
Gmail's compose new messege page or even the bugzilla enter a bug page) which
FireFox renders doesn't allow you to switch text editing directions - from LTR
to RTL.

This means RTL text enterd into the textbox (such as Hebrew text) will always be
LTR aligned (Hebrew is an RTL lang).

It is worthy to note that certain other browsers, such as IE, allow you to
swtich text directions using the Shift+Ctrl combination. This is probably
becuase IE users the Windows OS generic textbox (that supports RTL) while
Firefox uses it's own that doesn't?


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enter the compose a new messege page in Gmail.
2.In the messege body textbox, try switching the direction of the text to RTL
(by using Shift+Ctrl for example).
3.try writing some text.

Actual Results:  
The text will be LTR aligned and not RTL aligned

Expected Results:  
The text should be RTL aligned - as required by BiDi langs.
