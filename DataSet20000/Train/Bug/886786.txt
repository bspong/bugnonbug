bsod when using Firefox
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:21.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/21.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130511120803

Steps to reproduce:

Firefox 21.0 all plug ins up to date.   Nvidia driver 320.18.  I have taken all steps recommended by nvidia, such as completely clean install and disabling HD audio driver.   ISP Dishnet (=Hughesnet). 

No other applications running.  When examining web site, typically a retail site displaying a list of products, or sometimes a news site (CNN, Fox), sudden BSOD.  (No freeze before bsod.)  Definitely recurs, sometimes several times per day,  but cannot predict exactly when or with what site.  Returning immediately to the site does not repeat the error.  Always seems that something in a smaller pane is updating, but cannot tell what if any plugin after the fact.  But not video player.     


Actual results:

While information in a pane is updating, or just after, BSOD.  No particular error message displayed on bsod or reported in windows event log.  Seems most likely if I was navigating  frequently or rapidly.    Does not happen when first navigating to homepage of a site, only when selecting within it.  Does not normally happen right at "click," though may be a couple seconds after.  Happens while I am watching something within a small pane.      

Does not occur with any other application other than Firefox.   


Expected results:

Nothing.
