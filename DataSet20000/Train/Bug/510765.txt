Incorrect handling of OGG audio file embedded with audio tag

If I embed a audio file using HTML 5.0 in a local web pageb, Firefox don't  play the file if exists an external application set to handle OGG files.
It is impossible to set FF to handle internally OGG files, the only solution is to remove some registry key.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.Create a simple page embedding an OGG audio file, for example: <audio src="file.ogg" controls="controls"></audio>. 
If there exists an external apps set to open OGG files FF not show correctly the player and there are no possibility to reset this settings from Firefox GUI, also deleting the file mimetypes.rdf not solve problem.

I have used regmon to see what registry key are queried from FF when I open a FF try to use system settings instead of handling file internally reading these keys:

2239	4.46.29	firefox.exe:3112	OpenKey	HKCU\Software\Classes\.ogg	NOT FOUND		
2240	4.46.29	firefox.exe:3112	OpenKey	HKCR\.ogg	NOT FOUND

that I have removed to fix problem.


3.
Actual Results:  
c

Expected Results:  
1) If a OGG file is embedded in a audio tag Firefox must reproduce it without looking at system settings.

2) when an OGG file is opened directly (or from Opzions -> Apps) is possiblee to choose "handle this file internally".


I have noted this problem after setting Mplayer for Windows to handle OGG files, but I think that it could occurs also with other apps.
