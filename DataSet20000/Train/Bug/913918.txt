we may need to hotfix app.update.certs.3.* for digicert
See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=912675#c7

We would likely want this hotfix for all Firefox versions back to 10, on all platforms.

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #912675 +++

Greetings,

The current Firefox is pinned to accept only either Equifax or Thawte for SSL certificates on aus3.mozilla.org (for updating). Equifax is in use right now, and Thawte is a backup.

This cert is about to expire and we'll have to renew, but we don't yet know which of those 2 vendors we can renew with. So, we don't want to change either of them at this point.

We do, however, want to add Digicert as an allowed vendor. They are our new/current SSL certificate vendor.

The new entries would be:

app.update.certs.3.commonName
aus3.mozilla.org

app.update.certs.3.issuerName
C=US; O=DigiCert Inc; CN=DigiCert Secure Server CA

We'd like to do this as soon as possible (uplift to Aurora/Beta even, so it goes out on next release)... the sooner it's available on release, the sooner it becomes realistically feasible to start using Digicert (we have to wait for a significant level of penetration, so we can't go right away... an extra 2-3 versions would help).
