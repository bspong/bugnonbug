Firefox will not sort bookmarks

I try to sort bookmarks by selecting "organize bookmarks" in the bookmarks menu. I am going to call the window that pops up when you select "organize bookmarks" the "bookmarks window". The bookmarks window has "name" at the top of it. I click on this and the bookmarks are sorted by name. However, when I close the bookmarks window, the bookmarks are not sorted in the browser window when you click on the "bookmarks" menu to see the bookmarks. The bookmarks are not sorted when the browser is restarted, either. The bookmarks are also not sorted when "sort" is selected in the bookmarks window (this is selected by clicking on the button with horizontal lines on it). Finally, the bookmarks are not even sorted in the bookmarks window the next time you open it. 

This bug has existed since Firefox was at some stage in the 2.X level, perhaps 2.5. I suspect that the bug might not exist in the Windows version of Firefox because I doubt that users would have put up with it for so long. I did a search for a previous report of the bug, but I could not find it. Perhaps the bug is even more limited, such as to particular system configuration. I have dual 1.8 GHz G5 processors with 2 GB of RAM that runs on Mac OS 10.5.7. I have all of the updates for both Firefox and my operating system. Finally, I have run diagnostic software on my computer and have done the routine maintenance it needs.
