Remove etch from the Keyhole for Firelight
Currently one of the most common complaints about our OS X theme is the etch we created to try to group the back and forward controls to the drop down arrow.  It makes the controls look a little more complicated, and this type of navigation drop down isn't found elsewhere in the OS.  Also, the etch seems to provide a visual affordance that you can slide the forward button left and right, which wasn't helped by the release of the iPhone (where you actually have this kind of control).

The cleanest way to solve this problem is to completely remove both the etch and the drop down.  Overall I think this is the best idea, and (if I remember correctly) beltzner agrees with removing the control on OS X since this is more platform native.  Beltzner: can you comment to make sure this is the case.

Alternatively I guess we could make the etch much lighter, and less of a hard line and more of a gradual push back into the surface.  We can modify the bug to go with this solution if beltzner doesn't want the drop down control removed.

Regardless of if we keep the etch or not, I think we should remove the left side, since the curve intersects the back button a little strangely.  We are planning on removing that side of the etch on windows as well.
