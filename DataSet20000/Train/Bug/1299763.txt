kantar_media_virtual_meter-2.0.3-fx.xpi

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/52.0.2743.116 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

With no Firefox process running on Windows, use the command line:
firefox.exe -p default kantar_media_virtual_meter-2.0.3-fx.xpi



Actual results:

We have the error message:
Firefox prevented this site from asking you to install software on your computer


Expected results:

Firefox shall ask to install the plug-in, not prevent to install it

Our extension is fully reviewed and signed by the developer add-on portal
This was working perfectly well until version 47.0.1

Strange thing is that, doing it in two steps is working with version 48.0.2. That is to say that if I run these 2 command lines (No Firefox processes shall be running):
   - First: firefox.exe -p default (in order to start a Firefox process)
   - Second: firefox.exe -p default kantar_media_virtual_meter-2.0.3-fx.xpi
Firefox 48.0.2 ask to install the plugin correctly. 
It seems that if we want to install the extension using the command line, Firefox shall already be started.
