restore session stopped working

My firefox crashes occasionally.  Usually when I relaunch, I get the restore session option.  For the last few days, that hasn't worked.  I rechecked my settings (tools, options, etc.) and it's properly set up.  I've really grown attached to this function and want it back.  What can I do to make it work again?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Systems decides when to crash, not me, so I don't actually take this step proactively.
2.  I relaunch firefox.  Restore session doesn't appear.
3.  Click tools, then options, then general tab.  The drop menu for "When firefox starts" says "show my windows and tabs from last time".  I click OK.
Actual Results:  
Even though I do all this, the next crash still doesn't lead to session restore when I relaunch.

Expected Results:  
I should have been shown the windows and tabs that were open before the crash.

HELP!!  I really want this back.  Nothing special about my computer configuration - I'm a civilian, not a techie, so I don't know how to do any special tinkering that might get in the way of normal functionality.
