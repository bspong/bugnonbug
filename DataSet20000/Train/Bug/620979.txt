You can't turn off shortcut icon display in bookmarks bar without changing entire tool bar to "text only"

Shortcut icons appear in the bookmarks bar if you have icons displaying in the toolbar.  Since the shortcut icons appear, you can have fewer shortcuts in the toolbar without it creating a submenu.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View -> Toolbars -> Bookmarks Toolbar
2. Drag at least one bookmark to the bar
3. Note that the shortcut icon appears (or a blank document if the site has no shortcut icon)
4. Right click on tool bar to bring up context menu and select "Customize..."
5. Select "text only" from the "Show:" menu at the bottom of the dialog
6. Note the shortcut icons disappear, but the back and forward buttons now say "back" and "forward".
Actual Results:  
The shortcut icons disappear, but so do the toolbar icons

Expected Results:  
This is what I expected, but a preference to keep the shortcut icons from appearing would be appreciated since this is a change from FF3.X

This may be configurable through about:config, but, like, my parents aren't going to be able to figure that out.  They're just saying "hey, some of my bookmarks are missing" since they dont' know how to open up the menu from the bookmarks toolbar.
