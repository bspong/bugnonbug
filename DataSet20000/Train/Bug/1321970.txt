Entering an opening parens in Rules view kills lots of styles from the page
Steps to reproduce:
1. Visit any website, e.g. https://www.wikipedia.org/
2. Open the inspector and focus the <html> element
3. On the first property for that element in the Rules view, replace the value by "(" (no quotes).

Result:
A lot of elements in the page — if not all elements — become unstyled.

Expected result:
The one property with an invalid value would be dropped, without affecting other properties in that ruleset or other rulesets.

Details:
- I’m getting this kind of result with specific characters, but not all illegal values. In my tests, the main culprits are "(", "[" and "{".
- On the other hand, ")", "}" and "]" don’t seem to produce the same effect.
- If you close a parents, like "()" or "(((())))", the following styles are not affected. This works for "[]" too.
- Closing curly brackets "{}" does change the result but there is still some breakage going on.
- I’ve had experiences — in my development work, not just when stress-testing this bug — where after this kind of breakage I couldn’t get back to a working state, and had to reload the page, sometimes losing a small amount of work I was doing (prototyping CSS changes).

This bug affects me when writing valid CSS values such as "url(…)", because when I type "url(" everything goes nuts until I finish writing that value.
