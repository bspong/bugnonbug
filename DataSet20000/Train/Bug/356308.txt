<body onunload="javascript:alert();"> pops up browser window again, and crashes upon closing the browser

As there is no way to ensure that Firefox leaves a JavaScript/Flash module enough time when the user closes the browser window using the mouse, I am popping up an alert window upon "unload", so that my scripts can do final processing until the user has closed the alert window.

However, on the Macintosh, Firefox sometimes does not pop up this alert box at all, until the last browser window is being closed. Also, as soon as the alert box is closed by the user, the browser window that was actually closed before (causing the unload event) pops up AGAIN (albeit completely empty in its client area). Finally, Firefox 2 even crashes after this happens; at least Firefox 1.x doesn't crash at this point.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Simply use the following BODY tag in your HTML file, and open it with Firefox on Mac OS X:

<BODY onunload="javascript:alert('hello');">


Expected Results:  
It would be nice for Firefox to pop up the alert window right away, and leave the window that caused the "unload" event closed. This is what happens under Windows.
