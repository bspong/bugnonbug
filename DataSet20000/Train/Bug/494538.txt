A page info dialog that is opened during private browsing stays open after leaving private browsing
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1b4) Gecko/20090423 Firefox/3.5b4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When opening a page info dialog during a private browsing session, after leaving the private browsing session the page info dialog stays open.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a private browsing session by either using the keyboard shortcut (CTRL+SHIFT+P) or by the menu item (Tools> Start Private Browsing)
2.Navigate to any webpage (it's happened with multiple webpages I have tried, every time
3.Left click on the button next to the address bar
4.A pop-up panel opens with miscellaneous page information, click on the More Information... button
5.A page info dialog pops-up
6.Re-focus the main firefox window and leave private browsing mode by either using the keyboard shortcut or the menu item
7.Private browsing mode closes, but the page info dialog opened during private browsing stays open
Actual Results:  
The private browsing session closes, but the page info dialog opened during private browsing stays open

Expected Results:  
When a private browsing session is closed, the page info dialog(s) opened during that session should close as well.

I haven't tried this with multiple page info dialogs open, that might be included in the formal testing.

A personal note:
This is my first bug submitted to any projects besides my own.  As a fellow developer, I hope this helps.  Firefox is a wonderful product, you guys rock!!!
