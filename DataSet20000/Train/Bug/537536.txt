Startup attempts to open the final page of the previous session instead of the default home page, often failing to complete the process when the previous session was Gmail.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Running Vista Home Basic with 8 user accounts. Three accounts use Firefox as default browser.
2.Vanilla start
3.Invoke Firefox from quicklaunch bar
4.Don't normally multitask on startup so no special consideration of other active programs necessary.
5.No "new" programmes added in the recent past.
Actual Results:  
The final page of the previous session is opened when Firefox is invoked.
If the page opens successfully the lapsed time is quite noticably longer than normal.
If the previous session involved Gmail, then the "oops, this is embarassing" page is produced so a new session is chosen.
When a new session is selected it correctly opens the default startup page.


Expected Results:  
Open the default startup page "home" which is Google news UK.
