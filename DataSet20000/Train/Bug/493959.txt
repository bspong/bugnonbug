Window size can go to 0 with Virtual Desktop Managers

When using Virtual Desktop Managers with multiple Firefox windows open in different workspaces, moving between workspaces causes some of the Firefox widows to disappear. I believe the window size and position (x,y) has gone to 0. The window can be maximized and minimized, but nothing in between. If I try to "Size" the window from the right-click context window on the taskbar, the "re-size crosshair" appears at the 0,0 x,y location of my screen (this is why I think the window size and position are = 0). This has been happening for years (many versions of firefox) but seems to occur much more often now. I have used different Virtual Desktop Managers, but currently use Microsoft's "MSVDM".

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open multiple firefox windows in different virtual desktops 
2.move between the desktops
3.at some point, one of the Firefox windows will disappear


Expected Results:  
??. Not disappeared. :)

I looked through the about:config values for a "browser.minimum.size" (or some equivalent) but did not find anything relevant. Not all windows "play nice" with virtual desktops but most do. I have tried some of the "size" plug-ins (like Firesizer) hoping that it would force the minimum size, but that did not help. This issue happens a couple of times a day to my system and when I have 10-15 tabs per window becomes annoying. I have looked for better (lower level) windows-resizing software but have not found anything that had helped yet. I am willing to help (i.e. as it happens a lot on my system, I can run any information gathering apps you have) to gather troubleshooting information.
