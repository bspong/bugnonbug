With 2 Firefox installs in different folders, only one can be removed safely
Firefox 3.0b2 RC1 on WinXP SP2 build ID 2007121120.

After installing Firefox to two different locations, there is only one instance of Firefox located in add/remove programs.  Choosing to uninstall from here results in the last copy of Firefox being removed.  The original install can only be removed manually.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox using "Standard" install
2. Run Firefox and close it
3. Install Firefox again using the "Custom" install
4. Ensure you use a different install location and a different start-menu folder
5. Run Firefox and close it

** Note: The standard install uses "Mozilla Firefox 3 Beta 2" as the default folder/start-menu item.  For the custom install I just replaced "Mozilla Firefox 3 Beta 2" with "Mozilla Firefox 3 Beta 2 - 2007121120" for both the file-folder and start-menu folder. **

Actual Results:
Only one instance of Firefox exists in Add/Remove Programs

Expected Results:
There should be one entry for each instance of Firefox that is installed to a different location.

Upon further investigation, it appears that the registry key is just getting overwritten.  IMO, a new registry key should be created if the install location is different.

I will attach a screenshot of the key before and after the custom install to this bug.
