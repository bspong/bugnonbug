There is an unused feature provided by nsBookmarksService::importBookmarks in nsBookmarksService.cpp.
I tried to use this feature without success after a lot of attempts.
I suspect there is a bug in doBookmarksCommand() from Bookmarks.js which made call of RDF.GetResource() or RDF.GetLiteral() before to BMDS.DoCommand(sourcesArray, rCommand, argsArray); Maybe these calls are not compatible with arguments waited by nsBookmarksService::importBookmarks.

Or there is a bug in nsBookmarksService::importBookmarks.

I am not a C++ developper so I don't know what is the problem, maybe it will be simple to investigate this problem.

To reproduce this problem add the following lines in bookmarks.js in function importBookmarksFromFile just after the catch(){}.

// Add following lines to select a folder where to put imported bookmarks
var rv = { selectedFolder: null };      
openDialog("chrome://browser/content/bookmarks/addBookmark.xul", "", 
           "centerscreen,chrome,modal=yes,dialog=yes,resizable=yes", null, 
           null, null, null, "selectFolder", rv);
if (!rv.target) return; //If no folder is selected abort
var targetResource = rv.target.parent;
//targetResource = targetResource.QueryInterface(Components.interfaces.nsIRDFNode);
//------------
rTarget = RDF.GetResource("NC:BookmarksRoot");
RDFC.Init(BMDS, rTarget);
var countBefore = parseInt(BookmarksUtils.getProperty(rTarget, gRDF_NS+"nextVal"));

//Modify following line to add folder argument
//Original line: var args = [{ property: gNC_NS+"URL", literal: fileName}];
var args = [{ property: gNC_NS+"URL", literal: fileName, property: gNC_NS+"Folder", folder: targetResource}];

I tried to add/transform targetResource with QueryInterface, RDF.GetLiteral, ...
without success.

The JS error's message is always:
Error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE) [nsIRDFDataSource.DoCommand]"  nsresult: "0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/bookmarks/bookmarks.js :: anonymous :: line 379"  data: no]
Source File: chrome://browser/content/bookmarks/bookmarks.js
Line: 379

What is the problem ? Is it really a bug or I made mistakes ?

Reproducible: Always
