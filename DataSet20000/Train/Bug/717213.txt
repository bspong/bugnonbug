Steps to reproduce:

Scenario 1
1> I searched (any text) on the google search engine plugin on right top corner, this opens google search result page.
2> When left clicked on one of the sites, it re-directs to the google home page.
Also, click on BACK doesn't show the "search result page" , it shows the previous page that that.
3> If I open search site in new tab, it opens correctly, with no issues.
4> All the above things happened when I am not logged in to google.

Scenario 2:
1> If I am logged in to google & from www.google.com search for any text, it opens the searched site on left click.
4> However, if searched from google plugin on right top corner, it shows the search result, but on left click, gives the same issue !
