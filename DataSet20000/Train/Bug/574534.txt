After updating Firefox from version 3.6.3 to version 3.6.4, Firefox would not start from the executable anymore.

I even have tried Safe Mode, it still would not start. I am not under any user restrictions, and NOT EVEN running Firefox as an administrator helped the problem.
Firefox refuses to start.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Be using Windows 7 (32-64 Bit) OS. (I was using x64 bit). 
2. Update Firefox from 3.6.3 to 3.6.4
3. Attempt to start FireFox 3.6.4
Actual Results:  
Firefox would not start or launch.

Expected Results:  
It (Firefox) should have launched/started correctly and loaded my addons and homepage.

Windows 7 x64 bit Edition was used in the process of normal usage of this application.

Addons were used on Firefox, but that may not be the cause since even in safe mode for Firefox, it still would not launch.
