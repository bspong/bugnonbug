I have the URL given above (Qt documentation website) open in one tab, and at least one other tab open.

When I select the Qt documentation tab, or am viewing that tab and select another tab, the icon in the tab disappears for approx. half a second.

Additionally, if I'm on another tab and select the Qt documentation tab, I can see the favicon in the address bar also disappears for approximately the same amount of time (both the address bar icon and tab icon re-appear at exactly the same time, in this case).

To the best of my knowledge, the Qt website is NOT being reloaded when the tab is selected - the site is already loaded, the favicon is already loaded/cached.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.0/classes.html in a tab
2. Select another tab
3. Select the Qt documentation tab

Actual Results:  
The icon + address bar favicon disappears momentarily

Expected Results:  
The icon should always be visible, as per every other tab for every other website.  The favicon should also be immediately visible when the Qt documentation tab is selected.

Have not yet restarted the browser to check if this is reproducible.  On second thoughts, I should have filed this bug from another browser! :)
