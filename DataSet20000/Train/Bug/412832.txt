Regression in font appearance since Firefox 2. Hinting looks unacceptable bad.

The nighlty builds have a significantly degraded font rendering quality.
Fonts don't display in there requested color, e. g. black, but in a mixture of red, black and green for instance, which is quite likely a hinting problem.
FreeType's autohinter is used. 

(When using bytecode-hinting, the fonts look like in Firefox 2: http://ochsenreither.de/~soc/rendering_h-strong.png )

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox
2. Browse to any website
Actual Results:  
Fonts will look ugly.

Expected Results:  
Fonts shouldn't look ugly, at least the level of font quality seen in Firefox 2 should be reached.

In my opinion the severity is 'major', because readable text is one of the most important features a browser should provide.

(Additionally, I don't want to stay at Firefox 2, because of that unbearable bug ... so hopefully it gets fixed faster that way :-P)
