Firefox locks up entire machine when dropdown menu is being drawn on win 98.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.7C-CCK-MCD  [en] (X11; U; SunOS 5.9 sun4u)
Build Identifier: 1.0

I have only seen this on Win98-se. Running the same version of firefox on 2000
and XP does not produce the same lockup. This has occurred on every version of
Firebird/Firefox Ihave used on Win98 though.  

The lockup happens when a menu item (file, edit, view, bookmarks, etc.) is
clicked on.  The menu never appears and the machine is no longer responding. The
mouse pointer will often continue to track the mouse for a while though. This
happens most frequently with the Bookmarks menu, and sometimes with a right
click to bring up the "save link as" menu. It does not happen every time a menu
item is selected, but over the course of time will eventually happen almost
every time Firefox is run. This does not appear to be associated with any
particual web page, in fact almost half the time it will happen with the
initial(blank) page after starting Firefox.

Using <ctrl><alt><del> several times to reboot the machine is the only way to
get out of this situation, and occasionaly the even this will not work and the
reset button has to be used. I have never been able to bring up the task
manager, by pressing <ctrl><alt><del> one time, after the lockup occurs.
