Excess harddrive used for install (780MB);
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.3) Gecko/20060426 Firefox/1.5.0.3

This the second time I have installed Mozilla on my CPU. 
The first time I installed, I noticed that it used more hard drive space than I thought was correct, in excess of 700MB. I performed an "Uninstall" from the Control panel "Add/Remove...", and most of the files and programs in my Program Files folder were deleted along with Mozilla. 
For this install, I checked the file size again in the Control Panel "Add/Remove.." just to see how big it was, and it was 740MB. I then checked the Properties option for my Program Files folder, and viola! 740MB.
I believe Mozilla is somehow absorbing all files in that folder. I don't intend to "uninstall" Mozilla this time since I have much more hard drive space, but this certainly is not right.
2nd issue; not all my bookmarks were imported on install. Not a big problem, but again, not right.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download from Web to my "Downloads" folder.
2. Execute install of Firefox Setup 1.5.0.3 file.
3. Automatically launch program as recommened by checkbox on Intall Complete page.
That's pretty much it. The application icon in my Program Files folder indicates that it's 7,005kb.


Actual Results:  
I checked file size as stated above, and here we are.


I believe the program should be more like 7MB, not 740MB.
I selected "Normal bug..." below because there's not option even close to the problem.
