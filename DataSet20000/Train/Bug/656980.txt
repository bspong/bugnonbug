INSTALL -preferably with some sort of detail display so I could report the step at which it hung up
           ALSO -NO ERROR REPORT APPEARS: nothing like too little memory...... as in the old days.... {been a computer user since 1983) 

OPTIMALLY, would expect an email to me telling me the TRUE status of this problem- PLEASE DO NOT WASTE MY TIME TELLING ME REPEATEDLY THAT my email has been received and that you are looking into the cause of the problem.

I DID SEARCH THE BUG LIST:(which is a very nice feature- if it was useful)  "install firefox 4.0.1" and "firefox 4.0.1" and then scrolled down until issues involved firefoz 3.6.....
WHY DOESN'T BUG SEARCH SHOW DATES?  Since this update was released April 23? (or so) then I would know once I reached that date that I need not continue searching the bug list.  Why doesn't the bug list let the user sort, by date....or release .....
