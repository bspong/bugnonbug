PNG image not displayed inline at all (but shown in View Page Info -> Media or when loaded from disc)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.0.3) Gecko/20060426 Firefox/1.5.0.3

The image:
http://gmane.org/address.php?string=rmathew-PkbjNfxxIARBDgjK7y7TUQ%40public.gmane.org
is generated by Gmane to display a "decrypted" email address as a PNG image. 
(Gmane puts in encrypted email addresses in some newsgroups to foil spam 
harvesters.)

I can see this image in IE 6.0SP1 (Windows) and Konqueror 3.5.2 (Linux) and also Firefox 1.5.0.3 on Linux, but not Firefox 1.5.0.3 on Windows! In all the cases, I'm accessing the URL via a proxy server. This could be related to bug-283214
in some way, but I'm not 100% sure.

The "View Page Info" dialogue shows the content type correctly as "image/png"
and the "Media" tab actually shows the image as well but for "Alternate Text"
it shows:

The image “http://gmane.org/address.php?string=rmathew-PkbjNfxxIARBDgjK7y7TUQ%40public.gmane.org” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors.

If I save this image to disc (using Ctrl+S within Firefox) and then view it
from the disc again within Firefox itself, it is correctly displayed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://gmane.org/address.php?string=rmathew-PkbjNfxxIARBDgjK7y7TUQ%40public.gmane.org
Actual Results:  
You see a blank page in Firefox 1.5.0.3 on Windows.

Expected Results:  
You should actually see a "captcha"-like image that shows "rmathew@hotmail.com".

The same version of Firefox on Linux shows the image properly.
