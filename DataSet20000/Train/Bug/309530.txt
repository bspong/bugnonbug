wenn i resize a iframe with javascript, de main-page doesn't resize too. i have
to  reload the page to solve this problem.
when i say, that de page doesn't resize, i mean:
e.g.
(1) the iframe has a height=1000px and the page is displayed correctly
(2) with javasript i resize the iframe to a height=500px
    and below the iframe, a empty place off 500px is displayed

note: on my site mentioned to demonstrade the bug, de tables reach the bottom of
the page. this is because i have given them a hight of 100% with css.
if you want, i can change the site temporaly to show you the problem. only send
me an email and i will do the changes as soon as possible.
