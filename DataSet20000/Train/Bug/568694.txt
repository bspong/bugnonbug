Recent or Freq Jumplist section disappears or never updates after removing all items from the list by hand using right click delete.

I tried to test bug 534147 this with a recent hourly..  I removed all items from the Freq jumplist section but now I cannot get recent items or freq items to update.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
addToRecentDocs is already true, I turned off taskbar pref Freq list = false and turned on Recent List = true, restarted, went to PB mode, tried to download a file, saw the file on the DLM but not the Jumplist (at all).  Exit PB mode, the file was not in the DLM, and Jumplist is still empty.  

Actual Results:  

I'm not sure add to Recent Docs or Recent Tasks work when I turn them on in about:config

Or I don't know if its there but my Jumplist menu doesn't update (bug 522481) or if there is a recent item update bug, or once you delete all items from the list, the jumplist never creates the recent or freq section again.

Expected Results:  
Recent/Freq list should exist and populate as expected when prefs set to true..
