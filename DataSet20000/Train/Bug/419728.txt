Formatting of "From" and "Subject" fields in Hotmail e-mail accounts are a bit of a mess

I just recently began using Firefox at the suggestion of a friend who is a computer network engineer.  I love the product and consider it to be far superior to Internet Explorer, with the exception of a couple of features . . .

The formatting for my Hotmail accounts is a bit of a mess when using Firefox.  In Hotmail the "From" field is extremely truncated -- making it impossible to read -- and the "Subject" field is huge.

I'm hoping that you will address this issue and satisfactorily resolve it, because I honestly both enjoy and prefer using Firefox.  I consider it to be the superior product.  Thank you!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Log into Hotmail account.
2.  Go to Inbox.
3.  Look at "From" and "Subject" fields.
Actual Results:  
The same thing happens every time.  I see a truncated "From" field and a huge "Subject" field.

Expected Results:  
Allow me to see the entire "From" field, so that I can read who sent me the e-mail.

I prefer to use an 800 x 600 pixel display.

The only work around is to use Internet Explorer to access Hotmail.
