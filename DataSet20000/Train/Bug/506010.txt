Actual Results:  
Limited Account Still tries to update.
In Admin account, after the update it starts up, but later on. after logout and login, you get the message "The application or DLL C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\nss3.dss is not a valid Windows image. Please chek this against your installation disskette" when trying to start firefox.

1 admin account, all the others are limited user accounts.
