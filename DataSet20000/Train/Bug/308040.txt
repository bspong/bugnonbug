Viewing Cookies Causes Them Not to Be Erased by "Clear Private Data"

I'm having this problem in both the trunk and branch. I've seen Bug #291154, but
it doesn't mention the "View Cookies" aspect.

I have all the selections in the "Clear Private Data" checked and also have Keep
Cookies set to "until I close Deer Park". 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load any website with cookies allowed.
2.Go to Tools -> Options -> Privacy -> View Cookies
3.Close "View Cookies" (or leave open)
4. Close FF
5. "Clear Private Data" dialogue opens; Click "Clear Private Data Now".
Actual Results:  
FF closes normally, but when it re-opens, the cookies are still there. 

The only way to eliminate them is manually using Ctrl+Shift+Del to open the
Clear Private Data Dialogue (checked to erase cookies) or using Clear Cookies Now. 

Expected Results:  
The cookies should have been erased.

When the browser is closed without my having looked at the cookies, and then
re-opened, and then closed again normally (with the Clear Private Data checked
to clear cookies and "Keep Cookies until I close Deer Park"), the cookies are
eliminated as expected.
