on a page with show 10 small jpg files, file 001.jpg-009.jpg loaded properly, but instead of loading 010.jpg Firefox loads a second copy of 001.jpg. Work around is to make a copy of 010.jpg as 011.jpg and edit HTML scrip for the page to load 011.jpg instead of 010.jpg. Firefox then displays the correct image. Other pages in the same site which access ONLY 010.jpg and no other image file properly display the 010.jpg file. Problem only happens when ten images displayed on the same page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.create new web page.
2. insert ten small JPG images
3. view page -- instead of image 010.jpg you will see 001.jpg.
4. put copy of image 010.jpg onto site and name as 011.jpg
5. modify HTML for 10th image to show 011.jpt
6. Now the correct image will appear.
Actual Results:  
if you perform the step above without creating the 011.jpg file image 001.jpg will appear where 010.jpg should appear

Expected Results:  
you should have gotten ten different images including seeing 010.jpg at the expected location for 010.jpg

Bug does NOT appear on pages with only one image, e.g. if the ONLY image on a page is 010.jpg, the correct image appears. But if you have a page that has ten images 001.jpg through 010.jpg, the browser displays the 001.jpg image both at its correct location and also, erroneously, at the 010.jpg location.
