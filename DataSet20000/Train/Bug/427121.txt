Bold fonts show up improperly spaced in auto-complete list, on websites and in tab headers

After installing Mozilla Firefox 3 Beta 5, bold fonts in certain parts of the Firefox interface show up improperly spaced (see attached URL).  Characters seem very wide, and numbers pretty much overlap each other, making some text very hard to read.

The problem is in the interface somewhere, I think, because bold fonts on websites render fine--it's only on three places that I've seen this bug so far: the bolded parts of the auto-complete list when typing URL's in the addressbar (not shown in attached image), in the header of the selected tab, and in the error message shown on the ``this site does not exist'' page.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) I just ran the setup normally, 2) started the browser, 3) and the bug was already there.  I know that it's probably hard to reproduce because none of my friends seem to have this problem.  It should be noted that fonts showed improperly spaced, right when I ran Firefox 3 for the first time after installing it, i.e. there was no point at which I did not see this bug occur.




It's weird because I've never had a similar problem with Firefox 2 nor with any other program.  I'm using the default Firefox theme, and I never messed around with Firefox' themes or settings or fonts or anytyhing.

In offchance that it matters, my Windows XP theme uses MS Sans Serif for menu's and Verdana for titlebars (although I'm not sure if those are the fonts Firefox actually uses).  Up to this point I used Firefox 2, which is installed in a different directory, and still works fine (i.e. no bold font bug).  I haven't installed any previous Mozilla Firefox 3 beta's on this system.
