and now vaio laptop t5500 1.66GHz 2gig ram i was using
refuses to load xp-64bit install
bios password accepts then screen goes black 3 seconds later
then bios password appears again
upto date virus checkers avast and avg would have stopped viruses in download
spybot would have stopped malware etc
i really hope the system does not need to be reinstalled as this laptop has extremely expensive, sensitive, irreplacable, legal documentation on it

i am contactable for more info if needed

installed correctly

restart later. forced a restart of software?
