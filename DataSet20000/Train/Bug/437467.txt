"Input string was not in a correct format." error occurs on page with .NET imagebutton

I have a .NET website with an image button on it for logging in.  Only on Firefox 3 RC2 I receive an error when the button is clicked.  (I've tested on IE 6&7, Firefox 2 and Safari).

Changing the code so that the page uses a regular button (<asp:Button instead of <asp:ImageButton) fixes the problem, as well as creating a hyperlink and just using stylesheets to show the images (http://www.dappertest.com/accounts/login.aspx is an example of this).  The page has other asp:imagebuttons which work.

I tried to create a simplied version of the page to see the problem, but I couldn't get it to reproduce.  From the error it seems like there is some problem with the processing of the postback.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions, and keep up the good work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://test.oabuild.com/accounts/login.aspx on Firefox RC2
2. Type in anything
3. Click login

I'm using some controls from Telerik for some Ajax functionality, and doing some tricks to create the image buttons on the fly (a .aspx page with "outputs" an image of the button) but these shouldn't have any affect (and again, there is another image button on the page which doesn't have this problem.
