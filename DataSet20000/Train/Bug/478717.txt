I am running Vista Home Premium SP1, 64 bit. Firefox is my default browser, and I saved a lot of web pages in my "Documents" folder using Firefox. They do open with Firefox. However, the file icon for them is a blank page, and does not have the Firefox icon on it (like it did in XP,) so I don't know at first glance what the file is. I've tried everything to get the Firefox logo to show up on it, but it won't. The File Association with them is Firefox. I did try uninstalling Firefox, and then I re-installed it, and the Firefox icons DID then show up for those saved web page files. However, when Firefox automatically updated to the current version, they went back to a blank page as the logo. Does anyone know how to fix this? I did first post this in the Firefox forum, however, nobody could figure it out. Thanks.
