Firefox doesn't prompt to become default browser (for first profile created after installing)
Latest 54.0a1 to 51.0b1, likely also before. Windows 8.1 64-bit

The first profile created after installing Firefox doesn't prompt for setting it as the default browser.

Steps to reproduce (Nightly and Developer Edition will prompt on second launch, browser on first, release likely similar, but I haven't tested):
1. Installed Nightly into the old custom install directory (but any custom install directory should work).
2. Launched it from the console with firefox.exe -no-remote -P
3. Create a new profile.
4. Launch the profile.
5. Close the profile.
6. Launch the profile.
7. Close the profile.
Actual result: Not prompted to set it as default browser.
8. Launched it from the console with firefox.exe -no-remote -P
9. Create a new profile.
10. Launch the profile.
6. Launch the profile.
7. Close the profile.
Actual & Expected result: Prompted to set it as default browser.

The first profile which won't show the prompt has browser.shell.checkDefaultBrowser automatically set to the custom value false.

This gets sets at https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/e91de6fb2b3dce9c932428265b0fdb630ea470d7/browser/components/shell/ShellService.jsm#52-74 because DefaultBrowserOptOut in the registry is True and gets deleted, so it won't get set for profiles created later.

The code for setting the registry key is at https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/e91de6fb2b3dce9c932428265b0fdb630ea470d7/browser/installer/windows/nsis/installer.nsi#1025
