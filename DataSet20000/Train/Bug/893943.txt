Firefox hang with intellicast.com animation
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:22.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/22.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130618035212

Steps to reproduce:

After FF is launched, in the past several days one of the tabs I consistently open reflects an Intellicast animated radar loop on the following webpage (the specific drop-down selection is set to San Antonio, Texas): http://www.intellicast.com/National/Radar/Current.aspx?animate=true


Actual results:

After a few minutes with that radar animation running in the background, it becomes impossible to refresh any of the other tabs' pages or achieve a successful transition to any link when clicked -- Firefox just hangs up and becomes non-responsive, requiring closure AND either a system reboot OR manual termination of the still-continuing process within Task Manager before it can be re-launched.  This behavior never occurred prior to v22.  By a trial-and-error process, I discovered that the dysfunction seems to be associated with the simultaneous presence of that animated Intellicast webpage, though at first I ascribed the issue(s) to problems with my wireless internet service and/or home office network (a wired + wireless combination).


Expected results:

FF should continue to be responsive and not become dysfunctional.
