Bookmarks list collapses after a few seconds when using keyboard to navigate bookmark sub menus

When I have one instance of Firefox open and I use the keyboard to navigate my
bookmarks (Alt+B, then arrow keys), after a few seconds and before I have
selected a bookmark, my bookmarks list collapses and I have to start over again.
 After I hit Alt+B again, the list stays open - the problem only occurs the
first time I open AND NAVIGATE (just opening the list doesn't cause the collapse
- I must navigate with the arrow keys too) the bookmarks list with Alt+B.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close all instances of Firefox, then open up a new one (it seems that I have
to open up another application between closing down Firefox and opening up a new
instance).
2. Hit Alt+B (open Bookmarks) and navigate your bookmarks with the arrow keys
(do not use the mouse), but do not select a bookmark.
3. Wait a few seconds, and the bookmarks list collapses.

Actual Results:  
The bookmarks list collapses, and I have to hit Alt+B again to open up my
bookmarks list.  The second time I open up my bookmarks with Alt+B the bookmarks
list stays open until I select a bookmark.

Expected Results:  
The bookmarks list should remain open until I select a bookmark.

I need to open up another application (IE, for instance) between closing all
instances of Firefox and opening up another instance of Firefox to recreate this
problem.
