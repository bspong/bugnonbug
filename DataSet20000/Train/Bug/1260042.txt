Sources are blank if Auto Prettify Minified Sources enabled
>>>   My Info:   Win7_64, Nightly 48, 32bit, ID 20160326030430
STR_1:
1. Open attachment 8724506 [details]
2. Open Debugger, enable "Auto Prettify Minified Sources"
3. Close and reopen devtools

AR:  No code displayed in the code area.
ER:  The code should be displayed.


Notes:
1) This bug is different from "sources are missing". I filed that as bug 1211514, no need to report it
2) In this bug, every time a script is displayed in the list, the code area is empty. That is the bug
3) If you want to workaround bug 1211514, then in Step 3 you should:
     Switch to Inspector tab -> close and reopen devtools -> Click (ev) button near <html> ->
     -> click pause button in event listener popup to switch to Debugger.
   That would reduce the frequency of bug 1211514.


STR_2:
1. Open http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=2735707 , wait until the site is fully loaded.
2. Open Debugger, enable "Auto Prettify Minified Sources"
3. Close and reopen devtools
4. If the script selected in the right sidebar is not "26sdov5axQhN", switch to that script
