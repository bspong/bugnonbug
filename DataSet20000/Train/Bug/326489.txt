Anchor tag with a number goes to the wrong location (UTF8 problem?)

I'm mostly certain this is a problem with mozilla as IE and Opera work correctly.

Here's the scenario, using phpBB2, I recently updated the templates so they would work in XHTML compliant mode, that is pretty much the only difference that this board is running that no other board is running. 

The search script seems to work in other browsers but mozilla, I've been unable to figure out why exactly mozilla is breaking (or maybe the other browsers are treating it as quirks mode and mozilla isn't, or I don't know)

Anyway, if you goto http://forums.comicgenesis.com/search.php?search_author=Kisai
you will be given one page of search results.
Click on page 2, 3 or even "Next", and it will say no results.
Now click back.
Hit view source, and copy the anchor tags href for it and open that in another tab, and then try again. Going to the URL directly by copying it out of view source works, but clicking on the link does not.

If you view source, you'll see the link to be
search.php?search_id=611986109&amp;start=20
but if you click on that link
it goes to 
http://forums.comicgenesis.com/search.php?search_id=83861028&start=20

The search_id is incorrect.

To make matters worse, this upgrade to phpBB2 happened around the same time Mozilla 1.5.0.1 was released, so the initial blame was placed on phpBB2...
Yet the bug doesn't happen on the stock forums at www.phpBB.com if you replicate the problem.

Which confuses me. One of the things that our forum does that a lot of other installations does not is run in UTF8 mode. So this could be trigger. 

So right now the problem does appear to be Mozilla/FireFox
