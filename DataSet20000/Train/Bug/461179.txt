A flash object that is displayed over a div using the overflow-y: hidden; property does not respond to any mouse events, including hover and click events. This event happens regardless of the position of the object tags in reference to the div (they can come before or after the div). Note: this is also caused by tags that were created dynamically by javascript using document.write("<object ...") )

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a flash object that dynamically changes size/position and registers click events.
2.Create a div with overflow-y: hidden; property
3.Cause flash object to move over div (note the object does not necessarily have to be inside of the offending div)
Actual Results:  
The portion of the flash object over the div does not respond to any events.

Expected Results:  
The flash object should still receive events when the object overlaps on top of the div.

The bug does not occur with overflow: hidden, just the direction specific overflows.
