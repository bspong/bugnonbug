some blocked pop-ups don't register - pop up blocking needs manual adding to whitelist
Currently pop-up blocking (when turned on) shows a yellow (i) button on status
bar, which allows you to add that site to the pop-up whitelist.

However, when using the web end of an exchange e-mail server, with po-up
blocking on alot of functionality is lost, and the way in which it works (I
think) prevents the yellow icon appearing.

reading an e-mail seems ok, but to reply, the site closes the current window,
and tries to open a new window - presumably as an action of closing the previous
one. This fails, and there is no yellow (i) on the original root window - and
the closed window.. is obviously closed.
It would be nice if in the prefs there was a way to manually add to the whitelist.
Possible would also be to turn off blocking, visit the site again, and when the
pop-ups occur, to have the yellow (i) appear _anyway_ and let sites be added to
the whitelist _even_ when pop-up blocking is not enabled. (this does not sound
like an ideal solution to me - but more user friendly than manually adding sites.)

If anything, I'd like to know if I can manually add the site in a pref file to
solve my own immediate issue.

But still think this is a bug, some pop-ups don't register with the pop-up
blocker ui.

The code onthe site for the reply button is:

<a href="JavaScript:DoCommand('reply')">  
<img SRC="/exchange/forms/reply.gif" Alt="Reply to sender" align="middle"
border=0></a>

which refers to:

    if (szCommand == "reply") {
     
window.location="commands.asp?command=reply&obj=00000000178F4CA9ECC5D41183E000D0B7D3010807009D10E7EFC779D411B03400D0B7D301080000000C14B500009D10E7EFC779D411B03400D0B7D30108000001DDDED70000";
       
    }

in this instance..
