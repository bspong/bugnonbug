Open Pre

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open Preferences
2. choose Content
3. click Manage... button
4. choose a helper app for a type (I did this for PDF, choosing a default application)
5. click Change Action...
6. repeat the whole procedure (or at least, try)
Actual Results:  
The file type is not listed anymore! And worst of all, there is no way to add another file type and/or mime type (this is the real problem). 

Expected Results:  
Two things:
1. the file type for which I just changed the helper app should still be listed, and therefore editable
2. I should be able to add other file/mime types

I had PDF Browser Plugin listed to open PDFs before doing this. 

I found that the problematic information (disabling the information from the prefs) was in prefs.js. Why is this information not in mimeTypes.rdf in the first place? And anyway, this line should never have been added to prefs.js (as I never asked for it, I *customized* it, so customization should not be disabled).
