Proxy exclusion by IP doesn't work for SSL unless hostname is fully qualified
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

I have our internal network IP range 10.0.0.0/8 in my proxy exclusion list.

This exclusion only works for SSL traffic when using the fully qualified domain
name.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set up proxy settings: manual config, same proxy for all, enter web proxy
hostname and port, add 10.0.0.0/8 to the "no proxy for" list.
2. Go to a HTTP site using just the hostname, no network DNS suffix -- works.
3. Go to a HTTPS site using the fully qualified hostname -- works.
4. Go to a HTTPS site using just the nostname, no network DNS suffix -- gateway
timeout from the web proxy server.

Actual Results:  
Works properly for steps 2 & 3 (HTTP and fully-qualified HTTPS), returns a
gateway timeout from the web proxy on step 4, because it doesn't match the proxy
exclusion list.

Expected Results:  
HTTPS sites using an unqualified hostname should do a DNS lookup, then apply the
proxy exclusion list.
