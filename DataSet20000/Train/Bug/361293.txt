User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

Cannot edit yahoo bookmarks using Firefox. This problem is with Firefox 2.0.  This was not a problem with Firefox 1.5 and earlier versions.  I have not tried Firefox 3.0.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a Yahoo account or log in to yahoo.com
2. go to hppt://bookmarks.yahoo.com
3. hit the link to add folder.
4. Firefox will end the bookmark editing session because the link is points to the finish.
Editing yahoo bookmarks in IE6 show the link for creating folders as:
http://e.my.yahoo.com/config/edit_bookmark?.folder=1&.bmprop=&.action=nf&.src=bookmarks&.partner=&.done=http%3a//us.edit.companion.yahoo.com/config/slv4_done%3f.bme=1
Firefox show the link as:
http://my.yahoo.com/

5. Editing bookmarks in Yahoo is done by hitting the link "Add Bookmark"
IE6 shows the link as:
http://e.my.yahoo.com/config/edit_bookmark?.folder=1&.bmprop=&.action=ab&.src=bookmarks&.partner=&.done=http%3a//us.edit.companion.yahoo.com/config/slv4_done%3f.bme=1
While Firefox shows the link to be:
http://my.yahoo.com/

If you have saved the bookmarks with the Yahoo Toolbar then you can edit a previously saved bookmark with the pencil icon:
1. Example save the link from the yahoo toolbar for yahoo.com
2. go to http://bookmarks.yahoo.com

Editing the bookmark in IE6.0 show the link for editing to be:
http://e.my.yahoo.com/config/edit_bookmark?.action=eb&.folder=1&.item_id=1%08http%3a//www.yahoo.com/&.src=bookmarks&.done=http%253a//us.edit.companion.yahoo.com/config/slv4_done%253f.bme=1
Firefox show the edit bookmark link to be:
http://www.yahoo.com/

Actual Results:  
when trying to create a folder or bookmark the editing session ends.

When trying to edit an existing yahoo bookmark, Firefox goes the the bookmarked website and not the yahoo bookmark edit page.

Expected Results:  
When creating Folders: Should do the same as IE6.0 does and this webpage should appear:
http://e.my.yahoo.com/config/edit_bookmark?.folder=1&.bmprop=&.action=nf&.src=bookmarks&.partner=&.done=http%3a//us.edit.companion.yahoo.com/config/slv4_done%3f.bme=1

When the existing bookmark (I.E. yahoo.com) the page for editing should appear as in IE6.0:
http://e.my.yahoo.com/config/edit_bookmark?.action=eb&.folder=1&.item_id=1%08http%3a//www.yahoo.com/&.src=bookmarks&.done=http%253a//us.edit.companion.yahoo.com/config/slv4_done%253f.bme=1
