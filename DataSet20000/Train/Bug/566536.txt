Alert dialog is empty or unresponsive when the form target page contains an alert followed by window.location change

Submitting a form to a page which contains an alert() followed by a window.location causes the alert dialog to pop up but the dialog has no content.

On my machine you have to submit the form at least THREE TIMES for the bug to be visible.

Mousing over the dialog reveals the content.

Clicking other parts of the UI makes the dialog unresponsive until repeatedly clicked. You have to click inside the alert box the same number of times you've clicked outside of it.

Closing the tab/window resets the behavior.

1.html:
<form action="2.html" method="get">
	<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>

2.html:
<script language="JavaScript">
	alert('The Prepared Alert was updated successfully.');
	window.location='1.html';
</script>


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create the two pages as outlined above
2. Open the first page (1.html)
3. Click the Submit button
4. Alert box pops up. Click OK. You are redirected back to the first page.
5. Perform steps 3. and 4. two more times. Keep your mouse out of the dialog till you see the button. On the third try the dialog will be empty
6. Mouse over the dialog. The contents appear.

To get the dialog to be unresponsive:
1. Perform the steps 1-5 above to get the dialog to be blank.
2. Click any number of times (n) the dialog close button (X), title bar, or the UI outside of the dialog
3. Mouse over the dialog to reveal the contents
4. Click the OK button n + 1 times to get the dialog to respond to the click.
Actual Results:  
1. The dialog contents were not visible. 
2. The dialog was unresponsive if I clicked outside of the dialog first.

Expected Results:  
1. The dialog contents should be visible as soon as the dialog appears.
2. The dialog should be responsive on the first click.
