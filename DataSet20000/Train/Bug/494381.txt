FireFox randomly starts using 100 percent of CPU and doesn't react anymore. sometimes it crashes or even freezes the whole PC. Only way out: Kill firefox.exe through Task Manager

The Problem seems not to be caused by a specific Website. If I close all Tabs just leaving one open sometimes you can kick Firefox back into normal operation so its possibly a Bug with Tabbed Brwosing? Probably a conflict between Tabs? Maybe not isolated Correctly against each other??


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse the Web as usual but TABBED! (For my Part I have about 7 to 15 Tabs open)
2. Do other things but leave Firefox open (It will happen sometimes after seconds, sometimes after hours)
3.If you're having some Luck Firefox will get into trouble with itself and use your full CPU. Now if you react fast enough you can stop the Problem by closing all Tabs except the MAin Window. Then it will work as usual again. (Got that two times yet)
Actual Results:  
Crash, Freeze oder just mega lagg. I don't know exactly but could also be linked with a MemLeak



Expected Results:  
Run normal^^ Don't use 100 percent of my CPU to just display any website. Again: Seems not to be an website-related issue like Javascript cycles or something.
