While working on bug 1205898 we noticed that some code in browser.js is calling TelemetryStopwatch.finish twice for the Histogram FX_PAGE_LOAD_MS, where as TelemetryStopwatch.start("FX_PAGE_LOAD_MS") is only called once. 

According to callstacks, here is the place where it happens: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser.js#4761

After the patch for bug 1205898 lands this will cause a similar message to appear in testing logs and possibly in browser console:

13:24:23     INFO -  3 INFO TEST-INFO | (browser-test.js) | Console message: [JavaScript Error: "TelemetryStopwatch: requesting elapsed time for nonexisting stopwatch. Histogram: "FX_PAGE_LOAD_MS", key: "null"" {file: "resource://gre/modules/TelemetryStopwatch.jsm" line: 303}]

STR:
0. if bug 1205898 is still open modify 
https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/telemetry/TelemetryStopwatch.jsm#153
to include some debug output as for example:
dump("*** ERROR ***: TelemetryStopwatch: requesting elapsed time for nonexisting stopwatch. Histogram: "FX_PAGE_LOAD_MS");

1. ./mach test browser/base/content/test/ | grep "TelemetryStopwatch"
2. Observe the error reports.

See the attached file for a sample output obtained by running:
./mach test browser/base/content/test/general/browser_aboutHome.js > browser-js-telemetry-stopwatch.log
