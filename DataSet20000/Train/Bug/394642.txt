On http://forums.majorgeeks.com/ there is a single line data entry field used for entering text into the chatbox.  On IE and FF2, the box scrolls (overfill feature) as you enter text.  On minefield the text simply stops, however one can keep typing and upon hitting enter, the data entered is still displayed in the chatbox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. navigate to http://forums.majorgeeks.com/

3. On the main page, after logging in, the "shoutbox" (chatbox) appears at the top of one's screen.
4.  Enter text in the white box, keep typing until you can no longer see what you are typing.
5.  If you continue to type, The box will not show the extra text, however if you hit "OK" to send the data to the chatbox, all will appear.
Actual Results:  
The box will not scroll to accomodate additional text,  all text entered beyond the physical width of the box is not visible to the user.
