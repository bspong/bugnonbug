Printer preferences default to incorrect page size (A4 - Envelope) due to incorrect printer page size enumeration (assumption) and inability to set default page size in UI

Firefox is incorrectly selecting defalut page size from printer enumeration of page sizes.  For Brother HL-1440 series, pages enumerate in: A4, Letter, Legal, Executive, A5, A6.  Therefore Firefox incorrectly assumes the first in the list is "Letter", but it is A4 so Firefox prints in A4 regardless of default printer settings set in control panel.  There is seemingly no way to set default page print layout in Firefox

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install on WinXP with printer where the printers enumerate with letter sizes where the 0 index is not Letter (such as A4)
2. go to google maps (type in any location)
3. Select print preview (or print) and page will print based on defalut 0 index page size for printer.
Actual Results:  
View of google maps shows layout printed in A4 with no way to change layout to correct page size.

Expected Results:  
Firfox should correctly select Letter ad default page size not simply zero index of page enumeration.  I also expect ability to change page type to print to to allow printing to other page types.

I believe ability to print is a Major feature.  Temporarily switching to Internet Explorer for printing until this is fixed.
