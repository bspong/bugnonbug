self signed certificate can't be accepted in iframe
User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; InfoPath.2; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)

Steps to reproduce:

My ISP has a self signed https certificate.
Logging into my ISP's squirrelmail via https, when I click on 'Junk Mail', the browser says the connection isn't trusted and displays a button that shows can show detail. Unfortunately, there is no way to add an exception for the self signed certificate, therefore I can't see the junkmail folder.

I suspect it is related to the use of iframes, because the exception option seems to
work when iframes are not involved.

A workaround is not to use https, which is very bad for security.
Another workaround is to use a different browser, which also is very bad.


Actual results:

There is no way to add an exception for the self signed certificate, therefore the junkmail folder is inaccessable.


Expected results:

There should be an option to view the certificate and accept it as being valid. It worked wirh all firefox's up to 18, but broke with firefox 19.

This is not specific to my ISP, my browser, or my OS. It has been replicated on a different computer, with a different ISP.
