JSP in tab locks-up and prevents graceful closure of Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5

We use the Focalpoint product (http://www.telelogic.com/corp/products/focalpoint/index.cfm) which uses JavaServer Pages (JSP) to communicate to a backend database server. Sometimes the embedded JSP applet will lockup (not sure why) - other tabs continue to work correctly.

The only way to reset is to exit Firefox. However although the main window disappears, the firefox.exe process does not exit and has to be killed. On re-start Firefox and the Focalpoint JSP work correctly.

Currently running J2SE 6 Update 11 (build 1.6.0_11-b03), however I think it happened with older versions too.

Note that FocalPoint output is customised for each site, thus it could be buggy in our setup. However the Java lock-up and consequent failure to exit should not be dependent on correct HTML/JSP.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Buy :-( and install a Focalpoint setup!
2. 
3.


Expected Results:  
Even if Java locks-up, firefox.exe should exit gracefully after closing the main window.
