Display of link targets with long queries isn't very usable

I was reading a slashdot article, which linked to a google query.  I know it's a google query because when I hovered over the link, I could see "http//www.google.com/ in the link preview in the address bar.  But I have absolutely no idea what the query terms are, because they're elided in the ... of the shortened query that's visible in the address bar.  See the attached screenshot.  I have a wide screen, and there wasn't enough room to see the only two parts of the url (hostname and query term) that I cared about.

Reproducible: Always




I know there's been discussion about moving (temporarily or otherwise) the link target preview out of the address bar and into a tooltip in the lower-left, where it "used to be", and some discussion about how the left edge of the link preview isn't currently predictable.  I'm not arguing for or against those behaviors, necessarily, but I would like to see something similar to Chrome's behavior, where initially the browser shows the elided and shortened URL, and if you stay hovered over the link for longer, shows the entire URL.  Perhaps something akin to WinAmp, that used to scrub the song title back and forth within a narrow display area, might work?
