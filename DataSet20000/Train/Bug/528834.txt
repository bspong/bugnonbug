Home button lacks styling for the disabled state, breaking compatibility with the UsableHomeButton extension

Icons for disabled state of home button (chrome element id is 'home-button') are missing as of Firefox 3.6 (including current nightlies—Gecko/20091115 Namoroka/3.6b3pre and Gecko/20091115 Minefield/3.7a1pre). Firefox 3.5 (current stable branch) *has* this icons.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Firefox (Windows version) installation directory.
2. Open "chrome\classic.jar\skin\classic\browser\Toolbar.png" or "chrome\classic.jar\skin\aero\browser\Toolbar.png". (Toolbar-small.png is affected too.)

Or just open provided testcase URL where sprite from 3.5 is compared with one from 3.6 side by side.
Actual Results:  
In Firefox 3.5, there is icons for disabled state of home button. But as of Fx 3.6, such icons are missing (in both Toolbar.png and Toolbar-small.png).

Expected Results:  
Icons for all states of home button, *including disabled* (missing in current 3.6/3.7 nightlies), should exist.

Currently affected version of Firefox are both (3.6 and 3.7) trunk branches. Latest tested versions are Gecko/20091115 Namoroka/3.6b3pre and Gecko/20091115 Minefield/3.7a1pre.

Disabled state icons are important for extensions that use them. For example, UsableHomeButton (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10315) disables home button if user is already on the home page of the current site. In current Fx 3.6/3.7 builds such navigational effect is unachievable, and therefore appropriate usability aspect is broken.

Besides, disabled states icons are missing not only for home button, but for adjucent icons in the same sprite too. May be all these missing icons are subject to be added soon, but this is uncertain, so here is bug report. Thanks.
