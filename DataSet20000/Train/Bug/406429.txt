Log into website, access videos. Firefox not showing videos and kicks me out of viewing lesson page. IE shows videos.

12/02/07 I am accessing www.golftec.com to view my lessons and the videos will not show up.  And then when I try to click elsewhere on the page, I am kicked out of the website.
 
This is a relative recent problem (11/104-11/25) as I have used Mozilla Firefox to view my lessons before.  I'm not aware of making any changes to my PC or Mozilla options.  I just went to the website and it no longer worked.
 
11/26/07 I checked with golftec's support and they could access my information.
 
12/02/07 I logged in using Internet Explorer and had no problems seeing my lessons.
 
12/02/07 Reloaded Firefox, did not fix my problem.
 
Any help will be appreciated.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. www.golftec.com
2. ID and PW. Not sure where this posts. Could I be emailed for ID and PW.
3. Click on Web Lesson. Video not showing.
4. Click on the page, kicks me out of the page. No errors listed.
Actual Results:  
No videos on page.
Internet Explores works fine.
I selected a few videos via You Tube and they showed up.  I'm not a techy and I do not know the code for Golftec's website.

Expected Results:  
When opening the web lesson page I should be able to view several videos for the lesson but the page is blank where the videos would normally be seen.  When the video is present, I click on it to view and or download.

Thank you for looking into this for me.
