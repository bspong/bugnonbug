Firefox starts blank instead of homepage/restoring tabs after crash
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:10.0.2) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0.2
Build ID: 20120215223356

Steps to reproduce:

1. I have disable the crash report of firefox, I have set the crash report enabled=0 in the application.ini file
2. I have disabled windows 7 check for solution, Start > All Programs > Maintenance > Problem Reports and Solutions, in the Problem Reports and Solutions window, and clicked Change settings > Advanced settings > Turn off problem settings
3. I have disabled the the windows error reporting alert message, I have set in the registry HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\DontShowUI to 1
4. I added firefox to the windows scheduler to run infinite time and to restart every 1 minute in case it crashes.



Actual results:

When firefox crashes (it can be simulated by just ending the firefox process in the task manager) it get restarted from windows 7 scheduler but it shows always a white page (about:blank), the configuration options of "When firefox starts:" "show my home page" and "show my windows and tabs from last time" are ignored.


Expected results:

Also if firefox has crashed, when it restarts the chosen options in the "When firefox starts" should be respected and either the home page or the previous windows and tabs should be shown.
