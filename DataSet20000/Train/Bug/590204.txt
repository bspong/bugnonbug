If I create a subfolder within a general bookmark folder, ie: I have a folder called "all mozilla links" and a subfolder called "firefox links," the subfolder refuses to accept new bookmarks if it is or has ever been the last entry in the folder.  This does not happen when it is the ONLY entry.  It occurs when it is created on the bottom or moved to the bottom, even if it later moved up again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create bookmark folder
2.Populate it with one or more links
3.Create bookmark subfolder and move it to bottom of folder
4.Attempt to populate subfolder with links
Actual Results:  
The subfolder did not hold the link

Expected Results:  
The subfolder should have held the link, as it does whenever the subfolder is NOT (and has never been) on the bottom

I recently transferred my firefox profile from a previous computer by copy/pasting files into the default profile folder.  I notice no other errors whatsoever from having done that (been using it for a while) and everything else seems perfect, but it may be relevant if you can't reproduce my error.
