Proxy settings don't work

I am using Foxy web filtering program (http://www.2-power-n.com)to filter adverts. It makes all the needed settings on IE automatically, but I have to find them manually on Mozilla. I have to put the following settings in Connection Settings tab:

Manual Settings: localhost, port 8080. 

When I put those settings it works. But when I close Mozilla 1.5.0.4 and open it again, the settings are lost and the radio button is again on Direct Connection position, so I have to make the settings again everytime I open Mozilla.

I tested the same situation on Windows 98 - it doesn't happen like that there - everything works as intended. I did it on a fresh Windows XP Installation - the same problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Put some proxy settings in the Connection settings Tab.
2.Try to browse
3.Close Mozilla, open it again, see if the proxy setting are still there.

Actual Results:  
The proxy settings are gone, and the radio button is again on Direct Connection to the Internet position. I have to make the settings again

Expected Results:  
The proxy settings are gone, and the radio button is again on Direct Connection to the Internet position. I have to make the settings again
