I got a notice from Java asking me if I wanted to check for updates and I chose the option that I wanted to.  Then it came back that it found an update.  I followed the onscreen instructions to download and install the update.  Then I noticed in the Add-ons box that it had a listing for Java Platform SE 6 Update 10 Java Platform SE 6 Update 11 and Java Platform SE 6 Update 11.  I was told to go to about:plugins to see the directory where the dll file is and move the dll file to somewhere like the desktop and then restart the browser.  I did that and noticed that when I clicked on the Tools menu that Java Console is greyed out and when I go to the Add-ons box all 3 are still listed.  How do I get rid of Java Platform SE 6 Update 10 in the Add-on box.  I even saw in Add/Remove Programs that it said I have Java Platform SE 6 Update 11 installed.  How do I fix this.
