[MAC] libsmime3.dylib in use when installing on top of an existing install
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20100413 Firefox/3.6.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20100413 Firefox/3.6.4

When dragging the Firefox 3.6.4 app to Applications and approving 'Replace' the install fails with "libsmime3.dylib in use". Restarting Mac and not starting Firefox still gives the same error. Old version of Firefox (3.6.3) is now useless - so a partial install left the previous version unstable.
Solution:- drag old install to Trash and then install 3.6.4.
... Would prefer no error on upgrade, or if error then previous version should still work - not good that get error and previous version is scotched as well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Mount disk image
2. Drag Firefox to Apps folder
3. Approve 'Replace'
4. Watch as install fails with 'libsmime3.dylib in use' error, repeatedly if you try it several times.
5. Gasp as you find previous install is now u/s as well
6. Start terminal window and cd /Applications .... find . -name 'libsmime3.*' -print ...... is your friend as it proves there is a local copy of libsmime3.dylib for Firefox!
7. Trash old install from Apps directory
8. Reinstall from scratch.


Expected Results:  
Stop libsmime3.dylib access and overwrite with newer version OR if fail leave previous version in usable state.
