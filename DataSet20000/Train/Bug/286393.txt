with last nightly build of firefox:

firefox crashes each time a fully w3c-validated page is loaded 
- here the details:

Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050315 Firefox/1.0+

on SuSE Linux 9.2 full updated on regular basis without positive effect on bug
behavior - last update march 16th 2005

using kernel
 >  uname -a
Linux gott 2.6.8-24.11-default #1 Fri Jan 14 13:01:26 UTC 2005 i686 i686 i386
GNU/Linux

starting firefox:

 >  /opt/firefox/firefox --sync
The program 'Gecko' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)'.
  (Details: serial 100154 error_code 11 request_code 53 minor_code 0)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
