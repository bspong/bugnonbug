Image on streamed video keeps on freezing intermittently

Whenever I wath anything on BBC iplayer or any online streamed video, the video runs for about 10-15 seconds and then momentarily freezes, and then restarts having missed all the frames during the pause, which usually lasts for about 2-3 seconds. This continues for as long as you watch video and never, ever corrects itself. It never does this in IE7 or 8, so it's not my computer.
The second problem, is that games using java applications, i.e. pogo, suddenly freeze half way through a game and do not restart. Again something that never happens on IE7 or 8.
If these issues are not resolved quickly, I shall return to IE despite all it's faults! This happened with the old version if Firefox too.
