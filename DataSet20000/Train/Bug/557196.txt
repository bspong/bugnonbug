I have three background images that are being Tweened-In on the home page; or Tweened-In when clicking on the Title "Vizion Designz."  The Background Images are displayed properly in Internet Explorer, Safari, and Chrome, but NOT in Firefox.  Firefox displays a white line at the bottom and will not display my background images.

Please go to http://www.viziondesignz.com in different browsers to see the difference.  The site was build with Flash CS4, ActionScript 3.0.  Thank you.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to Home Page
2.Click on Vizion Designz button
3.
Actual Results:  
Firefox will not show three background images that are being tweened-in.  Further Firefox displays a white line at the bottom of the stage.  IE, Safari, and Chrome do not have this problem.

Expected Results:  
If you go to this page in Firefox, you will not see the background images tweening-in (left side of Logo) and a white line at bottom of page.  If you view http://www.viziondesignz.com in IE, Safari, or Chrome it displays as it should.

I consider this a major issue.  All browsers except Firefox displays this page correctly.  Further this site is developed in Flash which used by many web-developers and is a problem that they may run into.
