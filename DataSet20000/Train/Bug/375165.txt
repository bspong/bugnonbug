FF + McAfee VS = CPU@100%

CPU@100% for over a minute when FF 2.0.0.3 is launched (even in safe-mode) and McAffee VirusScan is enabled.
After FF loads, the system will feel like frozen from time to time, due to VS taking 99% of the CPU. I do not have a clue on what triggers VS to take 99% of CPU while FF is loaded (even when I am not browsing). Closing FF solves the problem.

FF 2.0.0.2 did not seem to have the same problem.
Did not use 2.0.0.3RC2 long enough to tell if it had this issue.

Disabling "VirusScan on-access scan" prevents McAffee to misbehave.
I know the problem might be McAffee's, but in the end it will hurt FF if this issue is not resolved.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox in either "regular" or safe mode
2. Watch Task Manager: CPU@100% (McAffee 99%). It stays @ 100% for over a minute
3. Once FF (finally) loads, start using FF. At times, the system will feel like frozen, but it is McAffee taking 100% of the CPU.
4. Stop browsing but leave FF opened. Anyway, the system will feel like frozen from time to time. Closing FF or disabling "On-Access Scan" prevents McAffee from misbehaving.
