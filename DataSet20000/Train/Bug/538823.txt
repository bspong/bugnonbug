Firefox.exe does not close on hitting the "X"

When closing firefox (from normal mode and private mode browsing) it does not always really close. The form closes but by going to taskmanager and the processes tab, firefox.exe still exists (Most of the times even with 100% cpu usage for 1 core) I've had this problem since the 3.5.7 update (I had the latest previous version before this one).

This bug occurs to me on both my laptop (old D610) as on my laptop for work (Asus x59sl) and my desktop (i7core with hd4870 and 6gb memory).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox, start browsing.
2.Close firefox when you usually do..
3.Try to start firefox again and it displays a message that firefox is still running - so open taskmanager and kill the firefox.exe process to continue browsing.
Actual Results:  
Firefox.exe does not close.

Expected Results:  
Firefox.exe should not be running after hitting the "X" button on the right top of the window.

The only addon I have for all computers is chatzilla.
