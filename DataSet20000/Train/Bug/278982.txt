Menu view/sidebar has two entries: bookmark and history. At one time only one
can be selected or none. It would be more intuitive if it were radiobutton
insted of checkbox. I have tried to open both history and bookmarks and could
not manage. My understanding was "if it is a checkbox it must be possible to
have both". On the other hand, if we just simply replace checkbox with radio, it
is not possible to unselect it so it is not enough to do that. See the expected
results for a possible solution.
 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View/sidebar
2. choose either history or bookmark
3. now choose the other one

Actual Results:  
if I select one checkbox either Bookmark or History, the other gets deselected

Expected Results:  
radio instead of a checkbox, but not directly. In my opinion "sidebar" menu
should have two sumbenu entries, "visible" with a checkbox and the second one
would be "content" which would have two subitems "history" and "bookmark", both
with radiobuttons as a radiogroup.
