starting FF as always with its desktop shortcut, firefox.exe process starts with 12,960k mem, 0 CPU and nothing else happens, Cannot get firefox running again.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: firefox 9.2

I'd downloaded the 9.2 build a few days ago (~7/09 or 10) and applied the 
registry fix (the 4 null entries in "firefox_bug_246078_rev2.reg").  I'd had 
the browser open and running on several occasions since- yet today (7/11) 
after exiting, I could not restart the browser.  Looking into it via 
TaskManager, Each time the firefox.exe process is initiated, taking 12,960K 
each time, but zero activity.  No application associated with it, just the 
process.  I am having to enter this via IE6, as FF refuses to start.  
I consider this a rather important issue for FF to fix- it had been taking a 
long time to launch- 5-10 seconds-but this issue isn't a slow launch, its a no-
launch.  

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
"every time" since it happened the 1st time- I cannot get it opened again.
1.build 9.2- as the default browser, applied the registry fix for default 
ddeexec
2.used it on and off 3-5 times- nothing special- no form activity or sensitive 
site access.
3.upon the last exit, attempted to open again and it fell into this state.
I had shut all programs down, rebooted, reattempted and it still refuses to 
start the browser.  I ended the process, and the next time, the process tree, 
via task manager and rebooted, and still no go.  This might indicate a 
registry/ cached setting that is forcing it dead. 


Actual Results:  
absolutely nothing, besides having to reopen IE6 to get to this site and look 
for this bug, but I hadn't found any recent mention of anything along this 
line.  

Expected Results:  
the browser

awfully simple situation, making the problem more troublesome.  I just asked 
to open the browser again and no go.
