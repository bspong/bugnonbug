Firefox/29.0


1. Create a series of square boxes with background images (position center, size cover) floated at 25% wide to a flexible container.
2. stretch the document window or hover the cursor over the boxes with the background images.

If these values are set to pixels and not %, the problem goes away. Also, if the window is stretched to a width optimal to the %, the rendering looks fine (see attached image).

Hovering is particularly troublesome since it causes the images to change the subpixel rendering in odd ways. See second attachment.

Actual results:

Interpolation values at the edges of the box produce unwanted sub-pixel borders. These sometimes look like dotted lines, and sometimes just appear as straight thin lines.


Expected results:

The background images should bleed to the edges of the square, without any subpixel/interpolation bugs.
