Notice problem while using sites like yahoo mail, etc.. that use cookies to set your user information. While at the yahoo mail site reading my mail all it forgets who I am. So I checked the content cookies and the check box is off on the "Allow site to set cookies." So I turn in back on. later I opened firefox again and the checkbox was off again.  What I found is that almost everytime I start firefox its off and turns off during session sometime with in minutes sometimes longer like 10 ro 15 mintues.  But it does so reqularly.

Reproducible: Always
