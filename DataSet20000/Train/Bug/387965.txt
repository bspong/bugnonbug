www.blackboard.com and more specifically ccc.blackboard.com does not allow firefox to be used for posting in the forum area. This is an online classroom used by increasing numbers of schools with the numbers of students easily within tens of thousands. When the specific threads are accessed perhaps only for new ones created the title bar within the body of the page displays but does not respond. All of firefox becomes frozen on that view despite the unapparent control over which tabs are displayed. When Firefox is closed the process remains running and disallows new browsers to be opened until it is closed through non graphical OS interface means.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to existing topic
2. add new thread
3. attempt to title it
Actual Results:  
frozen firefox

Expected Results:  
a new thread within the topic

This also happened with Netscape 9 beta (running on Firefox 2 engine)
