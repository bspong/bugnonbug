Polish Australis tab stroke inner highlight
Created attachment 753287
v.0.9 Use new images from shorlander, fix layering of ::after, remove tab-active-middle-lwtheme.png

More detailed notes:
* I removed remove tab-active-middle-lwtheme.png because the updated remove tab-active-middle.png images from Stephen don't have the tab fill. This means we will always use fgTabTexture behind the stroke (tab-active-middle.png) rather than having the linear CSS gradient from start/end beside the image gradient in the middle which may not match perfectly.
* deleted redundant styles from browser/themes/linux/browser.css
* consolidate two ".tab-background-middle[selected=true]:-moz-lwtheme" rules

This patch fixes the layering of ::after, as it wasn't above ::before for some reason, which may help. With this patch there is a slight issue with LWT which seems to require a clip-path tweak. I'll do that in a later patch.

I thought your Windows images had the highlight but I don't see them now. Are they in some other bug or did I accidentally overwrite them locally?
