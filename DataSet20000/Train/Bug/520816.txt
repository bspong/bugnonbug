no option to set hotmail to open from mailto links in webpages.
it could simply set to the sign-in page.
I was told to enter the following in the address bar and then a dropdown would appear to allow this but nothing happens.
javascript:navigator.registerProtocolHandler('mailto','http://mail.live.com
/secure/start?action=compose&to=%s','Livemail');
Mailto feature worked fine with  2.0
No easy add-on that works for it either.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.
click on "mailto" button in any web page
2.IE opens at hotmail sign-in page
3.OR nothing happens (I've changed the behavior somehow)
Actual Results:  
nothing now
I tried changing it via javascript:navigator which apparently is disabled in FF 3.5

Expected Results:  
Opens hotmail sign in page in Firefox 3.5 (default browser)

This is apparently a default behavior?
I do NOT have a mail client installed nor do I want one. I want to manage my email in hotmail/live webmail on my browser as always.
I do NOT want to do this in IE. I want to do this in Firefox.
