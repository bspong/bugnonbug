The program gets into a state during which attempting to create a new bookmark folder causes the name of the selected folder in which the new folder is to be created and all entries above it to become highlighted but no new entry creation line is opened for naming the new folder and the attempt has to be abandoned.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right click on page to be bookmarked.
2. Select and left click on BOOKMARK THIS PAGE.
3. Left click on upper right arrow button.
4. Scroll to folder in which new folder is to be created.
5. Left click on name of folder in which new folder is to be created.
6. Left click NEW FOLDER button.
7. Abandon hope and cancel.
Actual Results:  
No line is opened to enter new folder name as one is when the program is behaving properly.

Expected Results:  
Duh....

This version  has so many new bugs I've added this bug reporting page to my toolbar!  Congrats guys!  Lots of new enhancements and bells and whistles and new bugs to go with them.  Why not concentrate on refining the existing version to get rid of the old bugs???  No fun, huh?
