Fire FTP 1.0.7 causes Firefox to exit wiht exit code 1
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-GB; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-GB; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6

Firefox did an automatic upgrade to 3.6 (on OSX 10.6) earlier this evening. From the on, each time I tried to launch it, the icon appeared briefly on the icon bar and disappeared, with "Firefox exited on exit code 1" appearing in the console log.

I downloaded Firefox again and re-installed, but this didn't solve the problem.

I used the profile manager to delete my profile, and then Firefox launched.

I then downloaded Fire FTP (the current version, which seems to be 1.0.7), but when Firefox restarted after installing it, the problem recurred.

I've now made several attempts: each time Firefox launches happily with a new profile, but dies as soon as I add FireFTP, so I guess there is a clash between FireFTP and the new Firefox.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox
2. Download FireFTP 1.0.7 and install it
3. restart Firefox
4. Firefox crashes
5. Use profile manager to delete profile and create new one
6. Launch Firefox (which is now happy, and back to step 1 above)
Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes with Fire FTP 1.0.7 (the current version)

Expected Results:  
I'd expected it to launch happily

Launched happily: FireFTP doesn't seem an exotic addition to Firefox

Things were working happily until I upgraded Firefox a few hours back, so I guess this is a problem that's been introduced by whatever has changed recently in Firefox.
