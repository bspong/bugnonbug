i understand you not receive email with suggestions, but create a account to report a bug? not very simple.

and i use """Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; pt-BR; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080201 Firefox/2.0.0.11;MEGAUPLOAD 1.0"""

i think that is the last version. I really like Firefox! Continue tha work guys!
sorry if that bug/suggestion exists.
