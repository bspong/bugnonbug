Firefox crashing. Cannot be restarted. Must reboot Windows

During browsing but otherwise in unspecified circumstances (perhaps when filling in some forms)Firefox crashes. Does not start Firefox bug reporting process. Only Windows bug procedure is invoked (unresponsive program). If attempt is made to restart Firefox, it fails (sand clock symbol for a few moments). Due to this, bug is extremely annoying. Ctrl-Alt-Del does not reveal presence of Firefox, but when Windows is stopped  Windows offers close program screen for Firefox. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Unfortunately have not been able to work out exact reproduce procedure although occurrence is fairly regular.
2.

I must register two gripes and I am writing them here because I do not know where else to write.
1. Bug reporting link in insufficiently prominent. I only found it in "Contact us" section.
2. More importantly, there is no legacy build available. Due to this I will be forced to reestablish a previous state from a disk image, costing me several hours of work.
