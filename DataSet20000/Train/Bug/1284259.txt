Indeed thanks for the heads up. There is a race condition which can lead to erase the tooltip content before having destroyed the previous tooltip. Comes from two reasons: 
- calling "hide" on a Tooltip not yet visible is not triggering the "hidden" event (early return in the hide() method)
- in markup.js, on event bubble click handler, we hide() the tooltip, then fetch the event info asynchronously and then show() the tooltip. We should hide() right before calling show() otherwise we are exposed to race conditions
