can audio icon be added to desktop icon in taskbar? [ audio(/video) apparently without a tab; KDE flaw]
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:43.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/43.0
Build ID: 20150831030209

Steps to reproduce:

This was reported to KDE; but filing this as FYI...
https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=352117

43.0a1 (2015-08-31)  
1. Detached noisy tab via Move tab to new window
2. Attach tab to... (ended up on another desktop, attached to a window running another user's Nightly)


Actual results:

VERY weird -- drove me nuts trying to find this noisy tab...  I have 300 tabs open on 13 windows. Sound from video streaming is playing; but I have:
- no audio indicator on any window
- no audio indicator on any tab
- the tab where I started the video is no longer visible anywhere

I searched several times through the 300 tabs; but couldn't find the noisy tab...  until I finally found it attached to my test Nightly running as a different user on another desktop... 


Expected results:

Issues I saw as a result of the above:
- No audio icon on noisy window (1 of 13 auto-grouped windows)
- Even in single-tab situation, FF should display speaker icon.
- Is there any way to add a visual indicator for the noisy desktop in Linux multi-desktop situation?
- With the "missing" tab on userid1's window, now attached to userid2's window, I can't get the audio icon to appear -- is there a minimum number of tabs before the icon will appear? Window w/userid2 (not sound enabled) running "43.0a1 (2015-08-30)" + window w/userid1 (sound enabled) running "43.0a1 (2015-08-31)"  grouped into one window...
- after closing userid1's window, left with userid2's on which audio icon does appear (without sound)...  go figure...

Confused yet?  :)
