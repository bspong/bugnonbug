when i don&#180;t want a website to load, i stop it. but then, if i try to load any other site, firefox just indicates the process of loading and nothing more (just like "opening www.somesite.com..."). and this continues to the eternity. but if i shut down browser and run it again, it will open the needed website without any problem.

P.S. I have a LAN access to the internet. may be, it's the reason to the bug.
P.P.S. this bug appears in 75% of times, but there is no fixed connection with when and what i do at the same moment at computer, so sometimes the browser works appropriately.
