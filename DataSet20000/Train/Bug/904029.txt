User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130809030203

Steps to reproduce:

Started browser , checked my email , opened another 2 tabs , all tabs were opened (not loaded just opened) when trying to open multiple tabs from bookmarks instead of opening new window or new tabs (along the old tabs)...


Actual results:

browser opened selected tabs from bookmarks over the old one's and the rest of tabs (over 90) disappeared. The restore previous session dose not work anymore.
I did not managed to restore session and could not access, to restore,(there is no such option) all my tabs in Sync offered by Mozilla. I want a method to restore my initial tabs , tried forced restore , did not work , restore only the latest tabs not the 90 lost ones.


Expected results:

Should have opened separately the bookmarks in septette tabs.
I'm so disappointing in Mozilla , and  Nightly -26.0a1 (a bit better than mozilla but has a lot of problems with tabs).
It's the 4th time I lose tabs in Mozilla , big tabs problems . I cant reopen them from history,there I have to many pages visited , so revisiting them it's not an option. because I don't know what I have closed or that mozilla has closed .
