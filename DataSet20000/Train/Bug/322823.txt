Installer should add shortcut link to (root) Profile directory in Firefox's Start Menu program folder

This is a simple Feature Enhancement request for the Firefox installer to add a shortcut in the Firefox Start Menu program folder that links to the root of the Profiles directory (%AppData%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles).

The main reason I believe this will be beneficial:
- If you take a look on Mozillazine, or any Firefox messageboard or newsgroup, one of the most common instructions given by someone offering tech support to a user in need is "go to your Profile folder and...." which then usually requires the addition of:
"You can find your Profile by going to ........." - where they either write out the long:
c:\documents and settings\[WindowsAccountName]\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[ProfileName]\
.. or give a link to the mozilla.org support page that shows how to locate ones profile.

Of course, they could just put %AppData%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles but that usually requires a "copy the above line, right-click on Start, choose, Explore and then paste it in the address bar (you do have that turned on right?)"...

Instructing a user to simply click the link in their Start Menu Firefox folder would be much easier!

Reproducible: Always




(While we're at it, putting a shortcut called 'Firefox Profiles Directory' in the program files install directory would also be beneficial).
