Toolbox height is larger than the available space after increasing the toolbox height, closing tools, shrinking browser height, then reopening tools
1. Load http://example.com/
2. Open the Developer Tools > Console
3. Resize the Developer Tools to be very tall

4. Close the Developer Tools
5. Resize your browser so the height is much smaller

6. Open the Developer Tools and notice the text box is no longer visible (also try typing something to see where the autocomplete box shows up)

Expected results:
The height of the Developer Tools (and Console) pane is resized to fit. (FWIW, this is what Chrome does.)

Actual results:
When a user resizes the height of Developer Tools pane, the height is always preserved, even when there's not enough space. In order to fix this for narrower heights, you have to make the browser taller and then make the Developer Tools pane shorter.

(I see a similar bug, bug 1014622, was marked RESOLVED INVALID. I wonder if the bug was exhibiting this behaviour or if it's unrelated to this issue.)
