Page still seems to be loading after is says 'done' LOCAL SERVER
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.5.0.7

I've put a stripped out page at http://firefox.gimme5.co.uk where the first 5 main tabs behave as described below when on a webserver on my local machine....

I have a navigation built for a website that has javascripts which effect the look, highlighting the appropriate navigation tab by parsing the URL to find the first folder its in for example www.site.com/products/software/sdk.asp will highlight the products 'tab' as thats the main folder the URL is in.

The problem is that it works fine in IE and appears to in Firefox, BUT if Firefox loads the page, highlights the tab and says 'done' if you don't wait for an additional 4 seconds (my best guess) then when you click on another tab, the page it goes to will render wrong. This is really annoying as the coding is absolutely fine. THIS ONLY HAPPENS WHEN I'M RUNNING IT ON MY LOCAL MACHINE WEBSERVER AND I'VE RECODED IT FROM ASP TO PHP TO RUN ON APACHE LOCALLY AND IT STILL DOES THE SAME THING.
When I'm viewing the site from the web I can only just get the site to falter - any ideas why????
