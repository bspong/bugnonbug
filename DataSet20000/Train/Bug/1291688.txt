Frequent lack of responsiveness / hanging on some machines

about:support

My father has been using Firefox for many years because his son works at Mozilla and because he doesn't like what Google does with his data.

Unfortunately, he's recently regretfully told me that he has switched to Chrome since he can't keep Firefox running without becaming unresponsive.
I've seen this behaviour as well and it seems to only report to Windows. In other words, I'm not sure if we report back to Mozilla.

After using Firefox for 5 to 15 minutes it would become unresponsive and have to be closed.
One of the times I've noticed that it was related to a Javascript script becoming unresponsive.

One of the websites he would visit besides Facebook is this:
http://www.rtve.es/noticias/mas-24/
IIRC the unresponsive script came from there.
Side note, that site shows no video stream for me (Nightly on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) and does not show audio nor video for jmaher.

I installed Firefox 64-bit (which was very hard to find) on my father's laptop and it seemed to help, however, there were other sites that stopped working for him.

Here's the build identifier from few weeks ago [1] and attached you can find the about:support.

I'm going to their house this Thursday (hopefully). If I can still reproduce it I could bring the laptop on Friday to the office.
