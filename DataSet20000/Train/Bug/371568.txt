Firefox hangs and does not respond in any manner when this page's web site has it java disabled during late night/early hour times.

In Firefox, going to the the site in particular (I have yet to experience any other sites that disables their java for any given reason) when they have the java disabled on the bandwidth test, causes the browser to hang and not respond to any mouse commands at all. I have to use Task Manager and force close Firefox from there. 

I have done this in IE7, and IE will still be usable and can continue on. The site in question has their java disable (typically) between the hours of 2AM to 8AM eastern time. This is done to save on their testing bandwidth on their part.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to site at described times (2AM to 8AM), and you should see that the java script is disabled (will see a red "X" in the top left corner). 
2. Try using any mouse click to close Firefox.
3. To get out, use Task Manager, and stop Firefox under the "Processes" tab, and then click the "End Process" button.
Actual Results:  
Same as described in the "Steps to Reproduce".

Expected Results:  
Simply close when prompted by mouse or keyboard command, or move to another web page.
