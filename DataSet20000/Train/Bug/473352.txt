Hi,

I've just figured out that if I add a feed-icon to the location-bar via the HTML-link-element the page has a min-width somehow. That means if I resize the window to a small width the page doesn't change anymore as soon as the location-bar has reached it's min-width (influenced by the feed-icon). So the text doesn't try to wrap at the current window-width anymore but at the width it had when the location-bar reached it's min-width.

You should view the described behaviour at:

If I remove the link-element it works:

I can't imagine that this is an intended behaviour. Therefore I'm reporting it here.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a simple HTML-page like the one mentioned in the details
2. Add some text to see line-wrapping
3. Add a link-Element to see an "subscribe to ..." icon in the location-bar
Actual Results:  
Line-wrapping "stops" as soon as the min-width of the location-bar is reached

Expected Results:  
The behaviour / rendering of the page should not make a difference wether I add a feed-icon to the location-bar or not
