Bookmarks toolbar and locationbar dropdown suddenly glitched, other UI elements corrupt. FF3 suddenly very slow.

Just booted up my computer and found a morsel of oddness. I'm currently posting this from Chrome, because when I tried to start up FF, I found it was first of all suddenly very slow, sluggish -- it's not churning the HDD, it's just taking extra long to start, and to load up pages...

...and second of all, has what I can best describe as a 'malformed' UI. Bookmarks are not being displayed in the bookmark toolbar, nor are the bookmark toolbar bookmarks even appearing in their section in the bookmarks menu -- but if I go into Organize Bookmarks, they are clearly still there. 

In what must somehow be related, the scroll bar in the drop down menu for the awesomebar is, quite simply, on the wrong side. It's appearing on the left side, instead of the right. 

Several (slow) restarts haven't resolved the issue
