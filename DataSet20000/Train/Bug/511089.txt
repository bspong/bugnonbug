I was viewing this page without issue last week.  I went back this week after Firefox 3.5 upgrade and now the background image on this and several other sites is not working properly.  I tried this with 2 separate themes.  It does not appear to occur with the standard, default Firefox theme.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn on Walnut or Nautipolis theme
2a. Browse to http://www.hoppenmotorsport.com/BoschBypass.htm (whole page)
2b. Browse to http://www.audittcca.com/discussions/auditt/00003777?b_start=0#00003777 just the top navigation section
3. Scroll the page
Actual Results:  
The video breaks up on the background image, as per attached screenshots.

Expected Results:  
proper background image, also included in screenshots.

The Walnut 1.8.50 and Nautipolis (newest version as well).  I contacted the creator of the theme and he says he was not able to reproduce.  I can add any additional FireBug traces if needed.
