Firefox modifies $_SESSION data where other browsers do not
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:28.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/28.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140314220517

Steps to reproduce:

Open Firefox and navigaet to http://www.imagefactory.it
This site runs wordpress version 3.8.1 and the plugin wp-photo-album-plus, of wich i am the developer.

Note the diagnostic text in red right between the banner text and the breadcrumb box:

[WPPA+ dbg msg: On line 528 in wppa-functions.php: $_SESSION['wppa_session']['search_root'] set to: 1 meaning: HOME]

Now click on the (airplane) image right below the text: AIRSHOW

The diagnostic changes into:

[WPPA+ dbg msg: On line 528 in wppa-functions.php: $_SESSION['wppa_session']['search_root'] set to: 4 meaning: AIRSHOW]

Now fill in the edit box at the right hand side of the screen, right below RECERCA FOTO, the text: eagle
Tick the checkbox: Ricerca solo nella sezione corrente, this will tell the server to search only in the album AIRSHOW ( the search root ) and its sub albums.
Press the button: Search.


Actual results:

The next screen shows the diagnostic text:

[WPPA+ dbg msg: On line 99 in wppa-breadcrumb.php: $_SESSION['wppa_session']['search_root'] = 11 meaning: NATURA]

and the search results of album 11: NATURA and its sub albums.

This is faulty, and happens only in Firefox, IE11, Opera, Safari and Chrome produce the right results:


Expected results:

[WPPA+ dbg msg: On line 99 in wppa-breadcrumb.php: $_SESSION['wppa_session']['search_root'] = 4 meaning: AIRSHOW]

and only one line of thumbnail images from the correct albums.

Unfortunately i can not attach 2 files, if you need the modified files for the red diagnostics, i canb mail them to you.
