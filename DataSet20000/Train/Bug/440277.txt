I downloaded the updated version twice for my Mac I have version: OSX 10.4.11. 
I did the following: 
1. clicked on the download-update version for mac, it downloaded perfectly
2. took the firefox icon to the applications folder
3. the notice came to replace the older version , which I said yes to. 
4. then the note from "Copy" came: "The operation cannot be completed because you do  not have sufficient privileges for some of the items." No mention on which items they were. 

However I have this comment twice after each time I tried to update: "The operation cannot be completed because you do not have sufficient privileges for some of the items." 
I have a password for any changes I make, this was not generated. 

I own this Mac, I am the administrator for this stand alone system. It is my personal and professional base for all things computing, including the Internet. I do have friends who use this computer on occasion, and have a separate branch for them; hence the password for all changes.
