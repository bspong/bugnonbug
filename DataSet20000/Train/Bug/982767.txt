No cache size disk usage label shown on Advanced/Network pane
When opening Network pane on preferences, on the Cache size section, just the "Clear Now" button is displayed. The label which provides information about the size of cache used by Firefox is not shown.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Open Preferences window
3. Select Advanced tab and Network pane

What occurs:

1. No label showing the ammount of disk space used by Firefox as its cache.
2. An exception is logged into Console:

[Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE) [nsICacheStorage.asyncVisitStorage]"  nsresult: "0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/preferences/advanced.js :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 303"  data: no]

No other warnings or errors are shown on the Console

Expected results:

A label indicating the amount of disk space used by Firefox as its cache storage should be shown.

Another bug I saw before filling this bug report was bug 606123, but it wasn't exactly the same. In fact, I wasn't unable to reproduce. So, I think this report doesn't duplicates any other one.
