I'm in need of a script that would place "add this site to favorites with tags" button on html pages

Hey there,

I'm sure you're all familiar with the "Add this site to your favorites" button that many websites have.

Now came along Firefox 3 with this awesome functionality of bookmarking sites along with tags.

I'm interested in placing such a "bookmark me" button on my webpage that would automatically add the page to the browser's favorites, but in addition, will bookmark it with a list of predefined tags -- so that when the user writes these tags in the location bar, my site would pop up as a possible suggestion.

For example, if I have a website that features a real estate business, I want to have a "Add me to Firefox 3's favorites" button on the page itself, that when pressing it, will automatically bookmark that page with the tags "real estate", "buildings", and "house".

Is that possible? Can you develop a script that does such a thing? And if the script can co-handle other browsers as well that is even better.

THANKS A LOT!
