Have always had to login exactly twice to Lloyds site before I get in - I assume
it is some sort of cookie problem, but today I cannot get in at all after
multiple attempts. The site wants:
1 Login/password
2 security data

After entering both sets of details, it was passing me back to beginning, and
repeating the process let me in, but now it doesn't at all - I assume the banks
had some 'fall back' code for when there were problems with cookies, and they
have now changed it ?

Anyhow, this is not just Lloyds, I have a similar problem at barclaycard.co.uk
and have had it as other sites too.

My cookies have the default setting of 'allow all' - cookies for other sites
seem to work fine

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Got to Lloyds.co.uk or barclard.co.uk
2. login
3. login fails

Actual Results:  
returned to login page

Expected Results:  
To login

Obviously without an account on the sites you will NOT be able to test this - as
this is a security issue with the banks, I would suggest that someone contacts
the banks and liases with their wensite teams to isolate the problems.

The logins work fine with NetScape "0.9.6 based on Firfox 1.0"
