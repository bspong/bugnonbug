Firebug breakpoint in onload javascript locks Firefox

When Firebug stops on a breakpoint in Javascript code fired in the window's onload event, Firefox and Firebug both lock up and become unresponsive.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Add a Javascript function to the window's onload event
2.Load the page once in Firefox
3.Open Firebug and place a breakpoint somewhere in the code
4.Reload the page in Firefox
Actual Results:  
Firebug does stop at the breakpoint, but the cursor is still a "wait" cursor and Firefox indicates that it is still waiting for the page to load.  I cannot access any menus, buttons, etc. in either Firefox or Firebug.  I don't believe there is a crash, just that Firefox is waiting for the onload code to finish executing and Firebug has stopped it.

Expected Results:  
I'd like to be able to step through the Javascript code fired in the window's onload event.

I haven't had a chance to create a test case, so I can't say for sure that this would happen with a simpler script, but I'm pretty sure it would.  I will try to throw something together and add it to the bug report.
