Dragging links to between tabs no longer opens links in new tab between those tabs
Up to Firefox 3.6, it was possible to duplicate the active tab by dragging the favicon from the Awesomebar to a space between tabs or to the end of the tabstrips. In Firefox 4, dragging to between tabs no longer has the desired effect (it will instead replace the contents of one of the tabs the mouse is between with the contents of the active tab). Dragging to the end of the tab bar still works, but the ability to duplicate a tab to a specific place on the tab bar is lost.

The same problem applies to dragging bookmarks from the Bookmarks toolbar, menu, or side panel to the tab bar, and more importantly; when dragging links from an open page to the tab bar. The blue arrow for creating a new tab only shows up when dragging to the very end of the tab bar, so a new tab can only be created with the wanted context at the end of the bar. I used this feature (especially the ability to drag links to the tab bar and open a new tab from them at that specific location) a lot, so its absence is quite annoying now.

Steps to reproduce (1):
1. Open 2 tabs.
2. In one tab, load a page that contains a link.
3. Drag the link to the tab bar, between the 2 existing tabs.

Steps to reproduce (2):
1. Open 2 tabs.
2. Load a page in one tab.
3. Drag the favicon from the location bar to the area between the 2 tabs.

Steps to reproduce (3):
1. Open 2 tabs.
2. Drag a bookmark from the Bookmarks menu or the Bookmarks Toolbar to the space between the 2 tabs.

Expected results:
A new tab is opened between the 2 existing tabs, containing the target of the link (1), a copy of the active page (2), or the target of a bookmark (3).

Actual results:
Rather than creating a new tab, one of the 2 tabs will be overwritten with the contents that should appear in the new tab.
