If I try to switch default browser from Nightly to Firefox, I unexpectedly end up with Edge as my default
STR:
 1. Install both Firefox Nightly & Firefox Release, on a Windows 10 machine.

 2. Set Firefox Nightly as your default browser, and then quit out of Nightly.

 3. Start Firefox Release, and use its UI to set it to be the default (either via the dialog it pops up at startup, or via its preferences UI).

ACTUAL RESULTS:
* Your default browser gets *RESET*, to Edge (the Microsoft default).
* Also, if you're lucky, you might see an explanatory Windows system-tray notification like this:
   An app caused a problem with your default browser,
   so the default has been reset to Edge.
(I forget the exact language. This showed up the first time I triggered this bug, but didn't show up on subsequent times.)

I've reproduced this reliably on two different machines, so it wasn't a one-off. Happens over and over.

This seems very concerning! I'm not sure if this is Microsoft getting up to some funny business, or if there's a legitimate Mozilla issue with Firefox & Nightly colliding on some sort of identifier and that confuses windows and makes it throw up its hands, or what... In any case, it seems like something we should address.  Otherwise we're likely to end up with users' default-browser-preferences getting stomped on, if they test multiple versions of Firefox.

I'm using latest Firefox Nightly (53) and release (50.1.0).  (On one machine where I tested this, both Nightly & Release are 64-bit. On the other, Nightly is 64-bit and release is 32-bit.  So, I suspect this reproduces regardless of architecture/build-target.)
