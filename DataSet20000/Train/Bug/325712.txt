Can't view gmail site after login with firefox 1.5.0.1 or for previous versions last 2 months
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

1) login to gmail - all fine
2) new page shows loading
3) doesn't display anything except done at the bottom
4) can view code, so presume it's a display issue.

If gmail site doesn't determine I need to login, steps 1 and 2 left out.
Similar to bug: 309175, and a fair amount of discussion in the forum.


This appeared all of a sudden, after using a version fine.  I reverted to 
the previous version 1.07(?) which had also worked fine - didn't anymore.  No version since has worked.  Works fine on other machines also running Windows 2000 our family owns.  So must be intermittant, but why does it continue on the same machines, while all the others are fine?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.type url:  https://mail.google.com/mail
2.login if it asks you to
3. next page looks like sample gif



Expected Results:  
expect to see my mailbox.

I wondered if it could be the personal setting I have for firefox.  I have javascript enabled, with the 3 top options selected in advanced: I clicked them all, but no change to the display issue with gmail site.
