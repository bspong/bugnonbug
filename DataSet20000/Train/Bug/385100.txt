Typically, this occurs with multiple tabs up [this is my usage pattern].  The crash seems to occur if I scroll during page load.  I am tempted to suggest that it seems to occur near the end of the page load, or just after.  I further sense that it may occur on a page that is fully loaded, while other tabs are loading in background following a middle-click.  It also seems to be more likely [a sense, again] if I am scrolling not-slowly.

I have greasemonkey, adblock and tab mix plus enabled, but variations of disabling don't seem to affect this bug.  I can reproduce the bug, generally, but can not tie it to specific pages.

Restarting Fox, or rebooting the machine does not reduce the severity of the rate of crashes.  This is an annoying problem.  I can not tie it to the most recent updates, nor can I exclude it.  Fox, generally, has periods of instability for me, that come and go.
