When a parameter or URL containing extended characters in its URL is entered the behaviour in the URL toolbar is inconsistent.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Access www.google.com
2. Make a request for an extended character (for example "!") The request to google is;
http://www.google.ie/search?hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=%21&btnG=Search&meta=
(Note the encoded "!" as %21)
3. Google automatically decodes the %21 as "!" as expected (the request to google contains the encoded value), but in the address bar the %21 has been replaced with "!":
http://www.google.ie/search?hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=!&btnG=Search&meta=
4. Next refresh the page or get focus on the address bar and click enter.
5. The request to google this time is not with the encoded value but with "!" instead.
http://www.google.ie/search?hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=!&btnG=Search&meta=
Actual Results:  
The address in the Address Bar is decoded when the request is sent, but then when the page is refreshed the decoded value is sent instead of the encoded value.

Expected Results:  
When an encoded character is included in the Address Bar pressing refresh should not decode the character and send the decoded character to the web server, the same character as originally entered should be used.

This occurs for both parameters and within the url path.
