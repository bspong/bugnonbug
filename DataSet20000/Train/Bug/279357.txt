Firefox does not display colored backgrounds
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Firefox has suddenly stopped displaying colored boxes on some web pages.  For
example, on weather.com, there should be an orange background behind the words:
Today  	 	Tonight  	 	Tomorrow
under the 36 hour forecast at
http://www.weather.com/weather/local/22201?lswe=22201&lwsa=WeatherLocalUndeclared.

Likewise, on mail.yahoo.com, firefox is not displaying any colored backgrounds
after I log in.  (It displays text, but no backgrounds.)  This behavior started
occuring on 1/22/2005, and occurs even with all extensions disabled.  Note: This
does not seem to occur on ever web page
(https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox displays correctly,
for example.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to
http://www.weather.com/weather/local/22201?lswe=22201&lwsa=WeatherLocalUndeclared
or log into mail.yahoo.com

2. Observe the background behind the text
3. For comparison, display in IE.

Actual Results:  
text is rendered on these web pages, as are images.  But colored boxes do not
display.

Expected Results:  
displayed colored backgrounds correctly.
