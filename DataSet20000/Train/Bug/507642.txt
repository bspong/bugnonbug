Links from external programs and .URL files won't open in Fx if Fx is already running. They generate a "Fx is already running" error (see screenshot). This happens when clicking on links in Outlook Express' e-mails, links to home pages in applications > About > application home page, links in Windows dialog boxes and .URL files.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a program of your choice while Fx is running. (e.g. WinRAR)
2. Go to the program's Help > About > Visit home page.
3. Notice the error message and the link not opening.

1. While Fx is running, open Outlook Express.
2. Open an e-mail with web links. Click on a link.
3. Notice the error message and the link not opening.

1. While Fx is running, click on a .URL file anywhere on your system.
2. Notice the error message and the link not opening.

Actual Results:  
Links from external programs and .URL files won't open in Fx if Fx is already running + error message.

Expected Results:  
Links from external programs and .URL files should open in Fx if Fx is already running. No error message.

Happens to me in Fx 3.5.0, 3.5.1, 3.5.2 and 3.6.a1pre. Didn't happen in 3.0.x.
