Originally occured with .MAFF functions, Firefox refused to save any file with a .maf and a .mhtml in the save as dialog window. On further investigation, 'save as' did not correctly link file with file folder contents for save as "web page complete". I had trouble isolating what actual extension was used when trying to save as complete web page, but I think it just doesn't give it one. Upon adding the .htm/.html extension to the filename, it was correctly linked by windows with its 'extra folder' (don't know how to describe it), but I do not know how many times I have erronoeusly saved complete web pages that wound up with no extentions. Also noted, about mozilla archive, fic was achieved by deleting 'extensions.ini' 'extensions.cache' and 'extensions.rdf' while Firefox was offline. Thank you for investigated this issue.
