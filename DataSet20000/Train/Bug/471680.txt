When firefox open the image it is totally dissordered like the puzzle
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4

When i click on the image to open it, the result looks like this: http://www.fileden.com/files/2007/10/23/1533834/stacykeibler243.jpg
This not happens every single time,but very,very often. It can be very anoying. But than i copy and paste that same image link in any other browser,it opens normaly. It's happening on every site thati download pictures,no mather of the content of the image. 
Like you can see I'm using firefox 3.0.4, because i tought that it is becausse of version 3.0.5,but it isn't. It's the same problem with 3.0.4. Earlier (before 3.0.5 update) it was perfectly ok. When I clicked on 1000 pictures it opened 1000 pictures without any problem, and I don't want to use other browser because firefox fits me the most!
The OS is XP SP2,and it is installed for a few months. The problem apeared about 2-3 weeks ago. Please help me, I am abnormaly downloading images in my life,so this is a qiute problem to me.
Thanks in advance! Happy holidays!
