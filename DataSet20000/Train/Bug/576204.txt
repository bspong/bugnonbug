viewing email @ yahoo certain messages have no content in the body but fine in IE
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.6) Gecko/20100625 Firefox/3.6.6 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

using Firefox 3.6.6 on XP SP3 viewing email @ yahoo certain messages have no content in the body, such as something from monster.com
this occurs with 99% of monster emails (and some others) when opening the email in a new tab via the middle click.
But sometimes using the left click (opening in the same tab) sometimes works but then fails.
Clearing all history and cookies sometimes solves the problem, but when it does it seems to be temporary.

Using IE all email viewing works properly.
This has been occurring for a few months now.
Does anyone have similar results and possible solutions.
Thanx for participating,
