Steps to reproduce:

working with different web pages. Usually it is the most voracious are https://tradingview.com/chart/(anychart)



Actual results:

After some time of working, the process firefox.exe,thread GetHandleVerifier+0x3b41 starts to load the processor's core 100%. According this, firefox  does not react to any actions almost, until I kill his process.

This prioblem, happens always , when i open many tabs after some critical amount of tabs usually. It does not depends on URL. BUT usually  it happens when  memory usage by firefox.exe[2copies] over 1.4Gb+0.8Gb. But not always! And i have usually over 1 Gb free memory in my taskmanager.
Windows xp sp3(yea i know it))   4gb Ram(3,5gb windows see) 
This _ukin shit happened with firefox 47,48,49,51,52!!!!!!!
I Have no viruses.
Im tired of killing ff process and relad my templates. 
This will be repeat when i reopen 4-5 tabs of tradingview charts and load  some tabs  of any other sites.  
And i'm sured, the reason is not in tradingview.. Cos  this happens on any voracious (on memory) sites. Fox works works works , then hangs on with 50% load! what does he counts??


Expected results:

Anyone can to rewrite the GETHANDLEVERIFIER FUNCTION  to work correctly in win xp??? without while-true!!!
