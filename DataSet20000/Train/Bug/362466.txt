i've been using ff for a while i finally upgraded to 1.5 and having problems with games on pogo.com [this is where i noticed it started but...].  

selecting game will open game lobby window then selecting table opens window options and play button which would sometimes freeze when i click play button game table opens and alot of the times i can't type in chat box and that frame won't work.  things got worse where i couldnt click start game either.

i clear cache [all internet and java]
i've updated the java to current version and now have lost sound!
i've created a new profile
i've rebooted a few times

i started checking the java console in the tools menu and there are tons of errors and they even start with home page.  now after following instructions FF seems to get worse.

even have problem when i try to download/install new add-ons its always telling me downloads disabled and they are not.  but i think this issue has to be reported separately.

i'm lost, i'm stuck and dayuuuum i can't find any answers tho there are others with javascript errors and on same sites.  Note: i know javascript is different than java but?? what do i do?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start windows
2.start firefox
2b.open java console see errors [see below]
3.go to pogo.com and try a game [my issues are worse when playing High Stakes Pool]
4.open java console from tools menu in firefox

Actual Results:  
these are results from opening firefox [not yet at pogo.com]and there are multiple entries for some most [1. there are 12entries same error]
