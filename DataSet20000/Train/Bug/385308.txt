when having many windows and tabs open in firefox the tab feature freezes, the url at the top freezes also and it shows the previous url that was there before the freeze occurred, tabs cannot be changed until you close 10 or more tabs and it becomes active again, it feels like its almost too much for it too handle when having 30 or more tabs open at the same time and it freezes, even though browsing is ok and everything works you cannot switch back and forth between different pages in your tabs, when having mouse over the tabs they blink but when clicking on them nothing happens, you cannot close them either untill you start closing one by one all the tabs from the right. I have installed many firefox updates since i noticed this bug but none of them fixed this issue so i decided to report it myself, this only happens when having 20+ or more tabs open at the same time, sometimes more windows with more tabs in them causes that also, its very annoying because I'm a student and i need a lot of tabs when i work on different images and notes and i constantly have to close them and reopen again. Sometimes the only way to fix that is to terminate the browser and reopen everything again. Thanks a lot for your time and i hope this feature gets fixed asap. Gera
