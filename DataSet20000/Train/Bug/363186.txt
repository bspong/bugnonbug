Clicking both the left and right mouse buttons at the same time leaves the right-click menu open (stranded).  Additionally, if you go back to the bookmarks page, the menu will stay under the bookmarks menu even after right-clicking on a new bookmark.  The menu will go away when you right-click on a bookmark and then left-click anywhere.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. left-click the bookmark menu.
2. move the mouse over a bookmark.
3. click both the left and right mouse buttons at the same time.

Actual Results:  
The page selected loads, but the bookmark right-click menu appears and stays up.  You can even select links on the page or right-click on the page or a link on the page and the bookmark right-click pop-up will remain.

Expected Results:  
The bookmark right-click menu would disappear.

I'm using Gnome 2.14.2 on Gentoo Linux running a binary installation of Firefox 2.0.  This is a very low priority bug.
