Hi. To give you the full history, FF 3.5 was crashing repeatedly and it seemed as though it had more to do specifically with flash sites at the time. So, I uninstalled FF3.5 completely through Synaptic, and installed FF2. Then I had the same problems with FF2, so I did a bit more research, and found a solution. I uninstalled FF2 completely via Synaptic again, re-installed FF3.5b, and followed the steps as described here: http://wvarner.blogspot.com/2008/05/firefox-crashing-on-youtube-in-ubuntu.html.

For a while, meaning, a few hours of online activity, this did the trick or at least greatly reduced the number and frequency of crashes. But the crashes do continue, and as of today, have gotten to be much too frequent. Sometimes, I don't beleive I even have a page open that is using flash in my browser, and it will still crash. Although I always have about 4 or more tabbed pages open. 

Help please. 

Thanks, 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Insall 3.5 in Synaptic, install Foxmarks plugin, flash plugin, completely uninstall 3.5 via Synaptic, install FF2, completely uninstall FF2, install 3.5b again.  
2. if necessary (i don't remember) re-install Flash plugin. 
3. follow steps here: http://wvarner.blogspot.com/2008/05/firefox-crashing-on-youtube-in-ubuntu.html
4. reload FF3.5B and play around with sites. Open 4 tabs in one window, and surf around,  alternating between having some flash sites in your browser tabbed window(s), and no flash enabled sites in your browser tabbed window(s).
Actual Results:  
Would crash silently, sometimes mutiple times in a row, (always asking me to reload the pages I had open before the crash, of course, to which I would always say yes). 

Expected Results:  
It should be stable and not crash, from what I was led to believe, esp. if I am not at any web pages that use flash.
