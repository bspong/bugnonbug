Shift-clicking the back button or middle-clicking it with browser.tabs.opentabfor.middleclick=false flashes the tabbar

Click actions on the back and forward buttons that will result in a new window, when the tabbar is auto-hidden because there is only one tab, briefly show the tab=bar with a single tab.  Then the tab-bar disappears again and a new window opens.  This behaviour was introduced by the fix for bug 609700.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set browser.tabs.autohide true (and optionally set browser.tabs.opentabfor.middleclick false)
2. Open a window containing a single tab so that the tabbar auto-hides
3. Browse from one page to another to activate the back button
4. Shift-click the back button (or middle click if browser.tabs.opentabfor.middleclick is false)
Actual Results:  
The tab-bar briefly flashes a single tab before a new window appears, then the tab-bar is gone again.

Expected Results:  
The new window should appear without showing the tab-bar, as happens with shift-clicks and middle-clicks on links and other elements.  At no point is there more than one tab in any window and browser.tabs.autohide is true.

A quick loook at the patch for the fix to bug 609700 suggests that the initial click opens a new tab which causes the tab-bar to appear, then the tab is cloned out to a new window which causes it to disappear again.
