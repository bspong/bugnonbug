When you enter letters in the search box, suggestions start to appear. But, after you modify the Navigation bar (right-click => Customize), the suggestions no longer appear (until you restart FF).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start FF, start typing letters in search box (suggestions appear)
2. right click on Navigation bar (=> Customize)
3. click "done" (no need to make any real changes to the Bar)
4. start typing letters (the same ones) in search box => no suggestions appear (until you restart)
Actual Results:  
Suggestions no longer appeared.

Expected Results:  
Suggestions should have appeared.

I checked with a pristine profile (without any extension), this behaviour is the same.

Note however, that I managed _once_ to see the suggestions after I performed those steps. So it does not seem 100% reproducible. It still occured in all my other tests.

Restarting the browser cured the problem everytime. So this problem is just an annoyance.
