Firefox occasionally crashes on bandwidthplace.com, which uses HTML5
The crash is not 100% reproducible.
A user posted on the Mozilla Israel's community (http://community.mozilla.org.il/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=12493) and complained that Firefox is slow and crashes lately on Firefox 47.0.1.
I suggested him to create a new profile and check if the issues persist, and after resetting Firefox he said that there's an improvement with the browser's performance, but it's still crashing while speedtesting on http://www.bandwidthplace.com/.
His crash reports are all the same, all claiming to be OOM crashs, while it seems they're not:

I've tried speedtesting my internet connection with that website, and I also got a very similar crash:

After Firefox crashes I tried running it again twice, without having any crashes this time.

Note that the site uses HTML5 for the test.
