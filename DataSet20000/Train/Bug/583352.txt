Create Filter button stops working in Gmail after one use.  See steps to reproduce.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into Gmail using the "older" UI.  (https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=1)
2. Verify that you're using the older UI.  If so then in the top-right corner of the screen you should see the link "Newer Version".
3. To the right of the "Search the Web" button in the top-center of the screen there should be a link "Create Filter".  Click it.
4. Enter an email address in the "From" text box.
5. Click the "Next Step" button.
6. Check "Skip the Inbox".
7. Check "Apply the Label" and choose a label.
8. Check "Also apply to {number} conversations below".
9. Click the "Create Filter" button. (Filter should be created).
10. Click on "Inbox" to go back to the main view.

When these steps are repeated a second time step #9 should fail.  Nothing happens when the user clicks on the "Create Filter" button.
Actual Results:  
The first time everything works.  The second time the "Create Filter" button stops working.

Expected Results:  
"Create Filter" button should actually create the filter instead of doing nothing.
