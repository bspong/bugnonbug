Everything "stacking up" after opening new tab

I tried opening a new tab and it opened, it seemed to have something wrong with it cause the actual tab looked the size of an app tab yet it still said "new tab" and had the X. I clicked on the tab then every single plane in Firefox the would update in some sort of way would stack up new text over the old. If i were to go to a new site on a tab it would overlap what has changed (in this case it would probably over lap the word "Google" and "Enter a Bug"). I then Print Screened this and tried to upload it, once I clicked "Browse" of the uploading site, not only did Firefox crash but I got a Blue screen of Death.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a new tab
2. If it a appear not normal sized, and yet the size of an app tab then click it.
Actual Results:  
It opened a tab like normal.

Expected Results:  
The tab being the size of an app tab yet the words "New tab" would still be there and an X where it would be if it were a normal sized tab.

There seems to be no way to recreate this, I opened a new tab and it seemed to be the size of an app tab, I clicked it, then the bug happened.
