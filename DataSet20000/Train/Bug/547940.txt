SSL disabled and passwords lost after upgrade to 3.6
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; fr; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I upgraded from Firefox 3.5.8 to 3.6 on a Windows Vista system. After this upgrade, SSL became disabled (Error code: ssl_error_ssl_disabled) and all my passwords "disappeared".

Everything else worked. All cookies, history and the reset were there. Only the security-related features were disabled.

After reading several posts, I tried to remove cert8.db without success.

I uninstalled 3.6 and reinstalled 3.5.8 and everything was back. My passwords were available again.

The problem has also been reported at http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/forum/1/593235. I am the one who replied. Someone (not me!) marked my reply as "problem solved" but this was not a solution, just a hint: "revert to previous version".

Note the difference between to two 3.5.8 -> 3.6 upgrades I made: one on a system where my username contains a non-ASCII character (French e acute) and one on a system where my username contains only ASCII characters. The problem was seen only on the system with non-ASCII characters in the username.

But I have no evidence that the "e acute" in the user name is the culprit, this is just a clue.

After upgrade, I tried to _create_ a new account with a "e acute" in the user name but this account did not have the problem. I have seen the SSL & passwords error only on one _existing_ account.
