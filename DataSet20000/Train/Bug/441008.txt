4 crashes in one day using different URLs---very slow browser
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

Firefox crashed 4 times on 6-21-2008 using different URLs.  When using restore it would crash again (lost all my data and had to completely restart URLs).

Secondly, Firefox 3 is devilishly slow, slow, slow.  It takes forever for a URL to come on screen (I use dial up-but previous version of Firefox was very fast in comparison to Firefox 3)

Yes I checked for viruses and spyware.  Yes, I defraged my computer after first Firefox crash and when going back to Firefox 3 I still got crashes and very slow browsing experience.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Went back to same URL where crash occurred.
2.Rebooted computer and went to same URL where crash occurred.
3.Crashes occurred on several different URLs and could not reproduce the crash they come randomly.


Expected Results:  
At first I tried to resolve if it was my computer causing the problem, which turned out to not be the case.  The problem occurred randomly on different URLs and could not be reproduced.  When Firefox tried to restore session it would crash again which means in fact, of the four crashes I had repeated crashes when trying to restore a session.

Firefox 3 is not an improvement in my opinion.  In fact I am thinking of going back to download the previous edition.  At least I will get more speed from the previous edition and less crashes as well as other problems that Firefox 3 is causing.
