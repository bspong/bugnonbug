Firefox v3.5b1-4 Not Opening At All

I always know that whatever computer I use, Firefox used to take a lot of time to open. This was a great bug. Also, when not opening, the memory usage by 'firefox.exe' was static at one number. This happened usually with the 3.0.x versions. It is highly persistent in 3.0.10. So, I thought of giving 3.5 a try. But, it never starts at all. Whenever I start it, even after waiting for more than a couple of minutes, the memory usage is changing, but it doesn't start. A few times, it check the add-on compatibility. Is this because the Beta version is installed separately and the original version is still there? I hope it is fixed in the stable version. I can't wait to see how this fox looks like.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install a fresh copy of Firefox v3.5 any Beta.
2. Don't uninstall the old version (in my case v3.1.10)
3. Start the Beta. It is the same even in Safe Mode. So not add-on is causing it.
Actual Results:  
The browser won't start, the memory usage by the process is jumping up and down as usual, but it doesn't open at all. The Add-On Compatibility Checker starts sometimes, but nothing after that.

Expected Results:  
The app should have started normally, after checking the compatibility of add-ons.

This is a new copy of Firefox, and I have not uninstalled the old version. The Beta doesn't replace the old version. 

I am using a 1.6 GHz 512 MB RAM machine running Windows XP Home Edition SP2 machine, but this problem is persistent on a Windows Vista system too, running on a dual core 1.9 GHz processor and 2 GB of RAM. But this has been tested on only Beta 1-2.
