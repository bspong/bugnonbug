New firefox release not displaying content properly.

Since the recent 2.0.0.5 release, I've noticed that certain pages do not display properly or in some cases are missing content.  As one would assume, these pages are most likely the very same ones that are best viewed with IE and not designed to work with firefox.  I have tried loading an identical page in both.  The IE display is proper, the firefox is not.  One example is when I log into my Facebook account.  The tabs at the profile page simply do not show up in firefox.  However, if I hover my mouse of where they should appear, they do.

The second thing I noticed is that on certain pages where you have the option of clicking a link that simply opens a small non-resize able window such as a "help" window, does not display the content in full.  By that, I mean if it is simply a few paragraphs of text (which is usually the case), you can only read about the first 4 or 5 words of each line because the rest of the text runs beyond the border of the window and there is no scroll bar or any other option to view the content in whole.

I don't exactly mind using my IE View extension, but a problem is a problem worth reporting.
