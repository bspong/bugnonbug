chillspot login no longer vissible
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.5; Linux) KHTML/3.5.2 (like Gecko) Kubuntu 6.06 Dapper
Build Identifier: 

have been using firefox1.5 to browse on a system that controls internet access using chillispot.
upgraded to firefox2.0 and found no chillispot login (using kubuntu dapper)
probably also had a problem on windows machine that not previously used for internet - installed firefox 2.0 and could not get a chillispot login (can't confirm this as don't have physical access to this machine at the moment.
Anyway had been using ff2.0 with no problems on system that does not use chillspot.
tried yesterday to login to chillispot and got no login page
tried the acual url of login page (rather than just trying to browse any page) - nothing
deleted /usr/lib/firefox and replaced with old version - problem solved
tried to be clever and see if problem reproducable by deleting /usr/lib/firefox and replacing with the new version - now have a totally broken browser which I am trying to fix now! oops!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.enter a url
2.

Actual Results:  
briefly see browser try to access proxy address (as it should)
3.see whatever page was vissible before entering url rather than login page

Expected Results:  
should see the chillispot login page which after entering password and userid should take you to default home page
