Usage memory of Firefox grows quickly and slows Firefox when using multiple tabs for IBM Requirements Manager
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:21.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/21.0 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:


When I use IBM Requirements Manager with Firefox v21, memory usage grows quickly as I open new tabs and slows Firefox.

How to reproduce :
1. Here are manual operation with timestamp and memory usage trace (in Kb)
08:42   Open Firefox v21 on WinXP SP3 4Go RAM with 3 tabs (webmail Google and 2 calendars)   235 608   
08:45   Open a 4th tab to IBM Rational Requirements Manager (v4.0.2)  server  278 720   
08:48   Click on "Display modules"   307 672  
  08:48   Open 2 new tabs on the woking module (tabA and tabB)   400 907   
08:51   Nothing special, I use RM to find artefact and make tracability with tabA and tabB   510 010   
08:53   on tabA, display a shared view with the "Todo stuff"   479 508   
08:53   on tabA, find an artefact to perform
08:53   on tabB, find the previous artefact, I like have some context informations to do tracability, and set answers artefarcts  
09:27   open 2 new tabs to have 2 others module for answers  500 212   
09:28   8 tabs are opened, firefox is slow  675 904  
09:50   open and close a few tabs (2 ou 3, no more) to retrieve answering artefact and return with only 8 artefacts 991 268
11:20  open a new tab to fill this issue 1 247 689, firefox is very slow

Twos weeks ago, I used the Firefox cache with default configuration for cache properties. Memory usage grows slowly but Firefox was slowly quicker.
Last week, to improve performance, I use a proxy on a distant server to cache data and I don't use Firefox cache. Now memory usage grows quickly but Firefox is faster.
How to improve correctly firefox to have a fluent use with a correct memory usage ?


Actual results:

During a working day, Firefox comes slowly and his memory usage reaches 1,5 Gb and it's too slow to be use normally.
As far as I know, the workaround is to restart Firefox.



Expected results:

Fluent use with IBM Requirements Manager with less than 10 tabs.
