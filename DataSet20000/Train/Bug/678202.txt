Delay in Opening Firefox Omni.Jar linked
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build ID: 20110615151330

Steps to reproduce:

When opening Firefox - have done this a few times and using ProcMon from System Internals on Windows 7 x64 Sp1 have been seeing what is delaying the start up of Firefox




Actual results:

There is a call to HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Avalon.Graphics key

This took place at 16.04.25.4204563 and the response from the OS was key not found

The next call was at 16.04.26.904464 with the creation so ProcMon reports it of omni.jar
with a sucessful read of the file

16:04:26.9046624	firefox.exe	884	CloseFile	C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\omni.jar	SUCCESS	


A few actions later again there was a delay waiting for omni.jar of over 3 seconds

16:04:27.9064668	firefox.exe	884	LockFile	F:\Firefox Profiles\Nigel\places.sqlite-shm	SUCCESS	Exclusive: False, Offset: 124, Length: 1, Fail Immediately: True

16:04:30.3778394	firefox.exe	884	CreateFile	C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\omni.jar	SUCCESS	Desired Access: Read Attributes, Disposition: Open, Options: Open Reparse Point, Attributes: n/a, ShareMode: Read, Write, Delete, AllocationSize: n/a, OpenResult: Opened



Expected results:

Delayed processing seems to be related to omni.jar - two calls prior to the call to omni.jar are responsible for most of the waits between actions
