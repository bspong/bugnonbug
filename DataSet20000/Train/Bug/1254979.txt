Add a TEXT-BOX to Firefox's Customize: Additional Tools and Features section
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:44.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/44.0
Build ID: 20160209234642

Steps to reproduce:

I often used the old Search-Bar as a static text holder for viewing text across tabs and parts of a page. Since implementation of the new Search-Bar, typing in the new Search-Bar causes automatic opening of a dropdown-window filled with search engine icons. This dropdown often covers text I'm transcribing and generally is a distraction and cumbersome to deal with.


Actual results:

I reported Bug 1251264 to resolve the issue I'm having with the new Search-Bar, but it was marked WONTFIX. Would it be a simple task for Mozilla to add a TEXT-BOX (that looks something like the Search-Bar) to the Customize: Additional Tools and Features section of Firefox? 


Expected results:

Can Mozilla be persuaded to create a TEXT-BOX that users can put on their icon-bar/url-bar? The TEXT-BOX would be located under the Customize: Additional Tools and Features section. Users could drag it onto the url-bar.

The TEXT-BOX function would be simply an empty field (much like the old search-bar) where nothing "happens" when text is entered into the field. The TEXT-BOX would serve as a static holder of text that can be used to take notes with, display text from one part of a page when viewing another, or copying text from one tab and wanting to view that text when on a different tab. I would like to be able to access it with a keyboard shortcut and have the text automatically get highlighted, like happens with CTRL+J or CTRL+K with the Search-Bar.

This would be a very useful feature to have. I would remove the Search-Bar and replace it with this "inactive" TEXT-BOX.

Thank you kindly for any consideration you can give this.
