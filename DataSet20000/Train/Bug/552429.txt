Downloading long streamed files fails

This relates to the extension "Downloadhelper" all versions, and all versions of Firefox on x86 and AMD64 on both Linux and Windows, but the Downloadhelper developer does not believe it is related to his extension.

Situation: I try to download streaming mp3 files from www.last.fm using the Downloadhelper extension.  This works great as long as the files are under ~22 minutes in length.  When you engage Downloadhelper to download a streamed mp3, the Firefox Downloads window pops up and below the progress bar the info line just says "starting..." until the file finishes streaming.  For <22 minute songs, it then completes successfully and the info line says x.x MB --last.fm. >22 minute songs, it fails to download and the info line says 0 bytes --last.fm.

I'm not a programmer, but my guess is that Downloadhelper is caching the streamed song and Firefox is waiting and then times out, assuming something wrong because of still being in the "starting..." status for too long.

I think the length before timeout should be extended because of the Downloadhelper usage.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Downloadhelper addon. Know/learn how to use it.
2. If you are in a country where Last.fm allows playing certain full tracks, try this one that's over 22 minutes: http://www.last.fm/music/Big+Big+Train/_/The+Underfall+Yard
3.  Watch the Downloads window after the 20 minute mark.
Actual Results:  
Download "completes" with "0 bytes".

Expected Results:  
If Firefox really is the problem by timing out, I assume the developers will know if so or if not, and can either change the time-out period, or make this an advanced option for end users.
