Will not submit the password form data correctly if you use the "enter" or "return" key.

Firefox will not submit the password data to login if you hit the "enter" or "return" key while still in the password text box field. It submits the form however but will not submit a password to login with.

However, if you are in the username box it will work correctly. Also the button does work.

Another thing, the style is a widely used VB style so it's there are a lot more sites affected than just one. (to give you an idea > http://www.google.com/search?q=%22vBulletin%20Skin%20developed%20by:%20vBStyles.com%22)

Btw, this doesn't occur in Camino, only FF on all platforms, include Minefield.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://happylittlethings.com
2. On the upper-right hand side enter the login details. Username: FFBUGTEAM password: firefox101106
3. Make sure the password input field is select and hit enter. < -- this is where you will encounter the bug
4. Go back
5. Now instead select the username input field and hit enter OR hit the go button.

Actual Results:  
You will get an invalid password page because the password wouldn't have actually been sent correctly by the browser.

Expected Results:  
It should send the password correctly and redirect you back to the home page with you being logging in.

There is an easy work around. However, it's not ideal since most users don't know that the bug exists and assume it's their fault (eg. they forgot their passwords).
