Whenever I open any website, it gives me "firefox.exe - Application Error"

Whenever I try to open any website or any local server running on my machine, it gives me "firefox.exe - Application Error". The error description is as following. 

'The instruction at "0x10002258" referenced memory at "0x00000000". The memory could not be "read".

Click on OK to terminate the program
Click on CANCEL to debug the program'

Like wise it shows me a pop up box. As I click on any of the button, firefox gets crashed and closed. 

Initially I was using newer version of firefox on my machine, it was working fine, on the same operating system. Then abruptly at one morning, when I started it, it acted like I shown you. I tried for reinstalling, even uninstalled and installed again, but the problem persisted. Then I even tried for the older version of firefox, still the problem remains the same. Please do the needful.
