Go to http://www.sciencenews.org/ and click on the subscriber login/sign in
button (on the left side of the page) or simply go to the URL filed with this bug.

The page seems to load OK - fields and images rendered correctly.  But before
the page becomes usable, the program freezes.  The throbber stops animating (and
doesn't return to its idle state).  The mouse pointer is the arrow/hourglass
"working in background" shape.  The status bar says "Transferring data from
www.kable.com".  The program does not redraw itself if covered/exposed.  The
Windows task manager shows high CPU usage (varying between 75 and 95%).

Clicking the close box brings up the Windows "This program is not responding"
dialog, where I can force it to quit.

A proxy server is used to access the internet.  A proxy-autoconfig script is used.

The only installed extension is the Googlebar (version 0.9.0.27).  Uninstalling
it does not change the problem.

Installed plugins are Macromedia Shockwave for Director (10.0), Macromedia
Authorware Web Player, Macromedia Shockwave Flash 7.0r19, Sun Java 1.4.1_02,
Adobe Acrobat Reader 6.00, Apple QuickTime 6.5.1, Windows Media Player,
Microsoft DRM.

This does not happen with Mozilla 1.7, using the same plugins.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the above URL.
Actual Results:  
The browser hangs immediately after the page renders.  I have to force-quit it
from Windows and restart it.

Expected Results:  
I should get a web-form with a login screen.
