Firefox should update saved session state when a window closes

Firefox regularly fails trying to restore previous sessions for me (which is covered in another bug). Recently the following sequence occurred:

Starting with two windows with multiple tabs, I closed the tabs in one browser window, closed that window, closed the tabs in a second browser window, closed the second browser window, then closed two other programs and then shut down my computer. (Running Ubuntu 10.10.) My system was not busy -- no programs were consuming any significant amount of CPU and all the programs fit in memory. I didn't measure the time between closing the last Minefield window and clicking the "shut down" button on the "really shut down" prompt but it was several seconds.

When I restarted the computer and restarted Firefox I was greeted with:
   This is embarrassing... can't restore...
      Window 1
        about:blank
      Window 2
        about:blank

Something triggered Firefox to think it needed to restore the session. But once that happened, it restored a state that never existed -- I never had two windows opened with blank tabs.

Once first window closed with only a blank tab (and Firefox was still working), the session save/restore code should have realized there was nothing to restore from the closed window and updated the saved state to only contain information about the one window.

Reproducible: Didn't try
