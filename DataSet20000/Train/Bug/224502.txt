onclick incorrectly adds chrome:// to a location.href javascript request
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7

In the html of a webpage if you reference a url using &lt;a href="#"
onclick="location.href='anotherurl.html'" /&gt; firebird will either throw a
security exception within the javascript console, or just do nothing.  And there
are other times when it will work fine, nothing in the page changes.

If one puts javascript:location.href='anotherpage.html' in the href attribute,
all works fine.  Or if you reference the url absolutely with protocol 
http://domain.com/anotherpage.html  it works fine

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create simple HTML page with a href="#"
onclick="location.href='anotherpage.html'"
2. Launch the page with the javascript console open
3. Click on the link, and notice the apparent error

Actual Results:  
Firebird shows a Security Exception stating that page X cannot reference
chrome://anotherpage.html

Expected Results:  
Mozilla should have forwarded to that page, it seems to be incorrectly
referencing the chrome:// url for pages that don't have the protocol attached.
