The content and the images in the Accordion drops/overflows and mess up the whole layout. I have checked in Internet Explorer & Chrome  and there is no problem at all. 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clear Browser Cache
2. Type magnetic-training.com (without www - not sure if it happens with www also)
3. Click on "About us" link, then click "Home" link, then click "Credentials" link, if u r lucky enough then u'll get the float drop on Credentials Page's Accordion else repeat from Step 1.
Actual Results:  
The float drops from Credentials Page's Accordion.

Expected Results:  
It should have hold the floats properly. Here is a image for your reference: http://www.magnetic-training.com/magnetic-unexpected.jpg

It is not happening always so I believe it is not a programing error. When it happens I refresh the page and everything goes to normal. 

This is happening with all the pages having Accordion.

Please suggest what is the reason for this strange behavior of Firefox.
