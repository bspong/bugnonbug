if the autocomplete text is displayed under a text-input, a drop-down menu cannot be selected. If you click on it while autocompletion is displayed, the autocompletion-area below the input-field flickers once. One has to close the autocompletion before the drop-down can be selected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a form containing a drop-down with some items and a text-input field
2. enter something to the text-input and submit the form
3. enter something to the text-input to activate autocompletion
4. click on the drop-down
Actual Results:  
autocompletion-area flickers once, drop-down not selectable

Expected Results:  
autocompletion-area should close and the drop-down should get selected and opened

I noticed it on ogame universum 40-pages, works on ogame.de login-box
On some pages, the above does not work and everything is okay, maybe this happens only if the boxes are heavily styles with css or have some javascript.

On the ogame.de-sites, there is the plugin Foxgame, that cannot change the fields on the login-page due to a change in the login-page-design. In ogame itself, there's a greasemonkey-javascript called "ogame-script" version 1.3. I checked the source and did not find any point where the relevant form-elements are affected.
