When I drag a url to the Bookmarks menu, the menu fails to open. If I release the mouse, the Bookmarks menu is then opened and the link is added. When I go to move the link to a different spot, the line indicating where the link is to be dropped is higher up on the menu. Dropping results in link being dropped where line is.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Do one of the following:
   a. Drag url from address bar to Bookmarks menu
   b. Drag link from webpage to Bookmarks menu
2. Drop url or link (menu opens)
3. Go down to newly created bookmark
4. Attempt to move it
5. Underline will appear several entries up
6. If drop is over new bookmark bookmarks stays put, if drop is on menu at other point, bookmark moves to underlined location.

Actual Results:  
If drop is over new bookmark bookmarks stays put, if drop is on menu at other point, bookmark moves to underlined location.


Expected Results:  
Hovering a bookmarkable object over bookmark menu causes bookmark menu to open. Movement of mouse is then able to place the bookmarkable object in the right place in bookmark menu heirarchy, at which point one would drop it. Underline follows mouse.

When dragging bookmark already in Bookmarks menu, the Bookmarks menu up and down arrows do not work. If I use the up and down arrows and then drag a bookmark the same displacement of the line occurs.
