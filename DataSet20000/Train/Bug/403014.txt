If a file is downloaded through the standard dialogue or dragged onto a folder from a web page, Firefox will add the '+I' bit to it that tells Windows not to index that file. This is a major issue for Vista users, as it prevents the file from appearing in instant searches.

Files downloaded through the "Save As..." context menu item do NOT suffer from this issue.

(I'm not sure if this is major or not. Instant search is undoubtedly a major thing being broken, but it's not itself a component of Fx!)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download a file from the standard file download dialogue, or by dragging it from a page to a folder.
2. Run ATTRIB on it from the command line, or check it's advanced attribute properties from the Properties context item.

Actual Results:  
The file was set to be ignored by Windows' indexer.

Expected Results:  
The file should not have been set to be ignored by Windows' indexer. It should not have added the +I attribute.
