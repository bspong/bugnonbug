After I log in to a site using one of the accounts in "Saved Passwords" window without typing the full username and password, that account automatically logs out after a click on a link associated with the site, and all the saved passwords associated with the site are deleted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure first that four or more passwords are saved for the site.
2. Log in to a site described in the "Saved Passwords" window with an account described in the same window, but without typing the full log in details.
3. Click on a link within the site itself, or two, or more.
Actual Results:  
The account logs out, and all the saved passwords for the site are deleted.

Expected Results:  
Firefox must preserve the saved passwords for the site after a log in into that site using one of the saved passwords and the associated username.
