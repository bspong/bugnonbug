after upgrading to firefox 2.0 none of the users are able to use their bookmarks anymore, they all appear in the menu and sidebar, but when you click on them nothing happens


the windows clients are all windows xp pro, and it is an active directory environment which uses roaming profiles, the application information/profile is stored on the server and loaded up everytime a user logs in, if i uninstall and go back to version 1.5 everything is fine, if i remove v1.5 and do a clean install of v2 and import the bookmarks the problem keeps on happening

if we forget the bookmarks and start from scratch with them the problem comes back after the program is restarted

every attempt to install v2 sees the problem occour over and over again

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install v2
2. open bookmarks and the list is there
3. click on the bookmark and nothing happens
Actual Results:  
the bookmarks do not work

Expected Results:  
i expect to be taken to the link selected in the bookmark menu or sidebar

we can't upgrade to v2 until it is resolved
