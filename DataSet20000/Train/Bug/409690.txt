When the bookmark toolbar is full and i add a bookmark at the end (in the space between the last bookmark and the chevron), the added bookmark appears at the end of the dropdown menu/list that appears when clicking on the chevron. In preceding versions it was added at the top (click on chevron, it was the very first item)
Note that this affect the bookmarks appearing in the toolbar itself: if you have the firefox window not maximized (at least non expanded at max horizontally) and add a bookmark like described, when expanding the window the recently added bookmark will not appear in the toolbar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Place several bookmarks in the toolbar so it is filled and there are some items on the dropdown menu/list triggered by the chevron too
2.Reduce windows dimension so the horizontal size will be inferior of the screen size by a good margin (at least > of the size of the bookmark)
3.Drag and drop a link at the end of the toolbar just before the chevron
Actual Results:  
The added bookmark appears at the end of the dropdown menu/list.
Expanding firefox windows show at the end of the bookmarks toolbar older/unrelated bookmark.

Expected Results:  
The added bookmark should appear at the top of the dropdown menu/list.
Expanding firefox windows should show at the end of the bookmarks toolbar the bookmark just added.
