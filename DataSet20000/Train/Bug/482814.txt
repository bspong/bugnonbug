Flash controls do not work properly on many pages in the latest minefield, for example on pandora.com, I can not interact with the site at all, which is entirely controlled through flash.  Another page where this fails is http://i.gizmodo.com/5168295/diy-pistol-shoots-out-blocks-so-you-can-win-at-jenga-every-time?autoplay=true

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to www.pandora.com (preferably with an already established user profile)
2.  A song starts playing
3.  Can't pause the song, change channels, or interact with Pandora in any way.

This also affects many flash based video players.  For example, the flash based player at:

http://i.gizmodo.com/5168295/diy-pistol-shoots-out-blocks-so-you-can-win-at-jenga-every-time?autoplay=true

can not be paused, and no controls work.
Actual Results:  
Many flash based sites play, but no controls work in the latest minefied

Expected Results:  
controls on flash sites should work

Note: although I have adblock plus installed, I have tried disabling the plugin and get the same result.
