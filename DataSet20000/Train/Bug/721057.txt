keypress/keyboard event handling in Firefox Nightly
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:9.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/9.0.1
Build ID: 20111220165912

Steps to reproduce:

I went to http://idibidiart.com On-Screen Twitter Unicode Keyboard and I typed on the on-screen keyboard


Actual results:

While it works in the latest official version of Firefox (9.x) it does not work at all in the Nightly versions. 




Expected results:

Pressing any of the keys on screen should insert the corresponding character into the editor box but it fails on Nightly. It works on all other versions of Firefox.

I'm using the normal document.createEvent to send a keypress event to the focused textarea (the editor) and I'd be happy to share the code but basically I do that consistently whether the user presses a key on their keyboard or on the on-screen keyboard. Neither method works in the Nightly version of Firefox.

It could also be that keyup is now firing before keypress and keydown which would explain it. Has the order in which keyboard events fire change?

Please try the app and confirm for yourself that it doesn't work on Nightly but works on all other versions of Firefox (on Mac and Windows only, no Linux support yet due to how keyboard events differ on Linux and other issues) 

Thanks for your help.
