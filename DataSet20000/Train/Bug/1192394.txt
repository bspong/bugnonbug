thumbnail tile may remain unchanged in a single newtab page after thumbnail file updates
I can reliably reproduce a newtab page showing an old thumbnail after
forcing the thumbnail to refresh and seeing the new thumbnail on all other newtab pages.

This happens both with and without the bug #1180715 fix.

STR:

Prepare by:

* Create a new profile
* Make sure browser.newtab.preload is still the default true
* Browse around a little to create at least one frecent site
* Find the file that stores the site thumbnail, e.g. with PageThumbsStorage.getFilePathForURL
* Make sure that this file is at least two days old and showing a different image (e.g. copy it from your regular profile)

Now,

1 Open a new tab page
=> See a tile showing the old thumbnail
2 Open the site in a new tab from the tile; wait for it to load; switch to it; wait a few more seconds
3 Switch back to the newtab page
=> The tile now shows a thumbnail for the current page
4 Open a new newtab page
=> The tile shows a thumbnail for the old page
5 Open a further newtab page
=> The tile shows a thumbnail for the current page

The reason for this is that the preloaded newtab page that will be opened in Step 4 happens to have the loadid that is stored in the image cache entry. So the old image will continue to be used by imgLoader regardless of the fact that hasExpired=true in imgLoader::ValidateEntry().
