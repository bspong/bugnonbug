Copy for string  changes to DNT dialog
This bug can be used to decide on the new string to use the the DNT dialog.

Some options:
When tracking protection is on, Firefox will send the DNT header.
The DNT header is sent when Tracking Protection is enabled.
When Tracking Protection is enabled, the DNT header is sent.
Whenever Tracking Protection is enabled, the DNT header is sent.

We could potentially add a "Note:" at the beginning of the string.

The last string uses "whenever" to indicate that if Tracking Protection is just on in Private Browsing mode, then the DNT isn't sent automatically in regular mode.

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1274654 +++

When TP is enabled, the DNT header is going to be sent per bug 1258033.

In order to communicate this to users, we need to make changes to the dialog that pops up when you click about:preferences#privacy "manage your DNT settings".  If TP is enabled globally, the DNT checkbox should be checked and grayed out so that the user can't uncheck it.  In addition, there should be some messaging to indicate that DNT is automatically turned on when TP is on.  There was a previous mockup for this here:

Proposed string from previous mockup:
When tracking protection is always on, Firefox will send the DNT header.

The above works when TP is enabled globally.  I'm not sure how we communicate that DNT is sent in private browsing mode.
