When I'm viewing a web page within the print preview window and I accidentally
click on a link on that page, opening a new "tab," and than either close the web
page that I was viewing in the print preview or click on the newly opened tab,
the print preview menu remain and there is no was for my to go back to the
normal browser menu.  This is very frustrating when I'm doing research and have
made many tab and then I don't have all the great browser menu option of Firefox
and I have to restart the browser and open or re-research all the tabs I had open!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Updated software
2.  Uninstalled/reinstalled software
3.  Tried the same on three other computers! (steps 1 and 2!!!)

Actual Results:  
the problem remained

Expected Results:  
I'd be nice if you couldn't open the tab(s) while view a page in the print
preview, or if the other tab(s) would have the normal browser menu when you
switched...?

I like I said in the steps I took to fix the problem, I've tested this
personally on a total of four computer, each of which were running Windows XP
Home SP2 with all possible updates, but different hardware configurations, and
software configurations (anti-virus, firewall, etc.).
