[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Start Firefox
2. Enter Customization and drag the zoom buttons to ToolBar
3. Hover over zoom buttons and focus the separator between Zoom Out and Reset.

[Expected result]:
- The hover feedback is aligned with buttons separator.

[Actual result]:

[Regression range]:
- This is NOT a recent regression (but a very old one), I've tracked it back to Nightly from 2014-01-18:

There are a few bugs there, not sure which one is the cause of this. 

[Additional notes]:
- The GOOD build is a build without hover feedback and at some point during the regression search the same issue was seen on the separator between Reset and Zoom In.
