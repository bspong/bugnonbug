Consider starting a newly added tab as an active docshell
I have been debugging some test failures with my patches for bug 1343728 for weeks now and I finally found out the reason for why the failures happen!

Consider this try push: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=514c0110a4a5b441bd9eafc276988ca2f12e68d5&selectedJob=93751442  There are many test failures but they're all of similar nature but I have picked layout/style/test/test_animations_effect_timing_duration.html for debugging.  What generally happens is that we we try to open a test page in a new tab, the test page runs some scripts during page load which do something like call nsIDOMWindowUtils.advanceTimeAndRefresh() which runs a refresh driver tick from JS.  The refresh driver tick ends up calling nsViewManager::ProcessPendingUpdatesPaint() since my patch is removing the create window sync IPC, now this code in the content process is running very much earlier than before, much earlier before the parent has actually opened a tab, and it turns out that the docshell isn't marked as active yet, so our widget thinks that we don't need to paint and this returns false <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/6580dd9a4eb0224773897388dba2ddf5ed7f4216/view/nsViewManager.cpp#445> and we bail out early without every calling PresShell::Paint() and actually painting something.  Then the test listens for a MozAfterPaint event which will arrive but since no actual painting will happen the MozAfterPaint will have an empty invalidated rect which will cause the test to fail.  If you modify this test to open its test page in a new window (which is also changed by my patches) the test works.

I finally narrowed this down to this code: <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/6580dd9a4eb0224773897388dba2ddf5ed7f4216/browser/base/content/tabbrowser.xml#2201>  This code is very old, it dates back to bug 343515, and to the first WIP patch there (attachment 401797) and as far as I can tell there was no specific reason why this was done this way.  The specific thing that causes this test failure is that due to this line, when we get to ProcessPengingUpdatesPaint() above our widget thinks it doesn't need painting.  I see no reason why we can't change this to true.

I sent a patch to do that on top of my old try push to the try server last night and it seemed to work out well: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=a32776f3a5c6e88a2f262278f6d8214f4645de9b  There are other test failures as a result of this (for example the test for bug 343515 and a few other things that depend on the current behavior break but that's not unexpected.)

Before I spent the time to chase down these test failures and fix them, Mike, do you think it's reasonable to start out the docshell as active in _insertBrowser()?
