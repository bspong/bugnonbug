Crash when I close a particular popup window

When visiting http://www.dowcorning.com/applications/search/products/default.aspx?WT.svl=1&bhcp=1, on the left side is a link that says "Live Help." If you click that link, 2 new tabs are opened, one for the Live Help itself, and one to enter your email address in order to get access to the Live Help. If you close the tab asking for your email address, either by pressing Ctrl-W or clicking the X on the tab, the whole browser crashes. When you restart Firefox, it starts blank and Session Restore doesn't offer to reopen your last session.

I deactivated all my extensions and AddOns, and the problem still occurs. I tried it in IE7 (shameful, I know) and the problem didn't occur.

This is potentially serious, because with multiple tabs open, and no session restore, the possibility for loss of critical data is high.

Thank you!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit http://www.dowcorning.com/applications/search/products/default.aspx?WT.svl=1&bhcp=1
2.Click on Live Help
3.Close the tab called "Membership - Dow Corning"



This doesn't actually register as a crash, so I don't have any crash info to provide you. It just closes the browser. Even with multiple tabs open, the browser closes immediately without first confirming that you want to close multiple tabs.

All my AddOns are deactivated, and I'm using the default Firefox theme. The problem still occurs.
