Can't update my website with IE after latest Firefox update.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:50.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/50.0
Build ID: 20161104212021

Steps to reproduce:

Firefox is my standard browser but after the latest update on November 17, 2016 I can no longer use Internet Explorer to update my website.  I've tried to put IE as my standard browser but still got a Firefox crash error even though Firefox wasn't open. I've added my website as a trusted website, I've refreshed the firewall to accept the newest version of Firefox (I tried to remove Firefox so that I could then put it back in as a trusted website but it wouldn't let me delete firefox). I've attempted to upload my site via Filezilla instead of IE but there too I get a can't connect to server error.  


Actual results:

Every time I try to publish my website (using Magix Web Designer 10 Premium which automatically uses Internet Explorer to publish) I get a time out error.  If I try to force it to continue I then get a Firefox crash even though I've got IE open and Firefox closed.


Expected results:

Previously up until 10 days ago, I would click Publish website and IE would open, export my website, update the necessary information and close again.  After that I saved my Magix information, closed Magix and could go back to use Firefox as normal.  The only time IE gets used is to update my site. I've contacted Magix, they're not experiencing any server problems and they suggested Filezilla but there too, even with Firefox as my standard server, it won't allow me to access the Magix server to update my website.
