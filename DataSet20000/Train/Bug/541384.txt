Windows 7 autohide taskbar causes Firefox 3.5.7 fullscreen to display incorrectly at the bottom and right side of the screen.

After enabling "autohide taskbar" in Windows 7, Firefox has begun to display incorrectly. It displays a portion of the page in the area where the taskbar would "unhide" into and never refills that space with the actual page itself. I tried moving my taskbar to the right side and it now displays incorrectly as well. It's as if Firefox is reserving that space for the taskbar and doesn't reclaim the space properly when the taskbar hides. IE8 does not seem to be affected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set Windows 7 Taskbar to "Autohide"
2. Launch Firefox 3.5.7 (3.6 does the same)
3. Press F11 to go to fullscreen mode - note scroll bar areas at bottom and right side are not displayed correctly.

Alt - tab to another window and back into firefox seems to repair the rendering, this should not be a hard bug to fix.
Actual Results:  
From another users input:
I have a similar problem with firefox 3.5.7 when the taskbar is set to autohide. The scroll bar on the right and the status bar on the bottom of the firefox window are doubled when the browser is in fullscreen mode (F11)- the functional scrollbar is inset ~50 pixels from the right margin, while a "ghost" scrollbar is rendered to the right of that. A similar phenomenon happens at the bottom of the screen.

Expected Results:  
Right Scroll bar (vertical) should be rendered against right edge of screen, status bar or bottom scroll bar (horizontal) should be rendered against bottom edge of screen.
