Intermittantly, when using cmd-tab to switch apps (or when an app steals focus), and the app now focused is on a different "Space" from Firefox, hovering the mouse at the location on the screen where the tab bar would be shows the tooltip of the tab which would be under the mouse.

I.e. if iTunes on "space 3" steals focus from Firefox on "space 1", and I move my mouse to the "play" button, but that's the physical place on the screen where Firefox's tab bar was, I get the tooltip "Slashdot - News for Nerds" showing up as if it were a tooltip for the iTunes play button.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have some tabs open
2. Switch apps with cmd-tab to another space
3. Move the mouse to where the tab bar physically showed 
Actual Results:  
Tooltip with tab name shows up

Expected Results:  
Firefox would in no way be the frontmost app, nor respond to mouse or keyboard.

This is a holdover from Firefox 2 - I've seen it there and was surprised to see it in FF3
