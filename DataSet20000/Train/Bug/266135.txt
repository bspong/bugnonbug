Have to login twice to HP Systems Insight Manager (HPSIM) 4.0
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10

When accessing HPSIM, it is necessary to enter the login credentials twice.  The
first time, users are returned directly to the login page almost as if the login
failed.  The second time they login, everything works as expected.  The actual
HPSIM application appears to work as normal once logged in.

This happens on XP workstations connecting remotely, and also on the Windows2000
Server when using it locally.

I cannot test this with HPSIM4.1, as there is no upgrade path from 4.0 to 4.1.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open HPSIM login page
2.  Enter credentials and hit login
3.  Enter credentials again, and then work as normal

Actual Results:  
The first login returns me to the login page without any errors.  The second
login opens up the main management window as normal.

Expected Results:  
It should only be necessary to login to HPSIM once.

MS IE Patch MS04-025 caused IE to block access to HPSIM (more info here
http://h18004.www1.hp.com/products/servers/management/hpsim/index.html). 
Firefox was our saviour, as it was unaffected by the IE patch and allowed us to
access the system.  HP released an updated Java login component to allow patched
versions of IE to login to HPSIM once more.  Firefox's need to login twice
happened both before and after this patch, which leads me to believe it may be
something to do with the way Firefox is handling this login applet.  That is, of
course, merely wild speculation on my part.
