I try to write a "quick search" for amazon.de but do not succeed.
There is a mycroft search file at http://mycroft.mozdev.org/download.html?name=amazon.de&sherlock=yes&opensearch=&submitform=Search
which works perfectly in the search box.
Now I am trying to write an ordinary bookmark containing %s to allow for a quick seach.
So I create an empty bookmark from scratch, using the data in the mycroft file as my basis. the bookmark's URL is thus
http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/external-search/?field-keywords=%s&index=blended&tag=mycroft0c-21&sourceid=Mozilla-search

However, when I use that search from the location bar,

%s is not interpolated! (sent as a plain string to the website instead)

I have verified that using LiveHttpHeaders
amazon.de does not know what to do and thinks my search string is "¶index=blended"
