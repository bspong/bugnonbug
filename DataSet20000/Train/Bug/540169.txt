High CPU usage when deleting bookmarks in bookmarks sidebar

I'm not good at English. Hope you can understand what I mean.

Actually, this performance problem start from Firefox 3.0. I have experience this problem for long time(from FX 3.0.x to FX 3.5.x).

I have over 20,000 bookmark items.

I don't know how to reproduce this problem. Just install Firefox and import my "bookmarks.html" and use Firefox as usual for several months, then the problem happens.

Problem's Detail:
When deleting one bookmark item through bookmarks sidebar, Firefox causes 100% CPU usage on single core CPU and 50% CPU usage on multi-core CPU and hang for a while until CPU usage returns normal. Deleting a folder which contains many bookmark items(for example 10 items) will hang for much more time.

Solution ?
Everything is normal in Firefox's Safe Mode.
And finally, I found a imperfect solution:
1. Run Firefox Safe Mode.
2. Check "Reset toolbars and controls".
3. Click "Make Changes and Restart"

After these steps, Firefox bookmark performance returns normal. And so does the toolbar.........

Hope Mozilla fix this problem.

Reproducible: Always
