High CPU load when browsing normal pages and when typing into firefox

just by typing this message caused a load percentage of around 15%, normal usage on forums and non-media intencive sites cause up to 40% load and youtube sites up to 100% granted firefox 2.0 did experience similar load problems but from what lm currently experiencing its pretty much constant from the moment l upgraded to 3.0 l admit my system isnt cutting edge but it should handle things easy with 2GB ram and an AMD X2 4600+.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load firefox
2. browse some sites
3. maybe even visit youtube
Actual Results:  
between 15% when typing and 100% CPU usage when browsing or viewing content for long periods of time by just haveing the windows open

Expected Results:  
lm not expecting to see usage go down as such, l know with all these new applications and services out there today that computers need to be upgraded all the time to cope with system intensive applications, personally ld like to see a reduction in needed resources, although lm not so bothered about memory ld like to see processor usage plummet to around what it was when l used firefox 2.0 or maybe even become more resource friendly!

pretty much specified it all within my earlier explanations.
