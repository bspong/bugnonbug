Add support to distribution.js to enable extension packaging and installation
This is a feature enhancement request for the distribution.js module.

Currently, extensions packaged with a customized distribution of Firefox are installed to the application directory. This potentially prevents the user from uninstalling the bundled extension, limiting them to disabling the extension. In addition, it is sometimes desirable to be able to limit installation of an extension or extensions for a particular locale.

To address both these issues, the distribution.js should permit inclusion of extensions in the "distribution" directory, in a manner similar to how search 
plugins are included in the distribution directory. 

Mechanics:

- The extension xpi (or expanded extension directory) would be packaged in the distribution/extensions/common or distribution/extensions/locale/<LOCALE> directory (which is copied to the appdir on installation)
- On first-run (i.e. when the user profile is created), the extension(s) in the "common" directory and/or relevant locale directory would be copied/installed to the user profile directory before any UI was presented to the user
- Following a successful copy/install to the user profile, and before UI is presented to the user, Firefox would be restarted to enable the extensions on firstrun.
- On the ensuing restart, all other first-run activities would still occur (i.e. migration offer, display of welcome page, etc.)

Notes:

- extension(s) in the common directory would be installed regardless of the locale of the Firefox installation
- extension(s) in the locale directory would only be installed if the installed locale of Firefox matched
