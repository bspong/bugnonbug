For "some" (I don't know why only "some") Mac users, detection of QuickTime plugin failed in latest Firefox 2.0.0.9. I use this code to detect QT plugin and get the version number with Firefox:

if(navigator.mimeTypes && navigator.mimeTypes["video/quicktime"] && navigator.mimeTypes["video/quicktime"].enabledPlugin)
{
    for (var i = 0; i < navigator.plugins.length; i++)
    {
        if(navigator.plugins[i].name.indexOf("QuickTime Plug-in")!=-1)
        {
            var words = navigator.plugins[i].name.split(" ");
            var version = words[2].split(".");
        }
    }
}

I have an iMac with MacOSX 10.4 / Firefox 2.0.0.9 / QT 7.3 , but I can't reproduce this problem. Anyway a lot of user report me the problem with different configurations. The example page always work with Safari in the same computer.
