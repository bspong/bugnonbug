Try again button annoyance

I have blocklist installed, which means that I have an extensive list of hosts blocked, which cannot be accessed. (Either via the hosts file or via the Blockpost plugin in Outpost firewall).
When I browse some web sites (like the hotmail main page for example, the web page is full of these try again buttons as all the hosts (except the one I need) cannot be contacted. Pretty annoying if You ask me, FF 1.0.7 was clever enough to put there a transparent image instead (or did not show anything).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Block some hosts in Your hosts file or firewall (look up a web page that uses pages from a lot of other web site, and block all except one).
2. Visit the web site while most of the hosts are blocked.
3. Enjoy the annoying view of FF 1.5.

Actual Results:  
Page is full of Try again buttons and error messages.

Expected Results:  
Not error messages, no try again buttons, just a transparent image (or just put there nothing ultimately rendering the background only).

If You don't want to build this into FF 1.5 as a default feature, it's fine with me (some user need to know about the errors). But then leave one option to force a behaviour that allows hiding these annoying messages, please.
Thank You!
