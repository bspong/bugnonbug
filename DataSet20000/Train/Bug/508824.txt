Link application in Facebook shows preview for a brief moment then disappears without allowing post to be made

Both when using the 'Bookmarks' buttons on various newspaper Web sites and when copying and pasting the urls directly into Facebook into the 'Links' application, an error occurs. The preview for the link to be posted appears briefly in Facebook and then disappears without posting the link. The 'Links' function still works normally with Internet Explorer (6.0.2800.1106). The malfunction with Firefox only started when I upgraded to this newer version.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a newspaper Web site and find a story to post to Facebook.
2. Use the 'Bookmarks' function to post to your Facebook account and sign in.

Actual Results:  
The preview appears for a moment, then disappears without posting the link.

Expected Results:  
The preview should stay, allowing edits, and should not go until the 'Share' button is pressed on the preview pop-up. Once the 'Share' button is pressed, the link should be posted to the Facebook account.
