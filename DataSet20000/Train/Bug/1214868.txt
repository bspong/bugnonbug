Reproducing and debugging the regression:
If you would like to re-run this Talos test on a potential fix, use try with the following syntax:
try: -b o -p linux64 -u none -t svgr  # add "mozharness: --spsProfile" to generate profile data

To run the test locally and do a more in-depth investigation, first set up a local Talos environment:

Then run the following command from the directory where you set up Talos:
talos --develop -e <path>/firefox -a tsvgr_opacity
