Add the ability to not "Always show the tab bar"
We should re-add the ability to not "Always show the tab bar" as a built-in setting:

1. On lower-end devices having displays with low vertical pixel counts, hiding the tab bar is very helpful in making room for page contents.  Installing an add-on on a low-end device to do this would require more resources than if it were a built-in setting.

2. Hiding tabs when they are not needed is a common and natural UI behavior.  Quickly surveying my desktop, many mature applications do so: GVim, GNOME Terminal, Files, etc.  I believe this behavior is more common than the alternative of always showing tabs.  Keeping a single tab open is inconsistent with the majority of applications.

3. The feature itself is lightweight and adds minimal complexity.  Requiring the user to install an add-on for a basic configuration is anti-minimalistic.

This enhancement would partially or fully revert the change made in bug 855370.  The reasons that change are problematic, which I have listed above, were apparently not considered or discussed in that bug.

This enhancement is not a duplicate of existing bugs.  Bug 903384, bug 901974, and bug 877479 invalidly reported the lack of the "Always show the tab bar" as a fault, when it was an intended change.  This bug recognizes that removing the setting was an intended change, and proposes re-adding the setting as an enhancement for the reasons listed above.  Bug 855370 proposed removing the feature as an enhancement, so it seems equally valid to propose adding the feature as an enhancement.
