I cannot provide an URL because it is in a secure part of a website I use.  If
you can get to a tif file and try to open it, you may also get the box that asks
you how you want to open it.  There is a drop down that has your choices.  The
problem is that the first time I used this, it worked just fine, but every
subsequent time, the OK button to acknowldge a choice is shaded out and there is
sonsequently no way to open a tif file because there is no way to submit the
choice without the OK button.  I would also like to see your browser become
compatible with Alternatif.  I tried to install it, but foxfire will not
recognize the plugin.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Find a tiff file
2.click to open it in browser
3.choose and option and you will see the OK button shaded out

Actual Results:  
That's the problem, I can't take an action!!

Expected Results:  
OK button should be useable

I un-installed then re-installed firefox, but not even this would work.
