Add migrator telemetry for number of imported items
One of the reasons we support (and are improving) migrators is the theory that users who try a new browser will be more likely to keep using it if it's got all the stuff from their old browser.

It would be useful to record how many items are migrated, so that we can understand the impact of this. Is there a correlation between the number of items imported and the retention of that user? One would expect this matters a lot with users who were heavily invested in their bookmarks/passwords, whereas migration wouldn't really matter for users who barely used that.

This might also provide some indirect signal for the "how much is available" probe that we couldn't really implement in bug 1276694 (where we went for recency instead)... While we wouldn't know the number of items from browsers that were available but *not* selected for migration, it would give us a better understanding of how much is being imported when users make an explicit choice. We can then compare that with automigration: to see if it's similar, and to see if it correlates with the odds of a user selecting "undo". (I'm specifically thinking of the case of "you only used IE to download Firefox, and we unhelpfully migrated the default IR bookmarks".)

[I was thinking it would be nice answer things like "how often did the user undo an automigration, but the redo an import from another browser that had more data", but I'm not sure that's possible with a single probe.]


Despite my long comment, I think this is a simple FX_MIGRATION_NUM_ITEMS_IMPORTED probe, keyed by data type. :-)
