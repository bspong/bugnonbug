to the right of the word "ob·vi·ate" there is a flash mod (speaker) and to it's right there are images of the accented word spelling.. 
I read most of the page (definitions and usage) and the 'word images' where still not loaded. I did not know what type of item was not loaded so I went through the page source to find out if I needed to install a 'plugin', svg, java, flash (already installed), well you get it. I did all this and i'm a very slow reader, before the images of the accented spelling showed up.. I actually watched them appear one by one, slowly and smoothly... actually kinda neat.. 
Anyway this goes to another post.. 6.0x is loading page images very slowly.
load text and some elements Very quick, but images of any kind.. these images are very small and where the last thing to load, a few minutes after majority of page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.load url.
2.
3.


Expected Results:  
images, especially ones that are essential part of document should load before ancillary items (ads, anime, flash and such..)..
