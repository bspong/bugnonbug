I right-clicked and closed a lot of Windows at once and when I restarted Firefox, it attempted to restore all the Windows that I closed.

I searched for Session Restore as an option and can't find it.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Go to http://www.luckysurf.com/subscribe.html
3.Play your 10 Games.
4.Right-click and close Windows.
Actual Results:  
It closed all windows, but when I reopened Firefox without a reboot of the computer, it attempted to reopen all the Windows.

I want to just go to the Home Page when restarting Firefox, after closing Firefox.

Expected Results:  
Go to the Home Page after reopening Firefox.

I use Firefox to play my LuckySurf Lotto Games.

I wanted to re-use Firefox instead of IE, but it tried to reopen all the windows I closed.

No option to disable the Session Restore and just restart Firefox to go to the Home Page.
