Firefox 3.6.3 freezes/locks up after a period of time/use (including the top toolbar).  The only way to reset it is to quit the application and restart it.  This was an issue with a previous version of this application but it was fixed in a later release a few years ago.  I have not confirmed if it's the result of cache etc.  

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Surf the web

Actual Results:  
Things work well for a while, then you'll eventually reach a page where you can't refresh or it doesn't load properly.  Navigating to a new URL in the URL line or using the toolbar's built-in search option will yield no results and the only way to move away from the crawl of the application that usually responds quickly is to not refresh but actually quit the app. and restart it.

Expected Results:  
Should be able to navigate with no issue.
