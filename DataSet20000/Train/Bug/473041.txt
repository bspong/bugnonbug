Tools -> Addons does not show installed addons

I installed several addons including:
  Foxclock
  Noscript
  FireFTP
Also installed and then un-installed FoxyProxy.  I connect to the internet directly without any proxy.

Currently the Tools -> Addons menus does not show any addons and does not allow checking for updates since it does not show the addons even though the FoxClock and Noscript addons are functioning properly.  Also Help -> Check for Updates shows a blank screen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox
2.Select Tools -> Addons
3.Also select Help -> Check for Updates
Actual Results:  
The Tools -> Addons menu does not show any addons and does not allow checking for the updates that are currently installed.  It also does not allow me to install new addons.
Also the Help -> Check for Updates shows a blank screen.

Expected Results:  
Tools -> Addons should show the list of currently installed addons and allow checking for updates and/or installing new addons.
Help -> Check for Updates should either show no updates available or allow updating Firefox if an update is available.
