url does not switch back to the url of the web page your looking at when you type a new address in the Location Bar and middle click the go button to open the url in a new tab.

Normally when you middle click the go button it is supposed to switch the url back the url of the web page on that tab.

Instead it is keeping what you type in the Location Bar there in that tab.

However if you erase the url that you typed in and switch to another tab then back to that tab it switches it back to the correct url.

This used to work fine in previous builds, I think it may be because the new implementation of the go button, Can anyone confirm?
