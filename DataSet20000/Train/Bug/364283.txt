browser 100% freeze after network disconnect
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20061218 Minefield/3.0a1

I experience a total freeze and 100% cpu utilization of Firefox everytime my Network (Static IP Adress in a University Network) gets disconnected. I recognized it when I plugged off the network cable and was able to reproduce it. I am also able to reproduce the freeze when I close the network connection manually in windows control panel.

The error occured with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0, so I tested it with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20061218 Minefield/3.0a1 and it had the same behavior.

I also waited for 5 to 10 minutes for the browser to recover, but it stayed at 100% cpu utilization being frozen. After plugging the cable back in or reconnecting, Firefox also doesn't recover.

When this error occurs, I can't close it with the taskmanager, and even a "taskkill /F /IM firefox.exe" only produces a positive "PID XXX terminated" message but firefox stays in memory utilizing 100%. Soft-restarting windows is possible and seems even to be able to kill the process properly. The process can also be assigned a low priority in the taskmanager, dropping it to about 80%, keeping the rest of the system responsible.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start any build of Firefox
2. Plug off your network cable or manually close the network connection in windows.
Actual Results:  
Firefox begins utilizing 100% Cpu, then doesn't react anymore to keyboard and mouse input and also doesn't update the Browser window anymore -> Freeze

Expected Results:  
When not accessing anything at the moment, he shouldn't even notice that I plugged of the cable / terminated the network connection.

The next time he tries to create a connection, accessing a site, he should just give an error message like "no connection".

After plugging the cable back in/reestablishing the network connection he should be able to connect to the Internet again.
