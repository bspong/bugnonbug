Printing a HTML page with a table spanning multiple pages Firefox will only print one page of the table and supresses the rest of the table. All texts passages before and after the table are printed.

It looks like a serious error and is reconstrucable regardless of the used printer and is therefor a application (Firefox) error. It's a page handling error on large table AND landscape page orientation.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start firefox
2. Call the URL

3. Select File -> Preview -> Select Page setup "Landscape orientation "
4. Scroll down the pages
Actual Results:  
Landscape printout starts on page 1 with the header line und continues until the start of the table. A page break is included and the table starts on a fresh page (page 2). All lines are printed until the page is filled up. Printout continues on a new page with all the text blocks after the table (page 3 cont.). All in all are 5 pages printed.

Expected Results:  
Landscape printout starts on page 1 with the header line und continues until the start of the table. A page break is included and the table starts on a fresh page (page 2). All lines are printed until the page is filled up. The table continues on the following pages until it's printed. Then the rest of the pages are printd.

See description in Actual results. Printout handling of IE 7 is correct.
