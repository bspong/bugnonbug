Preserve form and search history as soon as the data is entered

After clearing the private data esp. form and search history, all the new form and search history will be lost if Firefox crashes in the same session. Closing the web browser seems to preserve the new form and search history.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Tools menu -> Clear Private Data

2. Check 'Saved form and search history'. Click on 'Clear Private Data Now' button.

3. Go to any web site and fill some form. For example, go to http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/dictionaryhome.aspx and search for few words like 'snide', 'gloat'. Make sure you can see the words 'snide' and 'gloat' in the "Find" text box when you type 's' and 'g' respectively.

3. In a shell, run: kill -9 `pgrep firefox-bin`

4. Launch Firefox web browser from Java Desktop System start menu. When given an option to start a new session, or to restore the old session, choose the latter (restore the session).

5. Again go back to http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/dictionaryhome.aspx and type 's' or 'g' to see if 'snide' or 'gloat' show up from the saved data.
Actual Results:  
Firefox behaves as if nothing was saved before the browser crash.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should show the appropriate data or keywords the user typed in before the web browser crash.

In the 5th step {of steps to reproduce}, I was expecting the word 'snide' when I typed the letter 's'.

If Firefox is waiting for the user to close the web browser to save that private data, it is very likely that this issue is not specific to Solaris.
