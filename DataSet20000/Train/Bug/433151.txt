Draggable RSS links are wrong! Can result in orphaned links. Crash can be triggered.
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: latest nightly win32 (05/10/08)

Unlike bookmarks, which are locally managed, RSS feeds are remotely managed (and temporary) and as such should be treated locally as static content. 

Although individual feed links cannot be dragged into another RSS feeds folder, they can be moved outside of their own feed folder, and in doing so the link becomes orphaned when the RSS feed is refreshed, with a duplicate link respawning in the original feed folder. Initial right click on orphaned file causes immediate Fatal Error crash (in XP) and does not trigger the Crash Reporter. Upon restart, the orphaned RSS link remains and right click functions correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a folder on the boomarks or navbar and populate with live rss feed folder(s)
2.Click on folder on toolbar, and from within a rss feed folder, drag a link out, into the parent (non-rss) folder.
3.Refresh feed.
4.Right click on the resulting orphaned link from the toolbar folder menu.
Actual Results:  
Instant fatal error. No crash reporter. Upon restart, orphaned rss link still orphaned, but now right clickable.

Expected Results:  
RSS live feeds should be static as per ff2. This is a regression. Remote links should not be locally editable/draggable.

None.
