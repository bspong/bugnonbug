<object> shows background image with 'load images automatically' off

I am/was testing new ways of doing accessible image replacement for text headings using the <object> tag.  I am also using CSS Sprites.
When I tried this with images off, I still see the background image.  While this is the best scenario,( ;-) ) it is not what is supposed to happen.

Here is my test document:

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>
   CSS Sprites with Object tag.
</title>
<style type="text/css">
<!-- 
object { background-image: url(images/Sprites3.png) }
object:hover { background-position: 0px -40px }
-->
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <object data="images/spacer.gif" type="image/gif" height="34px" width="100px">
      This is a test.
  </object>
</body>
</html>

Spacer.gif is a one pixel transparent gif, just like in the bad old days.  It's needed here to give the <object> something to do.  If it is not there, it just falls through to the text, like its supposed to do.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Copy above test code to an empty file
2. change the style to reflect the path to your image
3. display in firefox 3.0.5 or firefox 3.1b2
4. uncheck 'load images automatically' in tools>options>content
5. clear cache and redisplay page
Actual Results:  
background image always displays

Expected Results:  
background image doesn't display with images off

This works correctly in the latest version of Opera.
Of course, it fails miserably in IE 7 and lower.
