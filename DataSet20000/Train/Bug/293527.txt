"Save Image As" context menu allows to silently save executables instead of images

The context menu option "Save Image As" does not validate if the src image is
valid. By using absolute positioning and the moz-opacity filter an attacker can
easily fool the user to think he is going to save a valid image but is
downloading an executable file instead.

Since file extensions are default disabled on windows and an exe files can have
any file icon - including the standard image icon - the user can only tell the
difference when he recognizes that the save dialog file type drop down shows
"Application" instead of an image file. Unlikely average users will see that or
realize the consequences. Probably most poeple will just double-click the "image
file" they downloaded when they are going to view it and will run the executable
in that moment.

It seems Firefox sometimes raises an "the web page might have been removed or
its name changed" error when supplying a larger exe directly as an image source
and then trying to save it (is that a bug or a security feature?). Anyway, an
attacker can work around this problem with a little php script like this:

$fp = fopen("exe.exe", "rb");
header("Content-Type: image/gif");
header("Content-Disposition: inline; filename=booom.exe");
fpassthru($fp);
fclose($fp);
