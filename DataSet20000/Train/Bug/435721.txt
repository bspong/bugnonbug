SYMPTOMS
After you install Windows XP Service Pack 3 (SP3), the Address toolbar no longer appears as an option on the taskbar.

WORKAROUND
You can use Windows Desktop Search (WDS) to add features that resemble the features that are found on the Address toolbar. For example, by using Windows Desktop Search, you can use shortcuts that let you quickly start programs. Or, you can go directly to a Web site merely by typing a keyword or a shortcut name in the Desktop Search box. You can also create your own shortcuts. For more information about Windows Desktop Search and to download the program, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

Additionally, a number of third-party tools are available that offer similar functionality.
