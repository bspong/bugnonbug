I was searching using the google search box "mayfair bemis 1b5109622" which is a brand/model of toilet seat. The search results (zero) showed up in hawaiian. The only reason I know it was hawaiian and not jibberish, was I copied some of the text and went to google.com/translate and pasted it into the translate box. It said it was hawaiian. Weird. And the only way to fix the problem was to go to google translate's page. That somehow fixes the bug. Clearing the cache, all of it, even site preferences did not do anything to fix it. The only fix I could find was to go directly to google translate.

I'm using Linux Mint 10's version of firefox 3.6.16. The search box is a custom google search (why? I do not know.) I have installed all updates, levels 1-3, firefox was included in the update.
