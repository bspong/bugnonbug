Cannot connect with any https/secure Web page (Error establishing an encrypted connection to ...  Error code: -8075)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

My Firefox 1.5, downloaded and installed on 12/02/05, will not connect with an "https" page.  This is on a a Win98/SE system with plenty of memory and disk capacity.  There is a particular HUD-related site I must use that is all secure pages after login.  I had no problem with this or other such "https" sites or pages using IE6, Mozilla 1.7.8 (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511), or Firefox 1.0.3 and its updates.

Since the problem occurs in Firefox 1.5, I went back to check access of these secure sites/pages with IE6 and Mozilla 1.7.8 and had no problem with access, as before.  The same good result was obtained at Mozilla.org in accessing secure pages with Mozilla 1.7.8.

When trying to access "https" pages in Firefox 1.5 the response is "Error establishing an encrypted connection to _______.com.  Error code:-8075"

Similar results occur within Mozilla.org attempting to connect to secure pages--as in trying to report this bug (I had to use Mozilla 1.7.8 to make this filing). The response obtained with Firefox 1.5 in trying to enter a secure page within Mozilla.org is:

   "The connection was interrupted      

    The connection to addons.mozilla.org was interrupted while the page was loading.

    *   The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few moments.
    *   If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
connection.
    *   If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure that Firefox is permitted to access the Web."

I tried all of the available "Protocol" options under Tools\Advanced\Security, separately and all selected simultaneously.  None of these choices helped.

This is a major issue (unless no one else is experiencing this problem).  Since I never had a problem with https pages with IE6, Mozilla 1.7.8, or Firefox 1.0.3, the issues would appear to be in Firefox 1.5--no matter that the underlying software is basically the same as in Mozilla and earlier Firefox.

Thank you.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Using Firefox 1.5 on any system, find a Web site that has "https" pages.
2. Attempt to connect to the secure pages.
3. If that works properly, try the same on a Win\98 system in particular.

Actual Results:  
What happens is as described in "Details" above.

Expected Results:  
Based upon my trials with three older browsers which successfully handle secure pages and my version of Firefox 1.5 obtained on 12/02/05, I expect a rejection at the secure page.
