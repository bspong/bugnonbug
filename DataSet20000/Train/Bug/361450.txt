Tall page (with Applet) split across two monitors (Up,Down) - Clicking MenuBar on top monitor displays menu in bottom monitor

I am viewing a Tall page which happens to contain an Applet (maybe relevant)
I have stretched the window across my 2 monitors (Up and Down)
FF has top of window in TOP monitor and bottom of window in BOTTOM monitor,
When I click  on the MenuBar (on TOP monitor), 
it displays the menu items in bottom monitor.
This is also true when right clicking to get the context menu.
This does not happen on any tall page (e.g. news.google.com ) - so maybe it is the applet causing this problem.

Expected Results:  
Menus display on wrong monitor

Menus locations are being truncated to be the top of the Bottom Monitor instead
of near the mouse location.
