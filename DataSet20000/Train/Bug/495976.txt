When I download a pdf file from a journal webpage using "Open PDF" and try to read it I get an error message from Adobe: "Adobe Reader could not open '674079.pdf' because it is either not a supported file type or because the file has been damaged (for example, it was sent as an email attachment and wasn't correctly decoded)." In latest version of PDF download (but not in previous versions), when I try to download a pdf file using "Bypass PDF Download" the pdf file does not download at all.  If I go to the same webpage using Safari, I do not have a problem downloading the pdf file and Adobe reads it correctly.
