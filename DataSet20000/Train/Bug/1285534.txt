Firefox 48 Beta 6 - Scrolling Jerky When Images are Loading
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_2) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.103 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

(1) Loaded the webpage such as flickr or pinterest or google images.
(2) Scroll up and down using any method. 


Actual results:

These sites load more images as the scroll bar reaches near the bottom of the page. As more images are loading it causes the scroll bar to go up as you are scrolling down. This causes the scroll bar to jerk up.

I also tested this in Google Chrome and the same jerky scrolling behavior happens. So, this looks to be "normal" behavior. However, I was advised to fill out a bug to see if there is any fix that can be done. Maybe the issue is cause due to cacheing or something along those lines?


Expected results:

This seems to be "normal" browser behavior even in other web browsers. The question is, is there a way to prevent the jerking of the scroll bar when more images load. I suppose a quick fix would be not to have more images auto load as the scroll bar reaches the bottom of the page which is annoying anyway since sometimes I want to get to the links/info at the bottom of the page but if more images are loading I can't get there.  Just sayin. :)
