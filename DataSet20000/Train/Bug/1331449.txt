2.1 - 3.29% tpaint (osx-10-10, windows8-64) regression on push 4bbe0c7e648909d6118e9cc4eea14296569db80b (Fri Jan 13 2017)
There were several commits flagged in the push, but it looks like jmaher did some retriggering (e.g. https://treeherder.mozilla.org/perf.html#/graphs?series=%5Bmozilla-inbound,38229d537cd5265f429b0916d523305fa6ce1993,1,1%5D&series=%5Bautoland,38229d537cd5265f429b0916d523305fa6ce1993,1,1%5D) and it now seems pretty clear that bug 1314091 is the culprit. :bgrins, could you have a look?
