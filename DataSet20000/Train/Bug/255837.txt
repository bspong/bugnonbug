Popup blocker message persists across different URLs
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.2) Gecko/20040816 Firefox/0.9.1+

The yellow popup information bar persists across different visited URLs even
after leaving a Web site whose popup window was blocked.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ensure that the "Block popup windows" option is checked in the "Web Features"
panel of the Options dialog box (Tools | Options).
2. Use the location bar to jump to <http://www.cnn.com>.  A popup window should
be blocked by Firefox, and the popup info bar should appear.
3. Visit other Web sites that do not trigger popup windows.  Examples are:

   Mozilla home <http://www.mozilla.org>
   Inside Firefox <http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/ben/>
   The Burning Edge <http://www.squarefree.com/burningedge/>

Try entering the URL in the location bar or clicking a bookmark.

Actual Results:  
Regardless of whether the Web site was visited by manually entering its URL in
the location bar or clicking a bookmark item, the popup info bar remains.  In
addition, clicking on it will show "Allow popups for www.<hostname>.com", where
<hostname> is the host name portion of the current URL.

Expected Results:  
If the newly-visited Web site does not open popup windows, then the popup
information bar should disappear upon leaving the Web site whose popup window
was blocked by Firefox.


Currently, the popup info bar will only disappear after reloading the current
Web page that does not trigger a popup window.
