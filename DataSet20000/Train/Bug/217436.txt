Keyboard input locks up with GTK2 build using Klipper / KDE

Built Firebird with GTK2 (on Gentoo Linux), also built with GTK1 .. 
Firebird will sometimes suddenly lock up, and will not accept any keyboard
input. It still responds to mouse input, and all functions work, minus clipboard
functionality. 
Just today I noticed I could "unlock" firebird by clicking on the Klipper icon
in my KDE taskbar, and selecting another clipboard entry. This will unfreeze
Firebird, but this happens every now and again. I have not found out on exactly
what conditions this appear but it seems to be associated with clipboard
activity. (new string to clipboard etc.)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Compile Firebird with GTK2 
2. Use the KDE desktop and have the Klipper applet started 
3. Use firebird for a while copy stuff from KDE applications a lot
4. When Firebird freezes try clicking Klipper and selecting a different entry.

Actual Results:  
Firebird freezes as reported above.

Expected Results:  
Firebird should not freeze when utilizing the clipboard in KDE. 

Using default Qute theme, Gentoo linux 1.4+ (with all applied updates), GTK2 2.2.1
