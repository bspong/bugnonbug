search bar form autocomplete entries can conceal suggestions
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.8.1b1) Gecko/20060710 Firefox/2.0b1

I would consider this a bit of a useability bug.
If I have autocomplete and Search As You Type turned on, typing in the search box will cause search suggestions to be concealed by the autocomplete, which is located on top.

Perhaps the two should be flipped around?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In the search box, type the first letters to something which you have searched for before.
2. Scroll down through the autocomplete options to see the search suggestions, hidden away at the bottom.

Actual Results:  
Search suggestions, hidden away at the bottom of the list.

Expected Results:  
Search suggestions should have been located at the top of the list.

Sorry if I have called anything by the wrong name.
I'm not actually sure if these search suggestions were querying a search engine or a dictionary.
I'm going to assume that there will eventually be a Getting Started guide, so nothing to worry about.


I believe this bug is similar to bug #342980
