HUH, what a complication of process to write to you simple user question ;-) ...
Anyway, surfing with Firefox at my machine (and also on my friends computers)
stops in one case.
It was happening before, and even in newest 1.0.7. software. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Let's say my homepage is: http://www.passdb.com/indexfull2.shtml   I'm on
that page.
2. I choose down in Top Partner Sites, to open link BeStPaSsWoRdS. And I open
it. Now my Firefox is in two different windows (that is reason of opening those
pages).
3. When I close first window (in this case
http://www.passdb.com/indexfull2.shtml) with other that remains (bestpasswords)
I cannot longer surf. Like Firefox is frozen, don't respond.
Than I must end it in Task mannager, and run it again.
4. In any case, when I close first opened Firefox window, another who remains
are frozen. And need to be closed.


Actual Results:  
The result (problem) is, if I'm going to surf little longer, I must keep open
sometimes even 20 pages in Firefox, because if I terminate first one, all others
will be disabled.


I noticed that in last time adware and spyware comes into my machine via Firefox
(before it was only through IE)while I'm surfing (Alexa related, new.net, and
other junk).
Hope that is fixed in version 1.0.7.
And it would be nice if (for example) Spybot Search & Destroy have real time
protection for Firefox?
It has for Opera and Internet Explorer.

Thank you very much for reading this.
Have a nice day.
