PCTurboPro malware pop-up control took over the browser session.

While surfing the CAD comic site a small pop-up control showed up in the lower right corner, asking me if I wanted to install "PCTurboPro" to optimize my system's performance. The pop-up control took over the entire browser session. The main window could not be raised again unless one of the controls on the pop-up was selected.

Clicking on "cancel" or the X on the control caused the website to load in a new tab. This new tab could not be closed, and none of the other tabs I had open at the time could be accessed. Firefox needed to be killed using task manager, and then reopened using a fresh session.

If a user were to have been entering form data on an open tab when this comes up, that data would be lost and need to be reentered upon getting the browser back up.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Surf to the specified CAD URL.
2. Poke around for a bit. The pop-up may be part of one of the banner ads.
3. If the pop-up comes up, observe that control over the browser session is lost.
Actual Results:  
Pop-up control steals control away from the user. Browser session is no longer usable.

Expected Results:  
The pop-up control should not have been allowed to manifest.

Other websites I had open at the time are known to be malware-free as they are my own sites which I run on my own servers. The CAD website was the only external link open at the time.
