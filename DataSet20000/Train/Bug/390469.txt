Tab settings don't work properly

In Options/Tabs I've checked off "New Pages Should be Opened in:  A new Tab".
In Tam Mix Plus Options I've checked off Open Links new Tab;  Force to Open in New Tab - All Links;  and have checked all options in Events, Open Tabs From.

All worked properly in previous builds.  My home page remained on my first tab.  All links opened in new tabs.  Now new links open in my first tab.  I have to manually click on New Tab before clicking on a new link in order to keep my home page open.

In addition, when Firefox starts up, my home page no longer appears.  I get only the Firefox startup page.  No matter how many times I define my home page in Options and select start in home page, whenever I start Firefox the default has been reset to http://en-US.start2.mozilla.com/firefox?client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official.  Clearly it is not remembering its settings.

Also, even after defining my default save to directory, this build doesn't remember the setting and defaults to the Desktop.

Help???!!!

Thanks.
