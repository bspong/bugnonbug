browser.cache.disk.parent_directory setting has no effect (at least under OS X)

I've tried this setting on Firefox 1.0.7 and now on the latest version. I have never gotten it to work and I have spent a lot of time attempting to validate the cache location change. After setting the cache like so:

user_pref("browser.cache.disk.parent_directory", "/LocalDocs/kyle");

... about:cache reveals that the directory has not changed. Restarting, etc. has no effect.

Windows and Linux users do not seem to have this problem, but I have never gotten it to work on OS X. I really think it's broken.

Bugzilla Bug 78480 (marked FIXED) has comment #31 describing the same problem. Perhaps this has never been properly fixed for OS X?


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set browser.cache.disk.parent_directory value in about:config, e.g.:

user_pref("browser.cache.disk.parent_directory", "/LocalDocs/kyle");

2. Restart Firefox. Marvel at how the setting has no effect on where cache files are stored.
Actual Results:  
Cache files are written to the default location.

Expected Results:  
Cache files should have written to a cache directory within /LocalDocs/kyle. At least after a restart.

I personally find this bug to be a huge drag, since OS X machines with networked home directories will write cache files across the network, thus making the cache non-local and inefficient.
