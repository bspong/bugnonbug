Firefox 4 beta starts lagging randomly. Fixed by minimizing/maximizing or resizing.

I've been experiencing the weirdest thing with Firefox 4 (beta 7,8,9). It doesn't matter how long/short my session is or what pages I have open, but Firefox will just suddenly become less responsive, the scrolling becomes jerky, the tab loading animations look like 15fps instead of the usual 60, text typing is less responsive. Everything becomes less responsive basically. Not to the point of a hang or a crash, mind you, just a REALLY noticeable reduction in the browser's responsiveness. I'm experiencing it as I type this, in fact.

But that's not the strange part. The strange part is that the moment I simply re-size the Firefox window or open another window (not necessarily a Firefox window, can be anything) or maximize/minimize/switch windows, the lag COMPLETELY disappears! I haven't seen this problem with any other software. I use hardware acceleration. I found other bugs about lag, but they all talked about Flash or some JS slowing things down, and none of them said anything about the problem being fixed by such an unorthodox (albeit simple) method.
The quirk seems to go away when I disable hardware acceleration.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox with hardware acceleration enabled
2.Browse for a while
Actual Results:  
Browser lags until I switch windows/open a new window (Not necessarily a Firefox window)/maximize/minimize/re-size

Expected Results:  
Ermm.. maybe not lag at all?
