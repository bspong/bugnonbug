Usability concerns for new "restore default settings" UI in SSL error page

This is a great new feature, but the addition of the descriptive text plus button has been done in such as way as to make the error page as a whole difficult to use. 

The new text appears directly below the error in a way that does not differentiate the problem from the solution. 

Additionally, the user is now being presented with four possible UI interactions upon hitting this error: two buttons, one hyperlink and one checkbox. Both buttons reload the page, the link takes them to a lengthy help page, and the checkbox appears - to the user - to do nothing.

I know that this page is the result of much deliberation, but the design might be a bit fragile to introduce this new functionality in the way it exists now. 

My suggestions:

* If both buttons reload the page ("Try again" and "Restore default settings"), consider combining them into one button instead. 
* The "learn more" link is no longer contextually relevant. It could be moved back up to the area directly below the two bulleted items, since it directly describes the error and not the new feature.
* The two sentences starting with "It looks like your network security settings ..." might be redundant, since we have already detected this condition and present a button. This could be shortened.
