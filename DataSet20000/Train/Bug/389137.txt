Missing System Default Button (Checks if Firefox is default on startup) for firefox-2.0.0.x.Solaris8-sparc-gtk1
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; SunOS sun4u; en-US; rv:1.8.1.5) Gecko/20070718 Firefox/2.0.0.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; SunOS sun4u; en-US; rv:1.8.1.5) Gecko/20070718 Firefox/2.0.0.5

Options/Preferences:
System Defaults:
   o Always check to see if Firefox is the default browser on startup [Check Now]

This option is completely missing from Solaris 2.8 gtk1 build v2.0.0.x. The window version of 2.0.0.x clearly shows this option. I guess, the problem is with Solaris 2.8 build only, I don't know about Solaris 2.10 build.

I have contacted Sun Beijing Team, they asked me to file a bug on this.

It was present in firefox1.0.7-sparc-solaris2.8-gtk2 build, 1.5 was also missing, for this reason I had to stick with 1,0,7 for a long time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Missing: Edit --> Preferences --> Main (Windows(found): Tools --> Options --> Main)
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Solaris 2.8 gtk1 build (2.0.0.x)
Edit --> Preferences --> Main

Preferences:
Missing:
System Defaults:
   o Always check to see if Firefox is the default browser on startup [Check Now]


Expected Results:  
Preferences:

System Defaults:
   o Always check to see if Firefox is the default browser on startup [Check Now]

Without this option the firefox cannot be set default or started from Thunderbird.
