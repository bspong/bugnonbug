After uploading from Firefox 3.5 to Firefox 3.6, we (developers team) have met some problems when trying to read a wmv file through our customer website.

Indeed, the host url (beginning by mms://) can't be read and Firefox shuts down without any error alert.

To fix it, we've been forced to rewrite the target url (from mms:// to http://) but it unables the use of streaming read, which is really a problem.

Our client - we've always tried to persuade to use Firefox as often as they can - now use IE to ensure they'll be able to see the video in real time.

We can't only ask them to download your plugin so may you have an update including it ?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.connect any website that calls a wmv file without using an asx file

Actual Results:  
Firefox immediatly shuts down

Expected Results:  
The video should have been read through the navigator

the video is called by the fllowing html code :
