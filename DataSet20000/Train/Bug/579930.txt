Mouse cursor updates do not take effect until the user has moved the mouse at least once after page load.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:2.0b1) Gecko/20100630 Firefox/4.0b1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

The mouse cursor is not updated until the mouse has been moved at least once after the page has loaded. After that the cursor is updated as expected. For example if I have a document with the following style:

  html, body {
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    margin: 0;
    cursor: crosshair;
  }

the cursor will not update until I have moved the mouse. This is also true if the cursor is updated using javascript. I have tested this under Windows, Mac, and Linux. This works fine under Linux, but is broken under Windows and Mac (tested major releases back to FF 3.0).

This is a major problem for the application I'm developing. The application I'm developing needs to hide the mouse and will usually not have any user interaction. The computer will typically not even have a mouse or keyboard attached except when being serviced. 

I know this is a weird use case, but so far I have not been able to find a work around. I would even be happy if I could find a work around. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a page that has 'cursor' style
2. Do not move the mouse while page is loading
3. After the page has loaded, then move the mouse
4. To repeat the test you need to change the cursor back to auto as the 
   browser preserves the last cursor state.
Actual Results:  
The cursor is not updated until the mouse is moved.

Expected Results:  
The cursor is updated when the page is loaded without requiring user interaction.

I may also be able to spend some time working on this if someone could point me in the correct direction.
