lose keyboard when you view the about page

After viewing the Help->About page, none of the keyboard controls work.  You can't:

- Alt-T to open a tab
- Alt-W to close the window
- click in the address bar to type in a new window
- Crtl-F to open the find box...
- etc...

The only thing you can do is restart the browser.  I've been having this problem
for a while now but this is the first time I've been able to recreate it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  go to help, then select "about mozilla firebird"
2.  close the about box.

Actual Results:  
You will lose all keyboard controls.  No keyboard shortcuts work, you can't
input text into a text box, etc...  

Expected Results:  
It should've just closed the about window and let me continue using keyboard
shortcuts.

I'm using blackbox on Redhat 9, but I've been able to recreate this in Openbox
2.2 (and all versions of 3.0) on Gentoo as well.  

Also, when this problem happens, all other applications are normal.  So even
after I lose the keyboard in Mozilla, I'm able to click over to another
application and have it work just fine.  This is a Mozilla/Firebird issue.
