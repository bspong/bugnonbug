Firefox freezes or hangs frequently and temporarily at zero or low cpu - HT / hyperthread / multiple processor only - NOT resolved by BIOS update
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Firefox very frequently freezes (windows detects it as not responding, the mouse
shows an hourglass, and input has no effect).  It will usually unfreeze after a
few seconds or minutes, but it will eventually freeze again.  This sometimes
happens immediately after starting Firefox and sometimes just when interacting
with the browser.  CPU usage is 0 when this happens.

This happens on my computer, after replacing CPU and motherboard, removing a bad
hard drive, reformatting, then reinstalling just XP SP2 (slipstreamed), the
network driver, and Firefox.  I've also seen it on two network adapters.

Now for the strange part: if I run tcpview (www.sysinternals.com) and close the
TCP connection that Firefox opens to itself, firefox starts taking 100% CPU, but
it also functions flawlessly, will unhang itself, and will not hang again.  I
suspect some kind of deadlock or missed wakeup, and when I kill the connection,
all the select()s or whatever Firefox uses return immediately, and the problem
is hidden.

Is there anything I can do to provide more information?

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firefox
2. Do anything.  www.slashdot.org usually does it, but so do most pages.

Actual Results:  
Firefox freezes for awhile.

Expected Results:  
It shouldn't freeze.

I have two monitors at different resolutions.  That's the only odd thing about
my setup I can think of.
