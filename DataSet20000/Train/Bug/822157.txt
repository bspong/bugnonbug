RFE: Privacy -- Defeat ITU-T Y.2770 : Requirements for deep packet inspection in next generation networks.
Created attachment 692806
ITU-T Publication Y.2770: Requirements for DPI.

RFE: ITU-T Publication Y.2770 "Requirements for deep packet inspection in next generation networks" creates privacy concerns which are briefly described here: http://hexus.net/business/news/internet/49005-privacy-alert-itu-secretly-approves-deep-packet-inspection/ .

Briefly:
"This standard provides a means for ISPs and governments to inspect the actual content of user traffic and not just packet headers for the purposes of data routing." and "The standard even includes provision for bypassing encryption, by allowing the capture of exchanged keys. Unlike other web standards authorities, the ITU has made no attempt to analyse the impact of DPI misuse or to offers provisions for guaranteeing user data privacy." .


For those with authorized access to the origonal Document is can be obtained here: http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Y.2770-201211-P others may be able to view the (same?) Document here: https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:_FwD3aOUwTQJ:https://netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/T09-WTSA.12-C-0030MSW-E2.docx+&hl=en&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESh6KXDA_9HC4lNd3Sm9Zd8banxgjNGEAtM0oMB6DOG4OJubeCI7CdBDhLIdWfKinQbcvykE5aX4ChLdPvr_C1q0_hc43XeMreV3kzpGqV2I3bbyzgf1rqzXn7TdkERhWpXIcL7_&sig=AHIEtbRXLWqzQegL1DCD3n_GSUK6tIVrxw

Of particular concern is Section 6.8, 'the inspection of encrypted traffic' which may rely on password or keys that were sent 'in the clear' being retained and applied against latter Packets in an attempt to decrypt them.


What WE WANT (for this RFE) is for the https (and any other secure) Protocol, when the "Closed Lock" is displayed in OUR Browser, to be trustworthy and any loss of the user's privacy not be OUR fault.

We should make efforts to ensure that "Private Browsing" (and any concerns regarding "Phishing Protection") are respected and that we do nothing to facilitate this attack upon our users.


Other Person's concerns regarding so-called "legitimate DPI": Users who desired to participate in supposed truly secret communications would simply utilize a prearranged Code or method of communication (a ping) and not reply on our efforts to protect them; so no one should oppose this RFE on that basis.


Our Page: http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/ states: "Mozilla is a proudly non-profit organization dedicated to keeping the power of the Web in people’s hands.", so this RFE is within our Mandate.


Thank you.
