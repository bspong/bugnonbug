On the page [http://www.trackitdown.net/genre/breaks/new_releases.html] when
selecting to listen to a sample, the sample is downloaded and play begins.
However, when scrolling down the page using the mousewheel, the audio stops and
"Transferring data from www.etc" appears on the status bar.

I tried the same page using IE and this issue did not happen.

Also, when switching tabs in the same window, if the active tab is not the tab
where the sample was started, the audio stops. When going back to the tab where
the audio was started, the audio resumes. Why is teh audio not continuing even
when not looking at the stream originating tab?
