this happens to me on all the web pages that have flash objects.
and the bug is that when the context menu of theflash player is on, if I click
on the page somewhere, on the html, the browser rederects me back to the last
page visited(history: back)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.enter any page you want it doesn't matter, this is just the page you will be
send back by the error.
2.then in the same tab open a page that has a flash object on it. right click on
the flash object so that the flash player context's menu appear.
3.then, while the context menu is visible left click anywhere on the page, away
fromthe flash palyer, (for example on some html text).

Actual Results:  
this is the point where the browser is sent back automaticly.

Expected Results:  
nothing, the flash player's context menu should've disapear.

i'm using flash player version 8,0,5,0 on a Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT
5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6. 
i must say that I'm using the mouse gestures extension 1.0.1, but i don't move
my mouse in any directions while normal clicking on the html page.
