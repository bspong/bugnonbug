CPU hog when closing/opening database

my custom extension does use a SQLite database to store information (each db is a "user document"). opening the db once is fine. opening it a second time makes FF get as much CPU as it can (desktop is still usable but slow, I need to kill FF to get back to normal)
opening it a second time means either:
- load a new db. just does a connection = db.openDatabase(nsiFile); connection is a global variable in the main js script, db is the StorageService object
- open a new connection to the already opened db (in a custom autocomplete textbox looking for data in the db)
- refresh the page (chrome://myapp/content/myapp.xul)
the problem occurs on the openDatabe line

also, the problem occurs when closing FF after launching my extension UI (and openDatabase at least once).

bp-e09cca38-12b5-41fb-afc9-543442091004 is a crash report ID with this problem occuring. looks like it's somechere when sqlite tries to free something...

I did look for versions of FF not impacted (because my app worked some time ago! ;) ). FF3.0.10 is fine, FF3.0.11 is affected.

I also have to say that SQLite Manager extension for FF works perfectly fine! something in my code is definitively different but I can't see what. Anyway FF should just insult me for not coding properly and not take my CPU as an hostage...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch my extension (and automatically open db set à preference)
2.Close FF
OR
1.Launch my extension (and automatically open db set à preference)
2.open another db
OR
1.Launch my extension (and automatically open db set à preference)
2.Refresh the page
Actual Results:  
CPU hangs. I need to kill FF.

Expected Results:  
my other db is opened fine!
