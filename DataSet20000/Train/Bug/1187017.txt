Starting today, FF uses a lot of CPU even when idle
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:39.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/39.0
Build ID: 20150630154324

Steps to reproduce:

I'm using FF on a Win7 64-bit Lenovo T410 portable with 8Gb RAM and 4-core i5.  AV is F-Secure.  Win7 updates from MS are up to date.

I just start FF (v.39) and watch the CPU utilisation in Task Manager with no other applications running.


Actual results:

About 30 seconds after starting FF, the CPU utilisation rises from a few percent to 30%+ and stays there for several minutes.  On TaskMan's Processes tab, 27+% of this is attributed to  "firefox.exe *32".  Then it goes through alternating cycles of short periods of 1-2% utilisation before rising again to 27%+.  This behaviour occurs regardless of how many tabs are open in FF and of what sites are open on the tabs.

I've scanned the PC with F-Secure AV, SpyBot Search and Destroy and MalwareBytes premium, all of which are up to date.  None of them finds anything of consequence, just the usual tracking cookie stuff which I allow them to tidy up.  None of this has made any difference to FF's behaviour.  I have rebooted the PC several times, but the behaviour continues.

As noted in the summary, this has only started happening today.  I am running the same FF version on another PC on my LAN and on that, FF has continued to behave normally.

As noted


Expected results:

After starting up FF should settle down to a few % CPU like it usually does.
