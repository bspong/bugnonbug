Firefox 19 crashes using msn.co.uk as homepage, always has worked before, just past 2 days, only works using blank page as home page.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:19.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/19.0
Build ID: 20130215130331

Steps to reproduce:

I have always used Firefox and I use MSN.uk as my home page. 2 days ago I opened Firefox and it crashed (screen frozen), had to shut it using task manager.


Actual results:

  Opened Firefox again and same issue, again closed it using task manager. I can access Firefox menu bar, but as soon as I touch any item on the homepage it crashes. I cannot access any of my saved bookmarks either as Firefox will crash doing this as well.   I opened Internet Explorer and had no problem using MSN as homepage, hmm!


Expected results:

I usually just open Firefox and can open any item from my MSN homepage, not for 2 days now.  I have put in a temporary fix whereby I use a blank page as my home page and therefore can use my saved bookmarks.  I  originally thought that it might be the new version of Firefox, but since this has happened after several days of using the new update, I think not. I have tried disabling plug ins etc, but no use.  I find that I can use other home pages, but not MSN, again MSN works with IE, seems to be a compatibility  issue here?
