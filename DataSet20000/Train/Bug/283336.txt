Receive error : "The connection was refused when attempting to contact
www.clearstar.com." - when attempting to access the site via Firefox/1.0
The problem site (http://www.clearstar.com) can be accessed ok from within the
AOL/9.0SE browser but cannot be accessed from either IE6.0 or Firefox/1.0.
This site (http://www.clearstar.com) had always been accessible through IE/6.0
but I believe the problem started after installing the SP1 upgrade to IE/6.0.
Note: this site (http://www.clearstar.com) is the only one I access which always
brings up a window prior to allowing site access which requires entry of User ID
& Password.  This "password" window will not appear while attempting to access
the site via IE6.0/SP1 or Firefox 1.0.  This "password" window does appear when
access is attempted via AOL/9.0SE. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox/1.0 browser
2.Attempt to access: http://www.clearstar.com 
3.Receive error: "The connection was refused when attempting to contact
www.clearstar.com."

Actual Results:  
Receive error: "The connection was refused when attempting to contact
www.clearstar.com."

Expected Results:  
Expected to see the above described "password" window where User ID & Password
are required prior to allowing access to site.
