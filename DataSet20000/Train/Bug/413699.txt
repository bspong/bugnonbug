populating inline-block elements causes phantom margins on said elements

I apologize profusely if this is invalid/bogus, but it's better safe than sorry and I think I've prepared a reasonable test case for you to work it out anyway.
If an A tag (probably others too) contains certain types of replaced inline elements or block elements, then the box acquired margins on top proportional to the vertical dimension of its child boxes. If the child boxes are not rendered (display:none), then they have no effect on the margin of the parent.

I'm scared that this might be bogus or invalid because I get the same result from safari, opera, virus explorer etc; but I can't find it in the visual formatting model specs.
It made my life fun briefly when I tried to put an image in an inline-block A tag (so I could give it width and height and wrap the line)

In some contexts, the effect can easily be resolved with v-align or positioning, although this will not be suitable in every case.

@ all mozilla developers: thank you for making the web worth browsing.
Once again I apologize if this is an invalid or bogus bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
For author:
1. create A tag in document
2. inline-block with width and height for said tag
3. populate with inline-replacing elements and such, which have nonzero heights

For the um, viewer/client:
Type url, press enter :-p
Actual Results:  
inline-block elements all seem to move to random vertical positions on the suddenly very "tall" line.

Expected Results:  
All elements should retain the initial top and bottom margins. Nothing should become detached from the line or be positioned according to its content.
