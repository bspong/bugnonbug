Some pages has been loaded really slow down because
there is some problem with permission to using call method UnnamedClass.toString.

Error reports:

Error: Permission denied for <http://www.facebook.com> (document.domain=<http://facebook.com>) to call method UnnamedClass.toString on <> (document.domain has not been set).

Error: uncaught exception: unknown (can't convert to string)
