Please view following file in your firefox browser:
http://www.partysaarfari.de/download/bigimage_test.jpg
It's a .jpg file with about 2 Mbytes and a size of
3864 x 5152 Pixels

- At first, whole computer hangs for about 15 to 30 seconds,
because cpu usage is up to 100%. I can't do anything else in that time.
While loading the memory usage is 130 Mbytes of RAM and 180 Mbytes of virtual
- Then, it goes down to 80 MBytes for RAM and 150 MB virtual 
- cpu usage is now back to 1% 
- After some time (1 Minute), memory usage is only 30 Mbytes RAM again and 40 Mbytes virtual


I opened that file also in browser "opera 9"
It's a little bit better there:
- It loads the image also with much cpu usage, but *doesn't hang*
- memory usage is 130 Mbytes RAM and 130 Mbytes virtual while loading
- after loading, it uses 70 Mbytes RAM and 75 Mbytes virtual
- If I minimize opera and maximize window again, it uses only 1 Mbytes RAM and 72 Mbytes virtual.


I think this is a major problem, because it prevents user from opening big images in firefox.

I have a 1 Ghz Duron CPU, 256 Mbytes SDRAM, Geforce 2 MX400 graphics adapter
Win XP SP2
