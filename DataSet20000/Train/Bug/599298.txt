i usually place all my bookmarks on bookmarks toolbar, and create directory structyre there. i place bookmarks using drag and drop of sites. sometimes when i place new bookmarks the list is not refreshing, NEW bookmarks are only accesible from Organize bookmarks window, and from ctrl+n new firefox window, but on the old one(in which they were added) they simply dont appear in bookmarks toolbar(only old ones) 

i experienced this problem in firefox 3,5 3,6 on x86 - on win xp, and linux(ub 8.10-10.04),and on win 7 64bits.
