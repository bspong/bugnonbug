"Edit as HTML" feature in inspector stores all text edits for other nodes, so undo/Ctrl+Z is unpredictable
>>>   My Info:   Win7_64, Nightly 49, 32bit, ID 20160526082509
STR_1:
1. Open url   data:text/html,<a>Firefox regressions </a><b>since version 28</b>
2. Open devtools -> inspector
3. Click on element <a> in markup. Press F2 to edit it as HTML. Press Ctrl+Z

AR:  Text field opened in Step 3 becomes empty
ER:  Text in the text field shouldn't change

Use case:
 I edited the text, and I want to go back to some previous version that was close to initial version of the text. To do that, I hold Ctrl+Z (it works in normal <textarea>s, but not in this text field).



STR_2:
1. Open url   data:text/html,<a>Firefox regressions </a><b>since version 28</b>
2. Open devtools -> inspector
3. Click on element <a> in markup. Press F2 to edit it as HTML. Press Escape to cancel
4. Click on element <b> in markup. Press F2 to edit it as HTML.
5. Type "x", then press Ctrl+Z several times

AR:
 Before the 1st pressing of Ctrl+Z text in codemirror instance is   "x<b>since version 28</b>"    (OK)
 After  the 1st pressing of Ctrl+Z text in codemirror instance is   "<b>since version 28</b>"     (OK)
 After  the 2st pressing of Ctrl+Z text in codemirror instance is   "<a>Firefox regressions </a>"
 After  the 3st pressing of Ctrl+Z text in codemirror instance is   ""
ER:
 After N-th pressing of Ctrl+Z (N>0) text in codemirror instance should be "<b>since version 28</b>"
