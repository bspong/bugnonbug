If I open one window only, then it's fine.  If I open two or more tabs or windows, then everything shunts to the left.  The scroll bar that is normally to the right of the screen moves to the left, all panels are to the left of that (off screen) and I can see nothing.  I've had to switch back to Safari, which allows me to open multiple tabs.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a window.
2. Go to a website.
3. Go to a second web site.
Actual Results:  
The scroll bar that is normally to the right of the screen moves to the left, all panels are to the left of that (off screen) and I can see nothing.  Well, I can see a blank screen with a scroll bar to its left.  If I try to close the window, I get the 'you are attempting to close ____ tabs warning, so your software thinks there are tabs.  

Expected Results:  
It should have shown me tabbed windows.  In the old version, I got to read web sites.  

Am I going to have to lose all of my bookmarks if I want to use Firefox?  What's happening?
