On the history datasource, GetSource with referrer as target return the URL itself

I'm trying to trace the history upwards, from parent referer to the last page checked. As my XUL template didn't seem to work, I then tried to debug it in javascript. I finally found that when using GetSource(s) to get a target's referrer, the result would by the target itself. 

Example session : google.com -> results for "mozilla" -> mozilla website.
if I ask for mozilla website's referrer, it gives the results page 
( mozilla , referrer , ? ) -> google results. That's ok.
but if I ask which pages google results refers to, it doesn't work
( ? , referrer , google results ) -> google results. Bad !
Doesn't work either with getSources , still gives only one result, which is faulty.

I checked the sources for nsGlobalHistory.cpp but I can't figure it out.

Here is my test :

	var RDF = Components.
	            classes["@mozilla.org/rdf/rdf-service;1"].
                getService(Components.interfaces.nsIRDFService);
	
	var globalHistoryGraph = Components.
	                           classes["@mozilla.org/rdf/datasource;1?name=history"].
                               getService(Components.interfaces.nsIRDFDataSource);

	var list = globalHistoryGraph.GetAllResources() ;
	var str = "" ;
	var property = RDF.GetResource("http://home.netscape.com/NC-rdf#Referrer") ;
	while (list.hasMoreElements()) {
		var target = list.getNext().QueryInterface(Components.interfaces.nsIRDFResource) ;

		var source = globalHistoryGraph.GetSource(property,target,true) ;
		if (source) {
			target = target.QueryInterface(Components.interfaces.nsIRDFResource) ;
			str += "'"+ target.Value + "' is referred by '" + source.Value +"'\n" ;
		}
	}
	alert(str) ;

Reproducible: Always
