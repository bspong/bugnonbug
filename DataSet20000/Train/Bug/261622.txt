behave-like-IE extension as default, to stop mutilation of Firefox-program

I don't like to see Firefx becoming more and more mutilated to just behave like IE.

- In bug 259362, for example there the feature to open the PageInfo-window for
webpages with full-size java applets ore flash animations has been given up to
just have a short cut like IE. Now, one function ine Firefox has 2 short cuts,
the other none.

- In bug 257411 comment #5 the feature to delete multiple history items is given
up to just be like IE. bug 217472 comment #30.


I guess there are much more such examples.





I think a better solution would be to add a simple extension that applies such
IE-behaviours. This extension may be included to Firefox download and activated
by default. But advanced users could uninstall (or just dectivate) this
extension. So there would be no need anymore to mutilate Firefox. Things that
should be IE-like for users who switched from IE to Firefox could be changed in
this extension, not in the Firefox-program anymore!
