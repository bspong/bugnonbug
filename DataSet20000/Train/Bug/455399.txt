Logmein.com, it works for me all the time, however at random intervals it will cause the browser to crash requiring a restart.  The problem will happen right after I log into a computer on my account, sometimes it will work great for an hour or so, then even without me doing anything it will crash.

Firefox has also caused my computer random lockups, the machine will become unresponsive for a matter of seconds to a minute or so, then it will resume as normal, sometimes after this happens firefox will crash. I really feel this is due to a logmein.com issue though, as it only happens when logmein is being accessed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.restart firefox
2.go to logmein.com
3.log into a machine
Actual Results:  
Sometimes it will crash, sometimes it will stay up and crash shortly after, but 99% of the time it results in a firefox crash, its just a matter of when
