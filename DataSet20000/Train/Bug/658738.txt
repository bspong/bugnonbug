[meta] We seem to be leaking hundreds of windows until shutdown during browser-chrome tests
I was looking at http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/Firefox/1305941364.1305945463.28696.gz for unrelated reasons, and noticed that at the end of the test there are about 500 DOMWINDOW objects around, and only a few docshells.  So I grabbed the log and looked at the urls of the windows being destroyed _after_ the hidden window.  The top offenders of the 500 or so windows left at that point are:

  339 about:blank
   96 chrome://browser/content/browser.xul
   84 about:addons

I tried a quick test of just opening and closing windows locally and the browser.xul windows go away.

Oh, during that whole test run about 186 chrome://browser/content/browser.xul windows go away.

And windows are going away through the run as we go, so it's not like _all_ windows leak.  Just a bunch of them.  Looking at the log, we seem to have both inner and outer browser.xul windows around at the end there.

The big question: is this just test code holding on to windows?  Or is this test code calling code that would normally run in our UI and holds on to windows?

Again, all the windows are _closed_ (no docshell) but the inner and outer window objects are hanging around at shutdown.

It'd be nice if someone familiar with the browser tests took a look at which tests are opening the windows that leak or something.  Do we have any other ways of finding their allocation points?
