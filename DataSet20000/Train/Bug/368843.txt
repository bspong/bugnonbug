A site such as the National Weather Service weather site for city requires JAVA to be enabled since it uses a JAVA looping application. FF 2.0.0.1 crashes to a complete browser shut down closing all open tabs when JAVA is enabled to use these site when the feature requiring JAVA is initiated. In 2.0.0 and prior versions having two loops open at the same time would just cause a complete freeze of all tabs but leave them open. After closing, FF2.0.0 would run in the background with windows frozen requiring forced shutdown and restart. I am using an HP/Compaq nc8230 laptop with a gig of memory and XP-Pro. These types of sites work IE 7.0. The JAVA interface with FF2.0.0.1 does not work. Please fix it this is frustrating to have to use a MS product.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enable JAVA applets and JAVA
2.Go to http://radar.weather.gov/radar.php?rid=LWX&product=NCR&overlay=11101111&loop=yes
3.Go to radar picture and click on it
4. Click on any loop feature in left margin menu
5. FF 2.0.0.1 should shut down
Actual Results:  
Complete shutdown of 2.0.0.1

Expected Results:  
A JAVA looping application loads and the last 15-20 minutes of NWS radar image should begin looping

FIX THIS IT used to WORK
