Posting in Forums = 404 errors, and "Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand"

When I try to Post in Forums I always get 404 errors (Page Can not be found)
I also get "Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand"

Some websites, when I am asked to click buttons like Submit, proceed, Continue, and sometimes search, I get the 404 error and when searching I get "Bad Request (Invalid Verb) 

I have these problems with IE, Bon Echo, and FireFox. Thats the only browsers i use.

This seems to be the only website I can post at.

Errors every time

I'm not to worried about the search not working, as much as I am about posting in forums. That is a major problem for me.
