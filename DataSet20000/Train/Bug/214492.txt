Hi, first of all.
Nice thing you did with Thunderbird.

Enough of this, to the point.. 
I am trying mozilla for the first time, and I am quite happy with the results. But:
The homepage 
http://tng.kicks-ass.org/board/
has still to be loaded by my poor old IE. 
The problem, my Thunderbird isn't loading all pictures. Most of them appear as
broken links, (but they do work!) and for example smileys in threads are not
displayed at all.
And .. in mozilla, I miss the function IE provides, Show picture.
IE doesn't open a new window for the pic, it just loads the broken link on it's
current location. Mozilla opens a new page for the picture.. 

Btw, i don't use any proxies.

cheers, UNI

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just load the Homepage http://tng.kicks-ass.org/board/
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
see for yourself, page isn't willing to load images

Expected Results:  
Show me some smileys, thread symbols etc.

The problem can be fixed by viewing every little picture first and then reload
the page. That is a workaround, but no excuse for this .. bug :(
