mouse is flickering when opening a web page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; fr-FR; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041108 Firefox/1.0

On all the pages Firefox causes the mouse cursor to
flicker badly. This happens in the client area of the screen where the
webpage is due to appear. Moving the cursor onto the sidebar, address bar,
toolbar, or menu bar halts the flickering. Once the cursor is moved back into
the client area again, (provided the page is still loading), the flickering
starts again.

Once the page has completed loading, the flickering does not happen at all!

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:

It is happening when loading all Web pages, not only pages that take a 
considerable amount of time to load
it is not happening on all the computers, but my config is OK (500 MHz)



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into www.yahoo.com
2. Click on alink (whatever the link) 
3. Observe the cursor flickering whilst the site is loading the required data.

Actual Results:  
Badly flickering cursor after step 2 


Expected Results:  
Mouse moves fluently

as for me, it is very blocking : I uninstalled Firefox, I am waiting for a 
better version...
