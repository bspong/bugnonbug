Can't load / use Yahoo! Mail Beta with Firefox 2.0
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; InfoPath.1)

I had been using Yahoo!mail Beta for several weeks accessing through Firefox 2.0.  Then on 20070207, the beta version did not load, but the "old" version did load (everything was fine with my mail).  I have tried to switch to mail beta, but to no avail.  HOWEVER, MY YAHOO! MAIL ACCESSED THROUGH INTERNET EXPLORER 6 IS THE BETA VERSION???!!!  So it appears that the problem is with Firefox and not Yahoo, whom I blamed for the situation.  Comments??

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Find a "Try It Now" link to convert to Yahoo mail beta and activate it.
2.Mail opens with the standard mail handler.
3.Access my mail through IE6 and it opens with Yahoo Mail Beta!!!



I don't know who else this might be affecting.  I assume a large number of people use Yahoo Mail, but I don't know what percentage of them care to use the Beta version and I don't know how many of them use Firefox.  It works fine with the industry "standard", IE6, so many of the Beta users might not have run into it as a problem yet.

Should I uninstall Firefox and reinstall it to se if that fixes the problem??
