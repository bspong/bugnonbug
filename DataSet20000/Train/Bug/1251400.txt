firefox in front of taskbar

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:44.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/44.0
Build ID: 20160210153822

Steps to reproduce:

Exactly the same as bug id 127160 from 2002, but this happens in the year 2016 with Windows 10 build 1115 with current bugfixes and firefox 44.0.2. To reproduce:
1. set taskbar to autohide
2. press upper right corner symbol to fullscreen firefox window


Actual results:

taskbar does not come up as it is behind the firefox window.


The bug is also visible if you move a windowed firefox down that it overlaps taskbar. When moving the mouse down to screen border, taskbar moves up, but behind firefox window, see attached screenshot.


Expected results:

taskbar should get visible in front of firefox. This was still happening in Windows 8.1 with the same firefox 44.0.2.

If you don't fullscreen firefox but move the window down that it partially overlaps with the taskbar height, then you can see that firefox is in front of the taskbar. In firefox fullscreened taskbar then is no more reached. Tested with many other applications, also Thunderbird 38.6.0, there the taskbar is in front of the application.
