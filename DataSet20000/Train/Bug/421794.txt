Adding extension causes slowdown in link hover

I noticed very slow handling of some actions in the browser for quite some time
and put some effort in finding the reason last month. By trial and error I
found the extension prefbar to cause the slowdown (see
https://www.mozdev.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=18655 for discussion). Lowering
down the problem it doesn't seem prefbar specific but caused by just adding an
overlay.

No, this isn't related with bug 421353 since it occurs with older and newer builds and underline doesn't have to be recomputed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the coming attached testcase
2. Move the mouse over the links.

Actual Results:  
I've to move the mouse quite slow so no line fails to show the hover view. If
moving faster the hover will lag behind and skips links.


Expected Results:  
Also on fastest moving the hover should be shown for each and every line
without lag. And that's the way it works without the extension.


I guess the visibility depends on the hardware. Mine is about 7 years old, but
hardware isn't the issue since it's ok without the overlay extension.
