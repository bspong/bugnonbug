Copy and paste into a properties of a bookmarklet freezeze the requester, requiring it to be reopened for editing.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060308 Ubuntu/9.04 (jaunty) Firefox/3.0.11

When I paste in the url to add it into the bookmarklet, properties will not accept any input from the keyboard, I have to click "save changes", and reopen to continue editing the bookmarklet.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Edit a bookmarklet
2.Paste url into bookmarklet

Actual Results:  
Properties will not respond. 

Expected Results:  
To be able to continue editing the bookmarklet without having to close and reopen the properties window. 

Last bookmarklet I tried this with is the linkify bookmarklet from here

I like to replace the search string with a regex like [A-Z][a-z]+[ ][A-Z][a-z]+ to match names, then around the "A.href = M.data", I will pop in a google search url, this will make any names on a page appear as google search links, by clicking the bookmarklet. Because of firefox's behaviour while editing these url's (or bookmarklets), it makes editing them a pain in the rear.
