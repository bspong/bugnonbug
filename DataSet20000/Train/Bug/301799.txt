1. Log-in to www.hotmail.com
2. Open an existing "HTML" or "RTF" format mail

4. If you have RTF / Text as the default format in sending mails out, then the
existing mail text that is being forwarded is displayed as junk. All formating
characters of the format are visible and not decoded correctly. Also if the
default mail sending out format is RTF, then the RTF tolbar is also not visible.
