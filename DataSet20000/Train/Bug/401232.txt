For the past three days, Firefox very frequently encounters an error and has to shut down. I reinstalled the latest version of firefox, but this has not made any difference. When launching Firefox again and choosing restore session, four out of five times the tabs stay in reloading mode without actually reloading the sites. Once, this happened while I was checking cookies in the cookie manager - when I restarted Firefox after that, some of the individual website cookie folders had vanished and the websites in question appeared in the blocked cookies folder.

This happens regardless of what sites my tabs are on, it doesn't occur as a result of any particular action or as a result of surfing any particular website. I wonder if it is connected to the fact that my latest Norton upgrade has placed a toolbar in the browser.
