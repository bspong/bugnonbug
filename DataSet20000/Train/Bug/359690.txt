Forms Double Posting

I created a content management system that uses both POST and GET data to navigate. The GET data tells the system what to do, such as edit, add, etc. The POST data is what is entered into forms. When posting updates, Firfox seems to double post. Once with the data entered, and once with blank data. These are .php files connecting to a MYSQL database.

I had the program e-mail me everytime the UPDATE script was ran. The e-mail outputs the time, and then outputs the MYSQL script, then outputs the user agent. Here is what I got:

EMail 1:

SUBJECT: November 06, 2006 12:05:14 PM 0.56983900 1162832714

UPDATE `pages` SET 
			`title` = 'Hello',  
			`text` = 'trying this is in Firefox', 
			`image` = '',
			`layout` = '1', 
			`live` = 'n',
			`section` = '10',
			`group_id` = '',
			`featured` = 'n',
			`call_header` = '',
			`call_text` = '',
			`update_date` = '1162832714'
			WHERE `id` = '54'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0



EMail 2:

Subject: November 06, 2006 12:05:15 PM 0.95907800 1162832715

UPDATE `pages` SET 
			`title` = '',  
			`text` = '', 
			`image` = '',
			`layout` = '', 
			`live` = 'n',
			`section` = '',
			`group_id` = '',
			`featured` = 'n',
			`call_header` = '',
			`call_text` = '',
			`update_date` = '1162832715'

Where in this second e-mail, the little data that is filled in is automatic, such as the time, and if there is no data, use "n'. There appears to be less than 1/2 a second between them. The 0.xxx number is microtime, the second number is the UNIX timestamp.

So firefox is breaking these forms. And I've got about 120 of them over many different sites. I first noticed this Saturday when demonstrating a form. These forms worked fine for the 1.X releases.

This also appears to happen after the inital page has rendered. The page loads with all of the correct data, but when viewing the database afterwards, the record is blank.

Also, I'd like to note that this has happened on 3 different machines in 3 different locations. All were MS Win XP.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log Into content Management
2. Open Record
3. Submit Chnages
4. Data appears on the page, but the database is empty.

Actual Results:  
Blank Database record, but correct data shown on form. I'm thinking it happens like this:
Database Updated Correctly
Database Info grabbed
Database Updated with Blank Data

Expected Results:  
Data should be what was inserted into forms.
