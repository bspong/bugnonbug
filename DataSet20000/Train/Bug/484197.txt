CSS background-color style applied to HTML <select> list of US States fails when "Alabama" appears at the top, with correct spelling and in alphabetical order. If I misspell the word ("AL Alabam") the style works. If I move "AL Alabama" to 5th or lower in the <option> list, the style works. Putting it correctly spelled in its correct alphabetic order breaks the style--it seems to be totally dependent on that particular word!

I have ONLY reproduced this on FF 3.0.7 under OSX. Does not occur for FF in PC, and does not reproduce in IE and Safari.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.use this CSS to style the menu: 

select.dropmenu {
background-color: #001352; 
color: #ffffff; 
}

2.Bkgd style broken, with "AL alabama" at the top

Bkgd style works, with "AL Alabam" (misspelled) at the top:

Bkgd style broken, with "AL alabama" moved down below 5th on the list:

Actual Results:  
Background color CSS styling seems dependent on actual text content of the list--bizarre!

Expected Results:  
FF should not care where "Alabama" occurs in a drop menu or whether it's spelled correctly! Weirdest darn thing I've ever encountered!
