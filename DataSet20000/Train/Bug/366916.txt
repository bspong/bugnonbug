This is duplicate of the problem I had with first release of Firefox 1.5.  When logging onto certain websites that require javascript password checking the website returns the error

Your browser is not capable of viewing this site because it does not support JavaScript or JavaScript may be disabled. Please enable JavaScript.

All JavaScript options are enabled.

This problems was previously fixed in Firefox updates to 1.5 (I think it was 1.5.2? by the time I was able to use it).  I just updated to 2.0.0.1 and am going to look for a copy of 1.5 to downgrade.  The website in question is my personal bank.

My current work-around is to use Safari (Mac OSX proprietary browser).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  commercebank.com
2.  Online Services
     Online banking
        LOG IN (select to change to https://banking.commercebank.com/CBI/login.aspx  )
3.  Site accepts username, but when password is entered JavaScript error is returned.
Actual Results:  
Site returns message:

Your browser is not capable of viewing this site because it does not support JavaScript or JavaScript may be disabled. Please enable JavaScript.

Expected Results:  
Correct log in and site access
