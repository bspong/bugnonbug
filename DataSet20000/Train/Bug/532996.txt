A group of about 3 pixels appear every time you right click on an image within the carousel located on the bottom of the provided page. If you disable the image's source via Firebug, and give it dimensions, the same set of pixels show up below the first, and at a distance equal to the height of the image. Upon disabling anchor outline, the pixels will disappear. This however is not an option for us due to accessibility reasons.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://g.sports.yahoo.com/soccer/world-cup/
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page.
3. Right click on any image in the Carousel located at the bottom of the page.

Actual Results:  
Notice the anchor outline as well as 3 pixels towards the upper left corner of the image.

Expected Results:  
These pixels should not show up.

For some evidence that this probably isn't an issue caused by a site's styles, please see this different site:

Again, scroll to the bottom of the page, right click the next button of the thumb strip. Note the 3 pixels showing up in the upper left hand corner of the button.
