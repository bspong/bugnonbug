Some in-content preferences panes are not showing
rfeeley saw this, and I'm filing on his behalf.

He seemed to get into a state where some panes (applications, security, sync, content) will not be switched to, or will only show a blank pane.

I opened up his Browser Console and here's what I saw after attempting to switch to the content pane a few times:

Error initializing preference category paneContent: TypeError: preference.setElementValue is not a 
preferences.js:133
TypeError: preference.setElementValue is not a function
content.js:221:9

preferences.js:133
TypeError: preference.setElementValue is not a function

Which suggests to me that somewhere, somehow the preference XBL binding isn't being attached to the thing we're calling setElementValue on.

rfeeley says he's seen this a few times, and that it might have something to do with having an unverified sync account, since that's what he was testing when he started seeing this.
