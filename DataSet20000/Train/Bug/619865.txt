Please forgive me as I am somewhat new to reporting bugs. 

I'm having a major issue with Firefox that started only very recently- about a week before the new 3.6.13 update- and it has, unfortunately, continued to occur since updating as well. 

Seemingly out of nowhere, a small About:Blank window opens, followed by this error popup:

[Exception... "Security error"  code: "1000" nsresult: "0x805303e8 (NS_ERROR_DOM_SECURITY_ERR)"  location: "<unknown>"]

Immediately after I click "OK" on the error popup, another small About:Blank window opens, again followed by the same error popup > I click "OK" > another About:Blank window. . . and it continues on & on & on, and will not stop until I am forced to shut down Firefox through my task manager > "end task". When I restart Firefox it is usually fine, for a while, before it will inevitably begin to happen again.
 
Now when I said that this issue starts "seemingly out of nowhere" I wasn't being entirely accurate- I just can't seem to nail it down exclusively to some one particular website or action. But to note, when this whole "multiple About:Blank windows/error popups" thing *initially* started, it was almost always, and only, while on the Wikipedia website. In fact, I had attributed the Wikitweaks add-on to be the most likely cause. However, after promptly uninstalling it, not only did the error remain, but it also had begun to occur on websites other than Wikipedia. Also note that the error does not ALWAYS occur every time I am on Wikipedia either- but it has, and does, enough that I feel it necessary to make mention of it. 

Lastly- I tried to  research a fix for this before reporting it. Though I have found a handful of mentions of this exact same problem- About:Blank windows, error code & all- in various forums (one even specifically naming Wikipedia as the perceived antagonist as well), I have not yet found a solution. 
  And  actually, I had only come across one MAY be cause, which involves the About:Config editor and checking two particular settings: 
-one being that the "dom.storage.enabled" value is set to "true" (it is) ; 
-and the other, that the "dom.storage.default_quota" value is set to "5120" (it is). 

That's all I've got (that I can remember). Take care!
