Corel Presentations X3 cannot call links using Firefox but can using IE

I regularly use Corel Presentations X3 on three computers, one (not mine) with IE as the default browswer; two (mine) with Firefox.  Calls to the Internet work inside IE, but with Firefox, on both computers, I regularly get this message for all efforts to browse or link from inside PResentations:

Error trying to execute -- C:\PROGRA~1\MOZILL~1\FIREFOX.EXE -- requestPending-osint

I notice by using the Windows Task Manager that another program, Netscape Web Browser Integration, is called; it closes when I click OK on the error message.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open PResentations X3
2.Try to browse to Internet site, or while running Presentations call previously embedded Internet site
3.Error trying to execute -- C:\PROGRA~1\MOZILL~1\FIREFOX.EXE -- requestPending-osint
Actual Results:  
Error trying to execute -- C:\PROGRA~1\MOZILL~1\FIREFOX.EXE -- requestPending-osint

Expected Results:  
Opened the Internet site I called.

This did not happen last year, using the same Presentations files as I am now using.  Corel asserts that it is a Firefox problem, not their problem.
