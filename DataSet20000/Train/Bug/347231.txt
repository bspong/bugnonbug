"Clear Private Data" doesn't always clear Error Console even though configured to clear history

When attempting to find updates for Add-ons there usually are many messages logged in the Error Console regarding the attempt to find updates.  These messages are not cleared when using Clear Private Data even though CPD is configured to clear my history.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Launch FF
2) Launch Error Console and "Clear" contents
3) Launch Add-ons and click "Find Updates"
4) "Alt-tab" to Error Console and verify you have messages logged regarding the attempt to "Find Updates"
5) "Alt-tab to FF and "Clear Private Data"
6) Verify that the messages in the Error Console have not been cleared

Actual Results:  
Error console contained messages previously logged.

Expected Results:  
Error console should have been empty.

I've noticed that if there are errors (and I believe warnings) present then everything will be cleared.  If errors are not present and you attempt to reproduce the steps above then nothing will be cleared.
