When trying to save a file the windows save dialog is broken or crippled in certain situations. Specific examples include when downloading a file, or when right-clicking on an image and choosing save image as. When the save dialog comes up, you are able to navigate existing folders. However right-clicking within folder and choosing "New" on the pop-up menu shows a sub-menu that only has "new" on it. The dialog works correctly in every other application and situation, including identical situations in both Opera and IE. the only place that I can get the save dialog to work correctly in firefox is if choose File .. Save As from the main menu to save a web page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start downloading a file by clicking on a link on a page, or save an image by right-clicking on it and choosing save images as.
2.right click within a selected folder to bring up the pop-up menu
3. choose new.
Actual Results:  
only "New" shows up, and it's not usable.

Expected Results:  
Folder, txt file, etc. Ie the normal New sub-menu.
