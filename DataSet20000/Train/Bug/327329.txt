While watching a home webcam, Panasonic HCM-250, if machine sleeps, firefox crashes.  I can view menus, but highlighting is not working and cannot select options.  Cannot go to any other web sites.  Quitting FF leaves firefox.exe process running, and I have to kill that to get FF to start up again properly.

If machine does not sleep, stream is visible indefinitely.

Any sleep reproduces the crash.  I can't use the crash reporter to file the details, because FF is non-responsive.

These are private webcams, so I am reluctant to provide site and password.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to panasonic web cam site
2. let machine go to sleep
3. Wake machine, see FF dead.
4. Need to ctl-alt-del, and separately kill firefox.exe process to free machine

Actual Results:  
as described above

Expected Results:  
FF should wake up with machine and begin displaying stream.  Or even wake up and show broken stream, but it should not freeze up so bad.

this is on a sony Vaio laptop.
