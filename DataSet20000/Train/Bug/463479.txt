Firefox3.03 produces blank page when posting quick reply in vBulletin when adsense code is in postbit_legacy
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; MS-RTC LM 8)

This should probably be in broken web page, but I don't have the skillz to  build your code.

When a member posts a quick reply using Firefox 3.03 the member clicks the post quick reply button to submit the text, then Firefox displays a blank page.  Viewing source confirms that there is no code.  Error Console shows the following error

Error: window.google_render_ad is not a function
Source File: http://www.formatandreload.com/forum/showthread.php?t=18786&page=15
Line: 1

This only happens if Firefox 3, FF2, IE 6/7/8 and Opera process the page correctly. 

vBulletin Version is 3.7.3 PL1

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Post a quick reply at www.formatandreload.com using default style
2. Click post quick reply button 
3. see blank page
4. click back then refresh to see the quick reply you submitted.
Actual Results:  
entirely blank page with the word stopped on the status bar 

Expected Results:  
The software should have displayed the page with the new post at the bottom

I have 4 users all complaining of this problem, but they won't give up FF3.  I have posted at adsense and at vBulletin and the most useful reply I got was "something's interfering with the javascript".

Because this involves a particular circumstance it is very easy for vBulletin and adsense and Firefox to blame each other.  Please feel free to contact me if you would like to try this on my forum. You can see the posts at vBulletin here http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/showthread.php?p=1648741
