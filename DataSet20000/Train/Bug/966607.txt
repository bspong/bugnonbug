Tabs from last session are empty when starting firefox aurora
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:28.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/28.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140131004003

Steps to reproduce:

Firefox is set on displaying tabs from last session when restarting. I have open 40-100 tabs in tab groups. Starting a week ago (with an update to Aurora) I lost all open tabs without the possibility to restore them or open a closed window. Whenever I open firefox, some tabs from the last session are empty.

Alternatively I tried it with a new profile and only two pinned tabs. They still lost the content when opening firefox after closing it.



Actual results:

Opening firefox some pinned tabs and some normal tabs are empty. The tabs seem to be arbitrary, though it is always the same websites that get lost when closing firefox. The update to Aurora in the meantime changed which websites cannot be loaded from the last session.

There is no error message or anything, but the tab looses its complete history (it is as if I opened a new tab and just leave it there). The complete history of the browser remembers what I visited in the tabs, so it is really only the tab that looses the information that it displayed said page.



Expected results:

All tabs from the last session should be restored when closing and reopening firefox.
