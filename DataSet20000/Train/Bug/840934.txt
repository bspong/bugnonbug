Google Analytics graph or JS error reported through window.onerror handler

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:18.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/18.0
Build ID: 20130201065344

Steps to reproduce:

We have a canvas page on Facebook with about 1700000 daily visits from Firefox 18. As you can see in the attached screenshot of our google analytics page since you released version 18 we started receiving JS error: "document.getElementsByTagName(...)[0] is undefined" and we get about 6000 these errors per day. The screenshot shows it only happens in Firefox and we checked the version and it is only in version 18. We don't log the error line since our JS is minified so all code is in one line, but we only use this in one place in our code like this:

document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(e);

And the only other place something like this appears is in google's swfobject.js library. We couldn't reproduce this but you should probably investigate what was changed since version 18 that could cause this.


Actual results:

Since version 18 Firefox occasionally started to report this error in our Javascript.


Expected results:

No other version and no other browser reports this error, so Firefox 18 shouldn't either.
