The window close button sometimes doesn't work (keeps flickering and does nothing)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When trying to close a window by clicking the standard windows close button (the red x button on Vista's Aero), the window hangs for a moment, the button flickers (as if being pressed multiple times), and nothing happens.
At this point everything is really slow in this window, like the context menu takes forever to show up, or sometimes only the outline is shown, etc (however, other windows work fine).
Then, the only way to actually close the window is to Ctrl-F4 it, or by right clicking on the taskbar button (and even this sometimes does not work).
This happens to all browser windows (including the add-ons preferences window), and has been happening randomly since version 3.5 (or maybe 3.5.1).
Once all the offending windows are closed, the remaining windows (may) work fine, even without a firefox restart.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open two or three windows
2. Open tabs, navigate to some sites
3. Try to close each window, by pressing the window close button
Actual Results:  
Sometimes a window won't close, and even hang

Expected Results:  
Should've closed
