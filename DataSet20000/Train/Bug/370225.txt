child browser window opened via js cannot focus on parent via window.opener.focus

I use javascript to create new child window and set its opener as in:

<script language=javascript>
function openWindow() {
BFWin = open('display/somepage.php', 'BFWin');
BFWin.opener = window;
}
</script>

After that in child window, I try to focus on parent window using javascript:

        <script language=javascript>
        function focusOnParent() {  
        var pw = window.opener;
          if (pw && !pw.closed ) {
            //pw.alert('wha?');
            window.blur();
            pw.focus();
            window.close();
          } 
        }
        </script>

Note if I uncomment pw.alert line - it works and alerts the right parent tab, meaning I have a correct parent object window as opener. 

However if I call the function on child window - it closes child and goes to the right-most opened tab INSTEAD of parent. Very uncool.

So js window.opener.focus() doesn't work in FF 2.0.0.1 (linux ubuntu OS)

Reproducible: Always
