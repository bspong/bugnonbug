After updating my mozlla inbounds installation today, many file types (irrelevant to Firefox) don't open with their default app (you get a prompt to choose a default app, instead), and 'Nightly' is added among "Other options (to open the file with)"
I use m-i x64 (http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/tinderbox-builds/mozilla-inbound-win64/latest/) in win10 x64.

Today after updating m-i (running the installer on top of my m-i installation -and have set in Default Apps the "Nightly" as my default browser- // using win10 x64 )
a lot of file types (that used to have been set to open with a default app)
for example: .txt (Notepad),  .doc,.docx(Word 2016), avi (MPC-HC) .pdf(Acrobat), etc,etc
now when doubleclicking them to open in File Explorer,
they doesn't open with that app automatically.
Instead you get a prompt to manually choose a default app.
On this prompt the previously set default app is already selected
but the checkbox e.g. "Always use this app to open .txt file" is unchecked,(so I have to click it for each one myself and press Ok)
Below that, for all of these cases, the first entry in "Other options" is "Nightly", as you may see in the 4 screenshots below:

Also, rightclicking on a .txt file shows this:

I tried to recreate it in a clean win10 x64 installation (in a virtual machine)
but it didn't occur.
(I noticed though that after installing/updating Nightly there, if you rightclick for example a .txt, the "Nightly" doesn't appear as an available entry, i.e. as expected).


I also ran nirsoft's FileTypesMan and there's no Nightly-related entries except for .htm and .html documents.



Uninstalling Firefox m-i immediately fixes the problem, i.e. all files open again automatically with their default app without getting a prompt.
