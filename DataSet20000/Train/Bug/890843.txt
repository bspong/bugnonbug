Missing control capabilities on animated GIFs for a user (GIF Player capabilities: pause, stopping, per frame forward etc)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:23.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/23.0 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:

In wikipedia, there is a extensive usage (alone on commons 7700 are listed http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Animated_GIF) of animated GIFs for presenting technical or medical phenomenas. E.g. this one: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gef%C3%A4%C3%9Fmalformation, showing a 3D image of a medical phenomena as 2d slices in a looped animation.

As reader I a can't stop the animation or forward frame by frame to take a detailed look.


Actual results:

No way to control the animation for a reader, neither a menu after right-mouse-button click nor a control menu by a player is available.


Expected results:

The reader should have a possibility to control the animation like it is possible with other video formats.

Some kind of solution exists in form of a javascript player, called JSGIF, which could be used as prototype or directly as solution as the code is under MIT license.

Another solution would be if the firefox would accept GIF as supported format for the HTML5 video tag, at the moment no browser seems to allow this (http://dashes.com/anil/2011/07/animated-gifs-triumphant.html)
