If I close and reopen Firefox, many important navigational features become inaccessible. The Home Page does not appear when Firefox is reopened. Alt+Home triggers the Mozilla Start Page, which is no longer my homepage. When a link is clicked on, the address bar does not display the URL of the page I am visiting. The back, forward, refresh and stop features do not work. The favicon does not appear next to the address bar. Minor freezing occurs on pages with GIF animation. My bookmarks disappear.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox 3.0.1. 
2. Close Firefox 3.0.1. 
3. Reopen Firefox 3.0.1. 
Actual Results:  
The Home Page does not appear when Firefox is reopened. Alt+Home triggers the Mozilla Start Page, which is no longer my homepage. When a link is clicked on, the address bar does not display the URL of the page I am visiting. The back, forward, refresh and stop features do not work. The favicon does not appear next to the address bar. Minor freezing occurs on pages with GIF animation. My Bookmarks disappear.
