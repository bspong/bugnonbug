This page uses a file upload tool developed by CuteSoft.net (AjaxUploader). It has worked fine since installation. Now my customers are complaining that the tool no longer works - specifically the "upload files now" button.

After some research, the issue only occurs with Windows Firefox 3.63. The tool works fine with Firefox 3.59, Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari. We have no choice but to tell our customers to use another browser until this is fixed.

I have tested this with Windows FF 3.59, FF 3.63, Chrome, Safari, IE. Only the FF 3.63 does not work.

I have tested this with Mac FF 3.63 and the tool works as it should.

I un-installed FF 3.63 on the PC (including booksmark and any related items), re-installed FF 3.59. The tool works fine. I updated to 3.63, and the tool does not work.

I have tested this on different PC's (XP and Vista) and got the same results as above.
