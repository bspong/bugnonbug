Webpages don't display when moving between tabs, you have to scroll up and down to refresh the displayed page

Firefox 3.6 RC1/2 has a problem with the forums on avforums.com. I have about 30 tabs open from about 20 different sites but when i try switching between tabs on avforums.com the displayed page doesn't update, you need to scroll up and down for the content to be refreshed. Restarting firefox fixes this problem but if you use firefox for a few hours this will likely happen again (assuming you have "show my windows and tabs from last time" enabled), this has happened every day for the last few days for me, it only affects this website for me, all other websites except that work fine.

Here is a video to demonstrate the problem: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AObZ3rtbNjI

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open many tabs, have some with the threads from the forums at avforums open
2. surf for a few hours, if the problem of switching between tabs doesn't happen then restart firefox and try this again for a few hours.
3. if this problem does happen for you then scroll up and down for the page to be refreshed
Actual Results:  
pages aren't displayed when switching between tabs, you need to scroll up and down to fix this

Expected Results:  
the pages to be refreshed

I only have adblock plus installed, no other add-ons. Latest stable flash and silverlight are also installed.
