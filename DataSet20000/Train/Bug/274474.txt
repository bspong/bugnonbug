Firefox will not open with SP2 installed
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Cannot open Firefox after downloading it. Removed and re-downloaded three times,
and tried to open different ways (icon, Windows Explorer, Programs) but did not
open. I get the hourglass momentarily but it won't open.

I removed SP2 and Firefox opened/worked fine. Contacted Microsoft about SP2 and
they said to contact you.

This appears to be similar to Bug 273098 but when I went to link:
(https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=225894#c32) with possible fix it
referred to Monzilla and Shockwave. But according to Microsoft their impression
is a conflict which seems to me to be more basic than some unique fix on my
computer. This seems to me to be a fundamental problem warranting a fix in your
program? (Besides, to be honest, such a fix - which is only a 'try this?' may be
beyond my computer skills as it seemed complicated and I am afraid may mess up
my computer with no assurances it will work.) 

Is there a (simpler) fix known to work you can provide me with, or is there a
fundamental fix in the program that you need to do?

Thanks.
