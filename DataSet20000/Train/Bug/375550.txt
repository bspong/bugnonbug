Bookmark normal function. With the older Mozilla programs [pre-release of SeaMonkey as replacemnt for Mozilla browser,] these were non-issues between all mozilla browsers. This seems to occur only between foxfire and seamonkey. Reproduced these results with three of my computers, 32bit and 64bit. With Identical results. I wish I could give more in the line of program info, I'm just a computer mechanic. I would enjoy a reply or notification of a post, thanks for your ear, your work is great.
