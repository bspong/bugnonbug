Firefox in use message when trying to launch Firefox (Nightly specifically) after installation
Well, i was downloading Nightly for do some tests, and had installed Firefox 14.0b12 build1, so when the download finished i run the installation of Nightly, all was great and the installation finished very fast, but when it shows the screen of "Finishing installation" the box of "start firefox after finish installation" is checked, all is ok at this time! but when i click on the button of "Finish" it says, "Nightly is running, please close it and try again." Why it says this? Well because i see the icon of the Nightly in my explorer bar sticked (i didn't do this, i suppose that Nightly took the configuration of Firefox that it was sticked on my explorer bar), and i clicked on it, but it shows the animation of opening a new window but it opens a window of Firefox, not a window of Nightly, the process that runs is Firefox but not Nightly, Nightly doesn't starts from the icon of the explorer bar and the path in Programs Files, so i uninstall Firefox and i click on the icon of Nightly again and it starts finally! So the main problem is that Nightly doesn't starts if i have a version of Firefox like a 14.0b12 build1 installed before!

And other problem, is that when the installation program is in the part of "Finishing installation", my Mayus key starts to word in the bad way, and when i close the window of installation of Nightly my key works again fine! :)

Thats all!
