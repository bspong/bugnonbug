There's a game called Word Challenge on FaceBook that allows the player to use the keyboard to enter words that match the letters displayed.  The player may use the backspace button to erase the last letter typed.

In Firefox 3.0, this function works correctly.  In the Shiretoko build, the backspace registers in the Flash application, but the browser also backs up a page.

When flash is focused, backspace should not trigger a page navigation.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into FaceBook (http://www.facebook.com)
2. Go to web page referenced in URL (requires FaceBook account)
3. Click "Play"
4. Click checkbox. After countdown, a set of 6 letters will be displayed.  
5. Type a few letters from the group and then hit backspace.  
Actual Results:  
The last letter typed will be erased, and the browser will back up to the previous page.

Expected Results:  
The last letter typed will be erased only.
