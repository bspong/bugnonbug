Extensions using web services do not appear to handle proxy authentification

Extensions, (specifically the Gmail Notifier) do not appear to handle proxy
authentification.

I am not sure whether this is the fault of the extension author(s) or of Mozilla
in general. This bug has been submitted to the author of this extension also.

There is no simple workaround for this bug. (it still fails when you attempt to
log in after authentificating to the proxy)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download and install the gmail notifier from
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/extensions/gmail%20notifier/gmail_notifier-0.4-fx+mz.xpi
2. Set it to automatically log in to your gmail account on startup (if you need
a gmail account, I can provide you with an invite)
3. Start Mozilla while it is set to load pages through a proxy that requires
authentification.

Actual Results:  
the notifier, whilst working correctly when directly connected to the internet,
failed to retrieve the account status.

Expected Results:  
1. On startup, when the gmail notifier attempts to contact gmail, the standard
proxy authentification dialog appears asking me for a username and password.
2. After typing in my username and password, gmail notifier downloads the
required information for my account status.

Please note that I have only tested this with PORTABLE FIREFOX.

I am currently unable to test it with any other version due to an internet
shortage. (However I will test it with other versions when I do have internet)
