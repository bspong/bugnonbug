COMMAND+click items on the Bookmarks Toolbar opens that item in a new tab, middle-click the same item also opens the item in a new tab.

COMMAND+click bookmark folder on the Bookmarks Toolbar exposes the folder's contents (similar to left-click). Middle-click the same folder opens the folder's contents in new tabs.

These should be reconciled.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create folder of bookmarks on the Bookmarks Toolbar and populate with > 1 bookmark
2. Command-click on this bookmark folder
3. Menu item displays folder's contents
4. Middle-click on this bookmark folder
5. Folder's contents open in new tabs

Actual Results:  
Command-click displays folder's contents in a menu item, middle-click opens folder contents in a new tab

Expected Results:  
Both actions should result in opening folder contents in new tabs, similar to result of these actions on an individual bookmark item on the toolbar
