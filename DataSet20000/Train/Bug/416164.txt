Firefox hangs while loading GMail and other sites - possibly a Java Script problem
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; pt-BR; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; pt-BR; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11

When loading sites that are Java Script-heavy like GMail or usa.canon.com for the first time after starting Firefox, the browser hangs for up to 2 minutes. Affects all opened windows and tabs. Afterwards the problem goes away, repeats only after browser restart.

This happens for as long as I can remember, with any Firefox 2.0.0.x and 1.5.x and on different PCs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start browser
2. Visit website like gmail.google.com or usa.canon.com and start browsing around
3. Firefox will hang for up to 2 minutes on an average single-core 2005 PC
4. Firefox will continue to work normally afterwards, like nothing ever happened
5. Problem only happens again after restarting the browser


Expected Results:  
Firefox should not hang for such a large amount of time.

Since this is specially annoying, may drive away users from Firefox, and may cause users to close Firefox without waiting for it to continue working and loose their data, I assigned critical severity.

It is important to note that this bug never causes Firefox to crash, and the browser always continues to work after a few minutes.
