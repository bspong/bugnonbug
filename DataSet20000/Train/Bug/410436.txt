After installing the Simpy Firefox extension the back, forward, reload, and stop buttons as well as the search bar were all duplicated/moved to the left of the search bar. I have since removed the extension and have been able to move and remove all but two stop buttons that still exist in the Del.icio.us toolbar. They are usable, but attempt to move or remove them fail. Removing the Del.icio.us toolbar removes the buttons entirely and does not allow me to create a new one on the toolbar.
I have notified Simpy of the issue. They are looking into it, but I believe my not being able to remove the stop buttons are a Firefox bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download, install Simpy Firefox Extension provided on their site
Actual Results:  
The result is described in the details section. Essentially, many buttons and the search bar were moved or duplicated and the stop buttons are not removable/movable.

Expected Results:  
Installed a new toolbar into the application and left the standard buttons alone.
