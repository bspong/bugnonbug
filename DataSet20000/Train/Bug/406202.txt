Some tab-related extensions never work, because internal boxes of tabs and the stack for extra tab icon are lost by the patch of Bug 387345.

In Firefox 2, we extension authors can extend tabs with no/less conflict, because there is internal anonymous box defined by XBL. Moreover, there is a place holder (image.tab-extra-status) which is not used by Firefox default, like:

<xul:stack class="tab-icon">
  <xul:image xbl:inherits="validate,src=image" class="tab-icon-image"/>
  <xul:image class="tab-extra-status"/>
</xul:stack>

But, by the patch of Bug 387345, they died. This change breaks Firefox's extendability seriously. Now, to insert extra items to each <tab>, now we extension authors MUST use custom binding for <tab>s. However, if multiple extensions provide different binding for <tab>s, they will conflict, so we users cannot combine favorite tab-related extensions anymore.

If you recommend Firefox because it has powerful extendability, you shouldn't carelessly make changes like this.


Reproducible: Always
