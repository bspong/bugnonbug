Crashes with segmentation fault
/usr/bin/firefox: line 415: 32292 Segmentation fault      $mozbin "$@"
when I have type more quickly than it can respond.  I have noticed a lag in the
event loop as it is not always responsive to my keystrokes. I am running Gentoo
linux with the following ebuild of firefox (net-www/mozilla-firefox-1.0-r3).
Also, I get the following response logged to the syslog when this occurs:
atkbd.c: Keyboard on isa0060/serio0 reports too many keys pressed.  This crash
was also reproduced in the mozilla binary.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up several tabs.
2. Quickly move between tabs and/or type into navigation address bar quickly.
3. Continue switching between tabs and typing and eventually my browser will crash.


Actual Results:  
Browser unexpectedly closes with the following message on the terminal
/usr/bin/firefox: line 415: 32292 Segmentation fault      $mozbin "$@" and NO
core dump file is created.

Expected Results:  
It should be much more responsive.  I'm running a preemptive kernel on a modest
1GZ Dell laptop with 512MB RAM and 1GB virtual memory.  This is the only
application that seems to be unresponsive.
