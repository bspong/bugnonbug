Searched bugzilla for "default browser" from new bug page
 No search results (or search results grid) appeared.
 Either it doesn't work, or there were none found.



I just updated from Firefox 2.0.0.4 to Firefox 2.0.0.5
I logged in as local admin on my XPSP2 box to do so
Now I've logged back in as my regular user

The first time I invoke Firefox 2.0.0.5, I get this message box:

"Firefox is not currently set as your default browser. Would you like
to make it your default browser?"


It was set as my default browser before I upgraded, so apparently
the upgrade broke/lost that setting.


Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set web browser as default on a machine with Firefox 2.0.0.4
2. Upgrade using firefox builtin upgrade to 2.0.0.5
3. Test
Actual Results:  
I don't have a machine on which to reproduce.

Expected Results:  
I don't have a machine on which to reproduce.
