cursor problems with http://thepiratebay.se/

Steps to reproduce:

The last week I have been unable to use the Macintosh version of Firefox with The Pirate Bay. Firefox works fine with other sites. I can load any page from TPB and the address bar works fine. Scrollbars work and I can click on any link OK, including the link to write a comment.

However, when I click inside TPB's search field box or if I try to click to put a check mark in one of the category boxes near the top of the page saying "Audio", "Video", etc I have problems.

I have been using Firefox version 14 for Mac until today. Now I am using Firefox version 15 but the problem is the same. I can use Apple's Safari browser with TPB and it doesn't have these problems. However, I don't want to change my preferred browser just because of one site.


Actual results:

I can't change anything in TPB's search field box and I get a frame around the cursor. This frame is made of a small thin square dotted line. It follows the cursor around the page. The same thing happens if I try to click to put a check mark in one of the category boxes near the top of the page saying "Audio", "Video", etc. In other words, I can't use TPB's search box or categories for browsing.


Expected results:

I should be able to click in TPB's search field box and enter text there. I should be able to click to put a check mark in one of the category boxes near the top of TPB's page saying "Audio", "Video", etc.
