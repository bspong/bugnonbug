Extensive UI bugs, crashes on bug submission website, crashes on help->about
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Media Center PC 5.0; .NET CLR 3.0.04506; .NET CLR 3.5.21022)
Build Identifier: 3.03 (can't check build due to crash on help->about!).

UI bugs - when clicking on the address bar, the cursor stays about four spaces in even while typing.  After filling up the address bar, the text runs on the rest of the UI instead of scrolling over.  If a website has too long of an address, the address bar will take up several lines of UI space (gets taller).  Address bar is not highlighted when I click on it (even when typing clears it).  Various things do not show up in web pages (username, password boxes for example).  Also buttons don't have any text in them (clear private information or restore tab buttons for example (click yes or no) are empty).  This started after installing 3.03 and persisted after a reboot.

Next, when attempting to submit a bug report, selecting the buggy product crashes the browser.  Now that I am using IE to submit the bug, opening help->about to check the build number crashes the browser.
