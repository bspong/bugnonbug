Mac 10.4.11 cannot update to latest Firefox version, but previous Firefox version is now impossible to close with Mac 10.4.11
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.2.28) Gecko/20120306 Firefox/3.6.28 GTB7.1
Build ID: 20120306064154

Steps to reproduce:

Following Mozilla Firefox's oft-repeated instructions, I attempted to update to the latest version of Firefox. However, I was instructed that this new version of Firefox is not compatible with Mac 10.4.11 & that I should stick with the previous version of Firefox. I have. 


Actual results:

Unprecedented multiple bugs ensued with Firefox itself (& with Mac Firefox Add-Ons). THE CRUCIAL BUG bug is that I can no longer close Firefox on most occasions, even if I use Force Quit. On rare occasions, it closes if I give it 30 minutes or more to do so. These are tough times for many, & I cannot afford a new Mac right now just for Firefox. I sometimes cannot even shut down my Mac at all WITH an attempted Force Quit of Firefox. When I reopen it & reopen Firefox, instead of my home page set-up I see a blank tab. I fear I am damaging my Mac by not allowing it to Shut Down properly, & I suspect that many other users could be harmed by this issue as well. I consulted with a renowned on-line tech expert, who counseled me to switch to Opera, which he says provides all the benefits of Firefox & none of these bugs with an older version of Mac. He is suggesting that all Mac-using Firefox lovers switch to Opera when faced with this bug. But I love Firefox & consider it superior to all other browsers, & I also depend on my customized Firefox settings & add-ons. I wish I could quit Firefox, but I can't because Firefox is so good!


Expected results:

Firefox should quit promptly when I command it to quit, without my having to resort to Force Quit. If I must use Force Quit, Firefox should quit at THAT time.
