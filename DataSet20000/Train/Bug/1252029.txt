Firefox beta 45.0b10 often crashes on exit (Linux 64) with abort SessionStore.jsm, line 1456
Firefox 45.0b10 is almost always crashing on exit with the following message:

I reckon this issue should have been fixed in this build, but it's still happening:
one thing I've noticed is that I'm using the SessionManager addon, and sometimes opening a new session instead of restoring the previous one (with multiple tabs) doesn't trigger the crash, but it's not consistent.

It's worth noticing that also restarting the browser (I have a restart addon too) triggers the same issue, a long wait and then the crash with the same message.

I've been trying with disabling/enabling addons, but it's unpredictable: it may work once or a couple of times, then the issue surfaces again.

This never happened (all other things being equal) in Firefox 44 , it came right after the update to 45.
