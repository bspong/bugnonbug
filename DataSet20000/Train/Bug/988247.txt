Window.opener not working while using signed applets
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:24.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/24.0 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:

From my Application server , on click of a button on the parent page I am launching a new applet window like below

String vUrl = "OA.jsp?page=/oracle/apps/cs/csz/directcti/DirectCTIAppletPG"+ "&loginid=" + loginVal;
OAUrl owcUrl = new OAUrl(vUrl);

String script = "window.open('"+ oaUrl+ "' ,'ctiapplet1', 'resizable, width=350,height=350,menubar=yes,toolbar=yes,statusbar=yes,location=yes,locationbar=yes,scrollbars=yes')";

This applet window page not becomes the child window.

In the parent window, i have a JS function. 

From the child window i check if (typeof  window.opener.function1!= 'undefined'){} .

And the above always returns false, basically it never understands opener [parent window] , it always considers the current window as the opener and checks for the function there which fails.


Actual results:

It considers the child window as the parent window and never finds the function there.


Expected results:

It should check for the parent window and return true since the function is present is the parent window.

I am using signed applets here. If you using just normal html files window.opener works but with applets it does not. 

And this works absolutely fine in IE.
