Firefox appears to interpret search term rather than pass it on to search engine
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

The search result list and the search target pages should be displayed like any
other page from this website, but instead are not shown or not shown correctly.
Firefox' response comes so quickly that it may not be passing this search term
(count rendering) on to the search engine, but instead interprets it as a
command to Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open page http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.1/index.cfm?TopicName=welcome
2. Type "count rendering" or "rendering count" in search box OR find count
rendering in menu under Geoprocessing tool reference-spatial analyst
toolbox-utilities toolset-tools and click
3. Search result page will not display, search target cannot be opened

Actual Results:  
Firefox will not display target page properly
http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.1/index.cfm?ID=1276&TopicName=Count%20Rendering%20%28Spatial%20Statistics%29&rand=739&pid=1272

Several things might happen: menu column widens or disappears, results column
may show inappropriate page or be blank.

The problem does not only occur when the target page is opened, but also when
the search results with a link to the target page should be displayed.

Expected Results:  
Page with search results should display normally (as IE does for this page and
Firofox for any other page). Target page with "Count Rendering" help file should
display normally when target URL is entered directly.

This help website was used intensively over the past two months or so but has
not shown any similar error behaviour for any other search term.
