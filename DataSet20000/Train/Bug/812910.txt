Page displaying without formatting related to relative paths to link URLs

Screenshot of same page NOT displaying properly in Firefox

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:16.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/16.0
Build ID: 20121024073032

Steps to reproduce:

Not sure what puts FF16 into this mode. But the problem occurs when a page is loaded.


Actual results:

Some websites don't load their CSS files (i.e. the page is devoid of any formatting information and thus is displayed as a long series of unformatted objects (see screen shots).  The same page displays fine in Chrome and IE.  I used Firebug to inspect the loaded code and verified that one of the CSS files in a <link> tag failed to load. Oddly, the following <link> WAS able to load the CSS file.  Both <link> commands contain relative paths (like "/css/global.css"), so as an experiment, I edited the path into an absolute path (like "http://www.somedomain.com/css/global.css") whereupon the page displayed properly. 

So, apparently FireFox is having an intermittent problem traversing relative paths (and apparently this corrects itself after the first instance.

Also, this doesn't happen on all pages (for instance, this Bugzilla page is displaying properly).


Expected results:

The page should display with full formatting in place (like it does in Chrome or IE).
