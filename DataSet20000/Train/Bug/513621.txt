Location bar auto-bookmarks/history-search needs to consider search shortcuts

I've noticed that the auto-search/completion function of the location bar (which was one of Firefox's 3 new features and which automatically checks whether keywords entered in the location bar match websites stored in bookmarks or history) treats search shortcuts as keywords, while it should ignore them instead.

Example:
1. Say I've defined 'g' as a shortcut for google search, and I've also stored Bugzilla in my bookmarks (Title "BUgzilla", Tags "bugs, mozilla, firefox").
2. Because I have a weak memory, I've forgotten about having saved Bugzilla as a bookmark, hence enter 'g firefox bugs' to look for the correct site for filing bugs).
3 Now, the expected behavior would be that firefox would simple display the bookmarked and tagged Bugzilla page at the top of the auto-search results. However, the 'g' among the keywords apparently distorts the location bar's auto-search results, as a result of which the Bugzilla page is moved a couple of notches down.


This is not a major annoyance, but it certainly would be more user-friendly is the distortion was corrected.

Reproducible: Always
