Since Firefox 1.0PR, if not earlier, Firefox thrashes CPU at 100% until process is terminated in Task Manager, (which takes 5-30 minutes to accomplish).  It begins at any point from instantly upon loading the program to after several minutes' useage.  According to Task Manager, the CPU is being run at 100% and the memory used rises steadily while the problem completely locks the entire system up.  Sometimes there is enough left to close Firefox via Task Manager's end process - IF TM is already open this generally takes five to ten minutes to accomplish.  If TM is not already open, and more and more often even if it is, the only option is to remove the power source(s). This bug is consistent across all four of my machines and four that I know of belonging to other people that operate XP Home and XP Pro both SP1 and SP2 and Intel and Athlon CPU's.

It manifests with no plug-ins, extensions or themes of any kind installed and even when there is only only one tab/window open.  It is not related to updates, (I have turned all automatic updates to Firefox and extensions and themes off.)  The problem persists through multiple uninstall/reinstalls, HD format and fresh Windows reinstalls and even DBAN wipes followed by complete reinstalls.  The problem is somewhere in Firefox itself and has gotten much, MUCH worse with each release since 1.0 PR or before.  AS of version 2.0, Firefox has become 99% unuseable.  It is 100% reproducible, occurring every time I try to use Firefox.  At some point, whether a few minutes into the session or instantly upon startup, the problem becomes untenable and causes a complete loss of data/downloads/open tab(s), etc.
