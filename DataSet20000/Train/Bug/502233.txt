I think it has to do with a new way Firefox handles clipboard information,
the way the program works is that you copy a segment text from a website and the program reads it to you using the Microsoft text-to-speech engine.

Program is called TTSReader

Program works as usual in Internet explorer and desktop applications, only in the Firefox environment the functionality of reading from clipboard don't work.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open TTSReader.
2.Select read from clipboard option( button on the top)
3. Browse to any webpage can try to copy text, listen to see if the program is reading the text.
Actual Results:  
No special steps except the three written above, the functionality of the program is very simple, you copy text to the clipboard, the text gets read.

Expected Results:  
Nothing happened, maybe the text was copied to the clipboard but the program did not read it.

The text would be read aloud through the speakers


-- in testing the problem all add-ons were disable, started in safe mode
result is the same.
