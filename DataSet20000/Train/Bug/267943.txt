Window disappears, but process still runs, when enter URL of a site that does not exist
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1

With multiple tabs open, if I create a new tab and enter the URL of a site that
does not exist, the Firefox window will disappear.  The process will still be
running and the program still shows as "Running" under Task Manager.  I have not
found a way to bring the application back to the foreground, so I always have to
"End Program" in Task Manager.  This last time I tried entering
http://www.icfai.edu (the correct URL is http://www.icfai.org).

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Open multiple tabs (usually three, usually Autozone.com in first, Yahoo! Mail
in second, Slashdot in third)
3. Create new fourth tab
4. Enter URL of a site that does not exist, such as http://www.icfai.edu

Actual Results:  
Firefox locks up, then window disappears.  Program is still running as shown
under Task Manager.  Have to force the program to end.

Expected Results:  
Give an error message to the effect of "Server not found."
