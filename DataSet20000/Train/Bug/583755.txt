Firefox 4b2 is unresponsive on opening Google stock price page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b2) Gecko/20100720 Firefox/4.0b2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When I go to http://www.google.com/finance?client=ob&q=NYSE:HPQ the page appears but the links do not respond to clicking (and the underlines don't respond to hovering), and the entire Firefox interface becomes unusable. The exception is that the graph widget on the page is still interactive. The only thing that works is closing Firefox with the red "X" button (Windows 7).

Firefox 3.x has no problem with this page.

Firefox 4b1 also had no problem with this page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.google.com/finance?client=ob&q=NYSE:HPQ
2. Try clicking on a link on the page.
3. Try changing to a different tab... or anything...
Actual Results:  
FF 4b2 becomes unusable. Can't interact with links on the page or change to a different tab.

Expected Results:  
Correct interactivity as exemplified by FF 3.x

I also found that if I open FF4b2, then open a separate session of FF4b2 and open the troublesome web page in that second session, the first session also hangs. Made it hard to file this bug the first time I tried. ;-p
