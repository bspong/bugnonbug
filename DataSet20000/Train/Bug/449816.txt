Changing locales many times in succession causes FF to stop drawing window text correctly

While testing locale-specific webpages, Firefox appears to leak memory on each page load, then once it hits about 150MB, it stops being able to paint the window correctly - the new page does not appear, mousing over buttons makes them lose their text, the window does not update correctly, and it's impossible to close FF in any way other than killing the process (since closing the window normally pops up a dialog, which has no buttons when this happens).

Restarting FF and loading the next page in the sequence resolves the issue, but after about 10-15 page loads the same issue presents itself.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a page with a different locale/charset.
2. Load another page with a different locale/charset.
3. Repeat 10-15 times.
Actual Results:  
Firefox stops drawing any widgets or text, and must be killed and restarted.

Expected Results:  
Pages should load correctly.
