Changing password doesn't cause browser to enter reauth state until browser is restarted.
STR:
* Create a bool pref |services.sync.debug.ignoreCachedAuthCredentials| set to true so the repro happens immediately.
* Configure Sync, perform a first sync.
* In the same browser, change your password via "manage account"
* Perform a Sync

Expected:
* Hamburger menu enters the "please reconnect to Sync" state.

Actual:
* Sync fails but the state isn't reflected in the hamburger menu (but it *is* reflected in the prefs pane)

If you restart the browser it correctly enters that state.

The relevant log entries:
> 1457493320592	Sync.BrowserIDManager	ERROR	Authentication error in _fetchTokenForUser: {"details":{"code":401,"errno":110,"error":"Unauthorized","message":"Invalid authentication token in request signature","info":"https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-auth-server/blob/master/docs/api.md#response-format"}}
> 1457493320592	Sync.Status	DEBUG	Status.login: success.login => error.login.reason.account
> 1457493320592	Sync.Status	DEBUG	Status.service: success.status_ok => error.login.failed
> 1457493320592	Sync.BrowserIDManager	INFO	Failed to fetch the cluster URL: {"details":{"code":401,"errno":110,"error":"Unauthorized","message":"Invalid authentication token in request signature","info":"https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-auth-server/blob/master/docs/api.md#response-format"}}
> 1457493320592	Sync.Service	DEBUG	Cluster value = null
> 1457493320592	Sync.Status	DEBUG	Status.sync: success.sync => error.sync.reason.no_node_found
> 1457493320592	Sync.Status	DEBUG	Status.service: error.login.failed => error.sync.failed

So Sync tried to update its token and failed. Sync treated this as a "no node available" error and changed the service state away from the error.login.failed state to error.sync.failed - it's that initial state that the hamburger menu expects to see before showing its reauth state.

(aside - the logs also show:

> 1457493309567	FirefoxAccounts	WARN	Unrecognized FxAccountsWebChannel command: fxaccounts:change_password

as the password is changed, which we should consider using so we don't rely on the token expiring before the device notices - but that's somewhat orthogonal to this bug)

(aside 2 - this is very difficult to write a test for - it might make sense to spend some time with tps to add checks for these states - tps will let you restart the browser etc - but that's probably a few days work I'd think, so probably shouldn't block this being fixed)
