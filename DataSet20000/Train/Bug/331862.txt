Using Firefox with BMC's Remedy ARS System

We've been testing Firefox with the new version of the Remedy ARS System.  Pop-up menus will appear.  I searched the Remedy knowledge base (http://support.remedy.com) and found this.  I cannot find the Mozilla browser without it being Firefox.

Why does Firefox have problems displaying pop-ups in Mid-Tier 6.3?


S O L U T I O N
In Mid-Tier version 6.3 (as well as previous versions of Mid-Tier), Firefox (any version) is not supported.
 
Mozilla and Mozilla Firefox (to which we will refer as Firefox only) are two different browsers. Mid-Tier 6.3 only supports Mozilla 1.7+, IE6 and Netscape 7.2, as can be seen on our Compatibility Matrix (viewable at http://supportweb.remedy.com/).
 
Although you may witness Firefox 1.0.3 and IE6 behaving similarly, this is merely because Firefox 1.0.3 and Mozilla 1.7 share the same version of the Gecko engine (and hence firefox 1.0.3 can work properly with code written for Mozilla 1.7). Firefox 1.5 uses a new version of the Gecko engine, and hence has problems displaying pop-ups.
 
Therefore, this is a compatibility problem of Firefox 1.5 and not an issue with Mid-Tier 6.3.
