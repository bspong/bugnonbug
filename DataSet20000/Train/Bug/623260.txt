Minefield freezes when trying to watch Full Episodes of shows on TV Land.com.

The above website is just a sample, but it occurs on all videos on the site.

I get the following in the Error Console:
  Error in parsing value for 'height'.  Declaration dropped. (About 100 instances)
  www.tvland.com/tv-schedule

  Unknown pseduo-class or pseudo-element 'first'.
  www.tvland.com/tv-schedule

  Expected declaration but found '/'.  Skipped to next declaration.  Line: 35.
  www.tvland.com/tv-schedule


The videos also hang Internet Explorer 9 and IE 9 comes up with JavaScript errors on lines 1 and 48.  I am not sure what the issue is here, but eventually after waiting a couple minutes, I get the Sad-Face-Flash icon on the video.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the above website to watch an episode of "I Dream of Jeannie" on TV Land.
2. Browser freezes.
3. Above website is an example, which shows the problem, but occurs on all full episodes on the site.  Problem also occurs on IE 9, so could be a TV Land JavaScript coding problem - not sure.
Actual Results:  
Browser freezes.

Expected Results:  
Browser should not freeze - or if there is an error rendering the site, Minefield should not hang for 3 to 4 minutes before giving up and cancelling the video rendering.
