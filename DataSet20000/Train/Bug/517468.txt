Using "Search in page" tool, when the last occurence of a text is found and the browser goes back to start of page to search, all visual components that is on the right margin got a slice hidden.
In fact, the visual components gets a width larger than the browser window (about 1cm larger), so, a slice of them gone hidden on the right.
The vertical scrollbar got hidden completely.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a website with vertical scrollbar (try http://br.mozdev.org/);
2. Type Ctrl+F (open the search on page tool);
3. Type a word that has at least 2 occurences in the page (try "contra", has 3 occurences);
4. Click on "next" button until the last occurence of the word in the page (try to click 2 times with the word "contra");
5. Click on "next" button once more time.
Actual Results:  
The visual components of browser are expanded to a width larger than the browser window (about 1cm larger), so, a slice of them gone hidden on the right.
The vertical scrollbar got hidden completely.
