If you have a page that contains an iframe whichs height style is bigger then
16384px all the 'pixels' over 16384 don't get rendered (if you move a window
overthem there is visual corruption...no repainting.

If the iframe contains a page(a page bugger than 16384px), the iframe behaves as
if it was only 16384 pixel in height and it's scrollbars work accordingly, but
the pixels >16384px never get repainted.

Easy repro create a file with the contents below. le last 10 pixels will never
repaint if you move a window(or minimize, maximize firefox) over the iframe.
If you want a more drastic effect set the height to something big like 17684px.

<html>

		<iframe src="" style="width:600px;height:16394px"></iframe>
		Here2
	</body>
</html>


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a t.html file containing the code detailed in the details.
2. Open it with FireFox
3. Minimize and maximize firefox, the last 10 pixels will not have been repainted.
Or move a window over the last pixels, same problem.

Actual Results:  
Corruption in the last 10 pixels of the iframe.

Expected Results:  
Painted the region accordingly. If a big document is used as source, the
scrollbar should use the extra (>16384px) pixels to display the document.
