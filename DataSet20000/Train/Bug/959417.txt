Firefox displays only characters and no graphics or images.
Firefox recently updated itself. Since that time, whenever I try to visit websites like Yahoo mail etc. It displays only characters, and no graphics content. I was not able to even get onto the Mozilla website, as it has the same issues with Mozilla itself.

Here is an example of what Yahoo mail looks like:
