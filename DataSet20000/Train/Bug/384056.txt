on all pages on which i try to view video using the windows media player 11, the windows media player loads and then shrinks itself vertically and leaves a red bar at the bottom below the player. (instead of being square in shape it is now rectangular....tool bar and all)  i have installed the latest firefox and the latest media player and this still happens.  the player  will load up square (like it should) and then immediately resize.  it is just as wide, but bottom of the player moves up towards the top and it looks squished.  (player works just fine with internet explorer)  problem did not happen until i upgraded to firefox 2....player worked fine with 1.5
