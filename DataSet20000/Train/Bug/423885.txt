The handling of the allowMetaRedirects attribute in the nsIDocShell interface seems to be broken.

The extension RefreshBlocker isn't able anymore to allow or deny the execution of a META refresh element by setting the allowMetaRedirects attribute of the corresponding nsIDocShell. It works fine with Firefox 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0. But it is broken with official beta builds of Firefox 3.0 from [0].

It stopped working with the nightly build 2007-02-09-04-trunk[3]. The builds 2007-02-07-04-trunk[1] and 2007-02-08-04-trunk[2] are OK. It is also not working with the current build 2008-03-19-04-trunk[4].

This could relate to bug 83265.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install RefreshBlocker-0.5pre1.xpi.
2. Extract testcase.zip.
3. Open testcase/testcase.html.
4. No refresh is executed. That's OK. See testcase-1.png.
5. Go to the preferences of RefreshBlocker and add the regular expressions ^.*1\.html and ^.*2\.html to the whitelist.
6. See preferences.png.
7. Open testcase/testcase.html again.
8. No refresh is executed. That's not OK. 1.html and 2.html should be get refreshed after 5 and 10 seconds. See testcase-2.png.
9. Compare this with the behaviour of Firefox 2.0 or the nightly build from 2007-02-08-04-trunk. See testcase-3.png.
