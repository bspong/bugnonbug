Using Windows Vista. While in Extended Desktop (pc + television), I realized that Firefox doesn't open browser window properly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Having s-video out, plug into a televison or another pc monitor.
2. Change the Output in Display Options (I'm using Windows Vista) to Extended Desktop (pc [or notebook] + television) (I'm using notebook).
3. Open youtube.com (yes, open youtube.com! that's how i got the bug, you can test other website later, it should have the same problem)
4. Drag and drop the Firefox window to the extended desktop and maximize.
5. While in youtube, open any video and watch it full screen.
6. Now close browser by pressing Ctrl + F4.
7. Opening Firefox again, it will open on the extended desktop. That's okay, open Firefox and now drag and drop it to the normal pc or notebook screen.
8. Now do the same thing, watch a youtube video again. Don't forget to watch it fullscreen. And close Firefox.

9. Now the bug is: when you open Firefox again, it should open on the notebook screen but it doesn't! It opens on the extended desktop always and forever!

In my tests, there's nothing you can do to open normally on the notebook screen again. You have to shut down extended desktop and reboot op. system.

PS: I haven't tested this on others websites, nether on others Windows systems, nether on others types of display output.

PS2: This bug exists on Firefox since version 2 first generations.

Actual Results:  
open browser on wrong screen

Expected Results:  
should open browser on last opened screen
