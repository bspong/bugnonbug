Strange behavior in creating directory for saving profile

When user is initially creating a profile there is doubt as to the name of the
directory that will be created to store settings.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. From dos window ..  MozillaFirebird.exe -p
2. From Profile manager  Create new profile
3. Profile manager starts with Default Profile
   If you start typing in a different name you have doubts as to the name that
will be used to store the user settings.
There is a screen display showing  Your user settings, preferences Bookmarks and
mail will be stored in  C:\Documents and Settings\...\Phoenix\Profiles\
4. Type a name for the new profile (I used Test)
   at the T    Phoenix\Profiles\
   at the Te   Phoenix\Profiles\T
   at the Tes  Phoenix\Profiles\Te
   at the Test Phoenix\Profiles\Tes
5. Backspace one time   Phoenix\Profiles\Test with profile name displayed as Tes
6. Add the t abain to the profile name and the target changes to
    Phoenix\Profiles\Tes

Actual Results:  
After typing in the name I wanted, the program did create the correct directory
name.   This is a visual thing.  The user should see the name of the directory
that will be created.  Why display the target if it is not going to be valid?

Expected Results:  
I would have expected the display to show
 Your user settings, preferences Bookmarks and mail will be stored in 
C:\Documents and Settings\...\Phoenix\Profiles\Test   
(Or whatever was actually typed into the profile name)
