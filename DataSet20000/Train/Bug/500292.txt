When left/right tab navigation buttons are visible, closing some tabs sometimes results in the last (right-most) being incorrectly aligned

When multiple tabs are open in FF3.5RC2 (so that left and right navigation buttons are visible on the tab bar), closing some tabs in the middle *sometimes* results in an incorrect alignment of the last tab. It has happened twice today, and I haven't been able to pin down the exact STR. I will post another comment If I do. Please see attached screen shot for what I mean.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open multiple tabs, so that left and right nav tab navigation buttons are visible
2. Close some tabs (those in the middle), such that both left and right nav buttons are presently active, meaning you're exactly in the middle of the opened tabs. (Not sure if this is required, but this is how I came across it)
3. The last tab should be aligned with the right navigation button but is instead next to an empty space
Actual Results:  
An empty space (equal to a tab) is seen with the right navigation button, followed by the last tab

Expected Results:  
There should be no empty space and the last tab should be aligned with the navigation button
