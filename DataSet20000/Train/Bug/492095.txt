Loading HTML and PDF reports in Cognos 8 shows a blank page

In versions previous to 3.0.9 Cognos 8 HTML and PDF reports would render correctly, in 3.0.9 an issue was introduced in Firefox where they would appear blank, and certain customers are still seeing this issue in 3.0.10.

PDF reports are rendered through the Adobe browser plugin (as opposed to something on our end) however it does not appear to be loading up either.

Nothing on our end has changed, so this definitely appears to be a code issue in Firefox.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into a Cognos 8 environment
2. Run any report in HTML or PDF format
3. Experience error

Actual Results:  
Against test environments in-house Cognos is not able to reproduce this error, however certain customers are seeing this issue with correctly configured environments.

Expected Results:  
Properly render the HTML and/or PDF reports as in previous versions and as is seen in Internet Explorer.

I understand that this may not specifically be an issue in Firefox, however since results are not consistent between versions of Firefox (with Cognos content/configuration remaining static) I suspect there has been a large change in how our HTML/PDFs are handled.
