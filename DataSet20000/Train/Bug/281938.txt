dragging a window across an image scars that image with by stripes

Please look at the attached screen shot (will attach it immediately after
this bug report).  The browser window displays Yahoo home page.  I dragged
a small notepad window over one of the home page's images, and that image
was left with white stripes, showing the contour of the movement of the
left boarder of the notepad window.  - this is problem #1.

The image will restore to normal if I simply click on the browser window
title bar to make it the current window.  That seems to imply that the
browser would redraw the image when it becomes current window.  If that's
true, it's problem #2, because the redraw should be unnecessary if problem
#1 is solved.

Firefox v1.0 does not have problem #1.  (So I'm not certain if it also
redraws.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to Yahoo.com
2.open a small window and drag it slowly across some of the Yahoo page images
3.some images will be left with stripes (white or other color), and this can
  always be repeated.  For other images which won't be scarred, they will never
  be scarred no matter how many times you try it.
