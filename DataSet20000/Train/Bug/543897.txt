Disabling add-ons when entering safe mode in FF3.6 voids their subsequent re-enabling

Was experiencing bug 538160, so I tried to disable all add-ons by loading FF 3.6 in safe mode and selecting the option of disabling them (did not solve the bug). After that, I was unable to re-enable any of the add-ons by clicking the corresponding button -- when I restart FF it's like I had never re-started it. The problem is there whether making a quick loading (selecting restart FF from the add-ons menu panel) or first exiting, releasing+defragging free memory, and loading FF again.

Have not been able to check whether I can reproduce the problem since now my FF doesn't accept add-ons (either new ones or previosuly installed). Will have to either uninstall and reinstall all add-ons or, worst yet, reinstall FF.
