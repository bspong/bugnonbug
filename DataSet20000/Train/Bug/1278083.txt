Steps to reproduce:

I made an extension which does cross domain ajax calls towards my own web server. It was working fine in version 45, but no longer working after the update.

To test the bug just create a simple extension with the following script content and run it on multiple pages

    var ajax = new XMLHttpRequest();
    ajax.onload = function(){console.log("OK")};
    ajax.onerror = function(e){console.log(e)};
    ajax.open("POST", "some_url", true);  <-- change some_url
    ajax.withCredentials = true;
    ajax.send(null);

My web server does allow cors and I do have the following about:config setting, allowing me to do CORS:
security.mixed_content.block_active_content = false

Not sure if it matters, but I am restricting the extension to run only on specific websites by using the "matches" field from manifest.json


Actual results:

When sending the call from the extension, the onerror callback instantly is called, with the xmlHttp object having readystate=4 and status=0. There is no error shown in the console other then the one logged by me and the request doesn't even appear in the networking tab. Needless to say the request does not reach my endpoint. 

I also tried testing cors by injecting the js script using a bookmark. This way seems to still work, so the problem might be specific to extensions.

I have also tried deploying the extension into Chrome browser and it works fine from there.


Expected results:

The http request should have reached my webserver.
