Macromedia Flash Player 8.0.22.0 does not recognize mouse clicks when embedded in a page.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9b2) Gecko/2007121120 Firefox/3.0b2

Links intended to trigger an internal event (or, recently found, to generate pop-up windows) do not respond when clicked upon.  Progression from one scene to another in Flash objects do not happen unless manually forced (through right-clicking the object and selecting the 'Play' option from the drop-down menu) and subsequent events to the manual override simply don't work at all.  The same Flash objects work fine in Internet Explorer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to URL provided.
2. Wait for Flash object in main portion of page to load. (Plushie Giveaway)
3. Click on any link.  Large button link is a pop-up generator.  Smaller links are internal.  Neither works.
Actual Results:  
No response from the Flash object.  Normal responses in IE (links were completely functional).

Expected Results:  
Smaller (internal event) links should have brought up a new "window" within the object, showing a picture of a group of plushies, with the option to close the "window" by a small X in the corner.  Large button link should pop up a new window.
