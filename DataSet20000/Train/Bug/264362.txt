Error launching browser window:no XBL binding for browser, browser doesn't open.

Installed Firefox Version 1.0 PR and several themed extensions (Noia, Doodle)
via the automatic update in the Firefox Preferences.  Upon restart, received
message, "Error launching browser window:no XBL binding for browser"  and
browser fails to load.  

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Uninstalled and Reinstalled 1.0 PR with same results
2. Installed nightly builds from around Oct 2 to present with same results
3. Installed and currently running Mozilla 1.7.3 with no problems
Actual Results:  
Nothing.  Upon uninstall received a message stating that all files have not been
removed during this uninstall, and asked if I wanted to delete forlder, and said
yes (I don't know if this is relevent).  This made no improvement in launching
browser after reinstall.  Mozilla 1.7.3 runs with no problems.

Expected Results:  
Opened properly and displayed browser window.

I had several themes installed, Noia extreme, doodle classic, and the weatherbug
extension.  All worked fine in the previous version.  No theme loads, however,
upon launching browser.  In fact, nothing loads except error message and blank
window.  After uninstall (which would presumable get rid of themes) same problem
occurs.
