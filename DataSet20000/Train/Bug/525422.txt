Error upon start that leaves window so small that it's only borders, and also causes the tab bar not to load(I have it set to always there.)

Occasionally when I open a new window (with no other windows open) Minefield will open super minimized, so minimized in fact that the window within it's borders isn't actually visible. It's about 2 inches wide still, but the length of the window is about a half inch. When you hit maximize, the tab bar (which I have set to always there) doesn't show up. If I close this malfunctioning window and open another the problem goes away. It seems to happen a lot when I accidentally open more than one window by double clicking the icon in my taskbar (I have Minefield mounted there.)


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have tab bar set to always show.
2.Have no windows up.
3.Double or triple click the Minefield icon(attached to tray.)
Actual Results:  
At random times, the problem happens. Most times, it will open more than one window, which is also an error.

Expected Results:  
Open one window and then minimize that one window. I have my taskbar set to stack all like programs all the time, so Minefield is always in the same place and is always the same size on my taskbar.

In the case of tiny window, it's easily fixed by closing the failed window, and reopening another one slowly. In the case of multiple windows, obviously just close extra windows.
