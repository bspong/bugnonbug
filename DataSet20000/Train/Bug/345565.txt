I would like to sync my bookmarks to a public or private place on www.

Then when I'm using another computer than my own I would like to fast an
easy connect to my private or public folder on www and get those bookmarks imported to a subfolder in the bookmarksfolder of this computer. .. or similar.

Then when I add/change/delete to "my" subfolder on the borrowed computer, then I would like my bookmarks on the www to be updated automagically.

Likewise, when I add/change/delete to bookmakrs on my own computer, then I would like my bookmarks on the www to be updated automagically.

I belive this would be a nice feature for people that are travelling a lot.

Today, I would have to:
First remember to export my bookmarks to my email.
Then I would have to import the bookmarks to the borrowed computer.
Then I would have to remember to export the bookmarks to my email again, from the borrowed computer.
Then I would have to remember to import the new bookmarks from my email.

Not a very easy task.

If Firefox cannot provide an online storage place for the bookmarks then Firefox and Google (or some other) might want to do this together.
I belive google or some other www company would offer this storage for free as long as they could display adds in the process of syncing the bookmarks between the www and current computer.... 

Reproducible: Always
