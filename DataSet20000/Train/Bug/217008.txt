user specific directories are created under C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Application Data.  I want to control where these folders go.
User-Agent:       Opera/7.11 (Windows NT 5.1; U)  [en]
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030728 Mozilla Firebird/0.6.1

One annoyance I have with the browser: Firebird creates the following 
directories under C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Application Data
Mozilla
Phoeniz
Talkback

I am trying to run "clean" (not install anything directly on my machine).  I 
tried putting the folders in the same path as the executable (usb device) but 
the folders were still created on my C drive.  
Is it possible to disable the creation of these folders?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firebird from my flash drive, directories are created
2. delete directories / move them to the flash drive
3. run firebird, directories are again created on my C drive.  I don't want this 
behavior!

Actual Results:  
Directories are created in an un-wanted area.  

Expected Results:  
I would like to be able to control where the directories are created.  I don't 
want things stored in the registry either because I want to be able to run 
"clean" -- no reg entries, no misc directories created on my hard drive.
