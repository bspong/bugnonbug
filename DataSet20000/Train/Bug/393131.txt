Lineage 2 and Firefox 2.0.0.6 bug, which causes firefox to not load websites with lineage 2 running.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070725 Firefox/2.0.0.6

Firefox itself is fine, it's still responding but any web page you try to load will either halfway load or load fully.  If it loads fully, load a few more tab's in the same window and Firefox should slow to a crawl and stop loading any new website all together.  The circle will still be spinning like it's trying to load a the web page but at the bottom status bar it will say "stopped."  This might take some time but it will eventually happen with Lineage 2 open and Firefox.  It just started happening with 2.0.0.6 update, the 2.0.0.4 version works fine.  I would guess that it is something with lineage2's gameguard program that's supposed to help prevent cheating but never works and always causes these kind of problems.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install and run Lineage 2
2.Login to the game, select your character and load the character.
3.Once you're in the game with your character loaded, minimize lineage 2 by clicking alt-tab or the windows key, load lineage2 and it should happen almost every time.  



This bug still occurs even with a fresh user profile and default theme.  I do not have zonealarm or any firewalls installed, including windows firewall disabled.  The only way to fix this problem until it is addressed in the next firefox update is to close firefox completely and reload it, it will happen almost immediately again with lineage 2 running.  When lineage 2 is closed, firefox works just like it always has, no problems.
