I have a VM that I use as my development LAMP server. I run XP on my desktop with FF 3.6.x. Until an upgrade to FF3.6.4 last night, I could always connect to my VM's https://mypse/ and it worked great (I have the icon on my desktop and just drag it into FF, so I know it worked for almost 2 years!). Now after the update, FF says it's unable to connect. If I type https://10.139.68.160/ it works fine. If I load the https://mypse in Internet Explorer it works fine. If I 'ping mypse' from a DOS shell, it of course pings and returns the right IP. I tried to even add an entry to c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts with "10.139.68.160 mypse" and that had no effect on FF either.

Again, this started AFTER the update to 3.6.4 and also tried with 3.6.6 as of this writing. I am forced to revert to 3.6.3 every time to get this functioning.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. setup a virtual machine
2. add the IP of that machine to your etc/hosts file OR use built in LAN DNS
3. hit the url https://mymachine/
4. note that FF says it can't find it
5. this worked fine up till 3.6.4
Actual Results:  
FF says it can't find the page, yet IE, Ping, etc. all work properly, and as mentioned, FF3.6.3 worked just fine, this broke after that version.

Expected Results:  
Use the networking that the OS uses to resolve this name/IP. I can't understand why this would break ever.
