FFX displays HTML code, not page when viewed offline with <!DOCTYPE> specified
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080201 Firefox/2.0.0.12
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080201 Firefox/2.0.0.12

Firefox appears to have a bug. I installed a new web development program that is designed to be W3C compliant and inserts the <DOC> code at the top of each page. When attempting to view any of these pages locally Firefox only shows them as the raw HTML not as web pages. IE displays them correctly.

If I manually edit the page to delete the <! DOCTYPE > code the page will work.
(Not really an option)

I first enquired at W3C to determine the correct placement for this tag and it is correct per W3C standards. It seems to be Firefox that does not allow local viewing with this code inserted.

When the page is uploaded to a web server it is displayed properly.

I could not find this issue reported.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Load page locally into Firefox. Page has:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
at top.
Actual Results:  
With the specified code in page, Firefox displays only the HTML/ext code of the page.

Expected Results:  
Should render the web page as a normal page.

As a developer I like to be able to switch views between Firefox and IE to assure mutual compatibility but with Firefox not letting me view pages off line it is a real problem.
