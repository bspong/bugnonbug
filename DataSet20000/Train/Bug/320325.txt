Logitech Hotkeys problem

I have a problem since upgrading to Firefox 1.5.  I have had my hotkey set on my LX700 to open a few webpages.  Some are to a specific page, others to a normal .com address.  Ever since upgrading to 1.5, if I use my hotkeys while Firefox is closed they open properly.  If firefox is already opened and I use one of the hotkeys it cuts off the last character in the URL.  It acts the same with each webpage I have tried for different hotkeys.  I also downloaded the newest Set Point software with the same results.  I do have the browser set to open these new pages as tabs not as seperate windows.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  If any hotkey is set and firefox 1.5 is already opened
2.  Pages are set to open as new tabs
3.  The new links get the last character in the URL cut off.

Actual Results:  
Page does not load.  I get the new Problem loading page.

Expected Results:  
I would except the last character of the URL not be cut off and the page to load properly.  

I have added another / on the end of my .com websites for the time being to get them to load properly each time.  Either .com or .com/  but with the ones set to go to a certain page they will fail with a / on the end.
