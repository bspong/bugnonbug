When viewing the HTML version of any FeedBurner feed, all characters seem to be in wrong encoding.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.9b4) Gecko/2008030714 Firefox/3.0b4

When I go to any RSS feed that uses FeedBurner's BrowserFriendly feature (renders RSS feed as an HTML page), the characters on the page seem to be in the wrong encoding. The document's source identifies itself as UTF-8 and View->Character Encoding shows Unicode (UTF-8).

Firefox does not render the page differently even when I select an alternate encoding from View->Character Encoding like ISO-8859-1.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up Firefox 3.0 Beta 4.
2. Go to a FeedBurner feed, such as http://feeds.feedburner.com/geekie?format=html .
Actual Results:  
The page's characters are not shown properly.

Expected Results:  
The text on the page should have rendered properly as UTF-8.

The source code of the page is normal HTML and has no character encoding issues. Also, links (in <a> tag) show up fine.
