cookie problem "Request header field is missing ':' separator."

I have a regular problem with the IBM website. For example, today at 
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/ (I am logged in already, so it is probably trying to access a cookie)

and the error is:

"Bad Request

Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand.
Request header field is missing ':' separator.

bm.com/support/us/en/

IBM_HTTP_Server/6.1.0.19 Apache/2.0.47 (Unix) DAV/2 Server at ltsgwascl006.sby.ibm.com Port 80"

If I clear the IBM site cookies, it starts working again for a while but the problem will recur. The latest version I have had this with is 3.5.4 on Windows XP. I am using a version installed via Firefox Portable but using standard updating tools from within Firefox. 



Another example is at (this page requires a login):

For example:
Bad Request

"Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand.
Request header field is missing ':' separator.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Intermittent, happens when I access the pages after having logged in.
2.
3.



Removing the IBM cookies fixes the problem for a while. Then it will recur.
