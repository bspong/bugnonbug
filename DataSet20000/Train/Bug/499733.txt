Open Web Location dialog leaks URL/search entered in private browsing mode
The Open Web Location dialog persists the last URL or search terms you enter across changes to the status of private browsing, which means it can reveal private URLs or search terms that you enter while browsing privately and don't want to reveal to others after you leave that mode.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. enter private browsing mode;
2. open the Open Web Location dialog;*
3. enter anything into the text field and press the Open button;
4. exit private browsing mode;
5. open the Open Web Location dialog again.

* There are (at least) two ways to open the Open Web Location dialog.  One is to be in full screen mode on Windows or Linux (View > Full Screen).  The other is to remove the location bar from the navigation toolbar on all OSes using View > Toolbars > Customize...  In either case, selecting File > Open Location will then open the Open Web Location dialog instead of focusing the location bar.

Expected Results: the text you entered into the text field is no longer there.

Actual Results: the text you entered into the text field is still there.

This seems significant enough to warrant some status wrt 3.5.  Requesting blocking so drivers see it and can determine whether it warrants blocking or wanted status.
