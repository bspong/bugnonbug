getCachedMessages: TypeError: object in compartment marked as invisible to Debugger breaks console and other toolbox functionality completely
Sometimes, when working with the browser toolbox or browser console, I end up with:

in the console, after which any evaluation in the console is met with no reply, the debugger is broken, and so is the style editor if and only if I haven't opened it before running into this issue. The inspector seems to still work, though. I don't know why this happens, and I don't seem to be able to find general STR. It happens both on my mac and on my windows machine.

Does this error mean anything to people? Can we recover from it better somehow? Patrick, do you know and/or can you take a look, please?
