Firefox window having open tabs for secure connection closes inadvertently when iconified

Looking on eBay for materials to be followed with my-eBay, I several times wanted to switch to some other activity and tried to iconify the window. When looking at the task bar, I noticed that the window had not been iconified but purely closed.
This happens seemingly specifically on secure connections, at least with eBay. When non-secure pages are opened on other windows, these stay open. When the tabs include both secure and non-secure links, if the window is iconified with a non-secure link on top, the iconification is successful, else the window is closed.
TIA.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open eBay in secure connection
2. iconify the window
3. see the window is no more active in the task bar
Actual Results:  
Window with secure connection gets lost. Connection stays open if Firefox not completely closed by the same time.

Expected Results:  
Firefox window in the task bar.

Leave the window in the task bar whatever the status of the connection if iconification asked for.
