bad url msgbox is handled as web-style popup by popup blocking
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7

when I typo'ed the url and got the message box error from it, the popup control
bit came up..Didn't see it long enough to read anything useful on it since I
hadn't been expecting it, and was already clicking OK by the time it displayed.

I suppose one could want such behavior, so as to not have the error pop up,
though  I would assume such a thing would be on the message box, similar to the
one on the download box telling it to stay open after completion or not.

I've not seen it come up since, however...just that first time.


Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1.fress install of firebird (I guess)
2.enter www.mozilla.og or some other bad domain
3.watch the bottom right of the browser

Actual Results:  
as I said in the description..

Expected Results:  
I might've put in some notifiation flag on system windows/message boxes that the
popup blocker can identify, and have it ignore those windows if it sees them
