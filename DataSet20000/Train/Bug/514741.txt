bad SSL certificate notification (Error code: ssl_error_bad_cert_domain) pops up continuously (when encountering a site with a bad cert) making FF unusable to the point where I have to crash it or reboot.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to a site with a bad ssl cert (current example www.frs.com)
2. keep acknowledging the "Secure Connection Failed" notification until your mouse finger falls off
3. switch to another browser (because you know the bad site tab is going to be restored)
Actual Results:  
I switched to another browser.

Expected Results:  
give me the bad cert pop-up once and then make the page load fail (rather than repeating the same message ad infinitum).

this is a basic install (well actually I had a bunch of add-ons but they are all disabled since I upgraded to 3.5.2 and the browser wouldn't stay up for more than a few minutes, but that's another problem).
