The page in the URL field displays fine (with readable russian) in Safari and Camino.
I believe that the issue I'm having has the same cause. I can't type in russian in address bar, google search bar and google search field on google.com.
There are maybe other places, but these are the ones that I found.
Font appear fine in cyrillic everywhere else on the system.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start firefox
2. Switch to russian input source
3. Type anything in the address bar, google search bar

or go to google.com and try typing in russian in the search field.
Actual Results:  
????? are displayed instead of letters

Expected Results:  
display russian letters correctly

I spend quite some time searching around. Reinstalled the font. It seems to work fine if I add russian into the UI language list in "international" in pref or the OS and make russian first in the list. But this makes all the menus in all apps display in russian.
