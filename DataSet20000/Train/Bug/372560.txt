This is a printing related problem.

When ever firefox is embedding fonts in the printed ps file (i.e. font.FreeType2.printing set to true), the following pdf file (generate using ps2pdf) will always have a problem, i.e. copy the select the text in that pdf and paste into a word processor you will see very strange characters. For example, the copied text of 'google' will appear to be '' and more over it's not searchable and the hyperlink is missing.

However this is not a problem for openoffice build-in pdf export module. You can copy-paste, you can search and the hyperlink is working. Could you implement their module in firefox?
