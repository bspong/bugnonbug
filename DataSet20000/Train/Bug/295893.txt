Suggestion for Security Patch Level version be mainained in Firefox, to avoid problems like the 1.0.4 update on Ubuntu Linux
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050526 Firefox/1.0.4 (Ubuntu package 1.0.4)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050526 Firefox/1.0.4 (Ubuntu package 1.0.4)

As you may know, when Ubuntu applied the security updates from 1.0.4 to their
production release of Firefox 1.0.2, there were problems accessing the firefox
extensions pages.  This was done as a kludge to prevent non-upgraded versions of
Firefox from getting in.

Simplest way to avoid issues with users would have been to put a button at the
end of the warning that would allow users to continue on anyway.  But as
suggested in Ubuntu's Bugzilla #10681
(https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=10681), maybe Firefox could start
keeping an internal security patchlevel version number that could be used for
such cases.

Ubuntu has good reasons for doing security-only updates to the released software
packages on Hoary (Ubuntu 5.0.4).  Having a separate security patch level
version string could make this all make more sense.  It would be more manageable
all around.  I am still a little confused perhaps, but I believe that Ubuntu's
Firefox "1.0.4" is actually 1.0.2 with security updates backported from Mozilla
Firefox 1.0.3 and 1.0.4.  With a patch level, the "About" page could say
something like "Ubuntu build Firefox version 1.0.2, Security Patch Level 1.0.4".
