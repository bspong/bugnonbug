Main Window frame incorrect after using F11 full screen view

Main frame comes back funky after viewing a web page in full screen mode using the F11 function key. Can return to proper (default) fuctioning by minimizing page and the reopening it. When this fault occurs none of the lower switch application tabs (buttons) will work until going through minimize/maximize action. Not critical, just annoying.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use F11 function key to view a web page in full screen.
2. Use F11 again to return to normal view. 
3. Use minimize/maximize to cure errors. (Use Alt-tab to switch applications then back if minimize button not functional.
Actual Results:  
Main window returns to proper funtioning and lower system tabs (buttons) work again.

Expected Results:  
Main window frame should have come back functioning correctly after F11 full screen view use.

I suspect the minimize/maximize corrective action forces software to redraw frame and remap buttons from scratch. A routine of some sort to force this to happen should probably be attatched to the F11 routines... but I'm not a programmer.
