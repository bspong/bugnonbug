Installer engine writes different Mozilla registry data, based on update method
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: 1.5.0.3

Registry keys written by the installer vs. the autoupdate process are different.

If I install 1.5.0.3 by downloading the exe and installing it, I get 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Mozilla\Mozilla Firefox 1.5

If I install 1.5.0.3 via autoupdate, I get
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Mozilla\Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.3

Similarly, using the full installer I get this:
GeckoVer = 1.7.5

But if I autoupdate,
GeckVer = 1.8.0.3

Note that this has been an ongoing problem with all 1.5x versions.

it appears that the full install exe package is not being modified with each release so that it writes version specific registry keys.  The builder is probably using the old 1.5 packaging and simply placing the new bits in it.  They should also be modifying the reg key values that are written by the installer so they match what is written by the autoupdate process (which looks like it writes the keys using dynamic information from the files that are deployed).

By having two different sets of data written depending upon which installation method is chosen (installer vs. autoupdate), it makes it more difficult for systems management solutions to identify which version is installed.  By using a consistent set of reg keys regardless of installer process, customers can get a better experience and better manage future updates to the product as they'll have a consistent way of seeing what version is installed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install 1.5.0.3 using the full installer exe
2. review the reg keys under HKLM\Software\Mozilla
3. install 1.5.0.3 via autoupdate from a prior version, on a separate machine from above
4. review the reg keys under HKLM\Software\Mozilla
5. Note the differences between the reg keys for the Mozilla Firefox key, and the GeckoVer for the two types of installs.
Actual Results:  
When I install 1.5.0.3 by downloading the exe and installing it, I get 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Mozilla\Mozilla Firefox 1.5

When I install 1.5.0.3 via autoupdate, I get
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Mozilla\Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.3

When I install 1.5.0.3 by downloading the exe and installing it, I get 
GeckoVer = 1.7.5

When I install 1.5.0.3 via autoupdate, I get
GeckoVer = 1.8.0.3

Expected Results:  
The reg key and the reg value between the two types of installs should be the same.  They should reflect the true versions
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Mozilla\Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.3
and
GeckoVer = 1.8.0.3
