Google Maps mouse wheel (zoom) also triggers page scroll
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:6.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0
Build ID: 20110811165603

Steps to reproduce:

On pages that have Google Maps component(s) embedded with mouse wheel zoom (scrollwheel option) enabled, use the mouse wheel over any of these components while the page has a higher scrollHeight than the height of the viewport and the 'overflow' property is not set to 'hidden'.



Actual results:

After the map starts to zoom in/out, the page also scrolls one step up/down just like it should whenever someone uses the mouse wheel for scrolling. I experienced this about 95% of the time; sometimes it works as it should, though, as mentioned in the question below.

I tried this with a vanilla install of FF6 on windows/x64 and osx 10.6 platforms.

(or any other google maps example)

This bug is claimed to have been fixed since the release of FF 6.0 and is related to the DOMMouseScroll event:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=650950


Expected results:

In all major browsers and in FF <= 5 the expected behavior was to zoom in/out and to _not_ scroll.

In FF 6.0, the DOMMouseScroll event _does_ propagate or "bubble up" somehow despite the contrary being explicitly stated in the documentation or an effectively similar mechanism triggers a page scroll almost every time I use the mouse wheel.
