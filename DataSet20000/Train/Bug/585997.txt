Go to 
http://www.firstchoicemarine.com/c-643-parts-finder.aspx
Put in make/year/model. 
Site complains that my browser is rejecting cookies. 

I check tools/options/privacy and accept third party cookies is unchecked. 
I check cookies on the page with cookie viewer, all the cookies are from either www.firstchoicemarine.com or .firstchoicemarine.com, not a third party. 

However the parts lookup is a frame, 
http://www.selocmarine.com/retail_counterman/index.php?aid=firch&header=none
an apparent data provider. 

This different domain has caused the site to fail function because of the third party cookies being blocked.  Checking accept third party cookies restores functionality of this site. 

I realize this is likely as designed but clearly this must come up many times, where a data provider site is in a frame but the cookies are being handed out from the underlying site.  

Can firefox somehow address this? 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Uncheck accept third party cookies, a privacy setting. 
2.Go to http://www.firstchoicemarine.com/c-643-parts-finder.aspx
3.Use the parts finder, but it fails because the embedded frame is from 
http://www.selocmarine.com/retail_counterman/index.php?aid=firch&header=none
but the cookies come from the underlying site. 
4. Function is restored by allowing third party cookies.
5. The only solution is to allow third party cookies globally.  What was the reason for allowing their restriction in the privacy settings if they have to be allowed globally to make legitimate websites work? 
Actual Results:  
Site fails after you put in make/year/model because of third party cookies restriction in Firefox privacy settings. 

Expected Results:  
Cookies from firstchoicemarine.com are accepted, as first party cookies.  The frame from another site causes this to fail when accept third party cookies is selected.  

Not sure, but this is the first time I have seen this issue.  There must be many embedded frames with functions provided by a third party, and clearly most work even with third party cookies blocked.
