can't load Firefox

I was running Firefox 3.5.5 and it was working alright until this past week when I added 3 add-ons from your site.  I had been running Adblock and NoScript with no problems.  The 3 add-ons just added were ScrapBook, ShortenUrl, and one other.  All of a sudden, Firefox began to fail.  I removed the add-ons.  It didn't help.  I removed Firefox and tried reinstalling 3.5.5, and then 3.6.  Didn't work.  Tried installing 3.1 - didn't work.  I'm getting the following error messages:
Error: Warning: unrecognized comeand line flag - foreground Slource File:  Error: Warning: unrecognized command line flag -foreground
