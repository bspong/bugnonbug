When I try to login to this Bank of America Account after I enter my userID, the browser was supposed to take me to another page where I can see the "security image" and a field to enter my password.  But in Firefox 3, after I enter my User ID and click "Enter", the browser thows in this error message.

Firefox2 works perfectly and Safari works perfectly also.  I tested this problem with Firefox3 RC3 also and the problem still persists.

I was able to access the Bank of America online Banking usign Minefield without any problem till about 10 days ago.  I updated Flash to version 9 (the latest player) a few days ago and I am not sure whether that created the problem.  I deleted and reinstalled the flas player and the problem still persists.  

I created a new profile and tried to use the BofA online banking using the new profile, the problem still persists. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Login "https://www.bankofamerica.com/index.jsp"
2.Enter User ID and choose the state as "California"
3. Yu will see the message on the browser page
