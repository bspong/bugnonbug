Add a right click context menu to the back and forward menus

When one right clicks the back or foward buttons, a menu pops up. But, when one
right clicks one of *those* sites listed in this menu, instead of getting a
context menu, the same behavior as a left click (it goes to that page) is executed. 

What I propose is a context menu to pop up on top of this primary menu when
right clicking on these back and foward button history entries, as well as when
right clicking the history entries in the Go menu. I think most effectively, the
context menu options would be: Open (default), Open in New Window, and Open in
New Tab (which happen to be the applicable options taken directly from the
Bookmarks right click context menu). These options would coincide with and
compliment the functionality given by the middle click enhancement of Bug 202819
"Middle mouse click on the back button opens previous page in new tab
(enhancement)" and Bug 214816 "Middle click on links in go menu does not open a
new tab", but would also dually serve as an alternative or replacement option
for users who happen to have their middle click functionality disabled,
unavailable, or assigned to alternative uses.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Right click on entries in the back, foward, and Go menus



Actual Results:  
In the Back and Foward menus, the right click does the same as a left click and
opens the page in the current window.
In the Go menu, a right click does nothing.

Expected Results:  
Expected results:
A context menu opens up with options when entries are right clicked.
