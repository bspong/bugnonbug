Flash <object> tag not displaying.  Will display on initial load but not reload, or if served with local filesystem, or if the flash object appears twice on the page.

Flash object's included with an <object> tag do not display.

This bug appears first the beta 5 release, it works in beta 4.  I downloaded several nightlies and isolated the first build that broke: 2008032304.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
First Test:

1.  Visit any of these urls:
http://oak.cobaltpointe.com/~aluter/swfobject/index.html
http://oak.cobaltpointe.com/~aluter/swfobject/index_minimum.html
http://oak.cobaltpointe.com/~aluter/swfobject/index_double.html

2.  Notice that the flash (may) load.

3.  Reload the page.

Second test:

1.  Download from this url:
http://oak.cobaltpointe.com/~aluter/swfobject.zip

2.  Unzip and view locally (with a file:// uri) index.html, index_minimum.html and index_double.html.

3.  Note that all flash objects load.

Actual Results:  
First Test:

Flash does not load, except on index_double.html where the second object does load.

Second Test:

All flash objects load.

Expected Results:  
First Test:

All flash objects should load both before and after the reload.

Second Test:

All flash objects should load.

Tested on Windows XP.  Probably reproducible on other systems but have time.
