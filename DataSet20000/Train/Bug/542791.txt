Yahoo mail won't let you login quickly with Firefox

First off, Internet Explorer 8 works fine and doesn't exhibit this "bug" like Firefox 3.6 does.

The problem is... if you type "mail.yahoo.com" into the address bar and then press <enter> in Firefox 3.6, Firefox will go to the appropriate yahoo web page (ok so far), but then will just stop displaying the rest of the page for about 5 seconds and then finally will continue displaying the rest of the mail.yahoo.com web page.  If you try to type in your Yahoo email account name or password into the form fields before that 5 seconds of hesitation, whatever you've typed gets completely erased and then the rest of the Yahoo mail web page gets displayed.  So in other words, you have to wait, wait, wait until the mail.yahoo.com web page is completely displayed before you can start typing.  Internet Explorer 8 doesn't exhibit this problem.  Thanks.
