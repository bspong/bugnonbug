Wrong address in address bar
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

When you click a link in a web page the address bar does not update, it still shows the address of the last page you were on, as if you are still there. For example, you click a link to www.mozilla.org on a Google search results page, it still shows the address of the Google search page and not www.mozilla.org, despite you leaving Google, even if you open a new tab or restart the browser it still doesn't update!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox (version 3 Release Candidate 2, Windows XP)
2. go to a random address (like www.google.com)
3. click on a link somewhere on that page
Actual Results:  
the address stayed the same as the page you were originally viewing 

Expected Results:  
the browser updates the address to the new one

this may affect History too, as it may log all pages under the same domain, even the pages outside of the domain, and a workaround may be to go into page info and get the URL and type it in manually, updating the address yourself, but this may be frustrating for some people as they have to update the address each time they go to a new page and, if it's a PHP encoded page, they may lose data and cause them to switch back to they're old Web Browser, and cause everyone else not using firefox never to switch.

And here is something that may help you fix this, my build config:
