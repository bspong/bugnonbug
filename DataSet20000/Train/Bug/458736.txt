Build Identifier: 

Get odd error message at startup and unable to use Mozilla Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Mozilla Firefox to surf web
2.That's it
3.
Actual Results:  
Check above.

Expected Results:  
A popup window appears with the following message:

Title of popup window is: Alert

Text inside of popup is as follows:

Could not initialize the application's security component. The most likely cause is problems with files in your application's profile directory. Please check that this directory has no read/write restrictions and your hard disk is not full or close to full. It is recommended that you exit the application and fix the problem. If you continue to use this session, you might see incorrect application behaviour when accessing security features.

I would assume that as normal, it would automatically start up and allow me to surf the web.

I will note that earlier yesterday (10-05-08) that everything was working fine. But after a restart of my computer, I found that this error would now occur and seems to not go away.
