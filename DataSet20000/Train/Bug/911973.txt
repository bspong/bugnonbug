Keyboard does not function in Firefox
User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E; MS-RTC LM 8)

Steps to reproduce:

Unsure exactly. My computer was at the lock screen, and I know Firefox was running in the background. I wiped my keyboard with a duster cloth, as I often do, and then proceeded to unlock the computer. Upon doing so, I noticed I was not able to type anything into Firefox.


Actual results:

Firefox does not allow me to type anywhere. The only key that still works in Firefox is the TAB key. All other keys do not function whatsoever. The keyboard works in all other applications perfectly normally.

Firefox continues to function other than the keyboard input not working. I can browse to websites in my favourites using the mouse and click on links. However, the keyboard will not function in ANY text field.

I have attempted to use a different keyboard, with identical results. I then attempted to use the Windows On-Screen Keyboard, with identical results. Computer has been rebooted, Firefox uninstalled, profile removed (basdically a CLEAN install of FF), still not working.


Expected results:

I should be able to type in all text fields.
