background dom updates cause firefox to "flicker"

I've written a javascript application which hides and reveals bits and pieces of a page sometimes in response to a completed xmlHttpRequest.  Your usual stuff.  With the default firefox on ubuntu (1.0.7), this all works fine.  With 1.5 and 1.5.0.1, I get a lot of "flicker", either the areas clear before being repainted, or invisible content appears for a split second.

Now, I might just assume I'm doing something wrong (though it worked before), but this also affects the smooth transitions in gmail.com, and, surely, those guys know what they're doing!

3. Pay attention to the obvious screen repaint.

Actual Results:  
You can see the screen repaint.

Expected Results:  
You don't see the screen or area repaint.

Having to absolutely position a whole lot of variable length textual elements (or tabular) seems a bit overkill for what used to work fine.  Also, it's much nicer to be able to just redraw a table with one new line in it than to process a lot of DOM elements and insert a row into a table (if that's even possible).

On the other hand, quicker reflow and redraw is nice too!  What a dilemma!

Are you guys going to tell Google to rewrite their app? (That sounds nasty, but, really, I don't mean to be!)

Just seems like something's not quite right.  Like maybe redraw/reflow should be fast when you're download pages, maybe a bit slower when you're manipulating the dom.  Shrug!
