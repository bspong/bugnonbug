FF might leak between tabs, and thinks LAN not secure

Steps to reproduce:

(This is really only a heads-up, since I killed the FF job immediately and did not try to reproduce the problem)

A little earlier this morning, while loading a page from my server-of-all-work, the load appeared to wait on decenthat.com, a data-collecting site.  

Since I myself wrote every line in vanilla PHP and JS on the page I was loading, I knew there was no reference to that site unless it was somehow embedded in a font.  Nor did I at the time know what the 'decenthat' site was, so I immediately killed the FF job.  

At the time, there was another tab open to a site (truthdig, iirc) that permits all kinds of capitalist crap to piggyback on their page loads, and the only thing I can suppose is that, somehow, there was some contamination between the two tabs such that decenthat thought it could snoop the page from my server too; that, or the notice belonged the other tab even though that tab had been open for awhile and should not still have been waiting on any site.

While trying to figure out what had happened, I opened Tools->PageInfo resp. the page from my server and discovered that FF doesn't distinguish between intranet and internet even though it should realise that a reference without a TLD was to a local node, not a site.  But it doesn't, and declared categorically that the connection to my server is insecure, which it's not unless FF is insecure:  there's a dedicated pfsense box with snort sitting between the DSL modem and the LAN, and nothing gets in without an invitation.  Probably FF should distinguish between node and site references, and qualify claims about insecurity where the reference is to a node.

I checked the "security" box below because if there *is* some kind of between-tab contamination, it's potentially a pretty big problem.
