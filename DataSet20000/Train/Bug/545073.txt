When using the "save & quit" tab feature in 3.6 while another session of firefox is running some or all the bookmarks will be lost or corrupted,(you couldn't "save & quit" in previous versions when another session was running). The other session is usually a streaming web radio broadcast with limited menu options, which does not shut down when the regular session is shut down using the "save & quit". Upon start up, especially after shutting down the streaming session, the bookmarks will be effected.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start firefox, and then start a streaming broadcast from it in another window
2.shut down main session.
3.Now restart firefox (either after shutting down the streaming session or not)Some or all bookmarks will be missing and/or corrupted.
Actual Results:  
Some or all bookmarks will be missing and/or corrupted. Gets worse with each restart until all bookmarks are lost.

Expected Results:  
"save & quit" tab feature should shut down all running sessions of firefox while preserving bookmarks and tabs in each session 
OR 
not allow the "save & quit" tab feature while other sessions are running as in previous versions.
