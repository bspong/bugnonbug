Steps to reproduce:

I added a feature to Greasemonkey to use Scratchpad as the default script editor.

Actual results:

I'm calling ScratchpadManager.openScratchpad() with a filename argument, which it seems to support -- but it doesn't read that file into the editor, so I'm also specifying the text argument.  Which it puts into the editor, but it then puts the cursor at the end of this text.


Expected results:

This is incongruent with the behavior that actually picking File>Open in Scratchpad displays: it puts the cursor at the top (as expected).  Pretty much every editor, when opening a new initial file at launch, or opening a file interactively, puts the cursor at the top of the file.

Either:
A) Supplying the filename argument to openScratchpad() should act exactly like picking that file after doing File>Open  (read its contents, put it in the editor, put the cursor at the top), or
B) The cursor should start at the top of the editor even when supplying initial text.
