javascript "new windows" set to open in a new tab, they do so once, and all further links reuse that tab

I configure Firefox to force all "new window" calls to a new tab- this works fine... [browser.link.open_newwindow set to 3, browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction set to 0], however when I click a javascript new window link- available from the supplied URL, any of the bold text links at the bottom left of the page- I notice it will open a new tab correctly 1 time, and in all subsequent links of the same type, it will instead open in that first new tab, not creating new tabs for each link as Firefox 1.5 did (and still does, I reinstalled it after noticing this problem).

I have found no information about why online, though I have found evidence others are experiencing this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set your browser.link.open_newwindow setting to 3, and browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction to 0.
2. Go to the supplied URL.
3. Click a bold text link to open a new tab.
4. Click another link and it will open in the previous tab.
Actual Results:  
The second (and any subsequent) links will all reuse the single new tab.

Expected Results:  
It should open each link in its own new tab.

No other relevant information.  I apologize if this report is flawed in any way; it is the first time I have had to file one.  I hope this issue is resolved, as it seriously hampers the functionality I was used to.  Thanks.
