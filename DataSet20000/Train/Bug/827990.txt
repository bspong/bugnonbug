inspector tests use DOM MutationObserver API incorrectly
I'm debugging some issues with page event queues (bug 715376) and am running into an error with browser_inspector_markup_edit.js.  The below log is from Linux64, but the error occurs on all platforms:

https://tbpl.mozilla.org/php/getParsedLog.php?id=18584189&tree=Try#error1

As near as I can tell, what happens is this:

1. We start a test from inside a function called from the event loop (on a clean tree, the function is injected directly into the event loop; in the above tree, the function is called via setTimeout)

The call to executeSoon with this handler function is here:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/markupview/test/browser_inspector_markup_edit.js#353

which is going to trigger the handler for a new-node event here:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/markupview/test/browser_inspector_markup_edit.js#347

which is going to call the functions below.

2. We select a node of interest:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/markupview/test/browser_inspector_markup_edit.js#248

This code causes a MutationObserver to be set up on the node in question.

3. Perform various things to trigger the mutation observer:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/markupview/test/browser_inspector_markup_edit.js#258

4. And finally, check various things, some of which should have been set by the mutation observer:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/markupview/test/browser_inspector_markup_edit.js#269

Notice that this is all done in the context of the handler function.  Which means--assuming I understand smaug's explanation of the MutationObserver API--that the changes we expect to see in step 4 don't actually happen until the handler stops running.

At least, that's what seems to be happening in my tree.  I don't understand why this same issue doesn't show up in an unpatched tree.

The fix is simple enough.  But I wanted to file this bug to see if somebody had an opinion on my analysis.
