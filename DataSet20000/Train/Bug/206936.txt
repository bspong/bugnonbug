I have the default Firebird theme, except I have customized the toolbar to show
only big icons (no text). I have also installed the SmoothWheel v0.2 Extension.

I have made Firebird my default browser using the Web tab in the OS X Internet
preferences pane.

When I click on a link in Entourage V.X it opens a new Firebird window but it
uses the Classic theme rather than the default one (Modern?). Also it sometimes
shows the Siebar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set Firebird as your default browser in OS X Internet Preferences Pany
2. Open Firebird
3. Open Entourage
4. Find an email with a link (In my case it is a plain-text email, not HTML)
5. Click the link

Actual Results:  
New firebird window will open with Classic theme...

Expected Results:  
Should have opened a window with the Modern theme. (Ideally it should have
reused an existing window, but that's a different issue. ;) )
