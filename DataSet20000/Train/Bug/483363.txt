Firefox 3.0.7 is not remembering information normally saved in cookies, including entered account information, and forum status information such as removing "new post" notifications after posts have been access or marked as read, until after the page as been hard-refreshed (CTRL+F5) at least once, if ever. I've cleared all the cookies, and even deleted the cookies.sqlite file in my profile folder, and neither has done anything to help. Cookies are being created for said sites, but they don't seem to load their information into the browser when pages are changed. This isn't just a single site, this has been every single site where permanent or per-session cookies are usually stored.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Browse to a site that is password protected or otherwise has per-session cookies to keep track of your navigation
2.Enter password and log in
3.Click a "New Post" notification link and access link location and/or mark forum as read, click OK/Enter/etc.
4.Forum page loads in again, with the same "New Post" notification link still in place, at least until you hit CTRL+F5 at least once. Even then, it isn't guaranteed to register the fact that you've visited that link.
5.Log into the page again, because by now, the browser has forgotten your login information.
Actual Results:  
Browser didn't register that "New Post" notification links were already view, or posts to the site are not made. Hitting CTRL+F5 sometimes makes it register.

Expected Results:  
Entering a post should post when you hit enter and New Post Notification links should clear after you've visited the page

Other pages are acting strange in Firefox since the upgrade to 3.0.7; pages stop loading and show just a blank white page many times
