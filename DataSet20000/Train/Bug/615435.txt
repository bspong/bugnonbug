Relocate the Home button to the right side of the browser
This change is likely to be controversial, but I believe we should relocate the Home button to be to the left of the bookmarks button.  This button was never meant to be part of Firefox 4 (we were transitioning to the home tab), so the fact that it is still in our UI at this stage is a bit unplanned.

Cons:
-Breaks consistency with previous versions of Firefox
-Will move to the left again in Firefox 4.x or 5 when we introduce the home tab, which is a bit chaotic

Pros:
-External consistency with the bulk of non-Firefox market share (IE7/8/9)
-Nice mapping with the bookmarks menu (home is basically a super bookmark)
-Users who hit home in order to do a google search (most of them) will potentially discover the search bar, which is now right next to the home button
-No consistency violation with Chrome (doesn't have a home button by default)*
-No consistency violation with Safari (doesn't have a home button)
-Reduces the visual complexity of the back/forward area back to the original Firefox 4 mockups

Mostly it feels like the arguments not to move the control mostly come down to trying to reducing how much we change our UI.  Users can of course always customize the button position to wherever they would like to place it.

[* depending on what day of the week it is, and how the stars are aligned.  I really can't figure out their position on the home button.]
