[e10s] The Pocket "read later" button in Location Bar is not working when e10s is enabled (won't let me add to my reading list)
STR:

SETUP STEPS: Get Pocket installed, and make your profile e10s
=============================================================
 0. Create a (free) account at https://getpocket.com/

 1. Install Pocket extension from
   https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/read-it-later/

 2. Enable e10s by setting browser.tabs.remote.autostart to true, and restart Firefox.

 3. Click the pocket icon, at the right end of your location bar.
    --> A dialog pops up to create account / log in.
 4. Log into your account.

TRIGGERING THE BUG
==================
 5. Now, visit any site with some text that would be suitable for saving to Pocket -- e.g. https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/README

 6. Click the pocket icon at the right end of your location bar.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
The icon should change color, and the page should end up in my reading list.

ACTUAL RESULTS:
Nothing happens. (Icon doesn't change color, and my reading list is unchanged.)
