Before I wasn't able to even login to this site.  Now I can login but I can't get movies to play instantly using Firefox.  It works with Internet Explorer but Firefox gives me this error:

Error code N8106-106
An internet or home connection problem is preventing playback.  Please check your internet connection and try again.

There is no problem with my internet connection, there is a problem with how this program is establishing a secure connection but I don't know what that problem is or I would fix it myself

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.login at the url listed in url 
2.try to play an instant movie and it gives me the error message listed in details
3.
Actual Results:  
get error message listed in details

People at Nexflix are useless they can't give me any resolution to this problem.  What security checks are Firefox doing that Internet Explorer doesn't do?

Clearing the cache, cookies, etc. doesn't fix this, does anyone know what will?
