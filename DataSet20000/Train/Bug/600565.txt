Extension Using new FF4 AddonManager module on startup to retrive current version and check if install/update was performed. 

On first startup after install/update (FF requested restart) AddonManager is accessible (object and funciton can be dumped to log) but not returning extension by id and all installed extension at all (callback funciton never called).

After next restart of FF - everything is working correcting. 

Note: this problem is not reproducible when extension installed via link in profile. Can be reproduced using drag&drop of xpi file to the FF window. 

Didn't tested installation/update from url.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create simple extension that importing AddonManager module (resource://gre/modules/AddonManager.jsm) and dump all installed extensions to the log or using alerts. 
2. Pack xpi file
3. Install it by dragging into FF4 window
4. Restart FF as requested

Actual Results:  
After restart extension is not dumping list of installed addons

Expected Results:  
After restart extension can retrive information about itself and other addons.

Such behaviour breaks install/update logic (creating preferences, modifying state, etc).
