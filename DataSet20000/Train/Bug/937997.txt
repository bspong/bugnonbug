+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #932781 +++

When bug 920978 starts with "uncaught exception - NS_ERROR_FAILURE: Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIZipReader.open] at chrome://mochikit/content/chrome-harness.js:271" that means we're OOM.

When the stuff we're piling onto bug 935419 says "Ran out of memory while building cycle collector graph" that pretty clearly means we're OOM.

Yesterday, we backed out bug 936143 and bug 933882 and the rest of the stuff in https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Mozilla-Inbound&rev=ae6f2151610f for ASan OOM failures, though there were also non-ASan OOM failures while it was in.

Today it relanded in https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Mozilla-Inbound&rev=9f3212effb9f, seemed sort of okayish, and we merged it to mozilla-central (though not yet on to fx-team and b2g-inbound).

We're hitting lots of both bug 920978 starting with OOM nsIZipReader.open, and bug 935419 again.

We can say yet again that it's all shu's fault, back him out, and go back to frequently hitting those two OOM failures, but maybe not so frequently that we have to notice, or we can fix the underlying fact that we're constantly on the edge of OOM even when we don't go over.

mozilla-inbound, mozilla-central and fx-team are closed.
