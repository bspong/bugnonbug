My son sent me this URL via email.  After it ran I tried to see what other items there were on the page that might be of interst.  No matter what icon I clicked I got a page of Javascript instead of having the web page loaded.

I have also had the same problem with an email account that I have, but you need passwords to get in where you could see it happen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the URL.
2.Wait for the video to run its course (only about a minute).
3.Click some other icon on the page.
Actual Results:  
You see a page of Javascript when what you should see is another video.

Expected Results:  
Another video.

A page of computer code - apparently Javascript.
