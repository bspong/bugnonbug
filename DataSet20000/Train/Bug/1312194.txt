Similar issue: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=391889 (Difference: my Location Bar does not necessary just draw white and it also happens on adding text after deleting a character |  I am unsure if me and the reporter of bug 391889 mean exactly the same -> If this was the case, sorry for reporting it a another time)

Attachment: 
LocationBarDelTextNoShowGifs.zip contains 2 GIF files which show the problem. Since I could not find an option to add multiple files in the submission, I've opted to zip them together. I hope this is ok. If not, please let me know where I can attach the images separately. 

I am happy to provide you with more information if such information would be needed in order to fix this issue.
