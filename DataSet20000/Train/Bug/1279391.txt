Bookmark editor wrongly replaces "cancel" button with "remove"
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.11; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0

Steps to reproduce:

Current tab contains URL with bookmark with 16 tags.
Hit star to open "Edit Bookmarks".
Realize that I didn't want to do this, and INSTINCTIVELY (10 years of muscle memory) hit the cancel button.


Actual results:

The bookmark and its 16 tags were irrevocably deleted, since the CANCEL button has been replace by the REMOVE_BOOKMARK button.


Expected results:

Either nothing should have happened (no button there), or cancel the transaction should have been performed by having a cancel button there.

A cancel button should never ever be replaced with its opposite, delete, even if you buy the "too cluttered" accusation for the bookmark editor window, which I don't.

By default, the bookmark editor window has been crippled by being fixed size and way too tiny (a long standing complaint).  In this state, the itty-bitty window was spuriously accused of being too cluttered, and crippled even more by having its cancel (abort all changes, ie "please don't do anything") button removed by bug 1247830.

I just now deleted yet another bookmark due to this misplacement, so am quite a bit upset.  It will take hours to recover.
