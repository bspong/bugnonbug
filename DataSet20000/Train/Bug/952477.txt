Upgrading Firefox from the installer should not add new icons to desktop/taskbar/program files
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20131205075310

Steps to reproduce:

I installed Firefox via the new "upgrade" button on Windows 7.  There was a tiny options button in the lower left where I could have configured shortcuts on the desktop/etc.  I didn't notice it though, I just pressed update (which is a GREAT new addition).


Actual results:

Firefox added an icon to my desktop, as this is the default.  It's fine to have that as a default on a new installation, but if I already have installed Firefox on my computer and have no desktop icon for Firefox, Firefox should not add one in an upgrade.


Expected results:

No desktop icon should have been created.  If a desktop icon already exists, and the path has changed to Firefox, a new icon could be added or the old one updated, so long as it is only a generic shortcut, not with command line parameter to open a specific profile, etc.  Same thing for taskbar and program files.  Whatever the user set on the old version of Firefox should be what happens when upgrading.

Thanks!  Firefox is awesome.
