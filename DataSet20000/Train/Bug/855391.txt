Steps to reproduce:

Mess around with Cc["@mozilla.org/browser/search-service;1"].getService(Ci.nsIBrowserSearchService).addEngine(). I've attached a reduced testcase (though the original testcase was never very big in the first place).


Actual results:

Timestamp: 2013-03-27 18:32:18
Warning: WARN addons.xpi: Exception running bootstrap method startup on searchmix@agrell.info: [Exception... "addEngine: Error adding engine:
TypeError: 'caller', 'callee', and 'arguments' properties may not be accessed on strict mode functions or the arguments objects for calls to them"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: resource://gre/components/nsSearchService.js :: FAIL :: line 262"  data: no]
Source File: resource://gre/components/nsSearchService.js
Line: 262

Line 262 contains only some kind of rethrow. The original line number is nowhere.


Expected results:

The error message should point to the root cause. The only use of caller, callee or arguments in that file is when assertions fire; saying that the line number is 4124 would've saved me a couple of minutes. I don't know if there are other possible ways to trigger this bug, but assertions can't be that rare...

I'd also prefer to see which assertion is firing, it would help in figuring out what I need to change.
