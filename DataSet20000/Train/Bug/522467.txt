Ceased responding while selecting a program to handle a downloaded file.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.1.4) Gecko/20091006 Firefox/3.5.4 GTB5

clicked on Windows player icon for streaming content, knowing that would create a file handling query, and navigated to VLC to handle the stream.cgi file.  While clicking on the choice from the Use: menu Firefox ceased responding and I had to force quit.  I have had many Force Quit experiences with this latest beta.  Sometimes it's as innocuous as entering a URL with a typo that makes Firefox unresponsive.  I thought at first it might be a memory issue sharing space with Parallels but the problems occur even when Parallels is not running a virtual Windows machine.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use Firefox to handle a non-standard file
2.field the request to chose a handler
3.initiate the handling of the file Firefox downloaded
Actual Results:  
I didn't perform those steps again, since the system now knows to use VLC to handle the file and I don't know of another non-standard file type to attempt.
