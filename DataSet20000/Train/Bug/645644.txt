Firefox crashes quite often with firebug installed [@ linux-gate.so@0x424 ]

I am using FF for web dev only. So I have only couple addons installed: firebug, grease monkey, httpfox, and web developer. The most used one is fb. Very often ff crashes after I tried to access different elements of fb. It may be expanding error message or xhr request, or opening another tab of fb. Fow now I did not get any sequence. To me it just crashes on plain cases. I may get up to few crashes per hour. I have tried to disable fb and use other addons to substitute fb and did not get any crashes. If I run browser just after crash, I did not get any message 'we had a crash, need to submit crash info', which is a bit weird to me.

After updating to ff4 I created *new* profile. 

I did not check the every crash, but couple of them (and I think all other too) finish with following message in console:

*** glibc detected *** firefox: free(): invalid next size (fast): 0x9f86ccf8 ***
Aborted

I am using stable branch of Gentoo Linux and www-client/firefox-4.0-r1 package, unstable at installation time. Now it substituted by r2, also unstable

Reproducible: Always
