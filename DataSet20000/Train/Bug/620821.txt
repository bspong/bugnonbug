135 failed reqs/sec to Google when using HTTP proxy

I setup my browser to use a web proxy that requires authentication.  When I start Firefox, it doesn't have my auth credentials yet, and the browser begins to try to access http://www.google.com/ 135 times per second, constantly.  Even after I enter my proxy credentials, and I'm surfing normally, Firefox continues to make 135 invalid (no authentication provided) requests per second to Google.

However, closing and re-opening the browser does solve the problem.  Until the next time I power up my computer and start Firefox again.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Power up laptop
2. Start Firefox
3. Watch web proxy logs


Expected Results:  
135 requests/second to http://www.google.com/

I would prefer it NOT to try to contact Google, but if it must, I would prefer that it recognize that I have eventually entered a username and password for web proxy authentication and use those credentials.
