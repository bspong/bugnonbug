browser window floats over other program's windows, even when other programs are brought forward.

The windows drawn by firefox somehow gain the ability to float on top of everything else.  This is like programs such as VLC which have that behavior as a feature.   I did not see any option to "make windows float"  so I think this may be a bug.  I'm running OSX 10.4.9.   I have clicked on other program's windows that can be seen partially, and also tried to use the exposé finder thingy to select a different window.  The other programs come forward, but the firefox window continues to block any of their windows.   

Also, firefox has gained the ability to move windows off the screen, covering the menu bar.  OSX usually blocks programs from being able to be placed covering the menubar.  I do have 2 monitors hooked up, but no other program is able to position a window partially off the top of the screen. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.well, I just leave firefox running and use it regularly. After time , possibly after watching embedded videos of flash or wmv nature.

Expected Results:  
Add an option to make windows float, or not.  So maybe whatever is causing it can be turned off.  If a website can make the windows float, it would be nice to have an option to stop them from doing that
