Modify Google Search String Attributes
As part of the renewal with Google, search query attributes for the Mozilla-branded versions of Firefox require modification to the "client" attributes, and the addition of a "channel" attribute. Modifications to the "rls" attribute are not required. The changes need to be made to each release channel we offer for desktop Firefox as below. Please note that these changes should NOT be used for Firefox Mobile.

Client Attribute Changes:

The client attributes must now be release-channel specific. The following client codes should be used by release, where Google is the default search provider (note that nightly should still use "unofficial" in the rls component, and the other three channels should use "official" in the rls component, as they are Mozilla-distributed builds. Firefox ESR should use the same client values as the Release channel:

Release: firefox-a
Beta:    firefox-beta
Aurora:  firefox-aurora
Nightly: firefox-nightly


Channel Attribute Additions:

Location Bar: All queries originating from the Location Bar should include the attribute of "channel=fflb" in addition to the existing attributes

Context/Right-click Search: All queries originating from the Context Menu/Right Click search for Google should include the attribute "channel=rcs" in addition to the existing attributes

About:home: All queries originating from the locally-hosted about:home should have an attribute of "channel=np" in addition to the existing attributes

Please let me know what additional information is required to develop product/config changes to accommodate these changes.
