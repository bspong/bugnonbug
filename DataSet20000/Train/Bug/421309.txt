Forms can only be submitted once
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080201 Firefox/2.0.0.12

Mozilla now seems to have some lock that prevents forms from being resubmitted.
This "bug" could have been added as a design feature, I have not pored over release notes.  But there are similar open reports: eg, 344420.

My application, which returns a 204 response code on form submission, no longer works because Mozilla (silently) refuses to repost the form submit request.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
This test requires a network sniffer.

1.  Visit the URL: http://tqis.com/mci/misc/touchmeform.htm
2.  Submit with the "Push the Button" button
3.  Observe the POST and server response on the network sniffer
4.  Submit the "Push the Button" button again.
5.  Observe that the browser does not transmit another POST request

I did not actually use a network sniffer.  I merely observed my server logs.  Any server containing a URL that returns a 204 response code can also be used.
Actual Results:  
The browser does not resubmit the form if the button is clicked more than once.

Expected Results:  
The browser should retransmit the post request every time the form is submitted.

I have not noticed this problem on older versions of Firefox.  IE 6 also works according to the Expected Results described above.
