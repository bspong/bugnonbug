flicker in address bar after using Firefox for a while (> 30 min)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de-DE; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050421 Firefox/1.0.3 (Debian package 1.0.3-2)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de-DE; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050421 Firefox/1.0.3 (Debian package 1.0.3-2)

When entering new addresses into the URL bar, the FF-window begins to flicker
and entry becomes sluggish (text lags way behind typing). For me it only happens
under Linux, but the bug has been persistent from 0.8 all the way to 1.0.3. 

I have tried a "naked" 1.0.3 stable as well as the latest nightly build on a
blank account with no extensions or themes installed. The problem definately
*is* there.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox Browser <= 1.0.3 under Linux
2. Surf the web on various sites for a while (about 30 minuts/5 sites)
3. Watch the annoying flickering screen bug when entering new addresses.

Actual Results:  
See summary

Expected Results:  
The browser window should not flicker and address text should appear as fast as
I can type.

I suspect maybe a problem with the "autocomplete" feature, but it is just a gut
feeling. I cannot find a way (even with about:config) to switch autocomplete off
entirely to confirm this feeling.
