Session isnt correctly saved and/or incorreclty restored when manually entering url in tab starting in version 43
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:42.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/42.0
Build ID: 20151029151421

Steps to reproduce:

New installation of FF 43.0.4 or above, with new profile.

Options to change from default setup :
	- "general", set "display previous tab"
	- "private life", set "use custom configuration for history". Uncheck "accept cookies"
	- close the option tab

Open a new tab, type in an url (for example http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/135201-rssro-issue/)

When the tab has finished loading, close FF.

Reopen FF.

Additional info :

I used the url given in that example to discover the bug, but the url itself doesnt matter.

This behaviour happend since v43 (tested versions v43.0.4, v44.0.2, v45.0.1). I triyed v42.0, and it gives the expected result.

I m using windows seven x64 SP1 on real hardware. I was also able to reproduce the bug in a VM running windows seven x64 SP1.


Actual results:

A blank tab is displayed


Expected results:

tab with url http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/135201-rssro-issue/ is reloaded
