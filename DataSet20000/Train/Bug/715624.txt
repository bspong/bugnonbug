sideby side split screen not resolved
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:9.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/9.0.1
Build ID: 20111220165912

Steps to reproduce:

as a new useer i elected to ck the bookmark 'sidebar' box.   


Actual results:

After that I all my screens are split in half and are side-by-side.  Opening in a new tab or window only re-creates the problem.  I tried the fix the was there for a split screen that was split top and bottom (unlike my side-by side screen) 
 I did ck all bookmarks and found one ck'd to display on side bar.  I unck'd it and still have the spilt screen.  I found the following  solution but it's over my head and I need help:
If you encounter strange problems relating to bookmarks, downloads, window placement, toolbars, history, or other settings, it is recommended that you try creating a new profile and attempting to reproduce the problem before filing bugs. Create a new profile by running Firefox with the -P command line argument, choose the "Manage Profiles" button and then choose "Create Profile...". Migrate your settings files (Bookmarks, Saved Passwords, etc) over one by one, checking each time to see if the problems resurface. If you do find a particular profile data file is causing a problem, file a bug and attach the file. 


Expected results:

the alternate solution should have been written for people that don't know what a
"by running Firefox with the -P command line argument," is.  
What should have happened?  I should no longer have a side-by-side split screen after uncking the 'side-bar' box of a bookmark and re-starting Firefox.  Please help.
