The error is in every page but evident when you have Google as your default page on open firefox, if you start typing in the URL bar at the end of a destination page loads by default the URL bar loses focus and the result is that you have written a piece of url in the URL bar the rest wrote in the object that took the focus after the page loads. For example you have in the url bar samethink like "www.faceb" and in the search of google after complete load of the page "ook.com".
I think that even if the page finishes loading the URL bar should not lose focus if they had first.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. set google as default page
2. close and reopen firefox
3. after opening when the page loading start write in url bar and you see the problem
Actual Results:  
samething like in the url bar you have part of your destination and the rest in the serach box of google

Expected Results:  
even if the page finishes loading the URL bar should not lose focus if they had first.
