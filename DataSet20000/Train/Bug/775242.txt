New "encrypted" symbol makes confusion and the few details from baloon text is not helpful

This is not exactly a bug, but is an annonying feature in Firefox 14.

I saw the same problem in Opera 11.x before, with the difference that in Opera at least if the certificate fails or loads partially in a web page (resulting in non-encrypted or partially encrypted connection, a security issue) it advice you. Firefox does not have something like this. 

However, in previous versions certified/encrypted sites that doesn't supports TLS was marked as a blue tag in the address bar (green for "all ok" sites). And if happens the related issue about encryption/certificate, Firefox does not show it, being this a warning sign.

In Firefox 14, encryption symbol looks grey, making confusion about certificate or encryption status if the related issue happens. It's good to remember that a vulnerability was discovered time ago with TLS and these sites (like Facebook or Yahoo! login page, for example) turned off the TLS support for security reasons. 

An alert in the baloon text (like Opera) and a distinctive color instead of grey lock for encrypted sites (like blue, used by older versions of Firefox) would be well appreciated.
