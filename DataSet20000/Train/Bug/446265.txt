everlasting 100% CPU usage upon closing - FX3 only -

This is an issue I never had with FX2 latest. It occurs since 3.0.0 (and 3.0.1). Whenever I close FX, I get 100% CPU usage for a lot more then 21s or 30s (see bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=415201) and it's not related to bookmarks or the like.

Startup time is normal.

The problem doesn't depend on browsed websites (AFAIK) nor on extensions (I have a very few of them, with one disabled because not supporting FX3).

I have no crash so I can't show you an error, but the 100% CPU useage has an impact on my CPU temp and on other processes running, of course. This can last for an entire night. This smells like a MM issue... (MM=memory manager) and I would look at the differences between latest FX2 and FX3.0.1 in this area if I were you ;-)


The process of FX2 unallocating memory was somewhat slow but predictable. I could follow it in Task Manager, seeing virtual memory being freed. The process took sometimes 10s or so.

Now in FX3 it lasts forever and no memory is deallocated. I have to kill the process manually so that the machine is functional again.

After this "kill", FX3 starts nicely, not complaining about a crashed session or the like.

If there is a way to track the problem down without myself compiling FX3 from sources, it would be nice ;-)

HTH

PS time permitting, I will try "FX3 in safe mode" to see if it does make any difference. I will post a followup later on.
