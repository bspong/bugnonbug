Logged out of multiple websites (redirected back to login page after a few clicks)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.10; rv:51.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/51.0
Build ID: 20161201172143

Steps to reproduce:

Website logins, multiple intermittent failures; where my site has a touchstone bounce, login sometimes succeeds, sometimes fails with a SAML error:
  "Error decoding authentication request message
  One cause of this error is an attempt to access the Touchstone Identity Provider login page directly..."

In the case of listed sites without touchstone, at some point a few clicks after logging in (or a few seconds of idleness) I am simply redirected back to the login screen. Sites:

ServiceNow + touchstone
RT + touchstone
Mediawiki + touchstone
F5 LTM management interface (password auth)
Wordpress (password auth)

(I can access/control both ends for most of these, but can't provide external access.)

This is reproducible in Safe mode, and my configuration (macos) has a long history of successful usage.


Actual results:

"Error decoding authentication request message
  One cause of this error is an attempt to access the Touchstone Identity Provider login page directly..." (for touchstone)
Redirected back to login page for wordpress etc.


Expected results:

Normal login/session lifetime.
