High CPU usage when zoom is not at default (100% CPU when scrolling, slow)

When the zoom is set at the default, scrolling is at normal speed. However, if one zooms out or zooms in (control-+ or control--) then scrolling 'hangs': press pagedown, and you get 100% CPU for around a full second before the action occurs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the example website given (but this occurs on lots of sites - that's just an example) 
2. At normal zoom, scroll up/down using pageup/pagedown.
3. Zoom in using control-+, then scroll up/down.
4. Zoom out using control--, control--, then scroll up and down.
Actual Results:  
Pageup/down works fine at normal zoom, but on either zoom in or zoom out the speed is very different, with a noticable 100% CPU usage for a second or so before the actual scroll action occurs.

Expected Results:  
Scrolling with pageup/pagedown should be fairly instantaneous, as it is when zoom is at the default.

Since this occurs in both zoom in and zoom out, it isn't related to the larger page size when zoomed in.

My (very uninformed) guess: Perhaps something to do with image scaling, a new feature in FF3 ?
