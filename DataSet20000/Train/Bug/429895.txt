Incorrect descriptions for connection errors

NOTE: URL above triggered this problem at time of writing but may allow connection again later (or from a different location). (Try with a non-existent domain name?)

When the browser fails to connect to the server, it puts up an information page intended to explain the situation. There are two errors in the *text* of this explanation:

1. The page text starts with: "Failed to Connect" and "Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at easy-designs.stikipad.com." OK. But then it continues with: "Though the site seems valid, the browser was unable to establish a connection."

=> If the browser can't connect, it *cannot* possibly conclude that the *site* seems valid. What is possibly intended is a more friendly term than "the URL seems valid" (which would be technically correct).

2. The Page title (shown on the *tab* for this information page) is: "Page Load Error".

=> There can only be a "page load error" when the browser has /already/ made a connection to the server.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.

Expected Results:  
For 1. (description on page):

Suggestion: use something like this:
"Though the URL (site address) seems valid, the browser was unable to establish a connection."

For 2. (Page title shown on tab):

The page title should be: "Connection Error".
