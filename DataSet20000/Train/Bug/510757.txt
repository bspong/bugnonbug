Damaged installation after a crash - including the profile manager

Firefox crashed today and the Crash Reporter popped up. The report was filed as http://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/pending/315b526b-1083-4fd8-8cd5-de6932090816

Upon restarting Firefox I found the interface to be corrupted rather badly. Please see the attached screenshots. Surprisingly, this is not just my profile - since the profile manager is also affected.

Hope someone knowledgeable will request further info soon enough, since I intend to reinstall Firefox later today.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Now that it's buggered, the problem is present at all times. No idea how to get into (or out of) this state.
Actual Results:  
- The captions of all buttons are gone
- The main menu is stretched to fit width-wise
- An extra outline is visible around all edit controls
- Website CSS is broken; e.g. Google docs content doesn't show at all; google search results look different (see screenshot).
- Text selection is not displayed (but operations on selected text work).
- Search provider text ("Google") is not gray like it always is but black.
- Text editing in textareas is subtly broken - e.g. if I place the caret at the start of this message and move right, the caret won't move past the first two characters; the Up arrow jumps extra lines; much other weirdness.
- Probably a lot of other things I haven't noticed


Expected Results:  
Work as designed.

I'm running Firefox x86 on Vista x64.
