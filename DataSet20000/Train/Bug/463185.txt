In Oracle Self Service Web Application (SSWA) we observerd at several places a "setting a property that has only a getter" in the error console when hitting a "javascript driven link" (e.g. an image) - usually followed by a another error: e.g. "a3 is undefined". 
All of them refer to "cabo/jsLibs/Common2_2_24_2.js".
=> in there "setting a property that has only a getter" refers to the following code (line 4387): 
   currElement.onfocus=new Function('event',a5);
=> "a3 is undefined" refers to (line 4198):
   var a4=a3.elements;

On Oracle's support platform Metalink, they state "this is a firefox bug - they have to fix it" and recommend using IE or FF2 instead.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto one of the pages where this issue occurs
2. Hit a link
3.
Actual Results:  
Nothing, that's the issue: as this error occurs, you can't get to the linked page or the linked function is not excuted

Expected Results:  
link to a page or execute a (javascript) function

I saw other bugs here, that seem to refer to the same issue; so I tested the page with the latest nightly (firefox-3.1b2pre.en-US.win32.installer.exe as of 5-NOV), but the issue still occurs.

Our problem is, that we convinced already about 70% of our employees to use firefox instead of IE - which worked fine with Oracle Applications in the past. But now we would have to tell them go back to IE or re-install firefox 2.X at all PCs :-(

We are on 11.5.10.2
