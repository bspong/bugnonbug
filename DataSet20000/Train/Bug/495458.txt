Firefox becomes unresponsive when Scrapbook is open and last window is closed (Mac)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042315 Firefox/3.0.10

When the Scrapbook extension (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/reviews/display/427) is installed in Firefox on Mac, if the Scrapbook sidebar is open when you close the last window, Firefox becomes somewhat non-responsive. Menus do not work, hotkeys (eg: Apple-N for new window, Apple-L for open location) which would normally spawn a new window instead do nothing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. On a Mac, install Scrapbook (currently, 1.3.3.9): https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/reviews/display/427
2. Restart Firefox to complete installation
3. Open the Scrapbook sidebar: View > Sidebar > Scrapbook
4. Close the Firefox window: click the red X in the top left corner
5. Click File > New Window
Actual Results:  
Nothing. No response, no activity.

Expected Results:  
Expected a new window.

This behavior does not occur if the Scrapbook sidebar is closed when the last window is closed. Nor does it happen when any other sidebar (eg: History) is open when the last window is closed.

It is necessary to quit the browser entirely, using either the Dock icon or the AppSwitcher. Note that the application is not regarded by Mac OS X as "not responsive" and does not, strictly speaking, need to be "Force Quit" - a regular quit instruction will do, but it cannot be given to Firefox directly via the menus or Apple-Q hotkey.
