XUL window fails to fire the onload event
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.15) Gecko/20080625 Ubuntu/7.10 (gutsy) Firefox/2.0.0.15 FirePHP/0.1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.15) Gecko/20080625 Ubuntu/7.10 (gutsy) Firefox/2.0.0.15 FirePHP/0.1.0

I've created an extension that needs to prevent the display of the default window (browser.xul) and instead display a custom replacement window. Based upon the choices the user makes within this window, I then either show the browser with a preset URL or display different custom windows.

To achieve this, I am using a component that implements nsICommandLineHandler. The code for this is taken from:

        http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Chrome:_Command_Line

The only changes I have made is to make it load my chrome URL and the Javascript console. I am not currently preventing the default action as I'm still developing.

In order to initialise the custom replacement window, I've added an onload attribute to the window element. The problem I have is that after I install the extension and click 'Restart Firefox', the onload event is executed, but when I start Firefox normally it is not. I've also tried adding "load" event listeners in the associated Javascript file with the following combinations:

        window.addEventListener (capture: false)
        window.addEventListener (capture: true)

        document.addEventListener (capture: false)
        document.addEventListener (capture: true)

        window.document.addEventListener (capture: false)
        window.document.addEventListener (capture: true)

In testing this I used the following versions (all Ubuntu Gutsy Linux) with the following results: 

        1.5.0.7 - "load" fires every time
        1.5.0.8 - "load" only fires on XPI install or after compatibility check
        1.5.0.12 - "load" only fires on XPI install or after compatibility check
        2.0.0.14 - "load" only fires on XPI install or after compatibility check
        3.0 - "load" only fires on XPI install or after compatibility check

So according to this, either the behaviour was incorrect for < 1.5.0.8 or one of the bug fixes broke this behaviour - or I've made a mistake somewhere :)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
To reproduce the problem I'm having (using 3.0 on Ubuntu Gutsy), I use the following steps:

    1. From within the un-tarred directory execute:

          ./firefox -profilemanager

    2. Create a new profile - say "onload.test.3.0"

    3. Accept the license, disable "Default Browser" checking when
prompted, and select "No" to make Firefox my default browser

    4. Change the "javascript.options.showInConsole" preference to "true"

    5. Install the extension attached to this ticket and click "Restart Firefox"

At this stage everything is ok as the errors created by the extension (using CU.reportError) appear in the error console after Firefox restarts. Next:

    6. Close Firefox

    7. From with the un-tarred directory execute:

          ./firefox -P onload.test.3.0

This is where the problem occurs - there is nothing within the error
console! Running the profile manager and selecting the new profile
causes the same error, as does starting Firefox with the new profile set
as the default.

Actual Results:  
The onload event is only fired after the initial XPI installation or a compatibility check.

Expected Results:  
The onload event should fire every time the XUL window is loaded.
