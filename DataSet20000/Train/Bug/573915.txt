Unwanted cursor on bookmarks toolbar makes two bookmarks disappear

This has happened a few times since about the 20th of June trunk build (but could have happened earlier without me knowing).

After normal web browsing (on sites that don't use any OOPP), the last two bookmarks on my bookmarks toolbar will spontaneously either disappear or cannot be dragged around, and a cursor remains there even though I have neither dragged anything into that area, nor is my mouse there.

I cannot get rid of the cursor or retrieve access to my bookmarks without restarting the browser.

A screenshot is attached.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
This problem has occurred a number of times, however - sometimes it actually hides the bookmarks there (as in the screenshot), other times I can still access the bookmarks however the cursor remains, and I cannot drag around those bookmarks.
Actual Results:  
The problem occurred when I was simply browsing MozillaZine... but it is not site-specific.

Expected Results:  
This problem should not occur.
