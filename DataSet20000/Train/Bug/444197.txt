Firefox 3 bug demo: page http://uuroanoke.org/firefox3demo/ uses frames. It calls on a menu frame and a content frame page, frame1.htm which works perfectly by itself, but which does not work as a framed page in Firefox 3. To see this, click on the links on this page. These links works correctly in Firefox 2, IE 7, and Opera 8.54.

Notice that the first five links all seem to work, but the last links doesn't. The file for case 5 is identical to the file for case 6. Only the path to the contents is different.

Please try this again, looking at only this page without being in a frameset.  It will work.

Thanks for looking at this. JDH.
