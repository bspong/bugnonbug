Opening Gmail Causes Hanging of Mozilla Firefox 13.0
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:13.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/13.0
Build ID: 20120601045813

Steps to reproduce:

I Opened gmail.com, It opened finely then i logged in my account, For the First Time it worked great but after that each & every time i open Gmail, it causes a hang to Mozilla Firefox untill Gmail Loads Inbox, I Checked it on Other Browser Like Google Chrome, it worked fine (to confirm that may it be internet problem) but Google Chrome confirms that its Browser's Problem (Firefox) So i would like the programmers to make it compatible!

My PC is 2.8 GHZ, 1 GB RAM with 160 GB of Hard Disk 96 MB of VGA! - Windows XP Service Pack 2

Thanks
