Steps to reproduce:

I connect to my Windows 8.1 PC (Intel NUC) over Windows Remote Desktop.  When I run Firefox in full screen mode (File > View > Full Screen or press F11), and then minimize and restore the RDP window, the Firefox tab bar is always filled with graphics glitches (http://imgur.com/a/SBCm3).

Additional info:
Restarting in Firefox safe mode which has add-on disabled still exhibits the issue.
Hide Toolbars disabled or enabled did not matter.
Changing the Firefox option to use hardware acceleration or not does not matter.
Firefox has been updated over the year and no change in behavior.
Firefox as a maximized window (where Windows taskbar is visible) does not exhibit the rendering issue.

The issue doesn't happen with IE or chrome.
I was also able to reproduce it with Teamviewer but only if I used a monitor, minimized FireFox, connected to Teamviewer, turned off the monitor, restored the FireFox from the teamviewer, disconnected teamviewer, turned back on the monitor, and restored firefox from the PC.
All Windows 8.1 updates installed and various versions of Intel graphics drivers.
Uninstalling Intel drivers and using MS ones, also exibits the artifacts.


Actual results:

The top of the fullscreen Firefox window/tab bar is always filled with graphics glitches (http://imgur.com/a/SBCm3) when the Windows RDP window is restored from minimized state.

Moving the mouse cursor over the tabs and buttons would cause it to render properly.  Minimizing and restoring firefox in the RDP session would also fix it.  Minimizing and restoring the RDP session would again fuzz up the tab bar.


Expected results:

The top part of the FireFox window should be redrawn correctly when minimizing and restoring the Windows RDP window.
