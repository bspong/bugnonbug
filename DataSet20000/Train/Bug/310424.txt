Cherry keyboard manager does NOT recognize Firefox  1.5 beta
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050908 Firefox/1.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050908 Firefox/1.4

When I press the Internet Browser dedicated button on the Cherry solar keyboard
Firefox 1.5 beta starts correctly but after 30-40 seconds a Warning Message Box
from the KeyMan software (the driver that makes the Cherry keyboard work) issues
the following message: "It was not possible to launch the Internet Browser (err.
ref. 106).
The most important thing is that working with Firefox 1.06 (either italian or
english) DID NOT give any Message Box error when I pressed the Internet button
on the same Cherry keyboard.
My understanding of the BUG is that Firefox 1.5 beta does not send back to the
KeyMan (Cherry keyboard manager) any acknowledgement about it having been
launched. Conversely Firefox 1.06 did it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch the predefined Internet browser by pressing the dedicated button on
the Cherry solar keyboard
2. See Firefox 1.5beta being correctly launched.
3. Wait for 30-40 seconds and an annoying Warning message in a Message Box will
popup, from KeyMan (the Cherry Keyboard Manager) saying that it was not possible
to launch the Internet Broweser (although this is not the truth).

Actual Results:  
I had to press the OK button of the Message Box to remove the annoying warning
message.

Expected Results:  
Not be responsible to make KeyMan (Cherry keyboard manager) issue the annoying
warning Message box probably due to the change of identity (internal program
name?) of Firefox 1.5 beta respect to Firefox 1.0.6 and previous releases.
