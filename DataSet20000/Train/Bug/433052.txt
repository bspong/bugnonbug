When going through RSS feeds using Google Reader, there's a way to read items such that an item's page is initially displayed at one size, and then the browser makes them smaller.  It doesn't happen with items from all sites, but it doesn't happen with items from Digg and from the NVD.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Subscribe to Digg using Google Reader
2.Bring up Google Reader
3.Select Digg feed
4.Select item in feed, right click on title and then select "Open Link in New Tab".
5. Let page load
6. Click on page's tab
7. Notice text displayed at one size
8. Notice that text is resized (made smaller)
Actual Results:  
Text resized

Expected Results:  
Text displayed at "correct" size initially

If in #4 of the steps, you just click on the title it will bring the page up and the text size will be "correct" (i.e. the smaller size) from the beginning.  It's only when the page is opened using the "new tab" that there's a problem.
