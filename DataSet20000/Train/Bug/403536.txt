In the history sidebar, view By Date And Site organizes under the day and then the site in a tree.  view By Date organizes under the day in a tree, but view By Site does not

By Date And Site:

Today
--www.yahoo.com
----URL1
----URL2
--www.google.com
----URL1
----URL2
Yesterday
...

By Date
Today
--www.yahoo.com/...
--www.google.com/...
Yesterday
--www.povray.org/...
--...

By Site DOES NOT do this, which I think it should:
www.google.com
--URL1
--URL2
www.povray.org
--URL1
--URL2

Instead it does this, without creating an organization the way that the sites are organized under the day in view by Date and Site.
www.google.com/...
www.google.com/...
www.povray.org/...
www.povray.org/...
