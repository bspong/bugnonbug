Localized versions of Firefox should contain their specific spellchecker instead of (or in addition of) the en-US one
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; it; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404 Firefox/2.0.0.14
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; it; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404 Firefox/2.0.0.14

Many not experienced user people find difficult to add their own spellchecker to their localized copy of Firefox. 
A good idea for the future could be to release the localized versions of Firefox containing their specific spellchecker instead of (or in addition of) the en-US one. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Write something in your own language (not in English) in a text field
2. Try to correct your typo with the Firefox built-in spellchecker

Actual Results:  
a. You wont be able to correct them because the default spellchecker is for en-US only
b. You must go on the appropriated dictionary page on AMO and install the needed spellchecker

Expected Results:  
1. Write something in your own language (not in English) in a text field
2. Try to correct your typo with the Firefox built-in spellchecker
3. Get your typo corrected thanks to your own language spellchecker already present in Firefox
