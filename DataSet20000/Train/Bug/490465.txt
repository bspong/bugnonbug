Opening a link in another tab outlines the link.  But after reading the new page and returning (by closing its tab) to the page containing the original link, the link focus outline has now disappeared.  This is new in 3.5b4 (3.1b3 preserved the outline).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit e.g. the above URL
2. Middle click a link to open it in a new tab.  Focus stays in original page as I've configured it to do.  The clicked link now shows a focus outline.
3. Click the new tab to view the new page, including scrolling down the page (scrolling may be involved but I couldn't confirm it).
4. Middle-click the tab to close it, revealing the original tab.
Actual Results:  
The focus outline has disappeared from the clicked link.

Expected Results:  
Preserve the focus outline, as in prior versions (3.1b3 preserved it).


Reason: The outline makes it easier to visually find one's place and resume reading on the original page.
