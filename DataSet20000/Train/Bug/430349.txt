Smart Bookmarks cascading menu prevents neighbouring cascading menus to open correctly

In Minefield (Firefox 3pre), I have in my bookmark toolbar the pre-installed "Smart Bookmark" and several other cascading menus (bookmark folders). But, for the second one, directly next to "Smart bookmarks", I regularly have trouble to open it in the bookmark toolbar: as soon as I cascade/drag over with the mouse, the "Smart bookmark" takes over it!
Not a serious bug, but just very annoying on every day basis. 
Thanks in advance if someone can correct this in Firefox 3 final. 
Firefox rocks :)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.put a "new bookmark folder" (with bookmarks in!) in the Bookmark toolbar, directly right to the "Smart Bookmark" folder (i.e. with "Smart Bookmark" at the very left, the new bookmark folder will be on position 2 from the left)
2.click and cascade the Smart Bookmark folder
3.then click and cascade the new bookmark folder (in position 2)
Actual Results:  
If you try to cascade the new bookmark folder (position 2), the "Smart bookmark" takes over it and prevents to access the content of the new bookmark folder (position 2)

Expected Results:  
Allow us to select the bookmark in the "new bookmark folder" instead of showing up the content of "Smart bookmark"
