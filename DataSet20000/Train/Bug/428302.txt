When you visit a page with safety certificate, comes in the address bar of another colour url ...

If you are in a tab on a page with safety certificate, as http://mail.google.com and raisins to another tab in which you are on a page without safety certificate, as http://google.com for about hundredths of a second, still leaving the same color, which can lead to mistakes or deception.
This happens in all themes

2- In another tab, opens a page is not safe, as google.com

Expected Results:  
It is a failure of this original version of Firefox
