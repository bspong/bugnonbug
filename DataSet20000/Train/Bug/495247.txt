(on fedora 10) After hibernate/resume (software suspend) audio doesn't work unless I kill firefox and restart
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042708 Fedora/3.0.10-1.fc10 Firefox/3.0.10
Build Identifier: Firefox 3.5 Beta 4 (firefox-3.5b4.tar.bz2 downloaded early May 2009. Still current I think.)

Problem occurs while using this version of Fedora10 2.6.27.21-170.2.56_1.cubbi_tuxonice.fc10.i686 (tuxonice instead of normal suspend). Everything works fine with Firefox en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042708 Fedora/3.0.10-1.fc10.
But with Firefox 3.5b4 if I try to run a video with sound, or an audio recording, the sound does not work properly. For a while it is silent, then I get what sounds like a repeated syllable, a bit like a cracked gramophone record. If I kill firefox and restart it, everything is fine, till after the next hibernate/resume. I gave up using FF3.5 for this reason.
(In case it is relevant, I have removed pulseaudio. It has never worked for me.
I am not the only one!)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.hibernate linux while firefox 3.5 is running
2.reboot-resume.
3.try playing something with sounds, e.g. BBC news videos.
Actual Results:  
Sound doesnt work. It's hard to describe the symptom, but most of the soundtrack is lost and it is as if some tiny part of it is just being repeated. First time it happened I thought the video file was corrupted.

Expected Results:  
Sound should work, as it does in FF 3.0.10

When videos can't play in firefox I have no problem using mplayer or vlc to play things that I have on my hard drive. It affects only firefox. Sounds as if some recently added part of FF providing integrated resources for audio needs to be made hibernate-resume aware.
