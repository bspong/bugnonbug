Firefox sometimes crashes when bug in "Find" bar occurs.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101206 Ubuntu/10.10 (maverick) Firefox/3.6.13
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101206 Ubuntu/10.10 (maverick) Firefox/3.6.13

Every now and then (when entering only a part of a word, sometimes even when full text is copied directly from the page.) the "Find" bar tells me, that a word or phrase was not found.
In the demonstrating page, the term "gmip" (INCLUDING quote signs) can only be found when the text contains at least the last quote sign (gmip").
When this happens, Firefox sometimes will crash when the "previous" or "next" button is clicked.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Navigate to a normal website (I have not found out yet HOW to find websites that induce his bug)
2.Open the "Find" bar
3.Type in some text that exists on the page and when it claims "Phrase not found"...
4. ...click the "Previous" or the "Next" button
Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes to desktop

Expected Results:  
Highlight the typed text on the page.
