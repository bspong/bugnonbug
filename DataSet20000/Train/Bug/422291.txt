The "Recent Tags" Smart bookmark "place:folder=4&group=3&sort=12&applyOptionsToContainers=1&maxResults=10&queryType=1" no longer returns URLs in the form of a tag folder, nor does the (Manually created) tag sorting folder "place:folder=4&group=3&sort=1&applyOptionsToContainers=1&maxResults=100&queryType=1"

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Simply click on the smart Bookmarks folder on the bookmarks toolbar and highlight Recent Tags; 
Actual Results:  
This now returns a single website for each results, with no obvious information showing any correspondence between the tag folders originally returned, and the single website returned now.

Expected Results:  
in Beta Three, this returned (and the manually created folder) folders for each of the tags that contained links to the websites that met the criteria.

This may be an intentional/expected change, but I'm not seeing it documented as such - the new returned values are much less useful than the tag folders format IMO.
