Firefox newest version (22-02-2006), dutch plugin, just installed xp prof, sp2.
Ths bug was same before i reinstalled the xp.
When i'll open the bookmark manager, all folders looks like they are sorted.
When i want to add a line between the folder alphabet (A / B / C/) the manager will  sort all lines togetther afther eachother.
They are stored between "H" sorted folders, somewhere in the middle.
When i'll dradg and drop a ine to a position i want it to be, it will not stay there, but move to the place where all the lines are stored next to eachother.
When i want to move a folder, in order to get it in line with the alphabet, the manager will messup more.
Whe i'll add a folder name and store a link inside, the manager will store the folder all at the bottom of the list, and will not sort it by alphabet.
I't allmost impossible to move the new created folder at this time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I have to opent bookmarks.html with a text editor to try to move my folders.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
It's allmost impossible to edit the bookmarks file in another editor.
There's no satisfied result.

Expected Results:  
The list in the manager has to look same as listed when i'll click the bookmarks (favorites) button.
It should be possible to drag and drop the folders easy and add / remove lines where i want them to.
Not just move to another unwanted place, and not messup.
