Mootools 1.3 on page throws JS error, audio and video tags never completely load.

The error message on page load in Firebug is "Permission denied to access property 'valueOf'" - valueOf is neither used in Mootools 1.3 nor in the code of the page. This error prevents both an audio and video tag in the page from loading completely (spinner animation never ends; anchor tag to media elements: http://www.storiesinflight.com/html5/#audio - this is a long page).

I've tried an older version of MooTools (1.2.x) with the same result. I've also tried to create a smaller version of the page to limit the complexity, but it's pretty straightforward: With MooTools I get this error, without not. Now I do have another page on this server with MooTools 1.2 and audio tags and no error message here: http://www.storiesinflight.com/jsfft/visualizer/index.html

The error is very baffling since I can not find an instance of "valueOf" anywhere at all...

Also, this page works perfectly fine in the latest Firefox 3.x - this is a 4.0beta9 issue only.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load page http://www.storiesinflight.com/html5
2. Check error console ("Permission denied to access property 'valueOf'")
3. Check here http://www.storiesinflight.com/html5/#audio if audio loading spinner is still spinning
Actual Results:  
JS Error in Firebug: "Permission denied to access property 'valueOf'"

Expected Results:  
No error message. Eternal bliss.

Firefox is plain vanilla with Firebug installed
