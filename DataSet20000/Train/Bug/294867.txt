memory leak flooding mem and causing hang (not responding) since 1.0.4
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de-DE; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de-DE; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

this happens nearly every time i open sites with some more media (like a gallery
of panorama-images. but i even got it after opening some random pages as tabs
from a google search.
a plugin automatically restores the tabs, so after restarting firefox i have to
manually stop loading or close them to prevent it from crashing again.
this happened not one time with 1.0.3 for weeks of extensive usage.

it always starts with slowing my whole system. firefox then starts to eat up 99%
cpu and memory usage becomes bigger and bigger. now it can't redraw hs window
anymore. (normally i kill it before it gets an mem overflow error).

additionally i can trigger it by opening Extras->Extensions. (wich never opens.
even if i try it 2 or 3 times)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to a site with many embedded (img/plugins) stuff OR open Extras->Extensions
2. open your task manager and watch mem-/cpu-usage for 30-60 sec
3. try to force window-redrawing of firefox

Actual Results:  
Firefox window not responding.
CPU @ 99% for firefox.
MEM @ ~200MB for firefox.

Expected Results:  
Load and display the page OR Show extensions window

I can't get a list of my plugins, but i think this could possibly matter...
(don't know how to get the list elsewhere.)
