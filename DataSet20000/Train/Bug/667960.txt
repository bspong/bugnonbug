By using drag'n'drop file upload the memory usage increased up to 2.7 GB - page refreshing and tab closing didn't help.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build ID: 20110615151330

Steps to reproduce:

I wrote a js library to provide easy-to-use drag'n'drop file uploads (cross browser).

This library will show thumbnails of the images to upload. It creates an objectURL (if available) or it reads the image as a DataURL. It shows this thumbnail and puts the files to an array to upload.
Next it will upload the images (using FormData) but maximum two at the same time.


Actual results:

The memory usage increased imediately and it was not going to decrease again.
If I close the tab where I put the files, the memory usage decreases only ~1kb (I think firefox frees the document and the variables in JS/DOM). The files stay in ram. Even if I don't preview the files (only upload via FormData), the ram increases and stays up.


Expected results:

The files should be uploaded and then the files should be free (the preview images in my example are only displayed until the file upload has finished). The latest point to remove the files from the memory - I think - is by closing the tab or leaving the page.

Better alternative: the files shouldn't be read into ram until the code says: "read it" - or only up to a maximum size (what if i want to drop a 1 Gb file?). At least if the code does only upload the file (for example like this:)
- for each (dropped) file:
  - check the mime type
  - push it to a FormData-object
- send the FormData via xhr

I'm sorry for my english - I hope you'll understand.
