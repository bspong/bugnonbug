Does not release SVG memory upon ajax refresh, nor after tab is closed
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

If you click on the link given, and keep clicking on an arrow to bring up a new chart in the page (getting a new SVG file via Ajax), and you monitor your memory, you will see that the memory increased 10MB per request (versus around 100K for IE).  Once you close the tab, you can see that FF does not release the memory until a new tab is opened, or until a new site is visited from within that tab (IE releases the memory properly).

FF seems to have a memory leak when it comes to SVG, and it has trouble reclaiming this memory once a tab is closed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://raphaeljs.com/chart.html
2. Click on an arrow
3. Monitor the memory usage
4. Close the tab
5. Note that the memory is not released
Actual Results:  
See 'Steps to Reproduce'

Expected Results:  
The memory usage within FF should mildly fluctuate.  A 10MB increase for every page load is bad, and FF should also release this memory once a tab has been closed.

FF should have released the loaded SVG file/insertion/request.
