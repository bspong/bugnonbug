<select> form elements open upwards instead of downwards depending on monitor arrangement

On a two-display macintosh system, if the secondary display is placed
(arranged, via System Preferences/Displays/Arrangment) so that the lower
edge of the secondary display is below the lower edge of the primary
display, <select> elements of an html form produce "dropdown" boxes which
extend upwards.

This will frequently result in the option box covering undesirable portions
of the interface, including portions of the surrounding window frame, or
extending off the top of the screen.

If the bottom of the secondary display is located even with the bottom
primary display, or above the bottom of the primary display, the behavior
does not occur.

The behavior is not reproducable with any other Macintosh application I
tried (finder, ical, microsoft office programs, etc).



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get mac with two monitors (I used MacBook Pro).
2. Place secondary display below primary display (I used internal display as secondary, to the left, and diagonally down from the main display).
3. Open any value/option form.
Actual Results:  
Dropdown goes upwards.

Expected Results:  
Dropdown goes downwards.

This is pretty nuts!
