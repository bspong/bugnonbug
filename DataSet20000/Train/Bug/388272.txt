the results of a search in mapquest shows driving directions, but scrolling down reveals no map image only the blue line showing point to point of requested directions.

Using mapquest.com to produce directions between two points resulted in the text for the directions. On scrolling down, there was no map IMAGE only the red line between the two points like a snake. The scroll bar for zooming in and out showed text of the word "scroll" multiple times superimposed on itself but no bar. In the directions, clicking on the word "map" to the right of the text produced a white empty box with a little icon image. 
Google maps work, and Mapquest works fine in Sarari, just not on my Firefox version 2.0.0.4.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.http://www.mapquest.com for starting and ending directions
2.Case Western University, Cleveland, OH to University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI
3.
Actual Results:  
It took a long time to process, i.e. longer than usual using other browsers.
Resulted in text and a large white box where the map image should have been. Clicking on the "map" to the right of any portion of the text steps resulted in the same white box. Zoom bar for scrolling in and out produced multiple text representations superimposed on each other but not image of a zoom bar.

Expected Results:  
Mapquest should produce images of maps!
