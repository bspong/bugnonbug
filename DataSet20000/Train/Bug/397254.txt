Adblock upgrade wiped out all other add-ons and add-ons can not be reinstalled to work

The automatic search for upgrades showed an Adblock upgrade to which I hit the install button.  None of my other add-ons work anymore.  I have lost all of my favorite websites, and tons of other features.  My browser has become totally dysfunctional to me in my reliance on how I had it set up to find the things I use.

I tried to look for how to uninstall the latest upgrade and it does not show up on the list of extensions at all.  I tried uninstalling some of my upgrades/add-ons and reinstalling them and it does not work.  I re-installed firefox and tried again.  It does not work.

At the very least, you should immediately disable and block the adblock add-on for upgrades and for people to use until this problem is sorted out.  For me I had things I needed and wanted to do and I had information saved with other features that I use with firefox and they are gone.
