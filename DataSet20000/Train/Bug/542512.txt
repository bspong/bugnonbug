After an install of an add-on, windows opened with JavaScript, cannot be closed with JavaScript.

As you may know the srandard window.close(); does not work in firefox, see issue 190515.  

However, window.close() is supposed to work for windows opened by Javascript.   If you open a window by Javascript, then the user restarts firefox for an add-on install, firefox no long treats the window, as one opened by Javascript.  I mean after the restart, the window.close() function no longer works ,even if the window was opened originally with javascript.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. window.showModalDialog()
2. install add-on  (with restart)
3. click button with window.close() 
Actual Results:  
The window will not close.

Expected Results:  
The window should close, because the window was opened with JavaScript.

It seems like when Firefox restarts it remembers what page you were at and session cookies, but it does not keep track of which windows were opened with JavaScript.
