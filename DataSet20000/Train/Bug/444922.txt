Application Details empty after fixing empty Applications panel (after bug #409192)

After installing Firefox 3.0 (via masked Gentoo official ebuild) without Gnome libs, bug #409192 arose: an empty Applications panel.  I recompiled with the patch fixing #409192 to repopulate the applications list, and this was successful.  However, when "Application Details" is selected from a content type's dropdown, the list is empty.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install 3.0 in a Linux environment without Gnome, producing bug #409192, empty Applications panel.
2. Recompile with patch to fix bug #409192.
3. Select Application Details from an Action dropdown in the Applications prefpane. (Web Feed is a good example since it comes with 3 actions pre-installed: Bloglines, My Yahoo, and Google.  These should be listed.)
Actual Results:  
Application Details list is empty.

Expected Results:  
Applications Details list displays some number of associated applications and an option to remove each.

Firefox produces no error messages or warnings to the console.  Profile is irrelevant. I don't funroll-loops, promise.
