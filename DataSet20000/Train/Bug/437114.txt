For every site I've tried, using FF > Tools > Page Info > Forms > Current value > rClk > sel all > copy. No problem indication, except that none of the text gets to the clipboard.

. Notepad > Edit > Paste does nothing !?

. Word > Edit > Paste does nothing !?

. This works almost* as expected only for ' Page Info - Form Action' field, and is ignored/prevented for all other Page Info fields: 'Name' 'Method', and 'Current Value' fields.

* Selects only entire line of 3 fields, but copies only ‘Action’.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.browse to any web form fill-in.
2.FF > Tools > Page Info > Forms > Current value > rClk > sel all > copy
3.open local text or word processor file
4. Ctrl+V or Edit > Paste
5. be frustrated at the blank paste area.
Actual Results:  
as described in details above.

Expected Results:  
as described in details above.

This problem might reflect a larger issue of function control with Page Info.
