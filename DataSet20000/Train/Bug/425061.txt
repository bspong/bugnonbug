Almost impossible to see that iframe form is sent in a secure way

When paying on the web shop http://www.cd-wow.com, the paying is handled in a separate iframe where the user has to enter its credit card details.

The parent frame is sent over http, so no sign is shown whether the form is sent in a secure way. I was suprised that when getting the page info of the iframe, there was not even a security tab. The only thing I could see was that the address started with https in the iframes Page Info.

I would expect a clear visual indication that the iframe is secured.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Put some things in the cart at http://www.cd-wow.com
2. At the check-out, log in or fill in some information in step 2, and then choose to pay by VISA credit card
3. Get a form in an iframe where you have to fill in the credit card details
Actual Results:  
No visible indication in Firefox that the form is actually secure

Expected Results:  
Some visible indication, such as a padlock somewhere, a coloured border indicating the secure iframe, or something like that...
