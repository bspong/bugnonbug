Firefox hangs after indeterminate period of time since latest OS X updates

Since I updated my Mac with the latest updates from Tuesday, and Wednesday this week (Mar. 19, 20), Firefox becomes unresponsive after a period of time.  This does not seem to be linked to any particular URL, or to any particular action.  Since I noticed it today, it may be related to the last update Time Machine and AirPort Updates.  I did notice on one of my Macs (MacBook Pro) that installing this update changed the setting for Configure Settings to Access the Internet.  I had to put it back to Auto-Detect.  But, this did not happen on two other Macs.  The hanging has occurred on two of the Macs, and I have to use Force Quit to quit Firefox.  Sometimes it does not happen for an hour, and other times it happens every few minutes.  Clearly, something in the updates is conflicting with something in Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Let Firefox sit with multiple Tabs open.  Perhaps sites with auto-refresh may provoke.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Firefox hangs.  Need to use Force Quit to stop.  

Expected Results:  
Should not hang.
