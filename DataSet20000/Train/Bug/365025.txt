After security update 2.0.0.1 installs Firefox cannot connect to any site
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1

After security update 2.0.0.1 installs Firefox can no longer connect to anything.  Not the internet, no localhost servers, no FTP, and it takes a millisecond to finish trying.  It doesn't hang, it just responds Unable to connect.  This happens in Saft Mode as well.  All other browsers (IE, Opera), including Firefox 2.0 without the security update work as expected. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 2.0 (downloaded from Mozilla.com)
2. Wait for automatic security update 2.0.0.1 to install automatically
3. Restart Firefox
Actual Results:  
Firefox starts but no page is ever loaded. No extension connects (Gmail notifier, Forecastfox).  Nothing works (connects) even in safe mode. 

Expected Results:  
I should get to the internet, etc.

I have the standard install, and there's no report from the Feedback agent, since the browser never crashes.  I don't know how to trace this any better. I'm running Windows XP SP2. I've got the problem at work (military installation) and at home (broadband connection).  All other browsers are functioning.  I'm not running a software firewall at work, but I have ZoneAlarm at home.  Antivirus is Symantec. Firefox (normal and safe mode) shows memory usage is slowly but steadily growing even though I'm not interacting with the program, and some CPU cycles are being used by Firefox.  (I'm writing this in IE - sorry).  As I said, 2.0 before the security fix works fine.  I've repeated this 3 times now. I'm not sure how to get more information - but I would respond to any request (CS major).
