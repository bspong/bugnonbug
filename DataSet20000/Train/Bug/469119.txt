Firefox tries to continue loading pages

Shiretoko continues to load some pages indefinitely even though all content is present on the page.  This problem began with Shiretoko.  It was not present with Minefield or any previous versions of Firefox.  In addition to the URL included with this report, I have included a list below of addresses that have displayed this problem for more ten minutes this morning(the last one is quite interesting).  This does not occur with all pages (iGoogle and Lifehacker.com work fine).  Viewing the page or reloading it does not help.  Halting the load and reloading it does nothing.  When you halt the load, it continues to try and load.  I am unable to bookmark a page while it is in this process but it otherwise acts as if the load is complete.  The word "Done" appears in the status field at the bottom of the window.

If I copy the URL into a new tab and load it the page loads normally, but it does not display the normal icon in the tab(this seems to be a problem for any URL typed into the address field, including mozilla.org).  If I then halt/reload the original tab there is no change.  it continues to run.  If I go to a link in a page and then return there is no change.  The page linked to can behave either way.  Bookmarked pages also display all of these porperties.

When I go to my.yahoo.com the system continues to load until I click to add content.  It then completes and stays that way after I return to the normal page.  When I go to another tab the behavior returns and remains even when I return to the tab that had been rendered.  

The address at tomshardware.com and my.yahoo.com will gray out the button to halt loading (like a fully rendered page) when I try to reload it, but it stills continues to load.  When I go to another tab and return the button is enabled again.



An update was run on Shiretoko as well as all of the extensions.
