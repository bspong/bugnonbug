        Summary: When printing a webpage, the printed page is squeezed in the
center of wide white (blank) margins.  Then I noticed the portrait/landscape
option was ON landscape.  When I changed it to Portrait the problem persisted. 
The result is an effective font size of 6, at least!

            Steps to Reproduce: Got the download about a month ago; took the
standard defaults; only noticed problem recently. Only a problem with FireFox.
