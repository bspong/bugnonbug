With two browser windows open, Quit only closes one window immediately, and the other after a delay

It seems like some code somewhere is assuming there is only one browser window to close.  The other closes eventually but the delay is significant and the contents of the window are frozen as it sits there for this extra time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open two browser windows
2. Select File->Quit in menu
Actual Results:  
One browser window quickly disappears, but the other closes after a significant delay (multiple seconds).

Expected Results:  
Both should disappear quickly and at the same time.

I have a reasonably fast system (Core Duo, 2GB ram, 7200rpm drive).  I do use the browser a lot, with lots of tabs etc (about 3-10 tabs per window on average).

I've started hunting around the Firefox code (I never have before) and I'm sure I could fix this if I could just track down where it's happening.  Of course the Mozilla codebase isn't something you can jump into quickly... if anyone could just give pointers to where I might want to look, it could help.
