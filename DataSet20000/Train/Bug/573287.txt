cannot start firefox after installing 3 add-ons, (in any order), killing firefox (pkill firefox).

This is the wierdest bug I have ever seen in firefox.
I installed adblockplus. and restarted firefox.
So far so good - no problems.
I killed it (deliberately) via pkill firefox.
I started firerfox again (from desktop icon),
and I was able to restore previous session.
----------
I installed a second add-on (tubestop), and restarted firefox for the add-on to take effect.
Again, do far so good.
I killed firefox (pkill firefox).
I started firefox (from desktop icon),
and it started and I was able to restore previous session.
-----------------
I installed a third add-on (video downloadhelper), and restarted forefox for the add-on to take effect.
I pkill'ed firefox.
I tried to re-start firefox (from desktop icon),
and now it will not restart at all.

So, I did the following:
I wanted to see if this is caused by the fact that it is a fedora rpm package from which it got installed, or is it generic in the browser.
I downloaded the 32 bit binary from the mozilla site and installed
it into a different directory, and I created a special launcher for it on the dektop.

I was able to start it up and restore my previous session. No problem.

So I pkilled it again, and tried to start it (the mozilla.org version).
No go!! It will not start.

No the wierdest part:

I started firefox from the original icon (which starts /usr/bin/firefox).
It starts up and I am able to restart my previous session.

However, I cannot restart it after a pkill.
I have to ping-pong between the rpm installed version and the mozila.org dowloaded version in order to restore my session, after each pkill.

Often, I reboot the system after updates. I expect that firefox should
always start up and restore my sessions.

One more note, I tried to install the 3 add-on in different order.
Once I get to 3 add-ons, the problem re-appears.


Reproducible: Always
