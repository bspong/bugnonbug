I am currently using Zencart latest HTML Editor to edit websites. ONLY The Editor main form boxes cannot be Ctrl+Copy and Ctrl+v Paste. If i used my mouse to Copy and paste, it will highlight the whole sentence instead. I know u provide a website fix for it, but i cant fucking understand and refuses to self fix a broken application.

For your Information, there is no problems with Copy and Paste of Scripts if i used IE, Chrome or Thunderbird ! I love firefox, so don't let me down.


"Unprivileged scripts cannot access Cut/Copy/Paste programatically for security reasons.  Click OK to see a technical note at mozilla.org which shows you how to allow a script to access the clipboard"

Reproducible: Always
