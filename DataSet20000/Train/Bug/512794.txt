scroll wheel works in all applications as normal.
scroll wheel in firefox only works on all displays except those to the 'left' of display '1' as shown in the windows 'Display Properties' Settings tab.

On a four head system (two video cards with two video ports each: dvi and vga):
display order set to 1:3:2:4 allows firefox to work on all display heads.
display order set to 3:2:1:4 only allows firefox to scrollwheel on displays 1:4
display order set to 3:1:2:4 only allows firefox to scrollwheel on displays 1:2:4

again, all other applications (notepad,rxvt,aura browser,etc) use the wheel fine.

workaround: mark the left-most display as the 'primary monitor'
(for windows xp, check the box labeled 'Use this device as the primary monitor'



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. get a multi-head system, two displays at least
2. move display '1' to the far right and select [apply]
3. test scrolling with any large web page (the above URL should suffice)
4. alternately, increase width of web page across all heads
5. attempt scrollwheel action while mouse is on each display
Actual Results:  
scrollwheel action only works on primary display and those displays to the right.

Expected Results:  
scrollwheel action should work on all displays

workaround: mark the left-most display as the 'primary monitor'
(for windows xp, check the box labeled 'Use this device as the primary monitor'
