Javascript does not work for part of  Vdeck website user admin program
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

My webhost uses Vdeck for admin of the site.
Under Database setup, each database has a button (Javascripted)
that deletes a mysql database.  
When clicked in IE5 it works correctly (there is first an 
"are you sure?" popup, you click yes, and then the database
is removed.  

In Foxfire, the "are you sure?" popup comes up, but
clicking yes on the popup has no effect.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Find someone whose website host uses VDECK for user administration
2.  Under database, create a mysql database
3.  Under database, click the X button left of the name of the database just
created, and click it.  Then click YES in the popup. 

Actual Results:  
the database was not deleted

Expected Results:  
the database should have been deleted

My website is hosted by ipowerweb.com. They are pretty big and maybe will
give you a temporary account that uses vdeck so you can try this out yourself.

Since this is just one particular javascript, it is symptomatic of other
javascript-related problems.
