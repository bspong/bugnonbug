It is possible on windows to make a webmail the default email client for handling all mailto links. Eg On Gmail by installing 'gattach' or by installing Gmail notifier. For Yahoo mail you can install 'Yattach' or install Yahoo messenger.

But sometimes the mailto subject line isn't completely passed onto the webmail page. It works correctly on all other browsers tried but not firefox

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have your mailto: set up to use webmail (eg install 'gattach' program

2. Click the following link: mailto:abuse@example.com?subject=Reporting%20post%20http://forums.example.com/showpost.html?p=3477039

Actual Results:  
Subject line on Compose email screen shows:
"Reporting post http://forums.example.com/showpost.html?p"
(Note that the number after the ?p is missing)

Expected Results:  
Subject line on Compose email screen shows:
"Reporting post http://forums.example.com/showpost.html?p=3477039"

Firefox has always behaved this way since I have used it (Many years and on different computers) So it is not a configuration issue.
