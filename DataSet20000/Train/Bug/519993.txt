Repeatedly advised of version upgrade availability in one FF profile after multiple installs which are indicated to be compleet and successful.  DOES NOT occur in second/different profile-still need to check two profiles but since having same problem multiple times for certain profile, decided to report/inquire.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Repeated download of Firefox 3.5.3(4X)and repeated installations(4X)for same profile
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Still directed to upgrade installed Firefox version (which was 3.5.3 already).
Have not had time to check all profiles for reproducibility but has repeated 4X in one profile and does not occur in a second/different profile

Expected Results:  
Uncertain-believed (same)newer version (3.5.3) would not be indicated as available.
