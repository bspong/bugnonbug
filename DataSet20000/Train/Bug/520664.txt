When accessing web pages with :0 as port, firefox gives a page not found exception, instead of using the default port, which would be prefered since 0 is not a valid port anyway.

The reason I'd like this fixed is cause the built in function in Microsoft ISA server for http-redirection appends a :0 at the end of urls
http://example.com/ becomes https://example.com:0/ and so on.

Now one would suspect this being a ISA issue and not a firefox one, however, getting MS to fix something is like asking a wall to speak. and the behaviour seen is only present in FF, not IE or Opera, they simply remove the :0 from the url and goes with the default port.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter a url with the port :0 and witness failure
Actual Results:  
Page not found

Expected Results:  
The page displayed with the default port instead of a page not found, since 0 is not a valid port anyway.
