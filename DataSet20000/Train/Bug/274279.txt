I have a powerbook and using the shortcut keys for this is quite inconvenient.  

I switch tabs and go to top all the time in Safari.  Switch tabs can be done
with Cmd(apple)+Right(or left of course).  This quite easy and comfortable with
one hand.  Ctrl+tab and Ctrl+shift+tab are not as easy.  You should make both
usable.  

Also, and this is the more difficult one, those the shortcut for end/beginning
of page is end/home this is not good for powerbook users, particularly those who
are used to Safari.  Safari uses Cmd+down(or up), which is one handed and easy.
 Your shortcut is not able to be done with one hand.  Furthermore, I never use
home/end/pgup/pgdown so i dont use the fn key much.  Please add this functionality.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a few pages in tabs
