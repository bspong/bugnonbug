Hello. The site in question uses both Java and Javascript. It should produce a live scrolling waterfall showing active signals on each band and allow selecting frequencies to listen to. It works fine using Firefox on Windows Vista and Linux Ubuntu and SUSE, it also works fine using Safari on OSX. But Firefox does not display the graphics or the sound at all on OSX. There are zillions of entries in the Tools -> Error Console, many, but not all, related to a Javascript function called soundapplet.isActive, but they scroll by so fast it's hard to read the others. I am running Firefox 3.6.10 on OS X 10.5.8. Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to any of the sites listed at http://www.websdr.org
2. scroll down to the black bars showing frequencies
3. you should see a waterfall above each bar and be able to select frequencies to hear.
Actual Results:  
All I see are the black bars, no waterfall and no way to select the sound to hear. Or to see it in action properly, just go to any of the pages using Vista or Linux and it will work fine, it just doesn't work on OS X. Note it also works fine using Safari on OS X.

Expected Results:  
you should see a waterfall above each bar and be able to select frequencies to hear.
