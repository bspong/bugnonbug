When adding a bookmark, firefox opens the link in the background
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

If you right click a link and go Bookmark this Link, fill in all the information and hit ok, FireFox like secretly opens the bookmark (but not in any visible way).
This can be somewhat problematic for people who play browser games and maybe don't want to go to that page right then.
There may be compelling arguments why this is a good idea, but I can't think of any.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Bookmark a link that if it is opened, you'll be able to check (perhaps changing some kind of setting in an online program)


Actual Results:  
The link will be non-visibly opened once

Expected Results:  
Just made a bookmark and never gone to it

I wish I had a really good way for most people to test this, but its really something that seems specific to browser based games.
Like if i set a bookmark to eat a steak in this game, when i move to another page, i notice that my hunger has gone down and i'm down one steak
