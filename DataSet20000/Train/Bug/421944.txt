When multiple pages are open, repositioning one page causes it to jump to bottom of screen. If I drag a page back up to the top of the screen, Firefox jumps it back down to the bottom of the screen. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. have multiple pages open... no specific number, just more than 1
2. pick one of the pages and reposition it on the screen

Actual Results:  
9 times out of ten, firefox will jump it to the bottom of the screen
drag the page at the bottom of the screen back to the top
firefox will punt it to bottom of screen again


Expected Results:  
can usually reposition page an inch from top of screen without problems but repositioning it flush with top of screen causes the page to jump to the bottom

No special themes were running; happens on most any website where I have more than 1 page open. Has been going on for over a year now... thru several builds of Firefox. Happens on my G5 as well as my MacBook Pro. Happens with Mac OX Tiger; have not tested it with Leopard, nor have I tested it on a PC.
