Location Bar Autocompletion too slow (blocks keyboard input)

When I enter text into the location bar, Firefox starts searching the browsing history and bookmarks so it can autocomplete the text I entered and offer suggestions in a list underneath the location bar. 

The problem is:
While firefox is searching, the location bar's textfield becomes irresponsive: I can keep on typing, but no letters appear until Firefox has finished it's search and displays suggestions in a list underneath the location bar.

A possible solution would be:
Don't block the textfield's thread while searching for autocompletions and list entries.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. have a lot of bookmarks in your bookmarks library (mine are without tags but kept in many folders) and a long browsing history
2. start firefox on mac osx
3. right after the firefox window has appeared, klick into the location bar and enter some text (any text will do, for example start typing 'dogs school')
Actual Results:  
having typed a few letters, firefox will have begun it's autocompletion search. any further letters you type won't appear in the location bar's textbox until firefox has completed it's search and displays the list underneath the location bar.

Expected Results:  
firefox should not block the textfield's user interface while searching for autocompletions.
