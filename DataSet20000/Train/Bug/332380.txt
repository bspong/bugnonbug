Cannot switch SCIM input methods normally under twm
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060313 Debian/1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.1-4 Firefox/1.5.0.1

When the twm window manager is used and scim is used for input methods, it is not possible to switch scim input methods normally (i.e., by clicking on the scim mini-window); input methods must be changed using the keyboard commands (i.e., ctrl+shift for next method or shift+ctrl for previous method).

If the user tries to position the mouse cursor over the scim mini-window, the mini-window will flash incessantly and it is impossible to click on it or do any other useful things.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use twm as the window manager (i.e., no Gnome, no KDE, no xfce, etc.)
2. Run scim
3. GTK_IM_MODULES=scim firefox
4. Press ctrl+space to open the scim mini-window and try to switch input methods. You can't.

Actual Results:  
SCIM's mini-window flashes (disappears and reappears) continuously and it is impossible to do anything useful.

If the user repositions the cursor outside the mini-window or types ctrl+space to turn off SCIM, the window still flashes for several seconds before it is closed.

Expected Results:  
The user should be able to click on SCIM's mini-window to select a different input method.

The problem does not occur with Gnome or Xfce.

It also (apparently) does not occur with any other X app when twm is used.
