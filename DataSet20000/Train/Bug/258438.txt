When I visits some of my often visited websites I sometimes, after typing a few
of the letters, click on the correct link in the autocomplete dropdown. However,
as I have visited these sites alot of times, I am very used to typing the url,
and sometimes I am actually still typing while clicking on the correct link in
the autocomplete dropdown. When that happens it looks for an website with the
letters I have already typed. Fx if I want to visit the mozilla.org website and
click the autocomplete link while having typed only 'moz' it starts searching
for 'moz' domains

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type the first letter of a site in the autocomplete list in the location bar
2. Move the mouse to the correct entry in the autocomplete list. Don't click it yet.
3. Enter some more letters of the domain quickly while clicking on the correct
entry.

Actual Results:  
The browser started searching for an domain with the letters I have already
typed myself.

Expected Results:  
The browser should have just launched the website that I clicked.
