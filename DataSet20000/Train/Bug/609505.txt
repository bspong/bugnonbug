4shared problem loading page

I go to this website:
http://www.craftcrave.com/
I select:
146 (this number changes daily) Digital Scrapbooking Freebies: [Blog (there are other choices but I use blog)
I look at the pictures and select one to download, if they use 4shared.com for the download this is what I get and I get it immediately it doesn't even start loading the page:
The connection was reset
 
The connection to the server was reset while the page was loading.

    *   The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few
          moments.

    *   If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
          connection.

    *   If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure
          that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.

If I go to Internet Explorer I have no trouble downloading whatever file I choose (but IE only works when it wants to).  I have three computers, a desktop PC with Windows XP, a laptop with Vista, and a desktop PC with Windows 7, all three have the latest version of Firefox (I did try downloading Firefox 4 beta but I keep getting corrupted file so I gave up.). I have the same problem with Vista and Windows 7 but so far since updating Firefox on Windows XP I have not had the problem however that computer is at my other house so I cannot try it again right now.

The computers do not freeze or anything, they just give me that message and after a while I just give up and use IE.




        
        
      


      
      

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. http://www.craftcrave.com/
2. Digital Scrapbooking Freebies: [Blog] click on blog
3. Click on a preview, it takes you to a web page, you have to select a "freebie" to download, then if that website uses 4shared you get the message mentioned above. Not all of these websites are in English, if you have to use Google to translate you have to go back to the original language to get the correct url.

This is the url for the one I was trying today, but these change daily so it may not be there after today:
http://www.4shared.com/photo/NjggfxtR/qp-boscoincantato.html  

You can change reproducibility above to read "happens most times", but not always.
Actual Results:  
As soon as I click on "download" in whatever language it is in, if the website uses 4shared I get the following:
The connection was reset
 
The connection to the server was reset while the page was loading.

    *   The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few
          moments.

    *   If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
          connection.

    *   If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure
          that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.


Expected Results:  
It should have brought up the 4shared web site with a page showing me the download file and telling me I had to wait however many seconds for the download to start, then I click "download file now" and it downloads the file.

Like I said above, firefox is telling me the site is unavailable or too busy but I keep trying and get the same message. I have to say at this point I have not always had this problem, it just started in the last two or three months and I have been using firefox for a couple years at least but I cannot tell you which update I started having the problem but I do know it is not the latest update, I had it before then. In fact I downloaded the latest update on my Windows XP first and thought the problem had been solved, but I still have it on Vista and Windows 7. If there is any way to add to this bug I will let you know if I still have the problem on the XP computer next week.
