Mozilla Firefox browser does not read Auroragpt Script (such as MRV5 script from http://www.maderitescripts.com/ and those from http://www.auroragpt.info/)from Paid to Click Websites (such as  blacksheepptc.info and bestcashclicks.com). Message comes up each time an ad is viewed:  "Error- There was an error validating your session".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Register an account at a PTC website that uses Auroragpt Script (such as blacksheepptc.info)
2.Log in and go to Earnings Area to click on any link (Such as Paid to Click and Paid to Read ads) 
3.Click on link.  
Actual Results:  
After clicking an ad I receive this message: "Error - There was an error validating your session" in top frame and bottom frame. 

Expected Results:  
Top frame should have a screen that has a countdown for how long an ad should be viewed before clicking on a number or symbol. Bottom frame should display the actual ad viewed. Occasionally, a message to check for cheating will come up before the top and bottom frames show up. 

Error messages occur with any site using Auroragpt scripts. Verify how Auroragpt scripts should work by using a different browser, such as Internet Explorer to click on ads viewed at PTC websites (i.e. blacksheepptc.info, bestcashclicks.com, and www.clickite.com). To view ads, go to the Earnings Area of each website.
