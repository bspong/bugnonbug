lockPref instructions in mozilla.cfg file not functional.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

At start-up, Firefox reads
   /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/greprefs/all.js
which contains a link to
   /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/mozilla.cfg
(ROT-13 'encrypted', and starting with //).
Firefox then reads mozilla.cfg (I'm sure) and subsequently ignores every line in it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Set up config files as instructed in (for instance)
http://ilias.ca/blog/2005/03/locking-mozilla-firefox-settings.html ,
in
http://mit.edu/~firefox/www/maintainers/autoconfig.html (steps 2, 3),
or in 
http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=2003856&highlight=lockpref#2003856

2. Start Firefox.



Actual Results:  
Indicated preference settings are not greyed out.
Preferences are not locked as requested (such as, for instance, a preset Home page).


Expected Results:  
Indicated preferences should be set and locked as requested.

This bug seems identical to Mozilla bug 213310.

As Mozilla browsers on OS-X are able to bypass the system firewall and connect directly to the 'net, the preference lock functionality is the only means an administrator has to add some security and parental content filtering to the browser.
