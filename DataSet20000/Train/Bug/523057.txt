dragging an HTML link from Thunderbird email to Firefox , Firefox displays web address in the URL bar twice

Dragging a link from Firefox 3.5.3 to another Firefox tab or different Firefox window works fine, when dragging a link from web based email works fine. When dragging a link like http://www.google.com from Thunderbird 2.0.0.23 email to Firefox the URL bar displays http://www.google.com/http://www.google.com/ and gives a 404 error from Google. This might be a Thunderbird problem, but when dragging the same email link within Thunderbird to Google Chrome 3.0.195.27 or Evil Explorer 8.0.6001.18828, the links work fine. This started about 4 months ago, which might mean it started with 3.5 and still does this. My Vista 32 bit laptop isn't the only system that is affected by this bug. My desktop does this too, it's on XP Pro SP2 32 bit and my moms XP SP3 32 bit laptop does this also. Also when hovering the cursor over the link in Thunderbird, the status bar on the lower left of Thunderbird displays the correct URL. Is anyone else able to duplicate this? Are Firefox and Thunderbird sharing the same API for links?

Thanks in advance and keep up the great work,
Derek
