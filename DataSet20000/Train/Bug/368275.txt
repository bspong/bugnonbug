unable to set up a Powerpoint association for *pps files in Firefox 2.0.0.1 File Manager.  A *.pps attachment to an email in Thunderbird will bring up Firefox correctly, however there is no option to add PPS to the list of file types.  Hence the result is Windows Media being "used" to open the the PPS file.  This naturally produces an error within WMP that it is an unrecognized file type.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.received PPS attachment in Thunderbird, and right click to open
2.Firefox 2.0.0.1 will load and try to match association in File Manager
3.PPS not on list, or able to entered to associate with MS Powerpoint program
4.Firefox then defaults to Windows Media Player 11 and lunches out..
Actual Results:  
The PPS files are good.  The work around is to save the PPS file to disk, and then  click to open in the Windows environment.  The Powerpoint associations are correct in my XP system, and the file will then open correctly and play the slideshow.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should allow adding PPS files into the list of File Types.  It does not have this option presently.  And, having said that, I expect Firefox to load Powerpoint correctly to run the PPS file.

Thunderbird  version 1.5.0.9 (20061207) could be the problem??  Technically, Firefox really does need to load when Powerpoint is the only program needed to run a PPS file.  Thunderbird has the same problem:  It only has *PPT associated to open with Powerpoint.  There is no means to add *PPS into Thunderbird either.  Thunderbird beta 3.0 did not work well.....
