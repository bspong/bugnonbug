Hello.

I firstly tested Firefox 3.0.4 with my new Vista notebook (I only used XP in the recent)

I wanted to download a p7b file that is secured via htaccess.

Following problem appeared:

- The password dialog box appeared
- After a few seconds, it disappeared by itself
- Application stop working - pause
- Password dialog open again, I could enter a few chars
- It disappeared again
- Application hanging again
- It appeared again and the chars I entered were still there, I could enter a few again
- It disappeared again - and so on!

I cannot tell why this happens, but I can tell that I have a finger print application VITAKEY which saves passwords from other applications.
