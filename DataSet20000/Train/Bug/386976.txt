X and Firefox use huge amounts of cpu and memory when visiting certain websites
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20070705 Firefox/2.0.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20070705 Firefox/2.0.0.4

First of all:
I build Firefox 2.0.0.4 from source using the latest stable ebuild in Gentoo without any specific use flags.

Also, the problem continues with or without netscape-flash.

When I visit certain websites (such as the before-mentioned http://borsen.dk/1649) Firefox demands a lot of cpu and memory usage. The X pid in Linux also goes way up and sometimes it stays at around 90% of cpu usage resulting in a really slow computer and a restart of Firefox

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the URL
2. Check your cpu and memory usage
Actual Results:  
Memory and cpu usage increases to around 40% and X to around 80-90%. Also if I try to scroll down the site, X and Firefox uses an enormous amount of cpu and memory.

Expected Results:  
It should have rendered the site without lagging, decreasing the overall speed of my computer.

I have a Pentium M 1600 MHz cpu and 1 gigabyte of memory so I have enough power.
