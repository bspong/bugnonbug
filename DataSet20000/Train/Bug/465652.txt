Starting Firefox at full internet speed on Local Area Connection and attempt to load Myspace.com. Myspace.com failed to reply to the request until the mouse was moved. Then an attempt to load facebook.com failed, but did not return an error page or a reset connection...the loading of the website stalled (not the browser). Attempted to use Firefox alone and close any application process/updater to gain exclusive access to the internet...and the operation was unsuccessful. Potential loss of temporary files and saved cookies for each website not loaded correctly and timing out.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Tried safe mode in Windows Vista SP1 x86 Firefox/3.0.4
2. Tried Standard mode in Windows XP SP3 x86 Firefox/3.0.4
3. Tried Standard mode in Apple Mac OSX 10.5 Firefox/3.0.4
Actual Results:  
Same results in all three operating systems. Using most current version. Some other websites performed okay, ones that had very little scripts/multimedia to load. 

Expected Results:  
It should have executed each web page fine. For some reason, the scripts seem to load very slow and the internet access with Firefox is slowed down and the internet connection skips itself from time to time.

There were default themes located on Windows XP and Mac OSX 10.5 tests. Noia 2.0 Extreme 2.0 on Windows Vista. Same result on all three machines.
