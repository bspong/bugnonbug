Failure code returned on closing popup, popups not exiting cleanly.

Please see the attached testcase for this one.

There are two columns on the test page.  The first column is an onMouseOver
test, the second an onClick test.

In both cases, the popup is closed on an onMouseOut event.  Quickly moving the
mouse over the links in the first column, or clicking then immediately moving
the mouse in the second column, will cause an error in browser.js.

The error in question is:
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code:
0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIObserverService.removeObserver]"  nsresult:
"0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame ::
chrome://browser/content/browser.js :: Shutdown :: line 445"  data: no]

The offending line is 445, service = null;

A small traceback of what is going on to get to that point:
1) The Startup() function gets called (line 181).
2) Line 237: setTimeout(delayedStartup, 0);
3) delayedStartup() function called (line: 301).
4) Line 377: observerService.addObserver(dlObserver, "dl-start", false);
5) Shutdown() function called (line: 424)
6) Line right before the error happens: service.removeObserver(dlObserver,
"dl-start"); (line: 444)

On top of this, the popups in this case case do not completely close.  Move the
mouse over the entire left column twice (down over the 5 links, then up over the
5 links), there will be a delay, and then several windows will spawn.  Most will
close immediately, but a few will be left open.  I've experienced anywhere from
1 to 4 remaining open windows, out of 10 produced.  All windows should be
closed, as I've called the close() method for each opened window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Load the testcase
2.  Move mouse over links in the left column, click and move mouse on the links
in the right column.

Actual Results:  
Windows will open, an error will occur on the JavaScript console, and most (but
sometimes not all) windows will close.

Expected Results:  
The exception error should be caught, and the popup windows should all close.

I haven't yet tested this on Mac & Linux, but I can do that later today.  The
speed of the window creation is unfortunately much slower in Firebird than in IE
(Tested on a P3 733 Mhz & P4 2 Ghz, delay was much shorter on the P4, but still
lagged behind IE.  I'll get some numbers on this to back it up later)
