Back button is not available.

I have been experiencing this problem for about a week now. Last night, before reporting the bug, I downloaded the most recent update which is Firefox 4.0. The last version I had was 3.6.1. Yahoo's homepage is set as my personal home page per my preferences. When I navigate away from the homepage, whether it be view a trending topic, or go to another site, the back button is not highlighted and navigating back to the previous page is not an option. When I downloaded 4.0, the problem seemed to go away. But the problem has occurred again and I cannot find any further updates.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox which goes to my homepage. I go to another webpage, the problem exists.
2. I close out that window, open a new window, go to a different page, and there is still no back button available, it is not highlighted.
3. I change my homepage to another page entirely such as wikipedia.org, go to a completely different website, and the problem still occurs.
Actual Results:  
The problem still exists, the back button is not highlighted or available to click on to go back to the previous page.

Expected Results:  
Going from Yahoo homepage to a "trending" results or a news item, the back button should be available. It should be highlighted, I should be able to click on it to go back to the Yahoo homepage. But it is not highlighted, going back to the previous page is not an available option. This happened with version 3.6.1 as well as the newest version 4.0.

Though I have contacted Yahoo! about this issue, I do not believe it is an issue on their end. For I have been able to duplicate this issue by setting my homepage to another website completely different, represented by a different company.
