Bad rendering of pages with XSLT and SVG - produces smaller image with black border.

I have some XSLT stylesheet that transforms xml data to XHTML+SVG graphics.
I have set up Firefox to open local files (when double-clicked) in a new tab.
After installing version 3.0, the file drawing becomes incorrect (if the browser is already open, and the file opens in the new tab), it is not of the correct size and the rest of space is filled with black. I have several xml and xsl files in the directory. Strangely, if I move needed files to another isolated directory (without the rest of files), everything draws correctly. If browser is not open before, the graph displays correctly (no tabs are displayed).
Also, if I right-click on this badly drawn image, the context menu contains too many different elements (does not even fits in whole, and has scrollers at top & bottom).

If I transform the xml file by a differrent XSLT processor, the resulting file opens ok.

The reproducibility depends on complexity of XSLT stylesheet, stripping it to bare minimum and replacing all the variables with fixed values elimintates the reproduction of bad render.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open browser on some page.
2. put my files in directory with some other files.
2. double-click my xml file so that it opens in the next tab.

Actual Results:  
Image is drawn in the 

Expected Results:  
image drawn in full, specified size.

Firefox 3.0
