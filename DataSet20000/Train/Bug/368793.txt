Different rendering between Firefox and IE-7  (text left aligned vs text centered)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.9) Gecko/20061206 Firefox/1.5.0.9

Possibly not a but, but I've noticed a difference in rendering
between Firefox IE-7.


Of course, it could be IE which is at fault here (not sure)
but the obvious different might be worth reporting.

I'm using:
- Firefox 1.5.0.9
- IE-7 7.0.5730.11
- Windows XP SP2



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
- go to following URL: http://dominique.pelle.free.fr/index_eo.php3
  using both Firefox and Internet Explorer. 
- compare the page rendering between Firefox and IE
- observe the difference: text is centered in IE-7,
  text left aligned in Firefox
Actual Results:  
different rendering in IE-7 and firefox as described above.




Expected Results:  
I'd expect IE-7 and firefox to render the page consistently.
Notice that this page is valid HTML-4 according to the button
at the bottom of the page.  I'd expect the rendering to be
consistent between IE and Firefox.  I do not know though
whether it's IE or Firefox which right or wrong.
