The firefox crashes when I try to hear one sound at a site that uses javascript (wmp plugin crashes)

First, sorry for my bad english.


When I used Firefox 3.6+, it crashed when I clicked on a button to play a sound.
So, I closed the browser (with ctrl + alt + del) and start a new session.

I noticed that when passing the mouse over the button, a JavaScript code in the status bar,

javascript: p.asfPlay ("/ lot numbers. wav")


Since I do a distance course, many of these have to click buttons to hear the lessons.

Firefox crashes, but not all the buttons.

Sometimes I can hear some sounds, but always has a button that locks, and I lose all the exercises which had made the page.


So recently I switched to Firefox 3 beta 4 and did the same problem. Only now Firefox is caught a few minutes and displays an error message:

"The error: Script error. 0 of online Has beed recorded"

and then: "The Microsoft Windows Media Player plugin crashed."


I thought it might be a problem in the browser since it's BETA, but the same problem occurs in versions 3.6 *

Several times already downloaded the wmp plugin and the problem is not solved: (

Reproducible: Always
