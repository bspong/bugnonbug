While browsing pages with short uris, like on this site, i noticed the text cursor (caret) is still blinking in the location bar. Even as i type this. I can move it to the search bar with a click, but it still doesn't go away when i focus the content pane. Even editing the toolbar content and then clicking the page doesn't help. The same problem happens with the textboxes on this page, making me scroll instead of inserting a space into this box even though this box contains a blinking cursor/caret. I'm a mouse man, so i don't know if any key combo while not focused on a textbox could cause dataloss.

Reproducible: Didn't try



Expected Results:  
Only show caret when textbox has focus.
