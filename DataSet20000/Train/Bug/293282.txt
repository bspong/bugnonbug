Printing HTML Table formatted incorrectly: everything over 1 page is lost
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050421 Firefox/1.0.3 (Debian package 1.0.3-2)

This looks much like VeryOldBug#66804!

Retrieve a mapquest routing (e.g. Archive attached); looks ok on screen.
Print-Preview shows peculiar layout, indicating a forced page eject at the
beginning of the <table>...</table>; but otherwise appears complete.
Print.  Only the first print page of the table is printed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. See detail.  Create an HTML table which requires more than one print page.
2. Print Preview - Note the table is forced onto a new page.
3. Print - Note only one page of the table is printed.



Expected Results:  
1. Printing the table should begin on the same page as the preceeding elements,
unless the style requires otherwise.
2. When a table is split from page to page, it should all be printed.  Ideally,
a preference could indicate the default behavior as to repeating the
<thead></thead> element (or the stylesheet should govern this).

My printing configuration:
OS: Debian 'sarge', kernel 2.4.28
CUPS
Printer= EPSON 5400
