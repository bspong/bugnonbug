Saving CNN.com to a File Crashes Firefox on Windows

When attempting to Save the CNN.com site to a file, on Windows, Firefox first warns that the file it is trying to download has too long of a name, and then it will crash.

Note that the name that appears in this "name is too long" dialog is *not* the name that was entered in the file picker.  The name in the File picker is: CNN.com - Breaking News, U.S., World, Weather, Entertainment & Video News.htm

But the name that appears in the dialog is far longer, you can see it in the screenshot in attachment 1.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to www.cnn.com
2. Chose File->Save Page As
3. Do not change the default name in the file picker or location (I was saving to desktop since I had saved previous files there).
4. Click OK on the three spurious "name is too long" dialogs that pop up.
5. Firefox Crashes.
Actual Results:  
The download manager launches as the "name is too long" dialog appears.  The "name is too long" warning will pop up three times and then Firefox will crash.

A directory is created with the name suggested in the Filepicker and that directory contains the elements of the CNN site.  But, there is no CNN HTML page saved on the desktop.



Expected Results:  
The Site should be saved properly, with the suggested file name, no spurious error dialogs, and no crashes.

I tried this on an Intel Mac and it worked, no Linux option to try it with atm.
