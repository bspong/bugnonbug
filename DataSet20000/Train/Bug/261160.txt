Each time I double click that lovely Jon Hicks logo on my desktop, I cannot see
any Jon Hicks icons in the product. Even worse, the logo on my desktop is
obscured by the Firefox window! I am sad about this as are all of my friends
(both of them).  After his great work on the project logos, I feel it is a
travesty of great proportions that a Hicks theme does not exist within the
product. *tear*

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Look for a Jon Hicks designed theme
3. Fail to find one
4. Feel sad

Actual Results:  
Sense of emptyness. I was left wishing Jon Hicks had design a Firefox theme.

Expected Results:  
Sense of fulfilment. My desktop should have been enlivened by a Hicks Design
Firefox theme.

Everybody knows that freelance developers cannot afford to always work for free.
 I suggest that the Mozilla Organisation sets aside a small sum of cash to
commision Jon Hicks to design a new theme set for Firefox.

If necessary could we set up a fund for donations just to this cause.  I know a
large number of fans of Jon's work and I'm sure they'd all contribute something.
I know I would.
