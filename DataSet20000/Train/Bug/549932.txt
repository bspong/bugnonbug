The width of the tooltip of the location bar should not be limited by the width of the location bar
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.2pre) Gecko/20100301 Firefox/3.6.2

When I narrowed the width of the browser window, as a matter of course, the width of the location bar becomes narrow.
In that case, the width of the tooltip of the location bar becomes narrow in the same way, too. 
and there is not the meaning of the tooltip.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Minefield width New Profile
2.Open Long  URL ( http://www.google.co.jp/search?q=Mozilla+Firefox&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a )
3.Narrow the width of the browser window
4.Show tooltip by mouse hover location bar


Actual Results:  
The width of the tooltip is the same as the width of the location bar.
I can not read whole URL.



Expected Results:  
The width of the tooltip should be unrelated to the width of the location bar.
And I can read whole URL without crop.
