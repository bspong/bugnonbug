It actually does this on numerous websites as far as adding comments or logging in.  It just sends me to an error page.   If I use the back arrow, sometimes it will work, sometimes it won't.  

Also, if I have typed a message, I go to add it, it loses the message and goes to the error page.


Sometimes when closing it goes to 100% cpu usage as well for  a minute or so.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  attempt to login, just goes to blank login and won't allow a login
2.  attempt to add message, either goes straight to error or if you can type a message, it won't  post it, instead going to error page
3.


Expected Results:  
Upon clicking on login, I should be logged in.

I should be able to click add message box,, dialog box comes up and message is added when clicked again.

Occurs with any theme, including default.   

I only have a couple addons, flashblock, adblock+, aging tabs, bugmenot, greasemonkey, corel ie tabs and reminder fox
