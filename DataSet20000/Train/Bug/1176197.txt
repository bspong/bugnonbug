Navigating two tabs with file:// URL hangs when e10s is enabled.
STR:

1. Download https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/40949268/Bugs/e10s_navigation_hang/e10s_navigation_hang.zip and unzip to local filesystem.
2. Navigate to file:///C:/where/you/unzipped/MathGeoLib.html
3. Wait for the page to load and print out the last two lines

Done. 1 tests run. 1 passed, of which 0 succeeded with warnings. 0 failed.
0

4. Don't close the finished tab, but at the top of the browser tab row, click on the plus sign to open a new tab, and in the new tab, navigate again to the URL file:///C:/where/you/unzipped/MathGeoLib.html

Observed: The page will not load, but the green circle will keep spinning indefinitely. The browser is now hung, and it is not possible to navigate to any other pages in other tabs, but those will also keep spinning the Connecting... animation. Closing the offending second file:// tab that never finished loading doesn't recover the browser either, but new pages cannot be loaded.

Expected: The page should load normally and not hang the browser.

Noticed that opening a new non e10s window and redoing the steps avoids the issue, and the page is able to load correctly, so this looks like e10s related.
