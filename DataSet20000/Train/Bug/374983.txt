Firefox fails to ask me if I want to clear private data when I close
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3

Under the privacy preference of Firefox 2.0.0.3, with respect to Private Data I have checked the box (x) Ask me before clearing Private Data. However, Firefox does not close with that option and simply clears my private data despite my request that I be asked whether I want to clear private data. My history, cache and probably my cookies are being cleared each time I close Firefox, and I am not being asked whether I wish to have my private data cleared. I am running on Mac OS 10.4.9

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I have deleted the first install of Firefox 2.0.0.3 along with all preference files, etc. No trace of firefox left
2. I have downloaded and reinstalled Firefox 2.0.0.3.

3. Every time I close the browser, my private data is deleted despite my request that I be asked and given the option of saying yes or no.
Actual Results:  
Same thing. Firefox fails to ask if I want to clear data and clears all items checked under settings.

Expected Results:  
Same thing. Firefox fails to ask if I want to clear data and clears all items checked under settings.

It should have ASKED me if I want to clear private data as this was the box I checked. I did not instruct it to clear the data each time I quit. Once again, I am using Firefox 2.0.0.3 running under MAC OS X 10.4.9. PPC Build 8P135
