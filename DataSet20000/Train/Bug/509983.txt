THE FOLLOWING CODE:

<!--		 <script src="swfobject.js" type="text/javascript"></script>               -->

RESULTS in the script getting interpreted by Firefox, and the Comment Never Closes. Closing Comment Tag gets rendered to browser.  

Specifically in my situation was trying to use the Google swfobject.js to load flash to a page.  The flash never gets rendered.   Works in every other browser I have used.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Insert Code above into an .html file
2. Load HTML into Firefox on any platform
3. Does not reproduce on any other browser available today. IE, Opera, Safari etc.
Actual Results:  
The "javascript" code gets interpeted, and the comment never closes.  The closing tag "-->" gets rendered to the page as text, and then the rest of the page does not load correctly.

Expected Results:  
Browser should simply ignore all text between the comments.

Tried it on Firefox on PC and on Imac.
