Very High Memory Use After Updating to 2.0.0.12

firefox 2.x has shown memory leaking since the beginning but after the recent update to 2.0.0.12 the leaking is out of control. It goes over 372MB of memory and large Virtual Memory usage also.  I'm very dissapointed with this and wish there was a way to revert to the prior release or UNDO or UNINSTALL a recent UPDATE.  Is there?  Firefox becomes sluggish after a while and then sometimes stops responding to keyboard input.  Rarely entirely hangs which is good but still its an annoying problem.  I like to open many window tabs upto 20 at a time and leave them open for days.  Please advise.

Thanks!
Dave

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.launch firefox 2.0.0.12 begin surfing, open tabs over time between 10 and 20 tabs
2.allow tabs to remain open for a few hours
3.browsing begins to slowdown. Eventually stops responding to text input/keyboard input. Have to restart firefox. Then problem repeats after a while again.
Actual Results:  
browsing begins to slowdown. Eventually stops responding to text input/keyboard input. Have to restart firefox. Then problem repeats after a while again.

Expected Results:  
browsing remains snappy and fast - considering I have 2GB of RAM and tons of disk space. it should keep running strong and memory usage should not leap up to 300+MB in just a couple of hours.  When I restart firefox and restore the prior session and windows that were open - the memory usage initially is only 128MB or so.

I have 2GB of RAM about 4 GB free on the C: drive where the OS is and some swap space.  This problem started to worsen after recent update to 2.0.0.12.
