Firefox freeze when pop up appears while I am dragging a new bookmark to the
Bookmark toolbar folder sub-folder.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

1 - Open two tabs and verify that you have at least one sub folder 
    with few links in the Bookmarks Toolbar Folder.
2 - open any page on tab 2.
3 - in the first tab write slow loading url f.exe: www.symbian.org
    (erroneous: the correct one is www.symbian.com)
4 - click second tab
5 - drag url icon to 'Bookmarks Toolbar Folder' so that a sub folder opens
6 - wait for the first tab url loader to pop up error dialog:
      'www.symbian.org could not be found'
Now firefox freezes.  I cannot click the error pop up, it simply does
not get focus at all.  The whole application is 'untouchable'!


Actual Results:  
Firefox freezes.

Expected Results:  
I should be able to click the error popup and continue normally.
