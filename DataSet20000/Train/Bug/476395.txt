Received a notification by Norton and then a new box has appeared in the browser

I received a notification from my Norton Anti-virus it had caught a Trojan and it was deleted and to complete it I needed to restart windows.  I did that and a new box has appeared right below the bookmarks toolbar.  It looks there is some sort of small symbol in the box and it appears the cursor can click on it however when you do nothing happens.  I put the cursor over the unknown symbol and it showed me this at the bottom of the browser, chrome:11m3ffstbr/content/toolbarembed.html#
I have uninstalled every program that was Mozilla, Windows Update 2 scans for any virus of anything and reinstalled from scratch.  When I reinstall the browser is fine until the CPU is restarted and the Unknown box reappears under the toolbar.  I do not know how to fix this.  Is this something you are aware of and know how to get rid of it?
