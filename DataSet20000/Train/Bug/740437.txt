Malicious Website redirects all tabs to different websites

Steps to reproduce:

Browse on the website www.mmorpg.com where one of the advertisements contained a piece of code which caused all active tabs to be redirected (or reloaded) since the sites in them remained the same.
However when checking the link target on anything clickable on all the tabs (including the one which had www.mmorpg.com) they where now going to an malicious website instead.

This can be used to exploit other vulnerabilities within the browser or install harmfull software on the target machine.


Actual results:

All active tabs where "reloaded" and all clickable links where replaced with an url to an malicious website.


Expected results:

No other tabs should be possible to be accessed in a way that allows to replace their content if the script is not from the same domain.

If such an attempt is discovered it should be logged silently in the error window so malware sites can be more easely tracked who are abusing this exploit.

Another extra feature should be added to be enabled or disabled (enabled by default) to allow same domain scripts to access tabs which are from the same domain.

Side note: this used to be a rare but becomes more common these days and is even applied within advertisement scripts now which would affect potentially every user which visits regular websites where advertisements are displayed (pretty much all websites).
