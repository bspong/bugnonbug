window.home no longer points to iframe window object
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:22.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/22.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130618035212

Steps to reproduce:

This worked in 21.0 and prior but stopped working as of 22.0:
Web application uses iframe with name="home" and javascript performs actions such as top.home.location.href = url; and window.home.location.href = url; to change the content of the "home" iframe (URL is in same domain, so not a cross domain issue).


Actual results:

Firefox 21.0 and earlier works fine.
Firefox 22.0 throws exception TypeError: window.home.location is undefined

Seems to be related to the fact that home() is now a function that is no longer assigned the iframe's name automatically (which gives javascript access to the iframes window object)


Expected results:

"home" iframe should have loaded the URL that was assigned to its window.location.href

What's a bummer is that this bug will further decrease Firefox's already-decreasing browser usage statistics since our response was to have all users switch to IE or Chrome (this is an enterprise / intranet web application used by thousands of organizations and hundreds of thousands of users and due to strict testing requirements at many of our clients simply changing the iframe and all code that references "home" is not an immediately viable option).
