Cannot load URL from address bar, typed or clicked via Awesomebar

The address bar stops working several times a day for me. I can type an address, but when I hit enter or click to load it, nothing happens. Same thing if I start to type a familiar address and click it in the Awesomebar drop down. I can still load pages by clicking bookmarks, though. If I close and restart Firefox, the problem goes away.

Here are the Add-ons I have active:

Adblock Plus
Delicious Bookmarks
Download Statusbar
FireFTP
Google Notebook
Greasemonkey

I haven't tried disabling things to see if it corrects the problem. That is my next step. This happens several times a day, and when it does, it also will not load things I click on in the Awesomebar.

One other note: I'm using Tiddlywiki quite frequently at work to log calls. It is a self-contained program/html file that I believe runs solely on Javascript. My file has gotten to be 1.1 MB these days - quite large for an html file, and saving was getting very slow under Firefox 2. FF3 speeds it up quite a bit, but I wonder if this is related to the problem?

Reproducible: Sometimes

I am not using any themes. I do have a few other add-ons that are disabled due to incompatibility or current disuse.
