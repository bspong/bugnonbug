Firefox freezes on launch, even after total reinstall or launch in safe mode
User-Agent:       Opera/9.63 (Macintosh; PPC Mac OS X; U; en) Presto/2.1.1
Build Identifier: Firefox 3.0.6

I downloaded (ie upgraded to) Firefox 3.0.6 a few days ago, more or less concurrently (I can't say which was first) with getting the latest Mac patch for OSX 10.4.11. All worked fine until the day before yesterday (16 Feb) when, for no reason I can think of, Firefox (which was running at the time though my Mac was not in use) lost all its log-in information. I simply went to the machine, woke it from sleep, and all of my logins were unrecognised, though the passwords were still there in Firefox prefs. Last night, Firefox crashed and would not restart. It has refused to restart since (hangs on restart every time, sometimes getting a step or two further than other times). Have tried accessing profile manager - Firefox freezes as soon as I invoke the program. Have uninstalled FF and every file with a FF/Mozilla connection, then reinstalled - same result. Have reinstalled every trace, I hope, of the only program I downloaded yesterday, which was a trial version of Intego anti-virus. And I repaired permissions and, well, just about everything, really. Maybe this is not a bug, but my system. However, I have run Disk First Aid, Norton and Disk Warrior, and ho problems are reported. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Double-click on Firefox app icon (in dock or apps folder)
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Program sometimes launches opening window without accessing home page, sometimes does nothing at all except to freeze. Difficult to regain access to finder and other programs.

Expected Results:  
Launched, I would have hoped. I've been a relatively untroubled Firefox user for quite a few years, and I'm desperate to solve this

Here are crash reports for the time in question
