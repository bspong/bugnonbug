It is possible to accidentally rename the "Bookmarks Menu" or "Unsorted Bookmarks" folders by double-clicking the close-tree button of another folder (possibly related to Bug 492061).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any page.
2. Click on the star in the location bar to bookmark it.
3. Click on the star again to open the "Edit This Bookmark" menu.
4. Click on the "Show all the bookmark folders" button.
5. Scroll down and select either "Bookmarks Menu" or "Unsorted Bookmarks"
6. With the selected folder still in view, click on the plus sign ("+") next to some other bookmark folder to expand it (scroll down all the way again if it pushes the selected folder out of view).
7. Double-click the minus ("-") sign on that folder.
Actual Results:  
The entry will now be renamable.

Expected Results:  
Both the "Bookmarks Menu" and "Unsorted Bookmarks" folders should not be renamable.

If you've ever done this accidentally, it can be frustrating figuring out how to undo it (for some time, my Booksmark Menu folder was called 'foto', the name of one of my other folders).
