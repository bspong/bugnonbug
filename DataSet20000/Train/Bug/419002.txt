form data not saved even after user confirmation, on moving to a different page in the web application

In a web application, when some data is filled in a form and some link is clicked (to move to a different page within the same application), a javascript prompt asks the user to confirm if the changed form data should be saved. On pressing okay, the data should be saved (form should be submitted as per the javascript), which is the behaviour in IE, but Firefox just moves to the new page without saving the data(submitting the form)which can be confirmed by coming back to the page.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.In any web application in which a javascript prompt is displayed when moving away from a form page (if form data has been changed), to confirm saving of new data, make data changes and affirm the data save on the prompt.
2. come back to the form and check whether the changes were saved.
Actual Results:  
Form data is not saved 

Expected Results:  
Form data should have been saved, as is the case in IE.
