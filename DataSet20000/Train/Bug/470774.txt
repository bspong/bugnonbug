I have a username/password saved for lala.com yet upon entering my username the password does not fill in. I am a developer for the site and have tried many things to fix the issue. See additional information to see

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Sign in to Lala.com using the in-page sign in dialog (just click sign in)
2. Enter your email address/password
3. Sign out of Lala
4. Check your password manager to verify that a username and password have been stored for www.lala.com
5. Begin to sign in to Lala again
6. Enter your email address again
7. Notice that the password field is not auto-filled when you enter your email address
Actual Results:  
The username/password are not entered into the appropriate fields

Expected Results:  
The username/password fields in sign up should be pre-populated

There are several things to note here, but some of these have already been ruled out as issues preventing the password manager to work as expected:

1. Lala.com performs client-side rendering. That is, the sign in form is not in the DOM until the user clicks the sign in link. (visit the site without JS enabled to see, or do a simple "View source")
2. The site uses an iframe to securely send the login info to the server and handle the response.
3. The page is using http, the iframe is using https
4. The sign in form element has a target=<iframe id>
