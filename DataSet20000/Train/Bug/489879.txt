Unable to access internet after Mozilla Firefox update

I first encountered this problem Wednesday morning after an update for Mozilla Firefox was installed.  Immediately after installation I was unable to access any websites from the Firefox browser or form Internet Explorer.  I got help in trying to fix this problem through my server (Time Warner) and it was determine that the connection was good and I was able to access the internet if I entered the websites IP address for example for Yahoo I had to enter 209.131.36.158.  Since the problem started after up Mozilla Firefox download I decided to restore the system to a previous date.  The result was that I was now able to access the internet through Mozilla Firefox but still no luck for Internet Explorer. 

A few minutes later a pop up was displayed indicating that there was an update for Mozilla Firefox I clicked on Okay the update was downloaded and just like the day before the internet was inaccessible.  I once again restored the system to the date I had previously restored it too and once again I have internet access through Mozilla Firefox but not internet explorer.

The pop up for the update just displayed itself for the 3rd time but this time I declined the update.  Any suggestions on what I should do for the next request to update the software?
