After browsing 50 course web pages on ee.stanford.edu and
downloading 2500 PDF and HTML files Firefox memory usage grows
to 278MB Real and 622MB Virtual memory. 

Selecting the URL field of the first browser window to be opened
and pressing the Delete (Backspace) key to delete the URL does not
work.

Instead of deleting the URL, Firefox displays the previous pages 
from the browser history. 

Since  1.5.0 I have noticed that Firefox does not fully release all
storage allocated for a browser window when the browser window is closed. 

Some structure is being overflowed and causing Firefox to misbehave. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any large web site with many downloadable files like ee.stanford.edu
2. open 50-60 course web pages
3. download all PDF documents linked to the course page
4. go back to the first browser window and select the URL and press Delete

Actual Results:  
Selecting the URL field of the first browser window to be opened
and pressing the Delete (Backspace) key to delete the URL does not
work.

Instead of deleting the URL, Firefox displays the previous pages 
from the browser history. 


Expected Results:  
The characters in the URL field should have been deleted.
