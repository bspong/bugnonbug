Actual Results:  
a new window is opened, but the location is at the top of the window and editable

Expected Results:  
a new window should open without a locationbar

the ability to open a browser window without a locationbar, is very necessary when the window is being used for something like a terminal emulator.
(where tabbing to fields is common, hitting enter executes a command within the window.  however if the current field is the locationbar the application is reloaded, this would destroy the terminal emulation session in this case)
