HUGE memory leak in windows xp causes system to become almost 100% unresponsive (consumes all available ram and pagefile space)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: 3.0.4

after about 2 hours of use firefox takes up all of my ram and makes the system near unresponsive. in fact most of the time the only way to avoid a total freeze is to reboot. this happens just in general use and has happened with 3.0.3 and 3.0.4

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open ff
2.start browsing
3.wait for 2 hours and check firefoxes size in task manager if you can even acsess it at that point
Actual Results:  
firefox took up 199+ Mb of my 256 Mb of ram, also, it only stayed at about 199+ for me because it was constantly loading into my pagefile. to confirm this i checked and my pagefile use went through the roof after this happened. also, only after this happens does windows tell me that it has to increase the pagefile because it is too small, an obvious sign that something is consuming my pagefile like a wildfire

Expected Results:  
well in real life the damn memory leak shouldent exist and all of my ram and pagefile wouldnt be eaten up

i dont think this has anything to do with it but i was using the aero fox theme (cant have been that because it happens with the default theme as well)

my system specs:
CPU: mPGA 478 P4 (2.00 Ghz)
RAM: 256 Mb PC-800
System: Dell Precision Workstation 340
