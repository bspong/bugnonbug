Integrate Tab Groups data into Session Restore proper
Right now Tab Candy is using Session Restore to stash data. However this approach is falling short in a few ways:

Undo Close Tab knows nothing about tab sets. So recently closed tabs are shown from all tab sets. This should be local to the current tab set (and stored independently). If we're going to handle this inside session restore, then we need to actually acknowledge that Tab Candy exists & is using session restore for data.

If tab sets become window-independent, then we need to restructure how session data is stored.

Current:
> {
>   "windows":[
>     {
>       "tabs":[
>         { ... },
>         { ... }
>       ],
>       "_closedTabs":[...],
>     }
>   ],
>   "_closedWindows":[...]
> }

Proposed (haven't necessarily covered all details)
> {
>   "tabsets":[
>     {
>       "id":100100101010,
>       "title": "foo",
>       "tabs":[
>         { ... },
>         { ... }
>       ],
>       "_closedTabs":[...],
>     },
>   ]
>   "windows":[
>     {
>       "tabset":100100101010,
>     },
>     { ... }
>   ]
> }

This would break consumers, hard. If it's going to happen, it should happen now.

We'd need new APIs. We'd need to get rid of some old APIs
