My problem is the same as the one reported already  (but unconfirmed) of bug
275897.  Using MOzilla Firefox 1.01 (and also with v 1.0) I am able to login to
my.yahoo.com and to groups.yahoo.com, but I cannot login to my Yahoo web-based
email account wiht this browser.  The probelm does not extend to my other
browsers, which are able to login to my Yahoo email.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.yahoo.com
2. Click on "My Yahoo" link at top of page.
3. Login - I have a junk mail accountL user "jeffreygson2", password c3b6n8m0
4. Click on any email listed in the Show email subjects on page.
5. Server will ask for a login password before it will display the contents of
the email.
6. Type in password "c3b6n8m0" again, in either standard mode or secure mode,
and Enter.
7.  User authentication is not accepted.  Email cannot be opened. 
Actual Results:  
It proved useless trying to view Yahoo email with Firefox so I switched to
Maxthosn (MyIE2) browser to read my email.

Expected Results:  
Login to email account shoudl have been successful.
