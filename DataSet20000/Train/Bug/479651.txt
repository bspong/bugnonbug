In Firefox 3.0.6, and also in Shiretoko and Minefield updated today, when one uses "Save Page As..." or in download "Save File", in both the tree view (Navigation Pane) and the details pane, scrolling is erratic. The first few clicks in the scroll bar usually seem normal, but then the scroll bar will suddenly jump a long way down (use a directory with a number of subdirectories, such as "Program Files" in Windows Vista). The behavior is not entirely consistent, I think, but happens almost every time. The scroll bar jumps to the position of the cursor.  I can't find any mouse setting that would explain it.

On the same machine, no similar behavior occurs in Windows Explorer, Internet Explorer, Openoffice 3.0.1, Google Chrome 2.0.164.0, or other programs that I use. 

I can't see the same problem on Windows XP or Fedora 10, both with 3.0.6 versions, so it seems to be Vista specific.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. On any browser page, do "File > Save Page As..."
2. Browse to a folder with more than a few subdirectories (C:\Program Files)
3. View as details so that there is one item per line.
4. Click the scroll bar beneath the cursor twice.
Actual Results:  
After the second click, see the scroll bar jump down to it, skipping the items in between, which might be the ones you are looking for.

Expected Results:  
Scroll down a few lines or even a full page of the folders or files, so you can select whichever you want.
