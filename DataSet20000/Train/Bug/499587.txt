Hello, there!

I experience a odd behaviour when trying to close a tab/window with the osx based keyboard command APPLE+W. The window is emptied from its content, but sticks open, now blank and a single tab is always visible - which is againt the preferences I chose (no tab bar when only one tab/window is open).

Let´s say, I have a browser window with lots of tabs. As intended, APPLE+W closes each and every tab but the last, wherer this behaviour again shows up.

When I use the mouse and press the red OSX close button on the upper left window edge, it just closes as expected.

This happened on Firefox 3.5 RC1 and RC2. Using Firefox 3.0.11 or older did not show this disturbance.

I am running OSX 10.5.7 natively on Intel Mac Pro.

I hope I can help.

Best wishes,
B.
