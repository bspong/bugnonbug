Memory Usage Grows Too Radidly When Surfing at Least 5 Tabs - Memory Leak?

I did a comparison of memory usage between FF3 and IE7. Obviously upon first load FF3 uses only 1/3 the memory footprint. Wonderful. But this efficiency diminishes once you actually start to surf. Check it out.

FF3 - 5 tabs, memory footprint 70MB. Click 3 links in each tab. --> 103 MB.

IE7 - the same 5 tabs, footprint 167MB. Click 3 links in each. --> 181 MB.

Obviously FF3 is more efficient overall in terms of memory usage, however... why is it claiming and holding more memory once sites are surfed? It climbed 33MB in this scenario, wheras IE7 only climbed 14MB.

The sites I loaded in the 5 tabs were:

google.com, yahoo.com, seattletimes.com, seattlepi.com, youtube.com.

In all cases I only clicked on links that went to textual pages -- didn't load any videos in the youtube tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load up the five tabs named above
2. click three links in each tab
3. watch the memory usage in Task Manager for the respective processes
Actual Results:  
FF3 claims 33MB more memory, IE7 claims 14MB. 

Expected Results:  
I would expect FF3 to claim no more memory than IE7, given how crappy IE7 is at memory usage in general.

These pages I am viewing are, saved to disk, not more than 150k. Since the tabs are already loaded -- why is it jumping 2.2 MB per click? It ought to jump no more than 150k, and that is only if it is holding those pages in memory, something I do not think should be the default behavior. It can store the pages to disk, if there is enough cache, otherwise nothing should be cached.
