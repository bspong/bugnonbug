--------- first a comment on design --------
I really hate the new bookmarks organization though I would like a left window like windows explorer. I like to be able to see the contents of more than one folder. This is unworkable. And strangely enough, it does not and cannot "Show all bookmarks" as the Menu Choice suggests.

---------- now the bug ---------------

I have firefox set so that I approve each cookie.
When I select a bookmark it asks me about the cookie for the bookmark even though I am not opening the page. And it freezes time after time. I tried it many times.
I may have selected another bookmark before I saw the choicebox. I was trying to move bookmarks around. 

That is all. I had to use Task Manager to close firefox. say 5 times.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1 start firefos
2.open bookmark organize, tho it's not called that now
3. move bookmarks around
Actual Results:  
Yah, firefox froze. nothing will function.

Expected Results:  
no request for cookie approval
firefox to not freeze

I said it all in the first box. the rest is to be cooperative. 
used default theme. XP pro. Averatec box.
