Again with another problem with Firefox 3.6.4 Beta. I updated the Beta to the latest one. And It has another bug! AGAIN! When you view sites with Flash, the CPU usage goes high to 90% to 100% and then again, causing my laptop fan to go turbo mode. Seriously, can you guys fix this problem? I hate having an hassle to throttle down my processor down! I have the latest version of Flash Player and still causing problems.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch a site with flash player. YouTube for example. Watch a video and then monitor my CPU usage. I saw it spiking up to 90% to 100%
2. Restart browser and went back to YouTube and watched another video. Does the same thing again.
3. Restart browser, restart Windows, re-open YouTube and watched another video. AND still does the same stupid thing.
Actual Results:  
I still get 100% CPU Usage!!! 

Expected Results:  
Firefox should use less CPU usage. Like in 50 to 65%. Thats good enough. Other browsers don't use 100% usage on flash.
