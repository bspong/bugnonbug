firefox doesn't properly handle certificate types in SSL/TLS client authentication
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050811 Firefox/1.0.6

When an SSL/TLS server request client authentication it sends a list of
certificate types which the client should use in selecting a client certificate.
Firefox allows the user to pick any available client certificate, regardless as
to whether the certificate is a valid choice based on the server's certificate
types.

For example, if the server sends a CertificateRequest message with only RSA_sign
as a valid certificate type, the client should only be able to pick client
certificates that contain RSA public keys signed with RSA signatures. However,
Firefox lets the user pick a certificate with a DSS key which may cause
authentication failures.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. find a SSL/TLS server that supports client authentication using only RSA_sign
2. Connect to the server with https
3. When the client certificate selection dialog is shown, pick a non-RSA
certificate such as a DSS certificate

Actual Results:  
In tests with my server the SSL/TLS handshake fails

Expected Results:  
Limit the set of possible client certificates to those that match the server's
certificate types in the CertificateRequest message.
