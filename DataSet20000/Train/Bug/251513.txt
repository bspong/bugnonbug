content of tabs not focused to keyboard scrolling when switching tabs
The content of tabs doesn't get the focus for keyboard scrolling reliably when
switching between tabs.  It seems to get into a state where it works for one tab
but not the other.  This seems like it might be a regression from bug 175893,
which landed today.  I can't reproduce in last night's Firefox nightly
(2004-07-14-08-trunk), but I can reproduce reliably in my cvs Firefox build from
6pm today, and I'm reasonably sure the behavior is new because I was trying to
scroll and it wasn't working when I was expecting it to.  (All Linux.)

Steps to reproduce:
 1. Open a new firefox window
 2. press control-L (focus URL bar)
 3. type "www.mozilla.org", and press enter
 4. hit the down arrow a few times to show scrolling works
 5. press control-T (open new tab, which focuses URL bar)
 6. type "www.mozilla.org", and press enter
 7. hit the down arrow a few times to show scrolling works
 8. Press Ctrl-PgUp (switch tab)
 9. hit the down arrow a few times

Actual results (after 9): no scrolling
Expected results (after 9): scrolling

Note: When opening more than two tabs, the most recently opened tab seems to be
OK, but previously open tabs all seem to be in the bad state.  Clicking in the
body of the page of one of the tabs puts that tab into the good (focusing)
state, and all the others into the bad (not focusing) state.

I could not reproduce in Seamonkey nightlies, 2004-07-14-07-trunk or
2004-07-14-19-trunk
