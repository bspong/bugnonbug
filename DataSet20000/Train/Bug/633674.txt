I just got done testing FF 4.0b11 with a new, clean test profile. After 6 hours the CPU spiked. The spikes are random and usually many hours/days in between spikes. This has been troublesome to try to trace down. I can't force the spikes, I just have to wait till they appear without any clues as to the cause.
