Not able to 'clear private data' if history is off (= "remember history for 0 days")

I tried to (several times) 'clear private data'. After doing that I could still go  forward (ALT+right arrow) and backward (ALT+left arrow) which means cache really wasn't cleared. I could still surf on pages I had visited. The problem was fixed, when I turned history on (=remember history for 1 days). I tried to 'clear private data' again and the arrows in the navigation bar turned grey immediately. So the problem, I guess, is that you can't clear all private data when you have history off ('remember history for 0 days').

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Turn history off (0 days)
2.'Clear private data' 


Actual Results:  
Data is not cleared. See 'Details' above.

Expected Results:  
I should not have been able to go to the previous page I'd visited. It should've cleared the data.

Please feel free to ask for additional information if the description of the problem was not detailed enough. I wasn't able to find an earlier report on this bug even though I tried.
