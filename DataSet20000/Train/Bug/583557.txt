Cookies are reset every time Firefox is closed.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b3pre) Gecko/20100731 Minefield/4.0b3pre

Whenever I quit Firefox then execute it again, all my cookies appear to be reset. I've checked the options for handling cookies and I've made sure that the browser does not automatically delete them upon being shut down, however the problem still persists, and I have to log into sites once again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox.
2.Login to any site that requires user login.
3.Quit Firefox.
4.Reopen Firefox and go to the sites that you are logged in at and check if you are still logged in.
Actual Results:  
I was logged out of any sites I was logged in to.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have kept me logged into the sites that I had logged in to, as it had been configured to keep cookies until they expired.
