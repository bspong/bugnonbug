About 3 or 4 times now i've ended up with something like 600-->400MB change when closing to everything but download manager. This only happens when i have used extensive flash video. There believe media on closed pages is often not closing properly.

This bug is often, but not always encountered with Bug 289873, even if i close down and reopen pages i cannot get flash sound(in videos) to play. This tells me videos are not closing with their windows.

Flash was downloaded about 2-3 months ago, just upgraded to latest.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.watch a lot of flash videos
Actual Results:  
major memory use, sluggish computer, memory cannot be freed without closing firefox, this act being quite painfully slow.


I've tried switching to using profiles to load multiple instance of firefox up so i can reduce downtime in restarting. Also the only way to store multiple windows on restart is to use task manager to kill firefox.exe first.

there is no plug-in catagory
