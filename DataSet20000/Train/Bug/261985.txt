ALT-B, then any letter should scroll through bookmarks starting with that letter

Using keyboard shortcuts, pressing alt-b then "B" or "M" does not currently work
because "B" automatically opens the "Add Bookmark" dialog, and "M" open "Manage
Bookmarks".  Note, it should only scroll if there are other bookmark options
available with that letter, otherwise it's perfectly accectable to have the Add
Bookmarks dialog open when alt-b then b is pressed.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Add a few book marks and/or folders that start with the letter "b" and "m"
2. Close boomark addition or manangement dialog
3.  Press alt-b then "b"
4.  Pressing the second "b" does not scroll through the "b" bookmarks, but
rather opens the "add bookmark" dialog that is set to have "b" as it's shortcut key.

Actual Results:  
The add bookmark dialog appeared.

Expected Results:  
It should have scrolled through the "b" list on the bookmarks menu of "add
bookmarks" (because short cut key is b for this menu item), then "baking",
"banking online", and "bar tending".

I'm not suggesting that any of the shorcut keys for menu items under the
bookmark menu be changed to something other than what they are now. I am
requesting that the bookmarks menu have the logic to scroll through all options
of any given character, regardless of any predefined, program-driven, menu items.

thanks keep up the great work!
