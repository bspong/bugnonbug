After page loads, text links disappear.  Links work ok in IE tab.

Entered search argument, searched, results popup on the screen for a second, then instantly disappear.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
On various sites, page appears to load fine, then, at the last second, various text / graphics elements disappear.  Peculiar to FireFox; not reproduceable under IE tab or when using MSIE.

Expected Results:  
Expected text / graphics to remain visible.  Expected various ads to be blocked by Adblock.

Have tried disabling NoScript, Disabling Adblock.  Using IE Tab displays the page fine, but of course without the advantage of FireFox's popup blocks, etc.

Captured some of the code (available as source, but not displayed..) (note: serach argument was "firefox", and this was one of several 'hits'):
<TD><A HREF="view.php?id=5139540" title="Firefox 1 0 5 (Windows)"><strong>firefox</strong> 1 0 5 (Windows)</A></TD>

Have seen same problem on several different websites.  I suspect it may be linked to a particular bit of "PHP" code, as each site I've seen with this problem does use PHP.  But I'm not so code-saavy.  Any ideas?
