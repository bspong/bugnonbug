Home pages on 2 tabs: "Security Error - Domain Name Mismatch" hangs-up Firefox

I have set two home pages in my preferences (using a '|' to seperate them)
Starting up with multiple homepages (on multiple tabs) hangsup firefox if one of
the tabs (not being the first one) generates an "Security Error - Domain Name
Mismatch" pop-up. It is not possible to select OK,Cancel or Help and therefor
Firefox is completely hung-up. It's even worse after killing Firefox and
re-start-up it happens again: the homepages are opened and the hang-up occurs
again. Only by editing the preferences.js file I can make firefox start-up again.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start up Firefox and make sure it has only one tab open
2. In this first tab open: http://www.dprp.net
3. Open a second tab and open: https://www.tasktoy.com
4. In windows "..not signed by" etc. permanently accept certificate
5. In tools->options change homepage by pressing "use current pages"
   (so home page is now: http://www.dprp.net/|https://www.tasktoy.com/). 
    Press OK
6. Exit firefox
7. Start up Firefox so your new homepages are shown
8. A window "Security Error - Domain Name Mismatch" pops-up. All buttons on this
window are useless.

Firefox hangs.


http://www.dprp.net|https://www.tasktoy.com. On start-up 2 tabs are opened
the one with www.dprp.net is shown. The second tab (containing
https://www.tasktoy.com) is not active. But this second task does make a window
pop-up saying:"Security Error - Domain Name Mismatch". 

It is not possible to select one of the buttons on this window. Therefor Firefox
hangs-up. 
Actual Results:  
Firefox hangs-up. Killing it and restarting it shows the same problem. Only
manually changing preferences.js solves the problem.

A "normal" user can only solve this hangup by creating a new blank user profile!
