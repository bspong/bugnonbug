No cursor / cannot enter text into some text boxes

Problem has been occurring in both 3.5 and after 3.6 update. Existing text in forum text box can be selected, but cursor never appears, and text cannot be deleted (backspace does nothing). On pages with multiple text boxes (Blackboard test for college) focus / cursor stayed in first text box. Was forced to type answers in first box, cut/paste into the rest. Reloading page does nothing; closing the tab and opening a new one changes nothing.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Attempt to reply to a forum post, fill out a Blackboard test, anything using a text input box.

Actual Results:  
1. Randomly, the cursor / focus will not lock onto the text box. No input can be made unless pasted in.

Expected Results:  
I expect to be able to type in any text input box. Not being able to renders Firefox unusable for me, as I require a reliable way of taking online tests for school, and posting in the discussion boards.

I use very few extensions (Adblock Plus and bug489729 1.3, to disable tab dragging) and Plugins (Java Embedding Plugin 0.9.7.2, Quicktime Plug-In 7.6.4, Shockwave Flash 10.0.42). 

Unless I can find a solution, I am forced to use Safari. I cannot take chances with my education. Ironically, this bug report form worked just fine. The lack of consistency makes it difficult to diagnose.
