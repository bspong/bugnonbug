Move throbber to where the URL bar site icon (favicon) is.
Alex, beltzner, and mconnor designed this, I'm summarizing:

* Remove the throbber from its current location on the toolbar.
* Add throbber to where the favicon is in the URL bar.
* The throbber, like the favicon and the URL, is tied to the tab being shown.
* While the page is loading, you see the throbber, and when it finishes you get the favicon. [Just like how the throbber/icon on tabs currently works.]

Why:

* Brings load activity closer to the UI that affects throbbing (eg Stop, enter a URL, forward/back/reload).
* A throbber here is useful for indicating activity as a Places search runs (as you're typing in the field)
* One less icon in the primary UI (favicon is now overloaded, no standalone throbber)

Known nits:

* The "inactive throbber" state ceases to exist. [More precisely, a favicon is shown when the throbber is inactive.] This is highly desirable for integration consistency on OS X.
* The throbber is no longer global, so if the only tab loading is hidden in tab overflow, there's no at-a-glance activity indication.
* The favicon can load before the page is finished loading, but won't be shown until the page finishes loading and the throbber stops. Stalled loads would be the worst example of this.
* This could be perceived as a flashing effect, where navigating within a site causes icon --> throbber --> icon --> throbber --> icon, etc. We already flash a little between the site icon and generic icon, although it can be subtle.
