Steps to reproduce:

Hi, Im not a tech but have been having terrible problems with Flashplayer on Mozilla, windows 7, 32 bit operating system. the 18 version worked for 

me very well, then website insists i update to latest version 23.0.0.181...  blooming dreadful, crash every minute! I went through all the forum 

suggestions and followed recommended directions to little avail.

I finally got things somewhat workable eg. minimal crashes (I dont know how?), and could put up with it.

I have a BUG logged in with Adobe. But no contact or action on it?

NOW that version has been blocked by Mozilla! Which lead me to this BUG LOG. 

So Version 23.0.0.162 is required?

I can download the install file but it opens a blank window with no option to do anything. 

What is going on that the 2 applications are constantly changing and truly getting worse and worse?

There is NO available Flash for me at the moment, I cant see anything that reuires Flash; and I cant get any support from Adobe or Mozilla.  
I am beyond the beyond of being beyond. Can SOMEBODY PLEASE assist me before I slit my own throat in despair! 

Thank you in advance, from my carpet. Distressed and frustrated. NOT resolved. NOT fixed
