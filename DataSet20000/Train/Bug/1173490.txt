Race conditions browser/devtools/markupview/test/browser_markupview_search_01.js
Working through the test ' browser/devtools/markupview/test/browser_markupview_search_01.js', it seems pretty clear that the test has some inbuilt race conditions.

The test itself does a bunch of 'searchUsingSelectorSearch' invocations, waits for an 'inspector-updated'  event, and then ensures that the correct element was selected.  This fails due to races where some unrelated 'inspector-updated' fires (sometimes a 'delayed' one from an earlier set of actions), causing the wait to terminate early, and the check to fail.

The tests can be made to succeed reliably by inserting delays in the appropriate places (in between invoking changes and checking for them).

The test fail reliably on a linux 64-bit debug build of tip (tried on several different revisions over the course of 2 weeks):

This is blocking landing of patches in bug 1167409, because those patches cause these tests to orange on try, but that's incidental (they're just triggering pre-existing races).

Could you look into fixing them?
