right-click on <a href="javascript:..."> and the code is executed as if it was left-click

I've been trying to create some bookmarklets, and the best way I can think of to
present them is to do so as links for people to right-click, and bookmark.  The
problem is, that when you right-click, the code is executed as if it was
left-clicked.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create something like <a
href="javascript:location.href='http://google.com'">link</a>
2. Right-click on the link, as if you wanted to copy-address or add-bookmark
 

Actual Results:  
the code is executed (in the case of the example, you're taken to google)

Expected Results:  
nothing should happen -- I should get a menu as if I was clicking on any other
normal link.

note that the menu does still come up, and I can bookmark or copy the address,
but in the case of something more complex than a location redirect (which can be
a pain in and of itself), it's somewhat of a serious annoyance.
