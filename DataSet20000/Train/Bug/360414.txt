I am going to try to be as detailed as possible but its a very stragne issue.
Ok here goes.  
Whenver I go to websites like www.apple.com or www.ign.com the page is majorily distorted. Someimes the page halfopens, in the sence that you can only see part of it.  With ign.com many of the hyperlinks are invisible.  But what is worse is that the page itself becomes longer becuase much of the content on the webpage is pushed down and moved left. 
This issue is very strange becuase it effects every site differntly.  I think that is becuase of the different design of the page.  AS in how the grasphics are  put up and stuff.  
If you would go to these 2 websites that I mentioned you will notice that they have lots of stuff to click on and look at> its very graphical. ( I cant rememeber the word used to describe stuff like this but I know you need Macromedia Flash or Java to display it)  
Also for some web pages the the way it displays the page changes every time you press the refresh button. as is the case when you go to www.apple.com
Thank you for your time.
