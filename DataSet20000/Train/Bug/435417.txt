Since upgrading to Firefox 3 Release Candidate 1, on several occasions (and on two different PCs) CPU usage has suddenly increased to very high levels after Firefox has been sitting open but idle for 20 minutes or more.  Windows task manager showed that Firefox was using almost all of the CPU resource (up to 100% on one occasion).  Exiting Firefox didn't solve the problem, so I had to kill the Firefox.exe process from the task manager.  No problems if I'm actually using Firefox, and I didn't hit the problem with the beta versions
