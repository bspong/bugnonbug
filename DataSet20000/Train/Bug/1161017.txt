The Reader View promo panel is displayed again if a crash occurred after the user viewed it
Reproducible on:
Nightly 40.0a1 (2015-04-03)

Affected platforms:
Windows 7 (x64), Ubuntu 14.04 (x64)

Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox with a clean profile.
2. Install crashme add-on - http://ted.mielczarek.org/mozilla/crashme.html
3. Open a Reader View compatible page in a new tab, e.g. http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-32574769
4. Close the Reader View promo panel by clicking the [x] button.
5. Wait for a few minutes (at least 2 mins), then crash Firefox using the crash-me add-on.
6. Restore the two tabs that were open before the crash, using session restore.

Expected result:
4. browser.reader.detectedFirstArticle is set to true, once the Reader View promo panel has been shown.
6.a. Both the tabs are successfully restored, following the crash.
6.b. The promo panel is not shown again for the restored, Reader View-compatible page.

Actual result:
Although browser.reader.detectedFirstArticle is indeed set to true, the promo panel is displayed once again for the restored tab.

Additional notes:
* I've waited about 3 mins before crashing Firefox on Ubuntu 14.04 (x64) and the promo panel was shown again for the restored tab.
* I was unable to reproduce this on Mac OS X 10.9.5.
