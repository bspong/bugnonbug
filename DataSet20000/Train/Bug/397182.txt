When I have multiple tabs open in a browser window and I drag that window to the top of the screen then it switches to the tab that my mouse is horizontally aligned with (since vertically the pointer is above the tab in the window title bar because I'm dragging).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a window and create multiple tabs.
2. Grab the window in the title bar, but in an area above a tab that is unselected.
3. Drag the window to the top of the screen, letting your mouse pointer go into menu bar before releasing the button.
Actual Results:  
The tab that was below the mouse pointer selects itself, even though it wasn't clicked in.

Expected Results:  
The current tab should remain selected, since no tabs were clicked on specifically.

This doesn't happen all the time. But when it does happen it is very consistent. It's like you have to get it into the mode and then it fails constantly. But I haven't nailed down what gets it into the mode in the first place.

I use a MacBook and it may be related to dynamically hooking up an external monitor. I mostly see this behavior when I'm using my cinema display. I have been able to reproduce it on the MacBook w/ the trackpad, but I see it *much* more often on the cinema display.

When this happens I usually also experience bug 335608, and so I suspect they may be related.
