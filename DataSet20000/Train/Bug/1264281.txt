Mathjax not working
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0
Build ID: 20160407164938

Steps to reproduce:

I created a new tab and went to 
http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/94886/what-is-the-relationship-between-the-gini-score-and-the-log-likelihood-ratio/95459



Actual results:

mathjax does not display on that site. Moreover, mathjax does not appear in any other stackexchange site that I went to afterward.

When I go to the console, this is the result:
The resource at "https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js" was blocked because tracking protection is enabled.[Learn More] 95459

The resource at "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/beacon.js" was blocked because tracking protection is enabled.[Learn More] 95459
no element found 57d8:1:1
This site makes use of a SHA-1 Certificate; it's recommended you use certificates with signature algorithms that use hash functions stronger than SHA-1.[Learn More] qa.sockets.stackexchange.com
Use of getPreventDefault() is deprecated.  Use defaultPrevented instead. jquery.min.js:3:659

When I looked up what tracking protection is, it says that it is only enabled for private tabs. However, I did not open a private tab.


Expected results:

Was expecting mathjax to work and not stop working on other sites.
