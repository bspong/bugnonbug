I am running my computer at a resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels.  I have a widescreen monitor with the start bar moved to the right hand of the screen.

When the firefox window is set to a shorter width, the double arrow button on the right hand side, which should open a menu of all remaining bookmarks, should appear.  It does this if I only resize slightly.  However, when a firefox window is resized to cover less than about 3/4 of the monitor screen width, This button disappears, and I can't access any bookmarks that are not already visible on the bookmark toolbar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open Mozilla
2.  Resize width of window.
3.  View the fact that the bug has occurred.
Actual Results:  
The double arrow disappeared.  As I continued to minimize it, more bookmarks disappeared, and the arrow button did not reappear.

Expected Results:  
I would expect the arrow to remain, with the bookmarks disappearing from the toolbar and reappearing in the menu that the arrows link to.
