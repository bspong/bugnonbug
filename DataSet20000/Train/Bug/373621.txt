Using our two Groupware (CLE) web applications (BSCW and Sakai), mime type encodings for PDF is set to application/download instead of e.g. application/pdf (only PDFs has been tested). Icons seems wrong as a result and (in BSCW) renaming files can lead to loss of file type due to removal of extension.
