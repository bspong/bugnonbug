I saw the following errors in a new profile on 34.0a1 (2014-08-04) Nightly.

Expected certificate attribute 'issuerName' value incorrect, expected: 'CN=Cybertrust Public SureServer SV CA,O=Cybertrust Inc', got: 'CN=DigiCert High Assurance CA-3,OU=www.digicert.com,O=DigiCert Inc,C=US'.

I think this is referring to the cert of https://telemetry-experiment.cdn.mozilla.net and it definitely is DigiCert instead of Cybertrust.

Any ideas about what's up?
