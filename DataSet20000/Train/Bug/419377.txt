When plugin acroread (Adobe Acrobat) is displaying a pdf file keyboard entry is disabled. Can't do find or page up/down. Only mouse responds on page. Not sure when this stopped working. Loaded newes rpm version of acroread with same result. 
Mouse access continues to work, but for me the biggest problem is that search (ctrl-f) access is disabled. This worked with default version of firefox installed with fedora 8 but at some point the keyboard access in pdf became disabled.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a pdf file into firefox
2.Do crtl-f to search, type into search box, or pg dn with keyboard
3.Nothing happens
Actual Results:  
No keyboard response in pdf file with acroread plugin

Expected Results:  
When crtl-f hit, should allow typing in find box. Or when pg up/dn hit page should scroll

Possibly an acroread bug but tried two version and actually the 1st version worked at least with fedora 8 as originally installed.

Also, possibly a bug in fedora 8?

Also, possibly I should have searched bugs for "pdf" but didn't so sorry if this is a duplicate.
