I've seen two variations on a memory leak in the new browser.

1) When I left for work this morning, my browser was using 62,788 K.  When I returned this evening, it was using approx. 80,500 K.  The browser had been idle, with a single tab open during that time.  The only part of the browser that should have been active is the RSS feed loader.

2) I downloaded a large number of large wallpaper images in separate tabs over a period of a day or two.  The browser was using up to 360,000 K or so.  Close all tabs but one.  Memory is not released.  Memory is only released when the browser is closed.  Similar results occur with every day browsing, even if very large images are not involved.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Record memory usage
1a. Bring up a web page or two.
2. Leave browser idle all day
3. Record memory usage again

or

1. Record memory usage
2. Browse lots of web pages, preferably with lots of distinct images, video, or other large content.  Using tabs seems to make it worse.
3. Close all tabs but one.  Browse to several small web pages, such as google.com, to force the browser to stop caching any larger ones in memory
4. Record memory usage

Actual Results:  
Idle memory increase was about 20,000 K in about 1-2 minutes of actual CPU time (10 hours of real world time).

Active browsing memory increase was up to 360,000 K

Expected Results:  
Memory should be released when a page is not displayed.  An idle browser should not use additional memroy.
