The very interesting part is the following:

Applet Code (in a nutshell)

Applet Java Code(only the relevant part. The applet extends JApplet from which getParameter() is found.)

String name = getParameter("NAME");

if(name == null)
{
name = "default";
}

Scenario:
The above code will work on ALL major browsers and ALSO on firefox 2.X. I simply upgraded my browser and now it does not work. I get a NULL when I call the getParameter("NAME").

I own and manage the above code, so I KNOW that it has not changed. I also have several other params that are passed into the applet, I can access every one of them, it is only the one named "name".
