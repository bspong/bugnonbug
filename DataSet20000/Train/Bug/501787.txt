When I go on Theoi Project, a Greek mythology website which goes by the original Greek spelling of the names of the characters, & lists the Greek alphabet spelling, English alphabet transliteration of that spelling, alternate Latin spelling, & alternate Latin name, of each character, via Firefox, the Greek alphabet letters appear as those English alphabet letters which most resemble the lowercase Greek letters (or in the case where they don't have a letter that resembles them in the English alphabet, what it transliterates to or sounds like).
