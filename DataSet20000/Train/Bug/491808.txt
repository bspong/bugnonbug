crash recovery opens new tab in the popup window

I have two ff window running, one is having multiple tabs while the other is a pop-out window from hulu for viewing the video.
Upon crash (crash id was not recorded somehow), the restored session opens up both windows with a 'bonus' of a new tab in the pop-out window. The new tab is the welcome to firefox or something, the same page that welcomes you to firefox (if I'm not mistaken, feel free to verify which new tab contents shown by using the steps below)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open hulu.com and choose any video that you would like to see
2. Pop-out the video to have it open in a separate ff window
3. Crash/ kill firefox (accidentally with crash or intentionally by killing the firefox from task manager)
4. Try to restore the session and make sure the last open tabs and window(ses) opens
Actual Results:  
There is a new tab opened in the pop-out window that plays hulu's video.

Expected Results:  
The last session should be restored as is, no new tab or new window should present (other than pop up, but I was not running any website with pop-up enabled)

Note:
- I have not disable/ enable any extension yet, but I believe this is a basic behavior that needs some fine tuning
- this bug is not reporting the crash, but more towards having new tab added in the restored session
