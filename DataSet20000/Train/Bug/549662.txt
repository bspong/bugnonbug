Typo when page not found - instead of problem -"Broblem" is reported when above URL is accessed

URL http://bug.oraclecorp.com/pls/bug/webbug_print.show?c_rptno=9437767 is for the bug database of our organization, and since I was not on VPN - it was expected that I get the standard error message "Problem loading page" - Server not found

I was surprised to notice that the Title bar both on the Tab and the browser reported
"B"roblem loading page

I tried accessing other inhouse links like http://files.oraclecorp.com/, there the error message is appropriate "Problem" and not Broblem


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Access through Firefox, link http://bug.oraclecorp.com/pls/bug /webbug_print.show?c_rptno=9437767 or even http://bug.oraclecorp.com/pls/bug/webbug_print.show? (  I guess the question mark character is playing a part) as when removed from link we get the right message
Actual Results:  
Error message on tab and title bar stating
Broblem loading page


Expected Results:  
Error message on tab and title bar stating
Problem loading page
