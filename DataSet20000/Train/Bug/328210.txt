Password-protected page with big javascript app invariably crashes Firefox on Intel iMac OSX 10.4.5.

The web statistics page for Intermedia.net invariably crashes Mac OSX Firefox ("Firefox quit unexpectedly" dialog box appears); Safari is fine with it on the same machine. Microsoft versions of Firefox and IE on laptop PC have no problems. The page is password-protected, uses frames, and seems to have a large javascript application to display results within the initial page.

I just tried using Firefox on my kid's eMac to access the same page - no problem with displaying the page using Firefox (installed within the past month) on eMac.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Try to access page - page never comes up.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Firefox quits

Expected Results:  
Displayed page, as it does in Safari and all PC browsers.

Firefox installed yesterday (02/21/2006) on 20" iMac Intel 2 Gb 256 Mb VRAM. The fact that the page loads fine on Firefox on an eMac (also with OSX 10.4.5) is suspicious...

You may want to collect any other Intel iMac bugs to send to Apple; I'm going to bring it up on their forum.
