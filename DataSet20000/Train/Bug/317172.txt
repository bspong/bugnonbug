Firefox 1.5 RC3 won't maximize it's Windows window when it opens every single time
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051119 Firefox/1.5

Even though the shorcut for Firefox 1.5 is set to maximize its Windows window when it's opened, the browser never seems to listen. Sometimes it maximizes, sometimes it doesn't.  You never know what's going to happen whenever you click on Firefox 1.5's shortcut.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Right-click on the shortcut to Firefox and select "Properties".

2. Modify the shortcut to maximize Firefox's Windows window, then save the setting.

3. Click on the shorcut to Firefox 1.5 to open the browser (If its Windows window isn't maximized, maximize it)   

4. Close the Firefox browser, then open it again via its shortcut to see whether the setting for the Windows window has been retained or not.  If it has, close the browser. If not, maximize, then close it.

5. Repeat steps 4 and 5 as often as necessary to reproduce the problem.
Actual Results:  
Firefox will open sometimes with its Windows window not maximized or completely maximized. The results will be unpredictable.

Expected Results:  
When the shortcut to Firefox is clicked, the program should open with its Windows window fully & totally maximized every single time.

This problem has been plaguing Firefox since the 0.7 version, it should've been fixed a long time ago & it's embarrassing for users to have to deal with.
