In Lotus Domino Web Access 8.01, cannot attach a file to a new message in Firefox 3 (resolved in Firefox 3.5)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090615 Firefox/3.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090615 Firefox/3.5

While in my inbox in Lotus Domino Web Access 8, with Firefox 3, when I create a new message (or reply, or forward a message), the link to attach a file crashes the first time I use it, then becomes inactive.

Also, with Firefox 3.5, the attachment link works fine, but the send button (again, for email), does not. There is no way around it (same problem for Safari 4 by the way). This was already reported, but I include it here as well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login mailbox in Lotus Domino Web Access.
2. Create new message (with a destination address, etc)
3. Attach a file
4. Click send button.
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens when you attach a file (Firefox 3) or when you try to send it (Firefox 3.5). It's weird because the send button works fine in Firefox 3.

Expected Results:  
To be able to attach a file and send email without any glitch with my Lotus Mailbox.

I can't access my university mailbox in any other way than to log in by Lotus Domino. This is irritating for me, but there is no way around it. I use Firefox as my default browser. The only way around the problem is to use Internet Explorer, which I dislike with a passion. So, there is an easy work around, just not with Firefox.

Also, since I installed the 3.5 beta4 version of Firefox, my shortcuts are mixed up between Firefox 3 (which was not removed by the 3.5 installator) and Firefox 3.5. When I click a shortcut (I have one for each version), I never know which version is going to open. I am reluctant to erase the older version because 3.5 is still in beta status.
