the video of flight of the navigator renders nothing more then a black screen

first some error messages upon load,
if you select the option to not want to view the next couple of error messages even the 'start' button doesn't render

f5 -> go through the error messages -> the start button renders

then some titles (white)
the music plays

and then a black screen,
when I scroll forward with the progress bar there is nothing visible except for the black screen, when I wanted to experience anything but a black screen I needed to see the video in stead of the actual thing.
(sorry about the negativity).
