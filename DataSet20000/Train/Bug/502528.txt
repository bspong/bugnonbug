Firefox can display the contents of .ZIP files using its built-in jar: protocol handler.  But Firefox will not offer to view the  contents of .ZIP files or even .jar files.  You have to know to change a URL like
  http://www.skierpage.com/moz_bugs/simple.myarchive
to
  jar:http://www.skierpage.com/moz_bugs/simple.myarchive!/

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Browse to remote .ZIP and .jar files.
http://www.skierpage.com/moz_bugs/ has simple.zip (served as application/zip) and simple.myarchive (served as application/java-archive), which you can view and/or save locally.
2.  Browse to local .ZIP and .jar files.

Actual Results:  
Firefox won't offer to let you view the contents, even if the remote file is served with the "application/java-archive" mime type.

Expected Results:  
When you click on a ZIP archive, Firefox should offer to "View archive contents in Firefox" and use its existing jar: protocol handler and jar:<URL>!/ trick to show you the contents.

To view the contents of remote files served as application/zip using the jar:<URL>!/ trick, you have to change network.jar.open-unsafe-types to true in about:config.  I don't know if this should apply if you explicitly choose the new "View archive contents in Firefox" option that I am proposing.

When you save locally, you can always use the jar: trick regardless of extension without needing to change about:config; e.g. if you save a ZIP file as simple.blah in /tmp, then
 jar:file:///tmp/simple.blah!/
works. However, a general "View this file in Firefox as if it were [text/XML/ZIP archive/HTML/OGG]" capability seems like a separate bug.
