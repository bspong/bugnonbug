Update Screenshots to version 19.1.0 (JPEG support)
We're going to be doing some smaller patches with the intention to uplift to 57.

This export adds support for generating JPEGs. For some Full Page captures (especially of image-heavy pages) the size of the screenshot files is very large and overall performance is problematic. By using JPEGs for large sites we avoid these cases.

Commits/changelog:

* Bug fix for https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3513, create proper extension for downloads (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3543)
  The clip object is used to inform the download filename, so we need to add a clip before generating the filename (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/145a456)
* Remove bad console.log statement (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/200f93d)
* Upload jpeg https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3513
  - Start https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/220 , allow JPEG uploads, and respect content-type for JPEG or PNG
  - use JPEG for large shots
  - Allows JPEGs on the server, both to pass content checks, and to make use of stored content-types (instead of assuming image/png).
  - Puts an clip.image.type into shot objects
  - Uses .jpg for filenames when appropriate
  - Adds a new buildSetting for controlling the cutoff when we use JPEG
  - If a PNG image is too large, tries to make a JPEG and substitutes if the JPEG is actually smaller
  - Refactor some data:-URL and blob converstion functions into their own module.
