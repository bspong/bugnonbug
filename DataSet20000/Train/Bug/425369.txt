Firefox. Update 2.0.0.13 Error Message Download Failed, Update File corrupt.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080201 Firefox/2.0.0.12

Currently using Firefox version 2.0.0.12. In options Updater was set to auto download and install. Update/Downloader installed update file. firefox required a restart and upon opening an "Alert" was received stating. Type Error: AVG_DTFox.prefs have no properties.

I attempted then to use the add remove facility to uninstall Firefox and received a further error message saying that the Uninstaller was corrupt and to contact the owner for a new version. I was unable to uninstall the updated firefox (Version 2.0.0.13)

I went to my downloaded files opened Firefox 2.0.0.12 and re installed that version over 2.0.0.13 the alert screen dissappeared and firefox opened normally.

I have downloaded version 2.0.0.13 manually and the auto updater has also done this on two occasions on each attempt the result has beenthe same the "Alert" appears and I am unable to uninstall through the Add Remove function in XP (Home SP2)

I have since disabled the auto update feature to prevent it auto updating and have the preferences set to " Ask me what i want to do" when updates are found.

I am assuming that the Alert Type Error: AVG_DTFox.prefs have no properties. is a reference to my AVG Anti virus and Firewall I am running AVG Pro Version 8.0.87 and have not previously encountered any issues with AVG and Firefox updates conflicting.    

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download Firefox 2.0.0.13
2.Allow it to Install 
3.Alert Appears
4.Uninstall fails 


Expected Results:  
Update should have occurred without any problems.
