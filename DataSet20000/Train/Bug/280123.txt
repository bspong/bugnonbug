I encounter this problem intermittently and cannot reproduce it.

When I move bookmarks up or down in the right-hand window, they often wind up in
an unexpected place in the menu, and are sometimes deleted.  This seems to be
more likely when the bookmark is a folder.

It seems to be safe to reposition a bookmark by moving it into a folder in the
tree view window.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Move bookmarks randomly withinin the bookmark window in an attempt to change
their position in the bookmark dropdown menu.  Move folders up and down, and do
the same for ordinary bookmarks.
Actual Results:  
Bookmarks will often not move to the target marked by the horizontal line
cursor.  If they do move there, the position on the dropdown will not always
correspond to the position in the bookmark window.

Bookmark sometimes disappear from the window, and from the bookmark file.

Expected Results:  
Move the bookmark to the point shown by the target cursor, or refuse to do anything.
