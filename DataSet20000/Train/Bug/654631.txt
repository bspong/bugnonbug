"Extraction Failed, File is corrupt." after download and attempted install
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.16) Gecko/20110319 Firefox/3.6.16
Build Identifier: Firefox/4

Downloaded FF4 to a save folder then attempted to install over FF3.6.16; it initiated and terminated giving the error message "Extraction Failed, File is corrupt."  Attempted twice, the second time after rebooting thinking that might solve it, no chance.  Deleted the download and tried to download a fresh copy, it would not download; tried rebooting, it still would not download.  Posted a question in the Support Forum on 04/28 with no answer as of 05/03 and can't find the damned question in that miserable "support forum".  After some 4 or 5 years with Firefox I'm about to trash it and move to IE9 where at least I can find things when I search, though it may take a while!  Your Support Forun format sucks big time, your "wonderful" Firefox 4 doesn't work and FF3.6.16 is slower than IE9. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. download
2. click to install, or
3. try to download and it won't!

Actual Results:
