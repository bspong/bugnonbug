Secondary browser pages NEVER display preview Images
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

I did browse several pages of previous errors but no ones appeared to the same as this one. (Similiar to Bug 582465 - but different) 

When I browse from either the Mozilla or basic google web pages and click on either videos of Images i get blank placeholders displayed instead of the previews. This is totally reproduceable. I un-installed and re-installed firefox and the problem persisted. I loaded firefox in Safe mode with the add ons disabled and the problem still persists. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type www.google.com 
2. type "mouse"
3. Click on Images
Actual Results:  
The top line which appears to be an ad correct displays images.
The remainder of the lines approx 16 pages or preview images are displayed as blank grey boxes.
- MSN search engine displays correctly
- ASK search engine displays correctly
This was preformed in safemode with all the add on and plugins disabled

Expected Results:  
Each 'grey box' should have an image from a different website.

Examining the logs of various other similiar issues this appears to reoccur to different degrees. Not sure but if the problem is affecting numerous other users at my level this could seriously impact firefox's market position.
