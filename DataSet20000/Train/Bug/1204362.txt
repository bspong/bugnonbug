video 1 - Mouse cursor is blinking between 'default' and 'text' when I move mouse from text or input or textarea to transparent part of popup menu.webm

STR:   (Win7_64, Nightly 43, 32bit, ID 20150910030225, new profile, safe mode)
1. Open this "data:" url or just click URL in the form above
>   data:text/html,<body style="opacity:0;" onload="var s='';for(i=0;i<9999;i++)s+='L ';document.body.innerHTML=s;">
2. Open devtools->Inspector, open sidebar in Inspector, make it [sidebar] as wide as possible (but so that (ev) button near <html> still was visible)
3. Click that (ev) button   [that'll open event listeners tooltip]
4. Select tab "Rules" in the sidebar.
5. Place mouse over filter field in that tab. Make sure that cursor is "cursor:text;"
6. Move mouse to the transparent part of tooltip from Step 3   (To make it clear: tooltip is a rectangle containing the arrow (triangle at the bottom of tooltip) and actual content in inner rectangle with rounded borders. So there's transparent area)
7. Move mouse within that transparent area.

Result:       cursor is blinking between "default" and "text"
Expectations: If cursor is moving above transparent area of tooltip, it should have a state determined by a visible element placed directly under the mouse cursor. 

Notes:
1) This doesn't happen only in devtools. Similar STR causes the bug for australis popups (see video 2). Note that on my videos cursor is invisible when it is "cursor:text". Sorry for that, but it's still easy to see what's going on there, having my STR.
2) Please let me know if you managed to reproduce this OR if you think that STR isn't clear

3) This is very similar to bug 1204350
