Easy rebranding
(Per bz) There should be a build switch to change the appname from "Firefox" to
something else, replacing *all* user-visible and user-relevant instances of the
name, including artwork, UI, filename, installer, maybe profile, maybe mechanics
(DDE etc.).

To be changed (not complete):
- There is already a switch to change the profile location, but IIRC it didn't
work (in all cases?).
- other-licenses/branding/firefox/
- other places with artwork?
- installer has the name hardcoded all over the config files
- xremote, DDE etc.
- brand.dtd, brand.properties, region.properties
- makefiles (filename)
- Windows resources: /browser/app/module.ver, /browser/app/splash.rc,
  /browser/app/firefox.exe.manifest
- Profile migration
- help (all over)
- /browser/components/shell/src/nsWindowsShellService.cpp, line 185 -- #define
EXE "firefox.exe"
