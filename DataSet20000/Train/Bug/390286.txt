When a select box has enough options to cause a scroll bar to appear and the width of the select box is set (style="width:200px;", say) and the user is using the arrow keys to scroll down the list, when the selected option reaches past the last visible option in the list, the select box repaints itself and the visible options only show the top of the list.  This behavior is not seen when the width of the box is NOT set.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a select box with enough options to cause scrolling
2. Set the width of the select box using a style (inline, linked, etc.)
3. Load the page and use the mouse to drop down the list of options
4. Use the arrow keys to scroll down the list of options
5. Scroll past the last visible option and the select box will repaint itself
Actual Results:  
The scroll bar does not scroll properly when using the arrow keys and the selected option within the list of options is hidden, though the selected option appears in the actual select box.

Expected Results:  
The scroll bar should move and the selected option should be visible in the list

At first we thought the select box was mis-behaving when we were using optgroup syntax, but we seen discovered that it affects every select box where we set the width of the box using a style sheet and use the arrow keys to scroll through the list of options.

I have a test document that quite simply shows the problem, but I see no way of uploading it, but you can see this issue on many web sites.
