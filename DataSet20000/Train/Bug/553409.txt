No Java working on SuseLinux 11.1 and Firefox 3.6
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6

I got the latest version of Firefox (6.3) which I had better denied.
Since that moment I do not get Java (twi versions tried) running.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.New ff ver. 6.3 came in, updated in /home/user as usual because /usr/lib/firefox doesn't work as shown on the website
2.Java, newly installed, with ln -s to the plugin path of ff looked OK
3.Firefox doesn't work on Java, shows missing software.
Actual Results:  
I also copied the installation to /usr/lib/firefox with the result that the older version in there is no more of use. So none of the versions act on Java.
I tried an older ver. of Java (1.6.0_10 and 1.6.0_18) and nothing happened. The links looked perfect, some 57 bytes, but with lots of content

Expected Results:  
I'm without Java on my most important OS. That's what I clearly did not expect.
After having studied the information of Java again and again with ns7 AND ns7-gcc29.

I do expect the installation of firefox easier, e. g. with rpm

It should have found the proper link in the plugin path.

Not even the Java Console was to be installed. A message told me the console would be uninstalled with next shutdown of firefox.

How can I stop the lousy show?
How can I install firefox with Yast? rpm is easily installed.

Fellows, get me out of that situation!

Thanks
