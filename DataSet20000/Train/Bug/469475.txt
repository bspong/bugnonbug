Start up the app but no window appears.  Look at the task manager and it doesn't appear.  Look at the processes and FF does appear and using 30-35mb of memory.  Kill the process and start up again, no luck but process is running again.  There is no indication of the window any where in the screen or on the task bar at the bottom.  Since there is now window, the only indication is the process is running in process manager.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start up app
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
expect window to appear

Expected Results:  
no window appears

This problem is periodic and I'm not sure how to reproduce it.  However when it does appear it is repeatable and I cannot get FF going until I restart the machine.  The only thing I can associate it with is if I have connection problems and have to restart FF but even this I'm not certain about.  I've been seeing this issue for at least a year but didn't report it.  Might happen every few weeks.

Given that I can't tell you how to reproduce it, what should I do on my side to document this when it does occur next time?
