1. After booting up, I usually have at least three firefox.exe entries in the task manager without an open browser:

2. When starting firefox, I always get three tabs:
my "homepage" page, the "thank you for using noscript" page & the "firefox is now updated" page

3. The Ultimate Troubleshooter shows the same thing:

4. I cannot change the theme / addons work fine (the themes & addons I have are compatible with 3.x)

None of this started until I upgraded to 3.x !

=======================================
* NOTE - I only have one browser open ! 
=======================================

Reproducible: Always

3. I cannot change the theme
Actual Results:  
1. Multiple firefox.exe entries in Task Manager
2. Three page tabs appear - my "homepage" page, the "thank you for using noscript" page & the "firefox is now updated" page
