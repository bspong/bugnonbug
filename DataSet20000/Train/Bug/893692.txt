The continue/stepping buttons in the debugger are very confusing when paused
I recently attended a Firefox OS hackathon and there were people making apps. Of those, around 20 or so played used the debugger.

There was extreme general confusion as to what the "play" button does. Almost everyone thought that it "runs code". So their workflow using the debugger was:
1. Add some breakpoints
2. Click the play button and expect the code to run in a way that results in those breakpoints being hit
3. Get confused
4. Start clicking on the page and get more confused and blaming Firefox for becoming unresponsive

What was actually happening:
1. Breakpoints were added
2. Debuggee was paused
3. People got confused as to
3.1. Why didn't the "code run?"
3.2. Why does interacting with the debuggee (clicking etc.) not work anymore

We used to have bug 766051 for the "play" button state being confusing, but I assert that the button itself, not only the pressed/unpressed state is being confusing. Moreover, it seems like the stepping buttons are also pretty useless while the debuggee is not paused, so it sounds to me like there are the following ways that we can (and really, really should!) alleviate the issue:

1. Hide the pause/stepping buttons while the debuggee is not paused
2. Disable them while the debuggee is not paused
3. Hide only the play button
4. Use a different icon (pause) and remove the checked state for the resume button

I think a combination of 2 and 4 is what we need. Hell, even just doing 2 would still be okay. In any case, we really need to do something about this because it looked like almost nobody was able to use our debugger because they were pausing the debuggee before getting a chance to do anything else :)

Panos what do you think about it?
