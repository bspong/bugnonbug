FeedWriter doesn't work with handlers with chrome:// URI (throws exception when downloading favicon)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1

I haven't tested the bug with an http:// uri, so it might only apply to chrome:// uri's.

Using a chrome:// uri for a feed handler causes Firefox to throw the following two exceptions when viewing a preview of a feed: -

Error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004003 (NS_ERROR_INVALID_POINTER) [nsIIOService.newChannelFromURI]" nsresult: "0x80004003 (NS_ERROR_INVALID_POINTER)" location: "JS frame :: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox/components/FeedWriter.js :: iconDataURIGenerator :: line 992" data: no]
Source File: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox/components/FeedWriter.js
Line: 992

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004003 (NS_ERROR_INVALID_POINTER) [nsIIOService.newChannelFromURI]" nsresult: "0x80004003 (NS_ERROR_INVALID_POINTER)" location: "JS frame :: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox/components/FeedWriter.js :: iconDataURIGenerator :: line 992" data: no]

The uncaught exceptions also cause the preview page to not work correctly. Also, the Tools>Options>Feeds page behaves strangely, refusing to allow the user to select the chrome feed handler from the list.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. There might be an easier way to reproduce the bug but I've no idea how to do that.
2. Install the Wizz RSS News Reader extension for Firefox (AMO ID - 424).
3. Add a new feed handler by adding the following lines in about:config: -

browser.contentHandlers.types.6.title - Wizz RSS News Reader
browser.contentHandlers.types.6.type - application/vnd.mozilla.maybe.feed
browser.contentHandlers.types.6.uri - chrome://wizzrss/content/addfeed.xul?url=%s

4. Try to select Wizz RSS News Reader (Subscribe to feed using) on the Tools>Options>Feeds page.
5. Try to preview a feed.
Actual Results:  
Preview page doesn't work. See screen shot here: -

Tools>Options>Feeds page doesn't work as it should.

Expected Results:  
The preview page should work normally and the Tools>Options>Feeds page should work normally.
