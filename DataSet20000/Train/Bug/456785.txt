Hotmail error: "Warning - Upgrade your web browser" on page click

Since updating to Firefox 3, I encounter this "Warning - Upgrade your browser" page at least once a day in Hotmail. The full error is below. Most of the time it works fine, and when I do get the error, I can hit the back button, press whatever link I went to that errored, and it works fine. I do have the IETab add-on installed, so I'm not sure if, although I'm in Firefox mode, that the hotmail site is reading the browser information incorrectly. The page doesn't say what it thinks the browser is, unfortunately.

If you don’t want to upgrade right now you can still continue to Windows Live Hotmail, but some parts of it may not work and it may not be displayed properly.
