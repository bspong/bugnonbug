I have noticed this on several different web sites since updating yesterday, 4-23-09.  When hovering over an <a> with a CSS hover attribute the mouse point flips back and forth between the pointer and hand leaving you unable to do anything on the page.  Note it does not seem to do on all CSS hovers.  Example: http://www.mishawakacity.com/electricpermits.asp then hover over "Building" in the middle of the page. try it a few times then it happens.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to page: http://www.mishawakacity.com/electricpermits.asp
2. Hover over the "Building" a few times
Actual Results:  
Mouse pointer is stuck in loop between pointer and hand and you can no longer click on anything.

Expected Results:  
A normal hover.

I have the following addons installed:
ColorZilla 2.0.2
Firebug 1.3.3
FireFTP 1.0.4
PDF Download 2.1.0.2
Seo Toolbar 1.0.8
Web Developer 1.1.6

- Note with the header to the left of the text boxes and the helper questions below the text boxes seem a little confusing on the bug report page which one goes where.
