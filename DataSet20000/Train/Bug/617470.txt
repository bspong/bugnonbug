Firefox menu  has got duplicate "New Tab" options to open a new tab
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/8.0.552.215 Safari/534.10
Build Identifier: Mozilla Firefox 4.0 Beta 7

When I click on "Firefox" menu (Which is present at the upper left most corner of the mozilla firefox web page), I get an option " New Tab" which opens a new tab in the same window of the mozilla browser. 

However that "New tab" option has got a sub-menu which again has the option named as " New Tab" which again opens a new tab in same window. 

That means the "Firefox" menu has duplicate "New Tab" options. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a Mozilla Firefox Browser ( Mozilla Firefox 4.0 Beta 7 version)
2. Click on "Firefox" menu.


Actual Results:  
"Firefox" menu (Which is present at the upper left most corner of the mozilla firefox web page) has an option named as " New Tab" which opens a new tab and the "New Tab" option has got a sub menu which has got the duplicate option " New Tab" which again opens a new tab in same window.

Expected Results:  
"Firefox" menu can have an option as " New" after clicking on which you will get a sub menu displaying options such as " New tab", "New Window" etc.
