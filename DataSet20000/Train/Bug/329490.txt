After bookmarking the JavaScript "Shell" bookmarklet provided at http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/webdevel.html (which works fine), one can not edit the properties of said bookmark. Attemping to open the properties dialog in the bookmark-manager results in either
a) complete lock-up of Firefox or
b) sometimes the application even crashes.

This bug was only reproducible with the JS shell bookmarklet, but not with other bookmarklets from said website.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to: http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/webdevel.html
2. Bookmark the "shell" bookmarklet (bookmark method doesn't sem to matter)
3. Open bookmark-manager
4. locate "shell" bookmarklet
5. Attempt to open properties dialog for the bookmarklet

Actual Results:  
Firefox locks up completely, sometimes even crashes immediately.

Expected Results:  
The bookmarklet's properties dialog is shown.

My original goal was to assign a keyword to the bookmarklet, and in an attempt to work around this bug I tried to manually assign a keyword (SHORTCUTURL) to the bookmarklet by modifying bookmarks.html. However, when I try to use the bookmark keyword in the location-bar, Firefox crashes everytime. 

Also tested with an empty firefox profile, with same results.
