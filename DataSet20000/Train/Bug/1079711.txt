New syncing tool introduces major security flaw
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:32.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/32.0
Build ID: 20140923175406

Steps to reproduce:

Enable device syncing.

Once enabled across your devices it only takes one device to fall in to the wrong hands for a mere few minutes or for a hacker to gain access to your computer via other means.

Once they have access to your machine they can get access to your master password file and extract the mozilla syncing account password

Once they have done that they can set up a device on your account that forevemore syncs to your account and thus learn all your passwords when they are changed what sites you vsit and all the other data the syncing tool shares accross devices

syncing should be disabled until this major design fault is rectified.

It is even possible for a user to setup syncing without the target knowing its in operation and therefore track them.

Lots of terrorist states such as the USA would love this.


Actual results:

Reveals passwords and browsing history to 3rd party. Allows for ongoing tracking of a user details


Expected results:

Syncing should never have been deployed in such a way as it forces a user to disable the master password.
