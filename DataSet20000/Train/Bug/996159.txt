Sync panel is still not entirely displayed in some localized builds
Created attachment 8406345
Slovak Central Win7 build 20140413030203

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #982615 +++

Disconnect button is still cut on Windows 7 and 8.1 in the Slovak build (and possibly others), probably repros on all platforms.

I have managed to workaround this by shortening the
      signedInLoginFailure.beforename.label
in the following block of
      http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/7b6905940e9a/browser/components/preferences/sync.xul

              <hbox flex="1">
                 <description>
                   &signedInLoginFailure.beforename.label;
                   <span id="fxaEmailAddress3"></span>
                   &signedInLoginFailure.aftername.label;
                 </description>
                ...
              </hbox>

Since it's a workaround let's try to fix the root cause here instead.

As per bug 982615 comment 20 we may need to revisit also the following:
               <!-- logged in to an unverified account -->
              <hbox flex="1">
                <description>
                  &signedInUnverified.beforename.label;
                  <span id="fxaEmailAddress2"></span>
                  &signedInUnverified.aftername.label;
                </description>
                ...
              </hbox>
