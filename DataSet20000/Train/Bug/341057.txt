Tab bar when text is dropped onto it does perform check to see whehther the test looks like URL and if it is, it does open it in (new) tab. The same works for location bar.

But that doesn't work, when DnD text onto Downloads button. DnDing URL opens Download manager and starts download of DnDed URL. But DnDing of text does nothing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. (Skip the step if Downloads button is already in toolbar) right click on toolbar and select customize. DnD "Downloads" button anywhere on toolbar. Close Customize sheet.
2. Open any page. DnD any link from it on "Downloads" button. Notice it works.
3. Open any page. DnD any link from it on Tab bar. Notice it works.
4. Open page with inlined URL. Select URL and DnD it on tab bar. Notice it works.
5. Open page with inlined URL. Select URL and DnD it into location bar. Notice it works.
6. Open page with inlined URL. Select URL and DnD it onto "Downloads" button. Notice it does NOT work.
Actual Results:  
In step 6 nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
Download manager starts downloading the URL.

P.S. Ironicaly, since there is no workaround for the problem (impossible to download inlined link/plain text URL, see bug 62253, (dup) bug 326649, etc) i have to keep the problem at "normal" severity :-/
