When quitting Firefox before all pages have loaded, session saving forgets pages that weren't loaded

When starting Firefox with setting "When Firefox starts: Show my windows and tabs from last time" and then closing before all pages have been completely loaded or possibly some haven't even started to render, some of the unloaded pages are lost. Having a slow connection and lots of pages makes this happen very often.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use browser setting When Firefox starts: Show my windows and tabs from last
time
2. Browse and open tabs you'd like to keep open, let's say 30 tabs for example
3. Close browser
4. Start browser
5. Close browser before all pages have been completely loaded or especially before some pages haven't even started to render
6. Start browser again
Actual Results:  
Some of the 30 tabs that weren't loaded before the browser was closed are now opened as about:blank.

Expected Results:  
All 30 tabs would have been opened properly, so that the address for not a single tab would be lost and browsing could be continued just as expected.

This bug has been in Firefox since 2.0 betas, so it's not caused by any newly-made code.

The Camino implementation of session manager suffers from the same problem. See  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=361092.
