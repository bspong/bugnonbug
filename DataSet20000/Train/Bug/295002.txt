Dreamweaver will not respond during startup if Firefox is running.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

I have been having severe problems since I installed 10.4. Most of all,
Dreamweaver when started will not fully open and quits responding soon after and
must be forced quit. I discovered today while waiting on hold for AppleCare
Support the problem is if Firefox is running while the startup attempt is made.
If Firefox is not running, DW operates just fine. If Firefox is running, DW is
more apt to crash. 

I was also having problems with the operation of Entourage 2004, but have
changed back to version X.x and am no longer experencing problems and can not
test it with Firefox.

I was blaming Tiger, but since this revelation I am reexamining this conviction
and am looking at Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have FireFox running,
2. Start Dreamweaver.
3. View Dreamweaver not responding in the Force Quit Panel.
4. Quit Firefox
5. Start DW
6. All is fine.
Actual Results:  
Firefox on, DW not.
Firefox off, DW fine.

Expected Results:  
Firefox on, DW on. No conflict.
