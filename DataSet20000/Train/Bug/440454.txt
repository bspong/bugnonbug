setTimeout execution sequence is out of order

I have a for loop that calls setTimeout a number of times with an increasing time interval. The setTimeout function calls another method that sets the opacity for an image. I pass in the opacity as a parameter. The function basically fades in/out an image. It seems that the sequence of setTimeout calls does not respect the time parameter sometimes and causes the setTimeout call to execute out of order. For example, I make the following sequence of calls

setTimeout('changeOpacity(0)', 100);
setTimeout('changeOpacity(10)', 150);
setTimeout('changeOpacity(20)', 200);
setTimeout('changeOpacity(30)', 250);
setTimeout('changeOpacity(40)', 300);
setTimeout('changeOpacity(50)', 350);

changeOpacity would not be guaranteed to be called with the same sequence later on. For example changeOpacity(30) might get called after changeOpacity(40). 

This used to work in Firefox2. Check out the URL. Make sure to click the Forward button in the navigation panel multiple times. Notice how sometimes the image transition is choppy


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on the navigation panel forward button
2. Notice how the images fade out/in
3. Sometimes the image transition is choppy
Actual Results:  
Image fade out/in is sometimes choppy

Expected Results:  
Image fade out/in should be smooth

Take a look at the opacity(...) function in scripts/javascript.js file
