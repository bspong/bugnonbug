Many website's favicons no longer show up in 3.6's Bookmarks or Tabs!

Ever since downloading 3.6, many of my favicons in Bookmarks have disappeared--to be replaced by the "blank page" icon (originally, NONE had favicons, until I started opening websites)!  When opening many websites that have favicons, they will then reload the favicon in Bookmarks, but--on many of them--including many of your OWN websites with favicons (see http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/ for example), they won't, no matter how I change my settings!  In addition, many websites that formerly HAD favicons on their tabs no longer do in Firefox (see https://www.charter.com/order/login.aspx for example).  Thus, many favicons have begun to disappear BOTH from Bookmarks AND from Tabs!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open tab with favicon.
2. Favicon will not show-up in Bookmarks in MANY cases--but not all.

1A. Open tab that used to have a favicon but no longer does in 3.6, and it remains without a favicon in Bookmarks.
Actual Results:  
Many favicons that used to appear both in Bookmarks and/or Tabs have disappeared.

Expected Results:  
Websites with favicons should have their favicons appear in Bookmarks.  Websites that formerly had favicons--but now don't--in Tabs should STILL have them.
