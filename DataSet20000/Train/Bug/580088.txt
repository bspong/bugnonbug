Hello,
I apologise upfront for the lack of decisive information.

Something is wrong with Firefox 3.6.6. I have four different computers running XP and Windows 7, both at work and home (therefore builds are completely unrelated) and have noted the same faults. Friends and colleagues have noted the same fault and searching the internet it seems lots of other people have too. Even at the Firefox forum.

Basically, it crashes. A lot. 

Of all the times it crashes, it is due to Flash video about 70% of the time. I have tried upgrading Flash, tried modifying settings, updating adobe, etc. I have reverted to a 3.5 branch and it is fine.

The other issues are:
1. Other random crashes not Flash linked
2. 'well this is embarrassing' messages appearing when simply switching between tabs
3. Ridiculously slow startup, even compared to the previous revision

I and my friends/colleagues have had to either roll back a version or move onto another browser.

Please address this or you'll find a lot more people leaving.


Reproducible: Always
