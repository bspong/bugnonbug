When you choose to restore bookmarks from a bookmarks backup, it displays and lets you to select only files that have a particular extension, html.

You should be able to choose to display and select files that are not html. Although naming the files *.html is the normal way, and a good default to have, why shouldn't you be able to name your backups however you'd like?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the Library via Organize Bookmarks in the Bookmarks menu
2.From Import and Backup, choose Restore --> Choose file.
3.A dialogue pops up, and it (sensibly) displays files with the suffix .html in selected directories
4.There is a box that allows you to choose what types of file are shown, but it less sensibly allows only one choice, html.
Actual Results:  
You can't choose your bookmarks backup if it is not named *.html

Expected Results:  
Allow you to choose a backup with any kind of name or suffix.

The workaround is to rename your files as needed.
