See http://www.google.com/search?q=babbo&hl=ar and look at the text that follows the plus icon in the first search result.  Logically, this text is <arabic translation of 'Map of'> 110 Waverly pl, New York, NY 10011.  BEcause there is no &lrml between the Arabic and the number, it should render as:

   Waverly pl, New York, NY 10011 110 <arabic> [+]

and if you watch as you load the page, this is indeed what happens initially; but then it rearranges to

   verly pl, New York, NY 10011 a0 W11 <arabic> [+]

I tried to reproduce this as a static example, but the bug doesn't appear.  

If I add an &lrm; before and after the address, then I get a different incorrect version:

  10 Waverly pl, New York, NY 100011 <arabic> [+]

One character is still displaced after the initial rendering.  Note: You may see this version when you access the URL above, as I am going to push a change that adds the &lrm;, since that makes the text render correctly in IE.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to this URL in Firefox on Win/XP or Linux (at least)
Actual Results:  
Text renders correctly and then rearranges to the incorrect version.

Expected Results:
