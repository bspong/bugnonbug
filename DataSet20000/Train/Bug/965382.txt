Intermittent loss of tabbar functionality with middle-clicking links
I've been seeing this for awhile now, but haven't had any good STR. Talking to Gijs on IRC, it sounds like he's seen similar issues from time to time.

Every now and then (unpredictably), when I middle-click a link to open in a new tab, nothing happens on the tab bar and from then on, the tab bar is "frozen". I can click on and switch to different tabs, but the focus doesn't change. If I close a tab via Ctrl+W, the tab bar remains frozen and clicking on the remaining tabs becomes unpredictable with respect to what it'll switch to.

It only affects the one active window (I'm often running two windows on different screens and the other is unaffected). The only way to fix it is to restart the browser. I have 5 pinned tabs in case it matters. I have new tabs opened from links set to open in the background.

Gijs also had me get a little output from the console when it's in this state:

TypeError: this.selectedItem is null @ tabbrowser.xml:3386
TypeError: this.mCurrentBrowser is null @ tabbrowser.xml:2764

gBrowser.selectedTab
XULElement {owner: null, linkedBrowser: XULElement, _tPos: 7, _animStartTime: 0, _fullyOpen: true, tmp: Object, _selected: true, _endRemoveArgs: null, className: "tabbrowser-tab", align: ""}

gBrowser.selectedBrowser
null
