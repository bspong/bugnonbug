Build ID: 20151029151421

Steps to reproduce:

I put userChrome.css and net45.ico into the profile/chrome folder.
With the menu and bookmarks bar both visible, I clicked on the folder I previously placed on the bookmarks bar. Alternatively, I opened the drop-down menu on the bookmarks menu.


.css file:
@namespace url("http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul");
 
#tabbrowser-tabs .tab-icon-image:not(src),
.sidebar-placesTreechildren::-moz-tree-image(leaf),
.bookmark-item:not(src):not([container]):not([type]):not([folder]){
 list-style-image: url("net45.ico") !important;
 -moz-image-region: rect(0px,16px,16px,0px) !important;
}

.bookmark-item:not(src):not([container]) {
	list-style-image:URL("net45.ico")!important;}

treechildren::-moz-tree-image(leaf) {
	list-style-image:url("net45.ico")!important;-moz-image-region:auto!important; }



Actual results:

AFTER FF version 42, (e.g. 43,44,45,46) I see a brand new icon served as the default bookmark icon. My customization is ignored.


Expected results:

I should have seen net45.ico instead of the new default bookmark icon in the two places I mentioned. The actual, full Bookmarks>Show All Bookmarks menu command appears largely unaffected by the new bug since net45.ico IS displayed as expected, although the icons in the Tags and Location columns are oversized
