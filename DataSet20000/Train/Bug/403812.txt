Bad encoding of accented (IDN) domains when accessed from History in menu bar

Most recent history entries accessed with the History menu from the menu bar do not store IDN domains correctly. Those are domain names with accented letters. The URL shows scrambled letters, and doesn't bring back to the original visited page, but to a "Server not found" error page.

Accessing the same history entries with the back button on the toolbar, or the menu next to the back button (the little down arrow) works fine however.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a domain with accented letters, say http://www.öpfl.ch/ (note the 2 dots above the o)
2. Go to any other page, on another domain, say http://www.mozilla.org/
3. In the History menu in the menu bar, select the first entry (öpfl.ch)
Actual Results:  
URL shows http://www.ã¶pfl.ch/ (that's an accented a and a paragraph character, in place of the accented o), with a "Server not found" error page.

Expected Results:  
http://www.öpfl.ch/ as URL, with corresponding web page displayed.
