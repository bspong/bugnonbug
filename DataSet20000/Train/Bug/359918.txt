Upon encountering certain (not all) Flash content, under Firefox 2.0 and Adobe Flash 9, a bug occurs which freezes mouse scroll functions, changing tabs with the mouse, closing firefox, and other operations. It does not seem to happen on Linux under same conditions, though. Keyboard shortcuts recover quicker from the bug, while mouse clicks have no effect on any buttons. The freeze can last about a minute or even longer.

This doesn't happen with all flash content, but amazon search (as of 11/8/06) triggers the bug consistently. Thus far, other sites trigger the bug sporadically.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch firefox (optional: launch various tabs, to test tab freeze bug)
2. Access amazon.com and do a search on any topic.
3. attempt to scroll down using the mouse wheel or the third mouse button. attempt to change tabs with mouse click. attempt other functions.

Actual Results:  
Scroll functions using mouse don't work. Switching tabs with mouse doesn't work either. Other button presses also fail.

Expected Results:  
All functions should work properly, few seconds after loading the webpage.

No other extensions were enabled. Bug does not occur on Minefield 3.0a1 under same conditions. Still, it must be very annoying for Firefox 2.0 users
