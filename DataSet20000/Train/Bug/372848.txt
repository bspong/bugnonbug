Firefox can't find the server at www.%1.com. (CDROM Autorun Issue w/ Firefox 2.0)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20070219 Firefox/2.0.0.2

When inserting a CDROM Firefox is automatically launched but the index.htm on the disk is not displayed. Instead, Firefox displays an error dialog with the message:
"Firefox can't find the server at www.%1.com."

This CD worked fine with my previous version of Firefox, which I believe was 1.5, but I was using the latest available prior to 2.0.xx

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Insert CDROM
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Firefox display an HTML page titled "Problem loading page" and the HTML page displayed shows:
Server not found
Firefox can't find the server at www.%1.com.
(Three bullets w/ text)
Try Again


Expected Results:  
Firefox should display the HTML page.

Tested w/ IE 6.0 and it worked fine.

The CDROM's root folder looks like this:
autorun.inf
cdstart.exe
index.htm
README.txt

The autorun.inf contains:
[AUTORUN]
open=cdstart.exe index.htm

I didn't create cdstart.exe so I don't know how it was created but can send you it if desired.
