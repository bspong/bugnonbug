Tried to load the Popular page (left hand link) at www.grooveshark.com (which claims to now be using HTML5 rendering), but I just get a spinner - the grid with the popular songs never loads after 5 mins or so.

Working correctly (loads the Popular page) in:
Opera 10.61
Internet Explorer 8

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Nav to www.grooveshark.com
2. Note there is no prompt for the HTML5 version with Minefield (appears with Opera since apparently it is not supported at the moment)
3. Click on Popular and wait for the songs to load ... ... no songs.
Actual Results:  
A spinner persists and the list of popular songs does not finish loading (loads in ~ 2-3 s with both Opera 10.61 and Internet Explorer 8).

Expected Results:  
The list of popular songs is loaded.

Sorry, I'm new around here, but believe this is the most recent Minefield build (I am on Vista 32-bit).

Hopefully this isn't bug spam for everyone, but figured this was worth reporting and didn't see it previously filed.  Any more help I can give, let me know!
