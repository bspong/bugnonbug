While trying out new features in FF 2, I couldn't get the "Session Restore" feature to work. After much trial and error, I found that by I could toggle this feature by checking and unchecking the Tools/Options/Tabbed Browsing/Features/"Warn on closing a window with multiple tabs open" option.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. uncheck the Tools/Options/Tabbed Browsing/Features/"Warn on closing a window with multiple tabs open" option.
2. On the PC do a Ctrl/Alt/Delete to bring up Windows Task Manager, select Firefox and hit the "End Task" button. This will crash off Firefox.
3. Bring Firefox back up and you will not get the Restore Session User Interface
4. Repeat the whole process with the Tools/Options/Tabbed Browsing/Features/"Warn on closing a window with multiple tabs open" option, checked (on) and the Session Restore will work fine.




Expected Results:  
The Session Restore should not be affected by the state of the "Warn on closing a window with multiple tabs open" option.
