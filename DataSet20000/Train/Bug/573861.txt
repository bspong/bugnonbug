I was do a scan via the web site listed in the URL section. The Anti-virus was running for about 20 hours. It completed its task, but I was at another location and could not response. Thus, the web site was patiently awaiting for my return so I can process the results from the anti-virus scan.

During this time, an update for Firefox was automatically  downloaded and tried to install. I think the update installation tried to bring down Firefox, but could not and something reported that Firefox stopped responding.  

When I came back to the machine, the only thing I could do was click on the OK button. 

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.You need 7 hard drives totaling about 1.73TB of space.

2. Go to the web site listed in the URL and do a Full scan. (Mine took about 20 hours) 

3*. When the scan is running, have Firefox automatically download  an update

4*. Let the scan complete and just still there

* Since I wasn't around, the scan could have completed and than the update occurred.
Actual Results:  
I did not retry the steps above. Come on, it took 20 hours. I cannot afford the time to reproduce. But the results were that Firefox stopped responding. 

Expected Results:  
Firefox would still be up and I can process the scan results
