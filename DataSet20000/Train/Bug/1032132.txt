Allow to automate filling Firefox Master Password via extensions for automatic unlocking
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:30.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/30.0 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:

When we using Master Password in Firefox for encrypt saved passwords, we must enter it manually every time when we start or restart Firefox.

Most of Linux systems have own password managers that store many user passwords in encrypted file (Gnome Keyring, KDE Wallet). Other users use some external apps or webservices for storing his passwords in secured storage.

Will be good if Firefox create API for entering Master Password via extensions or via some other way, for store Firefox Master Password in system or external Password Manager and automatically unlock Firefox password storage on each restart via this password without asking user to enter password manually, because this is very annoying.

Also this will be good solution for match SSO (single sign on) way.

At now already exists extensions that work with other password storage systems:
https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/kde-wallet-password-integratio/
https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/gnome-keyring-integration-1/
https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/gnome-keyring-integration/
https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/lastpass-password-manager/
https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/keefox/

But they are buggy and not work with Firefox Sync, and they structure are harder that described here.

As I researched, at now there are no way to unlock Firefox password storage without asking user to enter password - via extension or other way, when we already have unencrypted master password, isn't it?

What do you think about this problem and described solution? Maybe anybody can provide better way to solve this problem (entering Master Password each time Firefox starts)? 

If not, can you extend Firefox for automate filling Master Password via scripts?
