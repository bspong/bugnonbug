Firefox doesn't like Matrox M9128 driver
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:46.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/46.0

Expected results:

Nothing should be "blocked" for my graphics card. Matrox cards are used in many industries and have established themselves in certain high-demand environments as the graphics solution of choice.

I have the very latest driver for my card. Yes, it's from 2013, but it's the latest.

Matrox uses a unified driver package and has put out lots of updates subsequently (including 11 March 2016), but the Win7 x64 driver is still the one from 2013 (version 2.4.3.2). My impression is - barring some unforeseen calamity - it will never be updated.

I'm not certain, but the issue appears to have a real-world negative impact. Please see

My graphics card has 1gb of memory and my system (a Lenovo S20 workstation) has 12gb. I shouldn't be experiencing this type of problem, which, by the way, only happens with Fx. 

As mentioned in my forum post, both Norton Internet Security and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware - as well as Windows itself - regularly pop little messages up in that corner of my desktop; the "residue box" or whatever you want to call it only occurs as the result of some type of activity in Firefox. 

The two cases that come to mind - and always cause the problem - are messages related to the Screengrab and DownThemAll extensions. 

Thank you.
