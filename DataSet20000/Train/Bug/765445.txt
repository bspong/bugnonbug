X-Tag demos don't work on Arch Linux build

Everything from about:support

Most of the demos at http://mozilla.github.com/x-tag/demo.html do not work in the Arch Linux build of Firefox. The Mozilla build of Firefox has no problem on them.

Addons don't seem to be the issue: I tested it both in a clean Firefox profile and in safe mode.
