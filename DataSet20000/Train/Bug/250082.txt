Tabbing through alert dialog broken ("alert me whenever I submit information that is not encrypted")
In a dialog, hitting tab should go from one control to the other, cycling
through all controls. Shift-tab should go the other way round. However when
doing this with firefox nightly of 2004-07-06, there are some unexpected effects.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a fresh new profile and launch the browser
2. Load a page that has a form on it, e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/
3. Type a word in the search box at the left, e.g. 'mozilla'
4. Hit Enter
=> You should get an alert dialog labelled "Security warning", with the text
"Alert me whenever I submit information that is not encrypted" with one check
box, and two buttons (cancel) and (continue). The focus is on ((continue)).
5. Hit slowly tab 2 times in a row
=> Effect: the first tab brings the focus on the checkbox, the second tab
doesn't move the focus any more.
-> Expected behavior: the second tab should bring the focus to ((cancel))

6. Repeat steps 1-4 (fresh profile is important)
7. Hit slowly shift-tab 2 times in a row
=> Effect: the first shift-tab brings the focus on the checkbox, the second
shift-tab doesn't move the focus any more.
-> Expected behavior: if tabbing goes to the checkbox, then shift-tabbing should
go to the cancel button. Subsequent shift-tabs should cycle.
