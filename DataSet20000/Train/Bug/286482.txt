Show when users are visiting a site over SSL they haven't previously visited
This bug tracks an implementation in Firefox of the anti-phishing proposal known
as "New Site", described at the given URL. In summary, the idea is:

- Store (in hashed form) every domain visited over SSL
- Warn the user when they hit a new one.

This is on the basis that users will have visited their high-value sites before
(to establish the relationship) but will never have visited a phisher before
(otherwise they'd have been phished already). So the normal site will not show
the warning, but the phishing site will, creating a difference the user can see.

My initial suggestion for the UI warning would be to append the text "(first
visit)" to the domain name in the status bar. This text would remain present for
all pages on that site in the current browsing session.

One potential concern is the privacy issue - it is discussed in the paper. I
don't think the privacy loss is very great, and the security gain comes from
having a good and persistent record of previously-visited domains. So, my
current suggestion is to have the Sanitise function by default _not_ clear the
SSL domain history, but have a hidden pref to change that behaviour. That way,
average users get the security benefit, but ultra-paranoid users can scrub their
browser very clean.
