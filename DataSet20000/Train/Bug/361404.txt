'Reload Page' button (below video window) works on IE 6.0 but gives 'Server Error' on Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

  On the right of this page about 2/3 down is a video window showing traffic conditions.  Below that video window is a 'Reload Page' button (not the browsers reload button).  Clicking this 'Reload Page' button in IE 6.0 reloads the entire page as it should.  But clicking this 'Reload Page' button in Firefox gives a "Server Error in '/' Application." and "The resource cannot be found." error page.

  I can reproduce this problem consistently with IE and Firefox side by side.

  This works fine using IE 6.0.

  Clicking the Firefox 'Reload current page' button works fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Traffic/seattle/video/i405_sr169.htm#cam
2. Below the video window (on right and about 2/3 down this page) click the 'Reload Page' button below the video window (not the browsers 'Reload current page' button).
3.

Actual Results:  
The page is not reloaded.  Instead there is a page with the following text:

Server Error in '/' Application.

The resource cannot be found.

Description: HTTP 404. The resource you are looking for (or one of its dependencies) could have been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.  Please review the following URL and make sure that it is spelled correctly.

Requested URL: /Traffic/seattle/video/SeattleMapandVideo-lowcam.aspx

Expected Results:  
Page should have reloaded.

This version of Firefox was just downloaded and this was the third or fourth site I tried.
