When opening a non-menubar menu, selecting a menu item, waiting for the tooltip to appear, and slowly moving to the next menu item, when the cursor is at the threshold to select the next item an item approx 50px above where the cursor is gets selected. Moving the cursor slightly further will select the correct menu item. If the cursor is within the top 50px of the menu, the menu will close.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a toolbar dropdown menu (eg: Back/Forward menu)
2. Highlight a menu item
3. Wait for the tooltip to appear
4. Slowly move the cursor to the next menu item

Actual Results:  
Watch the selected item change to a menu item approx 50px above where the cursor is. If the cursor is within 50px of the left edge of the menu, the selected item will be in the previous menu. Sometimes the menu will close altogether if the cursor is within the first 50px down or right of the top left corner of the menu.

Expected Results:  
The menu immediately below should have been selected (under where the cursor actually is) and the tooltip should disappear.

Default theme on FF3RC2 Mac. My system theme is set to Helvetica, so the menus are being rendered in Helvetica and not Lucida Grande. This is done using Unsanity Silk. Because native menus (such as the system menu bar) and menus that don't bring up tooltips (like the history menu) don't exhibit this behaviour, I'm thinking that the tooltip drawing code has some hard-coded magic numbers relating to Lucida Grande.
