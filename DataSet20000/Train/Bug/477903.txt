From Firefox, any web site that calls up a PDF file locks up Firefox with a "server busy" error message.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open firefox
2.click "file"  "open"
3.Choose any pdf file
Actual Results:  
After Firefox locks up, error message appears:
Server Busy:  
This action cannot be completed because the "name of file.pdf(application/pdf Object)- Mozilla Firefox" program is not responding.  Choose "Switch To" and correct the problem.


Expected Results:  
Open the PDF file in Firefox. 

 I have FoxIt Reader and Adobe Reader 8 to choose from.  Browser is set up for both as Add-Ins.  Problem began out of the blue last week.  Reinstalation did not fix the problem.  Repair did not fix the problem.
PDF Download option under "tools" currently set in General to "Open PDF" 
To continue I have to close Firefox, losing everything and then go to the site using Internet Exporer to get the file open when I'm on a web site.
