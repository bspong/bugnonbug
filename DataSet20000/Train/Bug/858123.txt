Suggested Improvements for Adding Bookmarks
When I: click the 'yellow star' (Bookmark this page) icon

Nothing happens the first time. I usually have to click this twice to get the "Edit this bookmark" dialog to appear. When the dialog does appear, it is ineffective for large numbers of bookmarks and could benefit from a few SIMPLE enhancements.

1) The problem of having to click the icon twice should be resolved as this is really distracting and frustrating. No other control in the Firefox UI seems to suffer from this problem.

2) This dialog should be resizeable. The standard size is simply too small, especially when you have a large collection of bookmarks. As a UI designer/developer, I cannot imagine any reason why this is not resizeable. After the dialog is resized, Firefox should remember the size and make that the new default size.

3) In the tree of bookmarks, there should be controls to collapse/expand all.

4) When there are a large number of bookmarks, the "New Folder" feature has abysmal performance. It takes dozens of seconds for the action to complete after clicking the button. Is this a simple implementation problem or are you using O(n^2) or worse algorithms?

5) It should be easier to figure out what "Tags" means from the dialog. For example, a tool-tip could help enormously. A link to a help page would also be useful.

6) A search filter could be useful - or is that what tags are supposed to do?
