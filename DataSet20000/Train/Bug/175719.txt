Tab Groups wording could be slightly better
Summary: "Open in Tabs" and "Bookmark all tabs in a folder" should be reworded
to make it more obvious what they do.

When I encountered "Open in Tabs" for the first time, it wasn't all that obvious
what it does.  If someone can figure out a wording that better describes what
happens when you click on it, I think that would be a good improvement since any
user who comes across it will wonder about it till he tries it out. "Open every
tab in folder as tabs" is too verbose, but I think the important thing is to
emphasize the idea that it opens every bookmark in the folder rather than how it
does it.  So maybe something like "Open all bookmarks in (this) folder" or
something similar.

"Bookmark all tabs in a folder" could also be phrased a bit better.  I think it
should be "Bookmark all open tabs".  The "in a folder" bit is redundant because
the user always has to select a folder regardless of whether he is bookmarking 1
site or a set of tabs, it just adds more confusion for the user; if you're going
to keep it "to a folder" makes more sense.  "all tabs" is vague - the context is
not immediately obvious, to me at least.

I know this is a bit nitpicky, but Phoenix does so well in other parts of the UI
that I felt this should be of equivalent caliber.  The "Open in Tabs" feature
appears any time you browse bookmarks, so it should be as good as possible.
