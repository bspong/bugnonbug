Acroread and Flash unstable

Hi,
I run gentoo - linux on amd64 and have:
a. www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.0.7
b. app-text/acroread-7.0.1.1  -ldap +nls +nsplugin
c. net-libs/gecko-sdk-1.7.12-r1  +crypt -debug -gnome +ipv6 +java -ldap -mozcalendar -mozdevelop -moznocompose +moznoirc +moznomail +moznoxft +mozsvg -postgres +ssl +truetype -xinerama +xprint

Please let me know what should I do as from times to time it becomes very annoing. Why? Because I might have spent 1/2 hour on the web for a research with many tabs opened and to view a flash presentation, I have to close entirely firefox and open it again.

Could it be that Extensions might cause this issue?
Please advice....

Thank you,
Spiro





I have also acroread and flash which are the issue of this bugreport.
It seems that tehy work properly but from time to time they don't. Here is how it goes:

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I run firefox (this is the command from shortcut "aoss32 firefox-bin %u"
I use aoss32 because it is the only way on amd64 to make flash play sound
2. I browse as first thing either a website with flash or a website with a pdf file to view and all works fine. I can hear sound, and pdf opend in within firefox
3. When I start browsing other places, and use tabs or perhaps I just change on same tab websites, I happend to get errors for flash like this:
Additional plugins are required to display all the media on this page. Click here to download plugin (and it ask for Macromedia Flash.)
As for pdf, rather than opening it in withing firefox page, it prompts to save the file.

Actual Results:  
Have to close entirely firefox and run it again.


Here is my current info:
