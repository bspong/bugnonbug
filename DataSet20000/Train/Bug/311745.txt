Pop-ups come up frequently while I use my Yahoo (online) email account.

Pop-ups (these are actual full page browser windows) come up frequently while I
use my Yahoo (online) email account.  There are a number of advertisers who seem
to be getting through despite my pop-up blocker being on.  One offender is the
above URL opens in a new window...it is becoming more and more frequent.  With
others, it appears that banner or vertical ad is opening all by itself in a new
window instead of in the Yahoo email web page.  When this window opens, it
becomes the active window, even if I am using another application.

Hope this helps.  Let me know if you have questions.
