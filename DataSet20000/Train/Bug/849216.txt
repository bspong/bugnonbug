Steps to reproduce:
1. Start Firefox.
2. Navigate to https://www.facebook.com/about/messenger-for-firefox and click "Turn on" messenger for Firefox.
3. Randomly click the buttons (Notifications, Friend requests, Messages).

Expected results: Only the clicked button is highlighted.

Actual results: More than one button is highlighted.

Note:
1. This issue is intermittent, so I can’t find a reliable regression range.
2. Here is a screencast showing this issue: http://www.screencast.com/users/AlexandraLucinet/folders/Default/media/91838ffe-639d-4f62-b4dc-062e0f17d919
3. As seen in the screencast and attachment, the "No messages" and "No new notifications" messages from the panels are not displayed properly (as "No new requests" is). Should I file a new bug with this?
