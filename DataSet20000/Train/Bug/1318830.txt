Steps to reproduce:

Reproducible in FF 51 through 53.

1) Open any image / video. Sample image: http://i.imgur.com/Z0LU4lT.png.
2) Zoom in or out on the image so as to be at a zoom =/= 100%.
3) Now click on the image.


Actual results:

A) With the zoom percentage / + / - combo button (the one that looks like this - http://i.imgur.com/836AAdo.png) placed in the hamburger menu: the actual zoom of the image is reset but the indicator in the awesomebar isn't. However, the indicator in the hamburger menu has been correctly reset. Gif showing the bug: http://i.imgur.com/26wmoHd.gif (click marks the point at which the zoom is abruptly reset, STR 3).

B) With the zoom percentage / + / - combo button placed in the nav-bar: the actual zoom of the image is reset but now even this combo button display an incorrect zoom level. Gif showing the bug: http://i.imgur.com/JEX4Oj5.gif (again, click marks the point at which the zoom is abruptly reset, STR 3).


Expected results:

Either the zoom level of the images / videos shouldn't be reset upon clicking, or the zoom indicators, whether the one in the awesomebar or the combo one, should show 100% zoom even upon clicking on the image / video.
