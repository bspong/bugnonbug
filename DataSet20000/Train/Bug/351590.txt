The Flow
------------
( 1 ) The user selects an element from any of three popup menu's the nav frame (top_frame).
		( a ) The value of the selected element is updated to a hidden variable in the content frame (bottom_frame).
		( b ) A submit() event is posted to the form (colorForm) in the content frame (bottom_frame).
( 2 ) The page is reloaded, and using PHP the $_POST array is processed in order to effect the changes to the display of the content frame (bottom_frame).

( 3 ) When trying to access the content frame (bottom_frame) from the nav frame (top_frame), in order to update the hidden variables in the form (colorForm) of the bottom_frame nothing happens in FIREFOX, and the following error message is displayed in the JavaScript Console...

FIREFOX JavaScript Console Error : parent.bottom_frame has no properties.
WORKS PERFECT IN SAFARI, it seems to find the frames just fine... 

When I run the (BBEdit 8.2.6) HTML Syntax Checker, no errors are found.
