After browsing for a while, Youtube and other sites fail to render properly

After an indeterminate amount of time, Firefox will fail to correctly render pages on Youtube and Facebook. This may also affect other pages, but I have seen this behavior on these sites. Graphics tend not to display well and text is in bizarre, often unreadable positions. Links do not always function properly. The page will usually be many times "longer" than it should be because of the poor formatting.

Switching web sites does not clear the problem (i.e., Facebook will tend to show the same problem once Youtube has manifested it). The issue is temporarily resolved by restarting Firefox.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use browser for a significant time period (~hours)
2.Navigate to Youtube or Facebook page
3.Page style will be severely malformed on at least some pages
Actual Results:  
The pages were malformed. Up to a certain point there was no issue, but pages loaded after that tend to have bad formatting.

Expected Results:  
The page is expected to render normally.

This bug occurs in Firefox 3 RC1, but I have also seen it in several versions of Firefox 2. I don't believe this is unique to Firefox 3.
