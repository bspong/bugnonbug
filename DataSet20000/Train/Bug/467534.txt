Redirects to Adobe Flash Update - already installed, no Flash content on page

The page referenced in the URL has an iframe that contains a webcam feed.  Whenever the page loads/reloads, Firefox is directed to the Adobe Flash download page for Flash v. 10.0.12.36 - which is the version of Flash already installed on my browser.  This is doubly strange, because there is NO Flash content on the page, only the iframe that brings in the webcam feed, which is NOT Flash, but just a video refresh.  On a page that DOES contain a Flash element, (http://www.coyotetale.net/index.php), the browser is NOT redirected to the Adobe update page.  Stranger and stranger :-)  Thanks for listening.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to http://www.coyotetale.net/Milo/index.php
2.  Refresh that same page
Actual Results:  
You are directed to the Adobe Flash update page for version 10.0.12.36, which is the version already installed on my browser.

Expected Results:  
No redirect.

Can't think of a thing to add, here.  Make sure you have Flash 10.0.12.36 installed, go to the page, and witness the issue :-)
