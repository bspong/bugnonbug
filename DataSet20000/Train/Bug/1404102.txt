User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:58.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/58.0
Build ID: 20170928100123

Steps to reproduce:

After today's nightly update (9/28), I had the notification to update, but I just closed Firefox and shut down the system
Upon reopening firefox, update passed, and window didn't open correctly
Closing the window via the taskbar (or processes via the task manager) didn't help
Issue occurs for new windows (launched via taskbar) or windows started with Ctrl+N
Issue occurs with non-e10s windows too (opened via the top menu)


Actual results:

Windows are non visible, they are see-through and click-through
Hitting Alt key then down arrow makes the top menu appear and I can interact with it
I can solve the problem by hitting F11 (going fullscreen) and going back, than the window is visible correctly (not maximized by default), nothing seems to make the window dissapear again, yet new windows (normal or private) are non visible until I hit F11 twice
Hitting Win+arrows to make the hidden window snap to edges doesn't solve the problem
Issue is limited to firefox
