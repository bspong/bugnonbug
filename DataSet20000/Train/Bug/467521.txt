Preferences window is completely empty: nothing appears - no icons, menus or other content.

Whenever I try to open the Preferences panel, I am presented with a window that seems to be approximately the right size/shape for the preferences window - but also happens to be completely empty.  There are no buttons, no fields, no radio buttons - nothing but a pure, uninterrupted gray backdrop with nothing on it.  Maximizing the window, hovering the mouse over different regions, and clicking in random areas of the window all seem to do nothing.  This problem was not present in the first beta; it appeared somewhere between b1 and the time the tab-preview feature was stripped out.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a recent nightly build in SuSE 10.2 (KDE)
2. Try to open the Preferences panel
3. Behold the emptiness.  
Actual Results:  
I got a Preferences window that was (or appeared) totally empty.  

Expected Results:  
I would have preferred to see a fully functional Preferences window appear.
