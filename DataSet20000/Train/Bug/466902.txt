Can't deactivate Location Bar autocomplete/autocomplete with bookmarks

I have tried disabling the browser's autocomplete feature for the URL bar to no avail. Every time I try entering anything, it starts looking through my bookmarks to try to find an appropriate URL. I can't stand this behavior. The methods I have tried for disabling it all have involved modifying listings in the about:config screen and the prefs.js file stored as part of the browser's profile. I am currently running 3.0.4 alongside 2.00.18 using profile manager to keep my 2.00.18 profile intact. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.install latest build alongside 2.00.18 or any earlier version
2.upon first startup, try typing in anything in url address bar 
3.edit anything resembling autofill or autocomplete in about:config screen.
Actual Results:  
Autofill and autocomplete are to no avail with their entries, seems as if browser ignored entries, even though they show up. This includes a specific entry about autocomplete listed as follows: "browser.urlbar.autocomplete.enabled" with it being a boolean vale set to false.

Expected Results:  
Browser should not have autocomplete work at all after the step mentioned above, but it still does. I type any letter in a bookmark's url or title and the browser automatically thinks I'm looking for a bookmark, which I'm not.

Not tried guessing what I was trying to type into the address bar.
