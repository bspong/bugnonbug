XEmbed not detected by gnash plugin

The sample code at
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/plugins/xembed-plugin-extension.html suggests
that you should use this code to detect XEmbed...

    PRBool supportsXEmbed = PR_FALSE;

    err = CallNPN_GetValueProc(gNetscapeFuncs.getvalue, NULL,
                               NPNVSupportsXEmbedBool,
                               (void *)&supportsXEmbed);

    if (err != NPERR_NO_ERROR || supportsXEmbed != PR_TRUE)
        return NPERR_INCOMPATIBLE_VERSION_ERROR;

This doesn't seem to work though. PRBool seems to be an int -- its size is 4
bytes. The CallNPN_GetValueProc() call sets only the first byte and leaves the
others untouched. So on a big-endian machine, supportsXEmbed gets set to
0x01000000, which != PR_TRUE.

Is this a bug in the documentation, or in firefox?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Build gnash (http://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/)
2. Hack your firefox startup script so you actually see messages to stderr
3. See it say "WARNING: No xEmbed support in this Mozilla version!"
