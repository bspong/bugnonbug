Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox.
2. Open a PDF file (e.g. http://cp.literature.agilent.com/litweb/pdf/5989-8139EN.pdf).
3. Press on the printer icon or press "Cmd+P". 
4. Select "Save as PDF..." option and save the document on your computer. 
5. Select "Save as PostSript" option and save the document on your computer.
6. Minimize the Firefox window.  

Actual results: 
After step 4, the document is saved, but after few seconds an error occurs: "Print Preview Error: An error occurred while printing". After you reopen the Firefox window, this is blank. 
After step 5, the document is not saved at all and after few seconds an error occurs: "Print Preview Error: An error occurred while printing". After you reopen the Firefox window, this is blank. 
Please see screenshot "issue.png". 

Expected results: The document is correctly saved and no error occurs. 

Notes: The issue isn't reproduce on Firefox 31RC. I will investigate for regression range and I will put the results as soon as possible.
