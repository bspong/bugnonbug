Tables on website, size of cells unequal
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; WinNT4.0; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8
Build Identifier: Firefox/0.8

My website http://www.ferrolatino.ch is made with the Netscape Composer 4.73.
When I insert tables, I fix the percentage size of each cell, if there is more
than one, and I specify that the columns should be of equal size, so that they
are viewed correctly with the Internet Explorer 6 and earlier versions, and also
with Mozilla 1.5 and 1.7. They are also correctly viewed with the Firebird and
with the Netscape Communicator. 

With the Firefox, the tables come out as if I had not marked them in size, i.e.
one cell is wide, the next one is narrow, see the subpage:

http://www.ferrolatino.ch/FLBVot8-4.htm - 

this is in the German section of my website.

Furthermore, although I use Arial, they come out - only on Firefox - with an
unknown typeface. This, however, I could tolerate, but not the problem with the
tables.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Choose the above sub page http://www.ferrolatino.ch/FLBVot8-4.htm with Firefox
2. Compare the page by viewing it with Internet Explorer 6 or Mozilla 1.5/1.7 
3. Tell me what to do to avoid this problem without changing the whole web site.

Actual Results:  
Tables reproduced incorrectly

Expected Results:  
Reproduced tables correctly, the cells of equal size
