Prior to yesterday, Firefox 3.6.2 blocked 100% of popups with popup blocker set to "on" and no exceptions allowed.  Yesterday, occasional advertising popups (new less-than-full-screen windows with no visible tool bars) began to appear.  Popup blocker settings still at "on" with no exceptions allowed.  This morning, upgraded to Firefox 3.6.3 and checked that popup blocker settings still at "on" with no exceptions allowed.  Occasional advertising popups continue to appear.

Behavior seems to correlate with changing to a new web page, but difficult to reproduce reliably.  Can't (yet) correlate with specific domains.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open browser and begin normal surfing.
2.Advertising popup windows appear without warning at a random time.
3.Close popup window by clicking on close button ("x") in upper right corner.  Popup stays closed
4.Another popup window appears without warning, sometimes soon after the first, sometimes much later, sometimes not at all.
Actual Results:  
See "Steps to Reproduce" above.

Expected Results:  
No popups should ever appear.  For the past many, many months, the popup blocker worked 100% of the time until yesterday.

No theme installed.  No unusual computer configuration.  No change to computer, installed applications, etc., at or around time of first appearance of unwanted popup windows.
