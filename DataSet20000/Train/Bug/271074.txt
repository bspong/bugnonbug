Cannot open Live365 player window

When I surf to the Live365 site, I can't launch any of the stations. I get
various Javascript errors on the page:

I looked at the two other Live365 bugs, and it could be related to bug 240614.

I will note that this works perfectly with Mozilla 1.7, on the same machine. It
also works correctly on Windows.

I use a Gentoo build, not the build provided by Mozilla.org.
