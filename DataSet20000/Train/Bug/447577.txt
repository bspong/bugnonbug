A hidden DIV will obscure the insertion point on a non-hidden form.  The hidden DIV will hide all or part of the insertion point-- whatever portion lies behind the DIV.  Symptom is seen when CSS of hidden DIV includes overflow:auto and hidden DIV overlays a form field on the page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open attached HTML file in Firefox version 2.0.0.16 or earlier.
2. Click on 1st form's 2nd INPUT field (look at insertion point)
3. Click on 2nd form's 2nd INPUT field (look at insertion point)
4. In step 2, insertion point is partially obscured.
5. In step 3, insertion point is fully visible.
6. Click on "Show DIV" links to see the DIV that hid the insertion point.
Actual Results:  
Portion of insertion point is transparent in 2nd field, leaving a tiny portion above the expected placement.

Expected Results:  
Insertion point should be fully visible.

I've tested this on Linux and Windows with same results.  Version 3.0 corrects this problem, but 2.0.0.16 and earlier (even 1.x.x.x) is affected.
