firefox crashed and error report crashed upon sending data report. Followed by system was infected with "Bloodhound.Exploit.6"
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Upon entering http://www.railroadtycoon3.com/rt3/us/downloads/game.html Firefox
performs an illegal operation.  This is quickly followed by the "Report this
problem program" to load up.  After clicking continue/next three times the
reporting application also performs an illegal operation.  A window then appears
notifying me that i was infected by a Bloodhound.Exploit.6.

Norton explains the technical details of Bloodhound.Exploit.6 as "By embedding a
specially crafted URL in a Web page and having that URL refer to a CHM file
containing an HTML file with scripts in it, an attacker could force the user who
views the Web page with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer to download
and execute files."

I have only use internet explorer to run updates and because it is linked to my
virus definition encyclopedia quoted above.

The virus was found in "Source: C:\Documents and Settings\[username]\Application
Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\gegze1d2.Default User\Cache\_CACHE_001_"

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1.entered http://www.railroadtycoon3.com/rt3/us/downloads/game.html
2.waited as the shockwave application loaded
3.Firefox crash followed by "Report this problem" crash followed by Virus Alert

Actual Results:  
After attempting to reproduce above steps nothing occurred.  Website loaded
regularly.  Does not explain why the virus was inside the cache files.  I was also 

Expected Results:  
The software should not have crashed, and the cache should not have been
infected with a virus.

Furthermore, the virus could not be deleted by Norton.  The cache had to be
manually cleared.  Auto-Protect was enabled and has been since the first
installation of the PC. Auto-Protect works like this: as soon as a file is
created, modified, etc it is scanned to check for viruses.  I am fully updated
and patched in everything possible windows, norton, firefox.  Sygate firewall
was turned off earlier in the day to allow my lan network to access me, I am
also behind a router with a built in firewall.  I am unsure if the report was
accuretly sent to your data server but the time it was sent was 7:08:18 AM est
on 1/2/2005.  Checking logs might provide for some more information.

After running a full system virus scan I also had Trojan.ByteVerify infected
within Jvb.class, and a generic TrojanHorse in MainApp.class.  Both were 
located inside Sun Microsystem's java cache.  I have never had a problem of this
magnitude with firefox before.  I run a weekly virus scan at 8pm every Friday
and today is Sunday.  

I could not recreate the occurrance and do not have the offset values which the
crash occured at, I copied it into clipboard and forgot to jot it down.
Apologies.  Hope this helps current or future occurances.
