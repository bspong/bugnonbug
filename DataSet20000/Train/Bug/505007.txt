v3.5.1 - Slow startup and VERY slow webpage load (safe to say it doesn't load).
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009051221 Firefox/3.0.10
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Since updating to version 3.5.1, startup time takes a minute or two. Once it does load, the pages take absolutely forever to load. Nothing practically loads; It just sits there, "Waiting for..." and the "You've been updated to the latest version of Firefox" FINALLY loaded while typing this message. I'm currently in Flock 2.5 in order to report this to you. The browser menu system is rather responsive, as I used the Help->About to copy/paste the correct Build Identifier. Firefox (Safe Mode) behaves exactly the same.

From the beginning; After installation I noticed it was lagging tremendously on extension version checking. I canceled the version check and what I've written above has been consistent on every restart of the program.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a very quick/decent 3.5 build running on Windows 7 RC 7100.
2. See an update to 3.5.1 that "fixes" slow startup times on some windows machines.
3. Apply magic, and be surprised to see that a fix is now a new feature!
Actual Results:  
The same thing.

Expected Results:  
Behaved relatively the same.

Firewall isn't a problem. Safe mode behaves the same.
