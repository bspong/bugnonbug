Firefox 2.0 (from alpha to FINAL release) hangs up often without reason during browsing, and needs force quit.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; it; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

I've been using Firefox since 0.8 came out, and I'm always trying latest alpha and beta versions of it.
Firefox has always run fine on my MacBook until version 1.5.
When the first 2.0alpha version came, it started always to crash. It crashed with Beta 1, Beta 2, RC1, RC2, RC3 and now with the official 2.0.
When I'm just browsing web sites, it hangs and I have to forcely quit from the dock.
I tried a clean install (deleting profile, preferences and so on as told in Mac uninstall info page), but it still crashes, even with no extensions loaded.
Please, tell me how I can help you, and whi the talkback agent doesn't start.
