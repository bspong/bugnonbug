When running content on the subject site (and on related sites), the Macromedia Flash content is shifted downward relative to its expected location.  In IE, the content is properly positioned within its containing window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://www.paddypowercasino.com  (or www.hardrockcasino.com)
2.Choose Free Play.
3.Select a game ("21+3 Blackjack - Player's Suite") and then select "Free" under "Step 3"
4.When the game content window pops up, note there is a band between the window title bar and game playfield.  This does not appear in the IE browser context.

Actual Results:  
Band appears between the window title bar and game playfield.  Right-clicking the band reveals the browser context menu rather than Flash's menu.  The Flash movie is shifted down and the underlying window is visible.

Expected Results:  
The Flash movie should be positioned immediately below the window title bar.

This applies to numerous sites produced by our company.  As a result, we tell our customers that we do not support the Firefox browser.
