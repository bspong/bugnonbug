Figure out keyboard-accessible alternative for the webrtc global indicator
The current global indicator can't be focused with the keyboard. This means that a keyboard user can only manually search for the sharing tab and use tab navigation to activate the doorhanger to stop sharing.

We should figure out something better to do, like:

- use registerhotkey ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-ca/library/windows/desktop/ms646309%28v=vs.85%29.aspx ) on Windows to provide a hotkey to access the indicator, and then rely on simple tab navigation inside the hotkey.

Downside: how do you expose the hotkey? Can we do equivalent things on other platforms? How do we pick a non-conflicting hotkey?

- add a menu somewhere (under "View"? "Tools" ? "Edit"?) which lists the sharing tabs so the user can quickly find them.
Downside: relies on the old-style menu

- add a visual indicator to make it easier to spot tabs that are sharing content 

Downside: needs more visual assets, tabs are already small and so the indicators might crowd out text, and would still need a lot of scrolling manually to find the offending tabs if you have many tabs open.

Gavin, can we get this on the roadmap so we fix this for 34 even if it misses the 33 boat due to l10n? :-)

Philipp, can you think of another option that I've missed and/or indicate what solution you'd prefer from a UX perspective?
