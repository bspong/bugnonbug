I have OpenOffice.org selected as the helper application for Microsoft Word .doc
files. When I click on a link whose content-type is Microsoft Word .doc, I get
the OpenOffice.org Writer UI integrated into the Mozilla Firefox window. Now I
can see the text all OK, and scroll it up and down, but none of the popup menus
in the OpenOffice.org Writer UI work. I can't access any menu in the menu bar,
or any widget button providing a popup menu. Widget buttons opening a new window
work OK.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Choose OpenOffice.org Writer as the helper application for Microsoft Word
.doc files.
2. Open a Microsoft Word .doc file in Mozilla Firefox.
3. Try to access the menus in the menu bar.

Actual Results:  
The menu opens, and closes instantly, before even rendering any text in the menu
options.

Expected Results:  
The menu should have stayed open until I choose a menu option.


This is probably not a bug in OpenOffice.org itself. At least when it's working
on its own, the menu bar and popup widget buttons work all OK.
