I use Windows XP

This seems a bit different than the other reported bookmark bugs.  I DO have Bookmarks.  However, when I attempt to bookmark a new page, it does not appear anywhere.  Also, when I try to use Organize Bookmarks to place a new bookmark where I want it, I do not get the list of bookmark locations I used to get.  Instead, I get something called "Library", which doesn't give me options to store the new bookmarks.

Oddly enough, I also don't have History available anymore.  The same "Library" appears, with no possibility of getting any history information.

All this seems to have occurred after I returned home from a long stay in a hospital.  A few people had access to my computer, and may have accidentally (or intentionally) made changes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bookmark any page
2. OR, try to obtain history.
3.
Actual Results:  
A function called "Library" appears.

Expected Results:  
Should have bookmarked a page, and if using Organize Bookmarks, I should have list of favorites into which to place the new bookmark.  Also, when using History, I should get the history of pages visited.
