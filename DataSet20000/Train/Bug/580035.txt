"action=mailto:..." can not start the mailer sometime

I work for IBM and Lotus NOTES is my default mailer.

I am creating an HTML document that uses javascript to fill a <textarea>
in a 
<form method="post" enctype="text/plain" action="mailto:xxx@..."
 onSubmit="return checktext()"   >.
The <form> also has a <input type=submit value="submit"/>.

After the <textarea> is filled with about 300 English characters, I clicked
"submit" and the mailer would not show a new window with the content of the
<textarea>. No new window appeared at all as if the action is silently dropped.
This happens even when I changed the JS function "checktext()" to just
"return true".

If I put in another similar form and fill it in manually with 5 characters and clicked "submit", a new mail window appeared but without what I typed in.

Can you help ? 

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
nothing

Expected Results:  
Show a new mailer window with the content of the <textarea> in the body.
