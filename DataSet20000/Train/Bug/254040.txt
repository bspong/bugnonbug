When typing a word WITHOUT spaces in to the address bar to find a page to do a
google search for the first link firefox goes to the page but does not display
the url it instead displays the google search.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. type in "ebgames" in the addres bar leaving the.com out. 
2. the page will load but the correct address will not show unless you refresh
the page. 


Actual Results:  
The site http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/default.asp will load but only "ebgames"
(witout the quotes" will show in the address bar.

other examples include: "ign" "mozillafirefox" "slashdot" or any other word
without spaces.

Expected Results:  
The software should display the full address and not the word typed into the
address bar.

This works on a fresh profile with no extensions or themes.  Branch/zip.

This could be used to trick users so it could be a security problem but is not
something that could be exploited easily.
