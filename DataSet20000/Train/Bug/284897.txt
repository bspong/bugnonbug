failure to correctly load/render graphic navigation buttons on Amazon site
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050302 Firefox/1.0.1 Fedora/1.0.1-1.3.2

The nativations buttons containing text on the Amazon site check out pages do
not appear. The work around is to blindly move about with the mouse pointer
until it changes to show that it is on a link. However, that is troublesome and
in some cases I have not been able to find the links, a fact which may indicate
that this workaround does not always work(around). This only happens on the
secure pages at the time of checking out. For security reasons I altered the
link in the URL field above. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. put a book in the shopping basket (a good one)
2. go to check out and pass through the secure portal
3. try to place the order and check out in the usual way that one does these
things on Amazon... you know, clicking buttons and such like. 

Actual Results:  
I do not see the graphic button links, and also do not see the text which
normally appears in them. I cannot complete the transaction which, sadly I must
say, is contributing to reduced turn over for Amazon. 

Expected Results:  
The graphic links (containing text which seems to be ascii generated) are not
visible.

Konquorer on the same platform (RH Fedora 3/KDE) does not have this problem.
