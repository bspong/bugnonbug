At the web site, users can create web-based flashcards to assist in studying.
The site makes use of javascript pop-ups with what seems to be standard html in
the pop-up itself. When you 'flip' the card, it brings a new page. For some
reason this will flash in the taskbar as if it is trying to display an error
message (as firefox typically does), however no amount of clicking it or poking
around yields an error message. When the pop-up is being viewed, it flashes much
more rapidly than when it is minimized or out of view. For whatever reason, this
only became noticeable about halfway through the set.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Register and create a set of flash cards.
2. View the flash cards as if you are studying.
3. View epileptic goodness.

Actual Results:  
Incessant flashing.

Expected Results:  
No flashing should have occurred.

I am using a custom Windows theme with Star Skin, however I haven't had this
issue before, and I'm using the default firefox theme.
