Several Websites Don't Load Properly to Fully View
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build ID: 20110615151330

Steps to reproduce:

I've used Firefox for several years. This latest iteration ( Firefox 6) has caused instability in viewing, at certain websites I frequently visit, using my bookmark toolbar. 


Actual results:

For example, when I goto    http://www.imdb.com/features/hdgallery/          the screenshots for movie trailer downloads would "stick" and not load properly to view, as you enter the website. I had no problems with Firefox 5 in doing so. When i goto   http://www.giants.com/index.html   certain elements of the webpage won't download altogether, for viewing. When i goto http://xfinitytv.comcast.net/  alot of the show icons won't load properly for viewing as well. I would have to reload the page 2 or 3 times to get it to work fully.


Expected results:

Normally, on Firefox 5, when you enter these site -- everything on the page loads normally for viewing. I don't no if it is related to adobe flash , HTML5 -- but i do have the latest adobe software that worked perfectly on Firefox 5.  If you need screenshots, please email me and I will be happy to supply you with them Thank you and good luck
