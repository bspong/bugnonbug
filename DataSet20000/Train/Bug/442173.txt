When i am in yahoo games, and i'll tab from program to program or window to window, it closes randomly, and then i gotta go and re-log into it again. Session restore comes up next time i open firefox

Or, i'll be in yahoo games, and i'll hit the close button on a persons information and all windows will close after, and then session restore comes up next time i open firefox

Or i could be in the middle of typing something in the go fish room sardine can, in the general chat window, and it'll close randomly everything.

session restore opens next time i open firefox.

is it a java bug? or something with overall ?
