Here is what I've posted on forums explaining the problem.
"Is anybody having this problem or is it just me? First of all I have high speed internet and I'm using Mozilla as my browser. When I put in a search term in the Mozilla browser or Google search I get the normal page list of sites relevent to my keywords but when I click on a site it's re-directing my to a different site other than the one I choose. In the Mozilla browser window I get "http://relevantwebsearches.com/searchn.php?s=1&q=S8lMzyxJzCnIz8wr4TTiNDY3Sc03Sk4rTDQxMks0zy01yU0qSS_ITTcCAA~~" and then a page that says "The document has moved here. Wait..." then I get a site not even relevent to the site I originally clicked on. Also my search is very slow using Google or any other search engine listed on the Mozilla page. Plus I can't get into my google adsense or analytic accounts. I keep getting " Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at www.google.com." I can't access either account using AOL or IE either but these two browsers are not causing the other problems I'm having. AOL and IE is not re-directing me nor are they slow. If anyone can help I'd appreciate it. You should know that I've uninstaled and reinsalled Mozilla twice, scan my computer with my anti-virus, "Malwarebyte's" and even used "Hijack This" and found nothing. this has been going on now for around 3 days now."
