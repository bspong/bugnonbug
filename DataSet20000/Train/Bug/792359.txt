enablePrivilege("UniversalXPConnect") does not works anymore afer ff15.0.1 update
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/21.0.1180.89 Safari/537.1

Steps to reproduce:

Upgraded Firefox from version 15.0 to 15.0.1 
(via Ubuntu 12.04 LTS automatic upgrade mechanism)


Actual results:

Our properly signed script with enablePrivilege("UniversalXPConnect") started throwing exception with message:
"A script from "CompanyName Ltd" was denied UniversalXPConnect privileges"
("CompanyName Ltd" was read from signing certificate of the .jar signature)

Signature is ok (it was ok for FF 15.0) and if signature would be failing the message would contain base url (protocol + hostname) instead of company name from certificate.


Expected results:

The dialog:
----
A script from "CompanyName Ltd" is requesting enhanced abilities that are UNSAFE and could be used to compromise your machine or data:

Run or install software  on your machine

Allow these abilities only if you trust this source to be free of viruses or malicious programs.
[ ] Remember my decision
                                        [Deny]  [Allow]
----
should appear with option to allow the requested privilege escalation.

Note: related bug #546848 (Remove support for enablePrivilege) is still open as it plans for proper transition. But in reality the enablePrivilege functionality got broken suddenly, with no transition period.

The script in question is not some internal app.
