Steps to reproduce:

(I admit that this report is a little awkward, but a serious impact is given anyways.)

If you force a link to a new tab or window by holding CTRL or SHIFT, every href url will be openend, regardless of the security context.

Steps:
- Create an <a> link to a chrome:// or file:// url.
- Trigger the link while holding the SHIFT or CTRL key.
- The specified url will be loaded, disregarding all context restrictions.

A sneaky attack could take advantage of the fact that SHIFT+CR is a common user action. (In Facebook's chat for instance, this will expand your input box with a newline char instead of submitting the text.)
So, if you focus() a hidden link on page load, pressing SHIFT + ENTER in any context is sufficient to potentially compromise your system. Besides that, a lot of people should be used to CTRL-open most links anyways and will therefore be an easy target.

The superfluously attached proof of concept will open chrome://browser/content/blockedSite.xhtml.



Expected results:

Links should respect equal context restrictions for every way of invocation.
