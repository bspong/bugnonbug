Had a paused, signed-in session on Pandora, noticed the my computer was running out of ram, and found that firefox was using almost 1 GB. That session of Firefox had been running through a few stand-by's, a hibernate, and at times had a dozen or so tabs open. When I noticed the leak, though, I only had pandora and a two other text pages open their own tabs, and the amount of memory being consumed was increasing.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I'm sorry, I don't know. I couldn't find what happened that made it go bad. Just go to Pandora.com and maybe mess with the browser for a while. See the details for what I had been doing with the browser, if you want to try to reproduce it.
Actual Results:  
nothing unusual really. The page loaded, Ram went up a bit (as it should), and then held pretty much steady.

Expected Results:  
It's always worked in the past. it just did it this once. There might be some memory leak with the streaming aspect of Firefox. I had been doing a lot of off-and-on streaming, standing-by the computer, hibernating.

I couldn't get my download manager closed after I had killed the main browser. I had to use Task Manager -> End Process
