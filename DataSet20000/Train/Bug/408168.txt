Multimedia addon and media components in page causes complete crash

This release has found an old symptom.

It crashes the entire browser when accessing one of my regular sites www.news.com.au 
and the associated
http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt.

This looks similar to the existing bug report 383921: "Jung Katalog" site crashes browser.

With some sparse testing, I think it's in multimedia, and partly related to the Media Player Connectivity Add-on.

In the Configuration menu page 1 (of 2) is an option to Activate MPC for metafiles (asx, ram, pls etc).

With the option checked, the browser crashes totally on the above sites. Without that option checked, the blog home page loads but some objects are not rendered.

If I link from the blog-home to an article with an embedded multimedia object, the browser crashes.

If I try to open the news.com.au home page (with many embedded multimedia objects), the browser also crashes.

So far, every time I access www.news.com.au the browser crashes.

The browser renders much more of the page content before crashing if I have deactivated MPC as above and it renders much faster when MPC is disabled completely.

Both pages load satisfactorily in Firefox 2.0.0.6 for OS/2, but I think not in any later public releases up to 2.0.0.11 (can't remember testing 7 to 10 inclusive, sorry).
