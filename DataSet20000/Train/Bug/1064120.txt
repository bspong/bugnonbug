Deadlock occurred when switching back from full screen on YouTube
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0

Steps to reproduce:

This is the 3rd time it happened in last few months. I don't think it can be reproduced constantly, looks like it only happens at some specific timing.
In all cases, I was streaming a video on YouTube in fullscreen, and tried to switch back to window mode. Twice in the 3 crashes, the streaming video was about to end, and the other one, it was right after I switched to full screen mode. In all three cases, I hit ESC key to try to return to window mode.



Actual results:

Deadlock begins when I hit ESC key trying to switch back to window mode. Screen switches from Nothing (All Black) -> Black Screen (Background a bit grey but nothing) -> Desktop background with some random components shown -> Back to black screens again, in an infinite loop. I managed to start Task Manager with CTRL+ALT+DEL (took a while to appear) and CPU usage is constantly above 45% and sometime reaches 100% when desktop appears. I guess somehow the flash plugin and firefox has fallen into a dead lock trying to resolve from full screen mode. The firefox crash report window also appeared in some occasion when I can see desktop but there is no way to type in a crash report, even buttons are hardly responsive. I have to force a computer hardware shutdown by long-pushing the power button.

My unsent crashed report ID is as follows:
Firefox 31.0 Crash Report [@ igdumd32.dll@0xd7cb8 ]
ID: e297bdd9-c6f7-424e-8742-f2c4d2140908


Expected results:

Well it should return to window mode instantly if dead lock did not happen.
