When I overwrite a Bookmark .url file with a Bookmark of the same name but slightly different link, the File will get overwritten but the content will be the content of the original .url file instead of the new url.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Saturday_Night_Live_episodes
2. Click on 1 1970 -> 1.1 Season 1: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Saturday_Night_Live_episodes#Season_1
3. Drag the Url (grab the W displayed left to the Url)as a Bookmark into a Folder on your Harddrive
4. Click on 1 1970 -> 1.2 Season 2: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Saturday_Night_Live_episodes#Season_2
5. Drag the Url (grab the W displayed left to the Url)as a Bookmark into the same Folder on your Harddrive where you put the first Bookmark.
6. Confirm the old File being overwritten
7. Double Click new Bookmark or view it's content to see it still is a link to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Saturday_Night_Live_episodes#Season_1
Actual Results:  
The newly created Bookmark .url file contains the url that was in the File you just overwrote: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Saturday_Night_Live_episodes#Season_1

Expected Results:  
The newly created Bookmark .url file should contain the new url that is now being displayed in your browser: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Saturday_Night_Live_episodes#Season_2

I tried a workaround - deleting the previous url file, then creating the new url file. Even with this method the new file had the url of the file first created in the same folder. When I go to a different "untainted" folder, a new url will be saved but that url will be the new "master" url of that file name in that folder.
