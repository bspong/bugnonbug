Instability and slow down on 64-bit Windows 7 Pro.

When running under a 64-bit Windows 7 Professional OS, there appears to be instability in Firefox.  Namely, the browser crashes (even when there is no significant load such as multiple tabs, flash, java, etc running) on occasion for no apparent reason.
Further, there are often noticeable slowdowns - particularly when attempting to type in any text fields (including the address and search bars) or load a new tab (again, this occurs even when there is only one tab and no apparent source of stress).  The slowdown is only apparent in Firefox (I did not notice a slowdown in other applications such as Word, video playback, etc when I tested).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run 64-bit Windows 7 (professional?)
2. Start fiddling around
Actual Results:  
Browser experiences significant slowdown when attempting to type in any text field (similar to keyboard buffering), and when attempting to load additional tabs (regardless of how few are already open).

Expected Results:  
Browser should have run smoothly.  I have the same setup in Firefox (right down to the same profile and add-ons) currently as I did on 32-bit Vista Home Premium with no problems.

Current Extensions:
Adblock Plus 1.1.1
Cool Previews 2.7.6.0623
Download Statusbar 0.9.6.5
FireFTP 1.0.5
Personas for Firefox 1.2.2

Default theme

Note:  This is the same setup I had on 32-bit Vista Home Premium without any problems.
