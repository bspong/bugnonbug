step 1: Open page "facebook"
step 2: once the page (after login) is open, then scroll down with arrow keypad
THEN you will see you end up at the bottom, the focus goes to the last element of the page (f.x. links).
Cannot move up or down with the keypad.
IF I first click on the page, then it will go down, showing a cursor (i.e. line by line) - on certain pages (i.e. newspapers this is not possible). Only able to move up and down holding the mouse over the scrollbar)

Happens on all pages open in Mozilla.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open any page (if Facebook or other such sites, login to get the "full affect")
2.press arrow keypad down and see where it goes
3. click anywhere on the page to see the cursor
4. move up and down with arrow keypad to see you move line-by-line
Actual Results:  
you end up at the end of the page (or at the next "link").
after clicking anywhere on the screen (if able on the site), you see the cursor and you scroll down with keypad and you see the line-by-line movement.


Expected Results:  
you end up at the end of the page (or at the next "link").
after clicking anywhere on the screen (if able on the site), you see the cursor and you scroll down with keypad and you see the line-by-line movement.

The software should scroll with arrow keypad, as it was a scroll with a mouse. Should not either pop up a cursor to go line-by-line after clicking on a page (if possible).
