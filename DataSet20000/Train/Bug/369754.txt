Firefox 2.0 crashes on when logging into Facebook and then immediately switching tabs

On Windows Vista & Firefox, the browser crashes very often when logging into Facebook and then switching tabs right afterward.  Since I prefer not to wait when signing into the site, I have other tabs open and would like to switch to those while Facebook signs in.  But after clicking Login and then Control-TAB to switch to another tab, Firefox freezes and I would have to end-task the process.  If I wait for Facebook to sign in fully, and THEN switch to the other tab, Firefox does not crash.  This problem does NOT happen when I use Windows XP.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to facebook.com in Firefox when using Windows Vista, make sure at least one other tab is open also.
2. Type in username and password for Facebook, and click login.
3. Immediately Control-TAB to the other tab while Facebook is signing in, Firefox will more often than not crash.
Actual Results:  
Windows Vista proved to be a disappointment so I am no longer using it.

Expected Results:  
The browser should be able to handle simultaneously Facebook signing in and user switching to another tab.
