In Firefox3, and using a screen reader such as Jaws or NVDA, if you focus on a keyword bookmark that points to the search field on the rfc.net main page, in the library dialog, firefox and the screen reader start to majorly lag. Jaws pretty much becomes unusable, NVDA is rather slow. Orca takes at least 5 seconds to process the focus event, Windows Narrator becomes very slow.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start your favorite screen reader
2. go to www.rfc.net
3. access the context menu for the search field on this page
4. select 'add keyword for this search'.
5. Fill in the name and keyword fields in this dialog and press add.
6. Go to bookmarks -> show all bookmarks
7. focus on the rfc.net keyword bookmark just added.
8. either keep pressing tab and shift+tab to continuously move the focus back and forth from the rfc bookmark to something else and back again, or keep pressing up and down arrow to move between some other bookmarks and the rfc bookmark. Do this for up to perhaps 10 to 15 seconds, it may happen in a shorter amount of time.
Actual Results:  
The screen reader and firefox become very laggy and quite unresponsive, though this depends on what screen reader you're using

Expected Results:  
This should not happen at all

This does not seem to happen with other bookmarks and keyword bookmarks, though their could be some. Its unclear if www.rfc.net has something special about it. A possibility is that it is a keyword bookmark that has a description.
