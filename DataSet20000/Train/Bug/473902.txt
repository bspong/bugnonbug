Firefox does not respond when a web page is selected from the history menu
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120121 Firefox/3.0.5

Essentially, it's what I said in the summary. Firefox does nothing when a past page is selected from the history menu. It happens the first time you try it in a session and also the first time you try it in a new browser window. In these cases it seems to happen every time, or at the very least, almost all of the time. It does not happen, at least not every time, when you have already tried it in that session and/or browser window and you open a new tab and try it. Fortunately, Firefox usually responds when you select the web page from the history a second time. I would say that the bug is irritating more than anything else. Also, it has been happening for several months and in that time, there have been several Firefox updates.

The browser goes to the web page previously accessed.
