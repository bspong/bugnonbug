Ghosting of text on drag-and-drop to form field in IE 6

When highlighted text is drag-and-dropped to a form field in IE 6, the text is ghosted on screen. If you scroll IE you can see the ghosted text remains. The text remains on top of any window that is not specifically set to always remain on top. For example, Windows Task Manager with "Always On Top" hides the text, otherwise the text remains on top. This text remains until either IE is closed or other text is drag and dropped. In the latter case, the new text is ghosted instead. Fx 2 does not have this issue.

Based on responses from others who chimed in on a Mozillazine forum thread, only Fx 3 + IE 6 is affected.  Supposedly IE 7 and IE 8 are okay.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. launch IE 6 and visit any website with an input form.
2. Select a single line of text anywhere on this Bugzilla page, with the exception of text in any form field.
3. Drag and drop the selection to the input field of the IE page.

What you should notice is that, not only is the text added to the field (desired), the text is ghosted on screen (undesirable). If you scroll IE you can see the ghosted text remains. The text remains on top of any window that is not specifically set to always remain on top. For example, Windows Task Manager with "Always On Top" hides the text, otherwise the text remains on top. This text remains until either IE is closed or other text that is drag and dropped. In the latter case, the new text is ghosted instead.
