Attempting to move a bookmark to a bookmark folder crashes browser.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1.4) Gecko/20091027 Fedora/3.5.4-1.fc12 Firefox/3.5.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1.4) Gecko/20091027 Fedora/3.5.4-1.fc12 Firefox/3.5.4

Each time I try to move a bookmark to a folder, using "Organize," the browser crashes.  It does not hang; it disappears from screen.  I can restart browser and it offers to open the site I was on when it crashed; that works. But I can no longer move bookmarks to keep them easily organized. I believe the first time the crash occurred, I was attempting to move the bookmark for the site I was at.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on "Bookmarks."
2. Click on "Organize Bookmarks."
3. Click on "Bookmarks Menu."
4. Click on Name of bookmark.
5. Click on "Organize."
6. Click on "Move...."
       At this point Firefox crashes.
Actual Results:  
Browser crashes and disappears from screen.  

Expected Results:  
It should have provided list of folders to select one in which to deposit selected bookmark.

I am still relatively a new user of Linux, although I previously had ThinkPad dual-boot with Linux Red Hat 7.3 installed.  I used it mostly to modify files (using "vi" editor) and format/print results using a ported version of a UNIX DBMS called UNITY (invented at Bell Labs, where I used to work). Am hoping to be able to TOTALLY get away from Microsoft Windows (gag, barf!) and use Fedora 12 on new machine. At the Labs, I was considered a GREAT system tester, as I "got paid to break things" and was known for causing failures in the most robust of software! If I can assist with Linux improvement, please advise.  NOTE: I am not a programmer, so cannot find errors in source code; am only good at breaking stuff!!  Thanx.
