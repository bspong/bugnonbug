FF 8.0.1 -no-remote no longer works for multiple profiles in Windows XP
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:8.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/8.0.1
Build ID: 20111120135848

Steps to reproduce:

Have been using 2 different profiles (CBE and Fred) concurrently using the following command line options: "-P Fred" and "-no-remote -P CBE". Fred is the default profile. Up until the upgrade to FF 8.0.1, this worked flawlessly, no matter which profile I started first. 


Actual results:

When I open the first instance of FF using one of the profiles, it opens and operates fine (I'm using it now). When I open the second profile, the correct home tabs are qued up and FF sends the GET requests. But the connections either "time out" or fail with "The connection was interrupted." It's as if the second instance is not able to access the network. The actual second instance of FF is not hung. The menus still work and I can verify that the correct profile is loaded with the help/troubleshooting information->Open profile directory button.


Expected results:

The second profile instance of FF should have gotten valid responses to the GET requests. I have made no other changes to my system other than upgrading to FF 8.0.1. I created another profile and it has the same issue. If I don't use the -no-remote option, it loads up the first instance profile (as expected, kind of. See bug #31746). If I use the -no-remote option, it can't access the network.

I need multiple profiles in order to use both my work Google account and my personal Google account at the same time. When Google changed the ability to have two accounts active at the same time is when I started using multiple profiles in FF. It has worked flawlessly up until now.
