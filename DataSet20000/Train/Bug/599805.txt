firefox causes infinite loop and escalating memory usage.  this is recent

system monitor reports increase memory usage from 23% to 50% after less than 1 hour on firefox ... with NO reduction after closing firefox out.  the stress has fan on HP pavilion going like crazy.  (w/little to no correspondence in CPU or network usage).  have to reboot machine to get it back to normal.

memory usage occurs with or without flash movies running.  first thought was flash 10 problem (older flash on windows same thing), memory escalation continues after flash uninstall. browser plugins include sun java.


new install 64 bit unbuntu 10 on HP 64 bit system.  all updated.  

same machine, has windows 7 ... and no problems w/firefox memory usage.  

so something not jiving with ubuntu linux 64 bit and firefox.  

would investigate more, but do not have IT education to be much more help.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  install adobe flash, sun java, on 64 bit sys w/ubuntu 10 64 bit (updated)
2.  1080i 30 hz HD resolution
3.  launch firefox, watch memory usage climb and stay there
Actual Results:  
have to reboot machine after using firefox, to get memory usage back to normal

Expected Results:  
same

windows 7 power settings to power saver (re hdd drivers)
driver issue w/ATI graphics and linux-supplied ATI driver-resolution at highest 1080i HD.

flash ALWAYS plays worse in firefox on linux than firefox in windows.  all choppy on fullscreen .... hardware acceleration is wrong.

this much memory usage when just running the browser is alarming and will have to stop using firefox altogether.
