I just downloaded firefox 3.5.5 today and after installing the Firefox welcome page just freezes, I click on the links and nothing happens, I have to go to the scroll bar to be able to scroll up and down the page. I couldn't even close the tabs. I tried again opening 1 page, for sometime I could browse thru the said website but after some time problem occurs again. The links are not working. Is there I was I can revert back to the old working version of Firefox?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Closes firefox and opens it again
2. Browse a site
3. Tries to click on a link
Actual Results:  
1. Firefox is having trouble recovering your windows and tabs. This is usually caused by a recently opened web page.
2. I click on the restore session and open a new website
3. There is a time it opens the site I recently opened but there's a time it diverts me to Google site.
4. After that the firefox hangs again. Can't perform even closing the tab.

Expected Results:  
The software should let me browse any site I visit. I should be able to navigate thru the site.
