presence of some extensions disrupt the table layout

When some extensions are present in Firefox (tested with Adblock and SessionSaver.2), the layout engine starts making errors in complex tables. It looks like the layouting process was somehow stopped before it could move all objects to their proper places.

I primarily experienced this with Adblock and considered it to be a side effect of Adblock removing the ads. However, recently I have seen exactly the same behavior with Sessionsaver.2, which is not supposed to affect the page layout in any way.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install one of the extensions that trigger this.
2. Find a page with sufficiently complex table; they are hard to find, I will try to provide an example.
3. Open a new tab in Firefox.
4. Open the page in the tab by entering the URL by hand, or by copying it into the address bar.

Actual Results:  
Pages which are susceptible are rendered incorrectly on the first try; some items are at wrong positions. After reloading the page, everything is okay again.


Expected Results:  
The page should be rendered correctly at the first try :-)

Or, if this is a bug in the extensions, the extensions should be marked as incompatible with the current Firefox version.
