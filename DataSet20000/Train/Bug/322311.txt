When you goto http://www.enzymeformula.com/test.html and click on the first Nasutra banner it takes you to http://www.nasutraonline.com/?BannerID=167. The nasutra server checks the referrer and sets a cookie based on it. It works in IE but not in FireFox. 

Here is the query that I am sending in my Http Query program..

GET / HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-us
Referer: http://www.enzymeformula.com/test.html
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows 98)
Host: www.nasutraonline.com
Connection: close

This is what I get back from the server..

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Content-Type: text/html

Although, when I actually goto the enzymeformula.com site and click on the banner it does not set the cookie when you view your cookies in FireFox.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto http://www.enzymeformula.com/test.html
2. Click on the Nasutra banner, Its up and its good..
3. Check your cookies, the server sets the cookie, but FireFox does not see!?



Expected Results:  
I expect the cookie to be set on the nasutra website.
