Interfacing with iTunesU file management is broken.

In iTunesU users can upload and manage files, when doing so iTunes(latest version) will kick the user out to a website, when the user has the latest version of firefox installed on their Win7 machine then iTunes is unable to make a call to the browser, there is no error. If the user changes the default browser to IE then iTunes successfully makes the call to the browser and users can upload and manage files. This seems to be happening only on win7 machines.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use windows 7 computer with latest version of itunes and firefox installed
2. Gain access to upload to an iTunesU course
3. Select "Upload and Manage Files" within iTunesU, observe no action.
Actual Results:  
iTunes does not make a successful call to the browser as it should, if the default browser changes from Firefox then iTunes works perfectly.

Expected Results:  
iTunes should open firefox or a new tab within the browser and direct it to the upload and manage file website for the particular course, at which point users can upload new files and perform additional functions.

I have tested this on win7 32bit and can reproduce, I have no access to a 64bit version to see if it continue's there.
