The Firefox navigation button glyphs are not the native ones for navigation. Instead, they are the glyphs recommended by the Windows User Experience Guidelines for progressive disclosure.

See Windows Search in Vista (or our own Places Library) for an example of both controls used in the same window. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Open a Windows application that uses navigation icons (e.g. Windows Explorer or Help and Support) application and Firefox (which should be set to use large icons without text).

Actual Results:  
Firefox uses the progressive disclosure (single chevron) glyph while the builtin Vista app uses the navigation (open arrowhead with tail) glyph.

Expected Results:  
Both glyphs to be similar if not identical.

The same problem exists on Windows XP, but I do not have an installation to screenshot.
