This problem apeared with the new version of firefox (French version).
I've checked and upgraded extensions etc...

Clicking-and-holding on a link does not bring up a contextual menu.
With this new version, to bring up a contextual menu (save image zoom etc...), i need to do:
Clicking-and-holding + Ctrl

Then, every time i Click on a "favorite page", the same contextual menu (save image zoom etc...)appears. Also, every time i Click on a folder in the historical menu (left menu), the same contextual menu (save image zoom etc...)appears.


When i restart Firefox,"Click on a favorite page" does work...until i use a "Clicking-and-holding + Ctrl". Then , the trouble comes again.

Sincerely
