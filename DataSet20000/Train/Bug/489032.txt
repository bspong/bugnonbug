"Context" Key Not Functioning In Context
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011913 Firefox/3.0.6

1. Open a new instance of Firefox (3.0.6). Use ALT+B to open the "Bookmarks" menu.
2. Use the arrow keys to select (do not press ENTER) a bookmark or folder in the menu list.
3. Press the "Context" menu key (Key usually next to the right CONTROL key on standard keyboards).

The expected result is a menu that allows you to manipluate the bookmark (i.e. Properties, Delete, etc.).

The result is a menu that is of the wrong context. Instead of the expected result, you are presented with a menu that should (and does) appear when you right-click on a website. I fear there is something more seriously going on here. It almost seems like there was something missing or missed in this version of Firefox on the coding end. In other words, it looks like some code was overlooked that has affected not only this operation but may be affecting other operations internally.

Reproducible: Always
