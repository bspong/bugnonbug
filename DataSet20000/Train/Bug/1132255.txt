No styles visible in inspector, no stylesheets in style editor
As of sometime last week, when I connect to my device (Flame) from webIDE (nightly) the CSS panel in inspector is blank for all nodes, and the CSS editor tab is empty with just a spinner where the stylesheets should be. 

In the console I see: 

A coding exception was thrown and uncaught in a Task.

I tried about:app-manager and got the same error there FWIW. This however looks like a symptom not a cause. Not sure if the problem is unique to my machine/install somehow (Ubuntu 12.04) - it did all used to work. Today I've reinstalled nightly, and also deleted/recreated a fresh profile with no effect. 

The only event I can think of that might have precipitated this is I ran some UI tests on device (using adb forward tcp:2828 tcp:2828) and I don't think I've seen CSS on WebIDE since. All the other functionality works fine however, so that could be irrelevant.
