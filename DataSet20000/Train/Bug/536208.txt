Build Identifier: Trying to download Mozilla/Firefox 3.5 for XP SP3

I tried to download Firefox and got a message that my computer was not setup to do so.  I upgraded windows to XP SP3 and tried to download Firefox again.  This time I got a warning from my virus protection that an adware hotbar was trying to download.  I also got a message that I needed to turn off my blocker to complete download.  Even though I was uncertain, I did so to allow Mozilla Firefox to download. Once Firefox downloaded, I then turned Norton 360 back on and immediately got the warning and so I had to go about removing the virus.    I uninstalled Mozilla Firefox as well because when I clicked on the shortcut icon, I again got the warning.  

I teach an online class and really need Firefox to work with our emulation package.  Internet Explorer gives it trouble and Opera doesn’t work with it.  Please help.  I have a Dell XPS 400 and have upgraded my XP SP2 to XP SP3.  I am afraid now to try and download Mozilla Firefox again. What can I do?
