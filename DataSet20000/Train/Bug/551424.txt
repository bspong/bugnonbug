Visiting a certain webpage creates a Security Exception WITHOUT notifying the end-user.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6

This behavior is reproducable.  Here's how.
- upgrade from Firefox 2 to Firefox3.6
- turn on Javascript if it's not already on
- visit or reload the page:  http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.6/whatsnew/
- Go to Tools, Options, Security, Exceptions.  It is blank. There are no exceptions.  Close/Cancel to leave the Tools menu.

- Mouseover any persona on the Whatsnew page.
- Go to Tools, Options, Security, Exceptions again.  Now "getpersonas.com" is listed as "Allow"'-ed to install AddOns.  I was never notified that my Security Exceptions were being altered.

FYI:  If I remove "getpersonas.com" from the Exceptions list, I've never seen it come back again unless I reinstall Firefox 3.6.

Questions:
- Is it possible for ANY webpage to add a Security Exception without notifying the user?  Or is this possibility somehow restricted to certain Mozilla webpages?
- Are there any other Mozilla webpages that also do this?


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
- restore WinXP to its state before Firefox 3.6 was installed.
- upgrade from Firefox 2 to Firefox3.6
- turn on Javascript if it's not already on
- visit or reload the page:  http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.6/whatsnew/
- Go to Tools, Options, Security, Exceptions.  It is blank. There are no exceptions.  Close/Cancel to leave the Tools menu.

- Mouseover any persona on the Whatsnew page.
- Go to Tools, Options, Security, Exceptions again.  Now "getpersonas.com" is listed as "Allow"'-ed to install AddOns.  I was never notified that my Security Exceptions were being altered.
Actual Results:  
- Go to Tools, Options, Security, Exceptions again.  Now "getpersonas.com" is listed as "Allow"'-ed to install AddOns.  I was never notified that my Security Exceptions were being altered.

Expected Results:  
It seems like it would be a security breach for webpages to be able to add Security Exceptions without notifying the user.

Firefox should notify the user that a Security Exception is being created.
