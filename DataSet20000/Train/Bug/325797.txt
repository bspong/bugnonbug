File / Import does not find Netscape Communicator 4 profile
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-GB; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

I have recently
1)  re-installed windows 98 SE
2)  restored my netscape 4 profile directory tree. My profile directory
    is called DEFAULT and it is in the usual place for netsscape 4 profiles.
    i.e. The profile directory is c:\Program Files\Netscape\Users\DEFAULT
3)  downloaded and installed Firefox 1.5.0.1

When I started Firefox for the first time it only offered to 
1) import from Microsoft Internet Explorer
2) not import anything
I chose to not import anything

Now that Firefox is running when I select File / Import it still only offers to import from Microsoft Internet Explorer. My Netscape 4 profile is not offered.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Place a netscape 4 profile in c:\Program Files\Netscape\Users\DEFAULT
2. start Firefox and select File / Import


Actual Results:  
Firefox does not offer to import the profile

Expected Results:  
Firefox should offer to import the profile

Since re-installing windows 98
1) I have installed Internet Explorer 6 and all updates from Windows Update
2) I have not re-installed netscape 4
