The application should have started.  When trying to uninstall, for awhile I got the message that "Firefox is running and must be closed" but the application was not running, and didn't show up under task manager.  I finally was able to uninstall the program, downloaded a new copy and installed, and experience the same thing.  I really like Firefox and hope to be able to use it again.
