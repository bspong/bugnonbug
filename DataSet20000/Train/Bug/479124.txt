Firefox crashing on "Print Packing Slip" from Amazon.com marketplace

Hello,

I'm getting a segmentation fault when attempting to print a packing slip from Amazon.  I'm honestly not sure at this point whether the issue is with Firefox or something about the webpage in question (though it used to work).  To make matters worse, every once in awhile (maybe 1 out of 20 times) it does not crash.

I have tried it with a totally clean profile, so it isn't something about my Add-Ons, theme, or cache.

I would like to install debugging symbols for Firefox and figure out what is actually happening here, but have been unable to figure out how.  The instructions given here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MozillaTeam/Bugs do not work; I get the following error:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
  firefox-3.0-dbgsym: Depends: firefox-3.0 (= 3.0.3+nobinonly-0ubuntu2) but 3.0.6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.10.1 is to be installed
E: Broken packages

Can someone provide better instructions for getting a backtrace from Firefox?  Thanks in advance for any help!

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into your Amazon Seller account and view open orders.
2. Click "Print Packing Slip" on any open order.
Actual Results:  
The second window with the packing slip appears for a split second; Firefox then closes.  The terminal window reports that it closed with a segmentation fault.

Expected Results:  
A second window should open up, displaying a packing slip.  The "Print..." dialog automatically opens.
