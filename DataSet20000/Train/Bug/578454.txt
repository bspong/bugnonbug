When clicking on the RSS feed link in Firefox, and then choosing Subscribe to this feed using >> Microsoft Office Outlook, clicking the subscribe now button causes an error in Outlook that says that the RSS link may not point to a valid source. The RSS feed still works in Outlook if you copy/ paste the RSS feed URL into Outlook, this is only showing up when you try to subscribe from Firefox using Outlook.
