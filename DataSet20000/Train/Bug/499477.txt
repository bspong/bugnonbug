It's almost an year ago, when FF 3 first available, I reported the problem that it hits harddrive periodically (not entering a bug):

viewtopic.php?f=7&t=812575

And it didn't get resolved, I decided to stay with Firefox 2.

Since it has been a year almost passed, and it becomes more evident that I have to move to FF3, mainly due to the security patches that I should apply. I gave in and switched to FF3 about a month ago.

And this problem returns.

Many people have blamed on Symentac in the past, so I tried unloaded the Anti-virus on my laptop running XP.

That didn't help, the scan of harddrive returns even I do NOT have symentac anti-virus running. So I turned the anti-virus back on to protect myself.

I also tried to use the save mode to run the Firefox, and a little bit later, this scanning of harddrive appears.

I am saying this is a FF3 problem based on the following observations:

1) FF 2 doesn't have this behavior, and FF3 does.
2) When the "scan" begins, the cursor in FF3 becomes busy, and the program becomes "not responding." No activity can be done in FF3, however, other applications on my computer can be interacted as normal. For example, I can IM, I can write in emacs or MS Word. Only FF3 is so busy in the la la land.

The anti-phishing option has been disabled all these time.
