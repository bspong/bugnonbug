All while holding a url icon - if after grabbing the url icon to make a bookmark you hover over the bookmarks menu to open it then leave the area, the bookmark menu doesn't close.  Even after dropping the url icon, the bookmark menu still stays open.  Now all the menus can be switched to if you hover over them as if the  menu system never closed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to any page
2. Grab the url icon as if to drag and drop a bookmark
3. Hover over the 'Bookmarks' menu
4. Leave the bookmarks menu area

Actual Results:  
Bookmarks menu stayed open until some other 'specific' action was taken such as hitting the escape key(a second time if the escape key was used to cancel the drag and drop) or clicking on a menu / page.

Expected Results:  
After leaving the 'bookmarks' menu area with a drag and drop link, the bookmark menu should close.

This bug was confirmed by other people in the firefox build forums on windows vista.
