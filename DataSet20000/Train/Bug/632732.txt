Live bookmarks of one site (www.adslgr.com) are not automatically updated
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b11) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b11

Live bookmarks of this site(forum): http://www.adslgr.com are never updated automatically in firefox (though the feeds themselves are updated every 15 mins at the site).
I have to manually refresh them in order for them to update.

Two of the site's feeds:
    http://www.adslgr.com/forum/external.php?type=RSS2
    http://www.adslgr.com/forum/external.php?type=RSS2&forumids=106


I dont' have any problem with other feeds (greek or english).

In Opera 11.01 & IE8 these feeds above are updated automatically
so it must be a firefox bug.
Also, other members of that forum have reported the same problem, there.


I use firefox 4 beta 11 but I've tried firefox 3.6.13 and the latest nightly version (4.0b12pre.en-US.win64).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Subscribe to eg. http://www.adslgr.com/forum/external.php?type=RSS2
Actual Results:  
The live bookmark will never be updated automatically
(the only update to update it is to right-click on it and press "Reload Live Bookmark")

Expected Results:  
It should update automatically (the feed is updated every 15 min at the site)
