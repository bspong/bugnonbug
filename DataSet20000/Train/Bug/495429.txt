allow to backup bookmarks in XML file format, not only json

I would like to request a standardisation feature which would improve the backup bookmark funtion.

Currently, the default bookmark backup format is *.json and is a Firefox specific format.  It is difficult to edit and easily gets corrupted e.g. incorrect favicons showing for bookmarks.

I believe that using the XML file structure would be a much better way to implement bookmark backups.  XML is becoming a de facto standard for storage of this sort of data.  

A simple example of such a file could be:

<bookmarks>
<bookmark>
<link>www.amazon.com</link>
<title>Amazon</title>
<favicon>link to image</favicon>
</bookmark>
<link>www.play.com</link>
<title>Play</title>
<favicon>link to image</favicon>
</bookmark>
</bookmarks>

This would allow far easier use of exported bookmarks in other programs and also allow easier editing of the files. 

Thanks
