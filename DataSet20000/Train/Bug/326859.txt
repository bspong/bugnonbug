1. search Google for "celecoxib no prescription"
2. Click on search result entitled "Info about aspirin nsaids, conneticut lawyer celebrex..."
3. Selection of this result should go to URL above, http:/www.kromalab.com/celebrex.htm
4. Instead, the browser opens a different site which is an "Anime Pay Site Guide..."
5. The URL shown is the expected URL, but the web site reached is not.
6. Cutting an pasting the URL into a different instance of Mozilla opens the correct website, not the Pay Site Guide
7. Disabling Java and Javascript does not change the outcome.
8. The same behavior was observed on two different XP systems with completely different IP addresses, Internet access paths and service providers.
9. The same behavior was observed for Mozilla 1.5 as well as 1.0.x
10. Changing the search terms typically did not give the same result.
11. After doing several different searches, the same search no longer gave the same incorrect result.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.See above

3.

Actual Results:  
I reached an incorrect web page. In one instance, I saw the correct web page begin to open, then I was directed to the incorrect page.
Several completely different search results redirected to the same incorrect website.
Changing the search terms produced different results.

Expected Results:  
I should have reached the website and URL I selected from the Google search results. I was transferred instead to a website I had not selected. This website's URL did not appear in the browser window, the search result website did, even though I was not connected to it.

I'm concerned about the security implications of this.

Following the same steps with IE gave the correct and anticipated result.

Here's the page info for the site reached:
