If one instance of ff is running and open, and I double-click on an internet shortcut file, the new ff instance appears below the current active window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a firefox window.  any or empty page fine.  
2. open a folder from windows explorer: c:\path, \\unc, both the same
3. run an internet shortcut: double click, select and hit return, right-click and select open: no matter, all the same.

Actual Results:  
new firefox window opens above previous one, but behind top windows explorer instance.

Expected Results:  
previous versions (I believe I upgraded from 3.0.0 but might have been 2.0.0.11) opened new instance at top of z-order, as the new active window.

I played around with this for some time.

I use firefox-preloader, its presence/absense seems to make no difference.

If another ff window is *open and unminimized* this behavior will always occur.  If no other ff window is open, never.  Minimized ff, also never a problem.

If an ff window is open and I click on a desktop internet shortcut, new ff window opens behind original.

Tried on a couple of different win2k systems, both same.
