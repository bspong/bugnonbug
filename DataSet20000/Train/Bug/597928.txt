FF will hang when opening multiple tabs. It generally doesn't matter which links I am clicking, when 2-3 or more tabs are open, it has a good chance of hanging. My PC was built within the past 2 months, with an AMD Phenom II x4 965, so the processor should not be the issue, unless there are known problems with the processor. This would not happen on an old laptop running a version of 3.5 with a Pentium dual core processor. This issue was problematic when I first built the computer, would not reproduce for a month and is now prominent again.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Find a webpage with many links, or use bookmarks
2.Open multiple webpages in new tabs

Actual Results:  
The system would hang for roughly a minute, rendering it useless until Firefox corrected itself. 

Expected Results:  
Opened the tabs without a problem.
