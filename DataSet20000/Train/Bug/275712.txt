dragging icon into folder to create bookmark causes tooltip text to appear over folder

If you hover the mouse over the icon in the address bar, you get the tooltip
text "Drag and drop this icon to create a link to this page." If you drag the
icon above a folder in your bookmarks toolbar folder and drop it there, the
bookmark is successfully created. However, after the bookmark is created, if you
don't move the mouse but leave it above the folder, the tooltip text appears
again, this time directly above the folder you just created the bookmark in. If
you try to now click on this folder to see the bookmarks in it (including the
bookmark you just created), you can't. It doesn't respond. You have to wait
about 5 seconds until the tooltip text goes away, or move the mouse away and
back in order to be able to expand this folder. Since the bookmark has already
been created, the tooltip text shouldn't appear, especially since it gets in the
way of expanding the folder.
