When trying to set up a quicksearch bookmark for the search function of http://lyrics.wikia.com/Main_Page the resulting bookmark contains a bogus URL. The relevant part of the website is <form action="index.php?title=Special:Search" method="get">. Note the '?' in the action. Rightclicking the search text field, selecting "add a keyword for this search" from the pop-up menu and saving it yields the following bookmark: "http://lyrics.wikia.com/index.php?title=Special:Search?search=%s&fulltext=0". This fails upon use of the newly created bookmark due to the duplicate '?' in the URL. Manually replacing the second '?' with '&' yields the desired result.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://lyrics.wikia.com/Main_Page
2. Locate the search field to the right.
3. Rightclick the text field
4. Select "add a keyword for this search" from the pop-up menu
5. Assign a keyword
6. Click "Save"
7. Inspect the properties (in particular URL) of the newly created bookmark.
8. Use that quicksearch
Actual Results:  
7. http://lyrics.wikia.com/index.php?title=Special:Search?search=%s&fulltext=0
8. Get an error page due to the duplicate '?'.

Expected Results:  
7. http://lyrics.wikia.com/index.php?title=Special:Search&search=%s&fulltext=0
8. Actual search results.

Suggestion: Subsitute the second '?' by '&' when creating the quicksearch bookmark. I'm not familiar enough with the details of URL composition to know if a simple algorithm like "If URL already contains a '?' append '&', otherwise append '?'" is sufficient for this kind of problem or if a more elaborate approach is necessary.
