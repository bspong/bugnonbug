>> Does the application provide users with notice and control?
This is a link to our Support page on using screenshare:

It is geared toward our desktop and mobile apps, but will be updated with information for our browser app once available. We aim to make the browser application experience as close as possible to the native apps such that the UI will be familiar across platform and browsers.

Sharing is always triggered by the user and he or she will have completely control over the content shared, and content shared is always only available to the intended recipients--the attendees in the conference, which are visible in the UI. When sharing is active, the UI will reflect this information as well as what the user is currently sharing. The user may stop sharing at any time.
