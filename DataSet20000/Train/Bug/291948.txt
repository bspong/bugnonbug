Using a dhtml tab layout. Clicking each tab (div) causes certain elements to be
hidden (style.display = 'none') and others to be displayed (style.display =
'block'). One tab has a file upload input box. Clicking browse and choosing a
file will fill this input. Clicking another tab and returning to this tab
results in the text being erased from the file upload box.

1. Create two divs and two buttons.
2. One button displays the first div, hides the second.

6. Click the first button (to hide the second div and display the first)
7. Click the second button  -- the text in the file upload box is gone.
