WebCal Handler Web Service to Showcase Protocol Handling support in M8
We need to provide a WHATWG compliant web application so that users can try out and test our new protocol handling support in M8.  

In M8, there will be a protocol content preference to handle webcal protocol links using the proper URL for this web application. 

Once a user clicks on a webcal link anywhere on the web, they will be presented with a dialog that will ask them what application to open the link with.  Our web application will be among those listed.

I have been tasked with creating such a tool.

The first thing it must be able to do is parse ICAL files (iCalendar RFC 2445). I've seen that there has been several applications and libraries written for PHP that can parse iCalendar.  So, starting there, it was pretty natural to stumble across phpicalendar.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpicalendar/

It is GNU GPL licensed.  So, I downloaded it and started looking at leveraging their parser code.  But, the more I stare at this the more I wonder, "why don't we just use the whole thing".

Here's my idea:
Host the phpicalendar application someplace.
Remove the "local" calendars
Edit it so that it will work with the WHATWG interaction and registration properly.
Test it to ensure that when someone clicks on a webcal URL the resulting ICS is properly displayed, and when that person (or someone else) clicks on a webcal URL, the previous information is not displayed.  Basically, we want to remove all persistence from the application and make it merely a viewer.
