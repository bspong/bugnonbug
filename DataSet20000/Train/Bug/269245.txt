Very strange generation of unwanted new window while pressing a button more than 1 second

I use FF 0.9.3 (which works right) and I have noticed a NEW bug with FF 1.0 (PR
and final versions) I have recently tried. When I go to a stock exchange site
(my broker) and that I press a button to switch to another value (for example, I
look at IBM and want to change and look at ATT), if I remain 1 second on the
button it sometimes work normally, but if I stay 2 or 3 seconds (and over) it
spontaneously generates a new (and different) window.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. When I connect to my broker's website to trade on the stock exchange, there
is a window that shows the current bids and asks. If I want to change of value i
enter the name and press the Enter key
2. Then, if I stay just 1 second the new value may appear, but if I stay 2 or 3
seconds pressing, then a new window is automatically generated (which should
not, even if it has a relation, this is another way of showing the data)



Expected Results:  
Remain on the same window and see the stock value change whenever I decide it
(as it is with FF 0.9.3)
