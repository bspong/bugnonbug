My Airset program won't work anymore with FF,but works fine with IE.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.15) Gecko/20110303 Firefox/3.6.15 (.NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; .NET4.0C)

The images on the Airset menu page have disappeared so that I cannot navigate the menu pages.  All is ok with IE.  I like many of the FF browser features more but I went to FF via recommendations of AirSet helps!!  I dumped 5 years worth of work thinking I had failed, but in fact it was FF. Please help.  PS I am an old lady who is trying to use the computer as a good tool, not a toy. Thank you.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use FireFox browser
2. Go to my Bookmarked page for Airset.
3. Airset comes up but no icons/links to its applications therefore no use of them.
Actual Results:  
Log on to my Airset home page.  No icons and therefore no links to the applications therefore no navigation of the page and its various tasks.  Works with IE.  All is as expected and all links work.

Expected Results:  
Airset page to come up with all icons and their links.

I don't know what happened.  It all started when I tried to link to Facebook to link to my friends there to share my calendar.  After that many strange things started to happen.  The applications were uneditable;  I couldn't remove or reverse the link to FB so I finally dumped the page and decided to start over with a whole new page.  At that point, Firefox no longer worked to bring up the images.  I went to my old computer with WinXP2000 and the Airset page was fine.  I went to the new computer, Dell Inspirion E1704 /Vista and used IE to look at the Airset page.  All fine.  FF only partial page presented.  No images/links.
Oddly, Adobe Flash Plyr works fine with FF, but not with IE.??
