The new Skype 5 has a major problem. It compromises the Internet Explorer and Firefox web browsers on computers using Windows XP by aggressively attempting to install its add-ons—regardless of installation instructions to the contrary. So far, it seems to have no such effect on Chrome. I am running a machine with XP and a machine with Windows 7. Windows 7 seems not to be affected by Skype 5.

On the XP system, once Skype 5 is installed any attempt to access IE triggers the generation of hundreds, no...thousands, of tabs addressing:

This ties up 100% of CPU usage and essentially locks up the machine. Accessing Firefox has a different result: since Firefox processes add-ons first, it never loads. Instead, it generates the “We're sorry...” crash screen.

Please find a solution fast. I use all these programs for different tasks and don't want to lose their functionality.
