getShortcutOrURIAndPostData callback should be asynchronous
To be able to convert getShortcutOrURIAndPostData to async keywords (that is, to PlacesUtils.promiseHrefAndPostDataForKeyword), we need its callback to be made really asynchronous.

During the conversion to original promises (that were resolving in the same tick) it was onky made fake-async, but it was still synchronous in reality. Then when we moved to Promises.jsm that were resolving on the next tick, it was decided to convert it from promises to a callback due to the high number of tests to fix. It was thus kept synchronous (see bug 989984).

Now, to proceed with the conversion, we need the callback to be really invoked on the next tick, that means we must fix the tests to do the right thing.

this is the tests that are currently failing:
