Both version 3.0 beta 5 nor 2.0.0.13 have troubles reaching some http server after installing 3.0 beta 5.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.13) Gecko/20080311 Firefox/2.0.0.13
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.13) Gecko/20080311 Firefox/2.0.0.13

I have one pc with windows 2000 installed on it and Firefox 2.0.0.13. Works OK using a wireless connection (802.11g) I then installed 3.0 beta 5 in another directory (standard one provided) and it works with most HTTP servers of sites I visit, particularly large servers and server parks. There are a number of sites that are able to load the first page although sometimes partially. Any additional pages are not being served, unless one waits several minutes. It then is possible to load one more page. This behavior is very consistent. The happened to my 2.0.0.13 Firefox installation. Another pc with Windows XP that uses the same network is not affected, that pc only has 2.0.0.13.

The problem can be worked around by setting 2.0.0.13 again as the default browser and then restarting the pc. The problem can be recreated by setting 3.0 beta 5 as the default browser.

The http://www.dvhn.nl lik is a regional newspaper in The Netherlands which is very consistent in not serving more than one page at a time with 3.0 beta 5. There are many other sites too, but not the big sites like Google or Slashdot

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install 3.0 beta 5
2. visit site mentioned above.
3.
Actual Results:  
server timeout error while server is functioning properly

Expected Results:  
page displayed
