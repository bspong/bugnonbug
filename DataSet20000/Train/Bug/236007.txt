Page takes many minutes to display when images fail to load
User-Agent:

I see this problem often when using google cache to see a page when the original
server is unavailable.  The page will partly render, up until the point that
some images need to be loaded from the original site.  Then the page will just
sit there for a number of minutes.  Eventually, the image loads timeout and the
rest of the page is rendered, but that can take an unacceptably long time.

This happens reproducably when the site where the images are located isn't
responding to the TCP connections request.  Since the site isn't returning a
"connection refused", Mozilla just waits around in case it eventually responds.
 There's nothing wrong with that, but from a usability point of view, the rest
of the page really should be rendered without the images that are holding things
up.  If the image load continues in the background, and does eventually succeed,
the page could be re-rendered.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Visit given URL, which is a google cache URL of www.fvwm.org homepage
2.  To simulate conditions of bug report, www.fvwm.org needs to be not
responding to TCP connection requests.  (not connection refused, but simply
no response at all)  This could be simulated by using firewall or hosts file if
the site comes back up.

Actual Results:  
The google cache banner appears, the rest of the page with missing image symbols
appears 5 minutes later (I didn't time it, but 5 minutes seems about right.)

Expected Results:  
The page should render without the images much more quickly.
