I installed the latest Firefox 5/31/07. After restart, nothing else in my system works.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.11) Gecko/20070312 Firefox/2.0.0.4

I downloaded and installed Firefox 8 5/31/07. It appeared to also install 2 files my virus program didn't like but didn't name. When I started my computer tonight (6/1), office programs didn't work. Office Shortcut Bar wouldn't stay up. Notebook would exit when I tried to save a document. Word wouldn't open at all. PC Cillin, my virus program, had a fatal error. I had to do a system restore in order to use any programs. Now Firefox doesn't work. I can't change sites, although the first site opens. All my bookmarks are gone. I'm not computer literate enough to understand the things you want me to look up before  reporting this, so I hope I've given you enough information and it makes sense to you.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Copy information from web page
3.Try to save file with the information
Actual Results:  
The program in which I was trying to save the file closed with a warning that a problem had occurred and the program was closing, and a dialog box came up asking if I wanted to report the error to microsoft.

Expected Results:  
The file should have been saved and the program remained open to accept more information.

The theme had reverted to standard them as the new Firefox doesn't support crystal theme.
