When I click a link on the popular news aggregator Drudgereport.com, often the servers hosting the linked pages become overloaded due to the increased traffic coming from Drudge. When a page is taking too long to load, I will give up and hit the Stop button. However, more often than not, hitting the Stop button causes the browser to jump to a blank or partially loaded page, and then it stops loading that page. When I hit Stop, I want it to stop where it is. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to drudgereport.com
2. Click links till you find one that takes more than 15 sec. to load.
3. Hit the "Stop loading this page" [x] button.
Actual Results:  
Instead of stopping, the browser jumped to a blank or partially loaded page and then stopped loading that page. 

Expected Results:  
It should have stopped attempting to load the new page and stayed on the Drudgereport page.

This is a small problem, but it is really irritating, and it seems like it should be fairly simple to fix.
