At the neopets site some of the banner ads give out rewards. There is one banner ad which I can not click through on the FF beta or ff2 (which I was using yesterday). It is the banner ad for the Mr. Men Show. I tried letting the page fully load and that did not make a difference. Yesterday I opened the Opera browser and was able to click through on the ad and get the points, etc. Only Firefox has this problem. You may have to refresh the page a few times to get the right banner ad to come up. It is also on http://www.neopets.com/winter/adventcalendar.phtml page. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open page.
2. Attempt to click on the Mr. Men Show banner ad. 
3. Get nowhere.
Actual Results:  
Nothing. Still on same Neopets site page. Did not open a new page. 

Expected Results:  
Opera was able to open from this ad to a new page on a different site. 

This also happened yesterday when I was still using Firefox 2. I think the ad uses Adobe Flash.
