I'll leave for work and come back. Or start to read a book or watch a movie. Tipically I think I have it minimized but I am not sure. 
Close session and reopen firefox with no problem even will restore last session.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a few tabs open
2. minimize firfox
3. Wait (pretty hard huh?)
Actual Results:  
Prompt to close firefox then the excuse from vista that it was a dep issue.

Expected Results:  
Continue to run with no issues

Running Rainmeter and Object Dock (recent additions around same time as beta firefox)
