Firefox tries to load favicon from non-http URIs

When clicking on a link with a target URI on the format foo:bar:baz, after calling the handler that's registered for the foo URI schema, Firefox additionally, and incorrectly, tries to request the URI foo:favicon.ico from the foo handler, which results in an error in the handling application, since that's not a correct URI in the foo schema.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an application that registers as handler for the foo URI schema.
2. Click in a link to a foo URI in Firefox.
3. Accept calling the foo handler in the warning dialog box.
Actual Results:  
The foo handler receives two calls from Firefox: one for the correct URI and one for foo:favicon.ico.

Expected Results:  
Only the first call, to the correct URI, should be made. Firefox should not try to request favicons for URI schemas that it doesn't know of.

This only happens the first time a URI in the given schema is followed in Firefox. It seems that Firefox caches the fact that no favicons are available for the given URI schema.
