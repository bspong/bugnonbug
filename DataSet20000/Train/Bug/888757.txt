when using back button keeps saying document expired during web search
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:22.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/22.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130620135945

Steps to reproduce:

I am experiencing a problem when using the back arrow to go back a page to original search.

I type in something like Guitar Strings the page comes up with a list of web sites, I click on i.e. guitarstringsusa.com, if its not the site I require, I click the back arrow to return to the search page and listed web sites only to get the message below.

Document Expired
      
      
This document is no longer available.
        

The requested document is not available in Firefox's cache.As a security precaution, Firefox does not automatically re-request sensitive documents.Click Try Again to re-request the document from the website.

Try Again


Actual results:

When I click the try again button I can get back to the search page.

This has been since updating Linux Mint 13.0 on Sunday 30th June 2013, I now have to click the try again button each time to get back to original search..

I cannot understand the message about being a sensitive document as it is only search page have cleared the cache in preferences several times and only get the same problem.

Have searched through your help pages but could find nothing to do with this.

I am not sure if this is a bug in Firefox or with Linux Mints Repositories.

Any help would be appreciated
