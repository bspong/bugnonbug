when clear private data is set to run at closing on linux, this does not happen
in either the windows or macos versions, it causes the program to not terminated
untill killed via the kill command, or restart of the system.

this does not happen when it is disabled

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open up firefox 1.5b1
2. go to edit preferences
3. click the privacy tab
4. under privacy click the button "Settings..."
5. under the Settings section click "Clear private data on closing Firefox" to
enable it
6. ensure that "Ask me before clearing private data" is also enabled
7. close firefox
8. attempt to reopen firefox

Actual Results:  
firefox would not reopen due to it continuing to run, but not responding
it needed to be killed via the kill command

Expected Results:  
The program should have opened up the clear private data toolbox
and the program should terminate

this crashed on a fully updated intel 686 running fedora core 3 under the k
desktop environment, this has not been tested on any other linux distrobutions.

the easy workaround is to disable the data being cleared on exit, and clearing
it manually.
