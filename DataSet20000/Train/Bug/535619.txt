At first it seems like things are fine.  You can minimize, maximize, close, resize and move the window using the standard Windows frame controls. After about a day, having several google apps tabs open, usually visiting last.fm and playing some quake live, the frame controls completely stop working.  If you click on the min,max or close button, they just blink and nothing happens.  You cannot resize the window, you cannot move the window.  Clicking on the titlebar does nothing.  Restarting firefox fixes the problem for another few hours.

This happens to EVERY Windows 7 PC owner I've talked to.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up 3-4 google apps accounts, last.fm and play some quake live
2. Let several hours go by using the browser
3. Try to minimize, maximize, close, move or resize the window using the frame.
Actual Results:  
Nothing will happen.  It won't work.

Expected Results:  
The window should behave like every normal windows app.
