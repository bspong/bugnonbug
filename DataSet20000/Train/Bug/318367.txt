I have yahoo.com as my home page. In "My Yahoo". I have sections broken out: Main page, Business, Entertainment, Science etc. If I am in my "science" section and find an article I would like to read, I open it and read it. The problem is that when I am done and hit the back arrow key in the upper left corner of the browser (This is the very new version of 1.5 of Firefox but also did this with the older version) to return back to the main menu in the  "science" section, the page does not go back to the section you were in. Instead it goes all the way back to the main page. Its quite irritating. It happens with any of my subtabs. How would I fix this. Other than that, This Firefox version is fabulous and all of you who worked on it, should be commended for a job well done. I have certainly told a lot of my friends about how good this browser is. However, any bug is bad, as it kills your growth potential. Zero bugs-that is how you will beat your competition. Please let me know how I can fix this. Elliot

Expected Results:  
I should think that if you pull an article form a menu to read and when you are done and want to go back to the menu listing that article came from, the back button should go up one level and stop. No leap back to the main page
