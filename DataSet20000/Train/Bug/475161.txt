Firefox hangs, uses much memory and hangs Mac OS X
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120121 Firefox/3.0.5

My Mac OS X hanged down very few times but recently it happened at least 4 times I had to reset it in a hard way (keyboard and mouse were nonresponsive) and it's probably because of Firefox--the first app that hanged down was Fx, in several situations it was the only one I was using at the time.

It happened at least 8 times in a week that Fx hanged. I don't think it is any site that does it, but it was while I opened sites with lots of "stuff": javascript, Flash etc. like nytimes.com and several other "big" sites. It almost never happened before.

It happened just on opening sites, no action by me was made that could interfere. In most cases I was opening 1-3 sites at a time. 99% of those sites were major ones, that I could expect to have valid html and no malicious code.

I've done no changes in Fx configuration, add-ons, extensions etc. at the time.





Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open 1-4 sites at a time on recent Fx for Mac OS X, 10.4, ppc
2. Fx hangs, is impossible to quit
3. sometimes Mac OS X hangs in several minutes while waiting for Fx to 'unhang'
Actual Results:  
I checked for updates of Mac OS X and Fx. Checked the security stuff and disc permissions on Mac OS X. everything seems fine and up-to-date.
