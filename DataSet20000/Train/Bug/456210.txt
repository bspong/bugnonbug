When i enter to the cpanel of my domain, the URL with my password is keeped on the historical visits. (As you can see on the example). I have made the test with others browser (IE, Opera, Chrome, Safari) and do not occour this problem. I tried with all config options. The only one option that works is erasing the navigation history. But this not have sense. This is a serius problem because if you enter in your cpanel from a public pc, or even in yours, other user can find easily the password of your cpanel an login. And you know what that means!!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login on your cpanel
2. After you finish to do your stuff, logout. Close the browser.
3. Open the browser, and you'll see your cpanel's URL with your password on it!!. This occours even without closing the browser.


Expected Results:  
The expected result, of course is that the browser don´t keep this information on it. We are talking here of our PASSWORD of our CPANEL...
