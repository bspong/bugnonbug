“Allow Firefox Developer Edition and Firefox to run at the same time” lacks "Restart later" option
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:39.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/39.0
Build ID: 20150413140831

Steps to reproduce:

1. Remember that, next time I'm forced to restart Firefox, I'll have to manually select "default" in the profile manager because Aurora became Developer Edition.
2. Open Preferences
3. Uncheck “Allow Firefox Developer Edition and Firefox to run at the same time”
4. Receive dialog asking for restart
5. Click Cancel because I've got something that can't be interrupted going on (eg. 4GiB GOG.com BIN file download).


Actual results:

6. Checkbox resets to checked
7. I get annoyed and decide to do it later
8. I forget
9. Return to step 1 (This has been happening for months now)


Expected results:

It should provide a "Restart now/Restart later/Cancel" choice so I can choose "Restart later", check this off my TODO list, and get on with my day.

(Since I don't want to have to think about this anymore, I asked PlayOnLinux to install the Windows build of the Developer Edition before I started writing this and then let `diff -r` solve the problem. I also set an immutable filesystem attribute on the resulting ~/.mozilla/firefox/ignore-dev-edition-profile for good measure.)
