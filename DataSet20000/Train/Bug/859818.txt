ConsoleAPIStorage.jsm tries to delete var-declared _consoleStorage
ConsoleAPIStorage.jsm declares a JSM-local _consoleStorage object <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/base/ConsoleAPIStorage.jsm#16>:

> var _consoleStorage = {};

It tries to delete it later <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/base/ConsoleAPIStorage.jsm#50>:

> /** @private */
> observe: function CS_observe(aSubject, aTopic, aData)
> {
>   if (aTopic == "xpcom-shutdown") {
>     Services.obs.removeObserver(this, "xpcom-shutdown");
>     Services.obs.removeObserver(this, "inner-window-destroyed");
>     Services.obs.removeObserver(this, "memory-pressure");
>     delete _consoleStorage;
>   }

Since _consoleStorage is declared with var, this won't actually do anything (except throw a SyntaxError if this were strict mode).

Possible choices:
- Make _consoleStorage a property of ConsoleAPIStorage, then do |delete this._consoleStorage| here.
- Just set _consoleStorage to null, and the object can get GCed.

I'm actually not sure what the point of the statement is anyway, so there's another alternative, which is to just remove it altogether.

(Side note: Why is observe marked "@private"?  It's very definitely not private since the whole point of it is for the observer service to call it...)
