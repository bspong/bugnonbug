Possibly a Windbg Log that was collected when [@ hang] occurred.

Sometimes Nightly will hang and if I either mouse-over or watch "Window's Task Manager" I can see that I get control back for less than a second, at which point it hangs again for a few minutes. 

If I let this continue the "Mozilla Error Reporter" _might_ pop up or I get a BSOD (and lose the WinDbg Log (or the chance to use the 'MER')).


When I regained control during one of these hangs I quickly used WinDbg's "Break" and tried to create a decent WinDbg Log to submit.

I also have a couple of "Socorro Crash Reports" and another (Bug 651202 Comment 14) Report with the _same_ "Top Of Stack". I tried to search for Dupes and found Bug 558647 Comment 9 which is a 'meta' for "KiFastSystemCallRet".

Please note: Those two "bp-'s" have _exactly_ the same "Signature" yet one is Browser-based and the other is Plugin-based. it would be MUCH better if the Signatures differed (and were longer; had a bit of the Stack).
