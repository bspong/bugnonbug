Steps to reproduce:

First step : I used basically the document object "document.write " to write NULL bytes
Second step : I create a Loop that can execute document.write to print the "document.body.innerHTML" under a condition that initiate the variable used in the loop (var i=0) ; then the 2nd state to evaluate the condition of the initial variable with ( i<=xx ) and the final state to increases the 1st state .

How I'm interacting with Firefox ? 
I created this concept to make the browser fall in endless dialog loop that leads to crash firefox and it's done succesfully, I exactly focused on the corruption of the memory location due to this error, and make the browser Unable to handle the OOM exception.


Actual results:

Directly after the execution of the code on the browser it stops working definitely until you kill the process . When I have debug the problem I get an Out of Memory messages.
(I have mentionned in the file )


Expected results:

Normally when I execute the code, the browser should behave as well as the other browsers and print what I wanted to write even if the loop exists.
