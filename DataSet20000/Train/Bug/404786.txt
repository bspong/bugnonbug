I' on Windows XP Sp2, 
In firefox 3 beta 1, Go to Tools->Options
Click the Colors button and uncheck the "Allow pages to use own colors" checkbox
Also click on use System Colors.

I usually set the background to a lighter shade to go easy on my eyes, but several sites still show up with a bright white background.

Some sites are 

www.google.co.in
mail.google.com
http://in.rediff.com/

There are several others. Feel free to contact me if you need more details.
