Firefox causes a virtual memory avalanche that paralyzes the computer with disk IO.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: 3.5.2, also 3.0

Firefox works normally at first, but at some point begins requesting more virtual memory and doesn't stop.  Allocated virtual memory increases continuously, and the computer is paralyzed with continuous hard disk IO until the Firefox process can be forced closed from Task Manager.  Once closed, virtual memory and computer functionality return to normal.  I have seen this occur on my 512MB laptop and my 1GB desktop, both running XP.  It happens consistently enough that I no longer use Firefox, but use IE 6.0 or 7.0 instead.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Firefox normally with several open Tabs
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Nothing special required.

Expected Results:  
At some point, the disk IO light goes on and never shuts off.  Task Manager (when it finally comes up after a long wait) shows virtual memory graph rising steadily.

It should have behaved itself.  I have two Firefox addons, DownloadHelper 4.6 and Skype extension 2.2.0.102 on the laptop, no extensions on the desktop.
