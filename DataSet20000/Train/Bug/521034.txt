Not crash.

I started in safe mode, then again in safe mode with sync option. Here's what I got back from the crash:

[lgale@lgale-laptop ~]$ firefox -safe-mode &
[1] 4974
[lgale@lgale-laptop ~]$ The program 'firefox' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)'.
  (Details: serial 30918 error_code 11 request_code 53 minor_code 0)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)

FYI, I'm running Fedora 11, and I do have an nVidia graphics card.
