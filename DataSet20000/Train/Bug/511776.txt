Large images turn blank when zoomed in.
If I go to
http://images.csntm.org/Manuscripts/GA_0311/GA_0311_0001.jpg
The image is fine in the 'unexpanded' mode. Mouse over and click to expand, it
gives a properly sized blank. click again and the image reduces in size
properly, but stays blank. <shift>-reload causes the image to reload and
display correctly (but still not expand).

Save as saves the image just fine, even if the image is blank on the screen.

If I look in the cache, the cached image is correct.

I see this problem consistantly on Linux (Fedora 11, x86_64, FF 3.5.2). I don't see the problem on Windows XP (32-bit) with the same version of FF.

The following bugs may be related. I include why I think this one doesn't necessarily apply:

Bug 492992 - Black block or painting errors about halfway down very large pages 
 -- this describes pages in general. Not just images. In the case I see, the image draws correctly the first time, and only blanks when expanded.

Bug 420479 -  JPEG image is getting cached twice, one being a large-sized zombie
 -- this is a FF 2.0 problem. The cache looks correct (cached image seems ok).

Bug 395259 -  Large images disappear when scaled down
 -- could be related, image in description works properly for me, however.
