ASSERT: null node when deleting last history item
I get an Assertion Failed with recent trunk nightly builds on WinXP SP1 when deleting the last item in the history. Tested with new profile.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Create New Profile
2) Load Firefox
3) Open History sidebar
4) Expand History for today
5) Right click and Delete each item

After deleting the last item I get the assertion in a dialog:
ASSERT: null node
Stack Trace:
0:PU_nodeIsFolder(null)
1:PC__hasRemovableSelection()
2:PC_isCommandEnabled(cmd_cut)
3:isCommandEnabled(cmd_cut)
4:goUpdateCmd(cmd_cut)
...
15:onCommand([object XULCommandEvent])

(Sorry, couldn't be bothered typing the rest out)

If I dismiss the dialog, Fx hangs and eventually displays the Unresponsive script warning. Dismissing it either way just sees it coming back in another ~10s. 

Using Clear Private Data to clear the history also Asserts, but the behaviour is slightly different.
ASSERT: null node
Stack Trace:
0:PU_nodeIsContainer(undefined)
1:PTV_isContainer(0)

Followed by a barrage of similar Assertions (some of them with the same stack) until the browser becomes responsive again. It's pretty much screwed at this point and I generally need to restart or kill the process.
