After Firefox has been running awhile, auto-complete stops working
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091201 Firefox/3.5.6 GTB6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091201 Firefox/3.5.6 GTB6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

If I leave my Firefox session(s) up for more than 30 mins, when I try to use auto-complete it fails to work. In other words, when I click on and empty sigh-on / password combination my list of user id's and passwords is no longer available (but if I type in a userid it will then auto-complete the password).  This is extremely annoying and started a few updates back.  I keep hoping each update will fix this but so far nothing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create multiple accounts on a site with passwords
2.Go to the site and click on user if field (all accounts will appear in dropdown)
3.Now leave Firefox up for 30 mins or more and go back to that site and click on the user id field (no list is available)
Actual Results:  
No list appears like this site was never set up for any accounts or uto-complete is broken or has lost form data

Expected Results:  
A list of accounts should appear
