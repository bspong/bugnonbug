Add-ons should target Firefox features instead of version number
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/535.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/13.0.782.107 Safari/535.1

Steps to reproduce:

Tried to upgrade to Firefox 6.


Actual results:

Firefox told me most of my add-ons would stop working.


Expected results:

Instead of targeting a specific (and after the new version scheme, highly volatile) version of Firefox, add-ons should target (or advertise in some way) which features of Firefox they depend on instead of which version they work in.

The current scheme where a new Firefox major version is released every month or so, most or at least a good bunch of add-ons wil stop working since they are hard coded to work with a previous version. The add-ons might actually continue to work in the newest version of Firefox, but since the add-ons don't advertise required features but instead required Firefox version, the only safe choice is to disable them.

If add-ons instead advertised which features they depend on (just as is best practice with JavaScript in a browser) instead of which version of Firefox they were tested in, each Firefox upgrade would make less add-ons break since I believe that not all new versions of Firefox break every add-on API so add-ons needs to be completely rewritten.

I believe add-ons would continue to work with most Firefox upgrades and it would be nice if the add-on compatibility scheme reflected this fact by being based on features instead of version number.
