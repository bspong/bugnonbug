I just noticed this so it might be a problom with gamefaqs I will look in to it
more after I finish my term paper.  

In summury when you press Page up on a gamefaqs  board thread (not a topic
listing page) you are brought to the bottem of the page pressing home or page up
again slighly scrolls up then yanks you down to the end of the page again.  The
end key seems to work but page down also zaps you to the bottem of the page.

I played around with it on gamefaqs and it happens on every one of his boards. 
I will continue to look around and see if I can find the problom on other websites.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a Gamefaqs Board
2. Click on a topic
3. Press Page up /Page Down / Home
4. Repeat 3

Actual Results:  
Automaticly brought to the bottem of the page.  I am able to manually scroll up
with the mouse but page up page down and home do not respond properly.

Expected Results:  
Page up should scroll up one page
Page down should scroll down one page
Home should proceed to the top of the page

I know its not saying much but it works in IE
