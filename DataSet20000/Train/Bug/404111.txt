In the specified page, please click one of the rotund buttons on the right. A form will fade in and a layer will darken the background. The text box "emri" should get focus through document.....setfocus(). If you type from the keyboard it behaves like it has the focus, but it doesn't show the caret and doesn't respond to keyboard selection through pressing and holding the shift-key. Since the layer fades in, setfocus executes before the layer has gotten fully non-transparent opacity. However, this executes correctly in Internet Explorer 6 and later.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open http://imb.com.al/imb2/downloads.php
2.Click one of the orange rotund images on the right.
3.A form that appears near the middle of the page. Press any character keys with the keyboard. The text of the "emri" input box will change accordingly.
Actual Results:  
The caret does not show and the selection of text through shift-key is impossible.

Expected Results:  
It should behave like a normal textbox with the focus; like it behaves in IE6+ (not tested in IE5).
