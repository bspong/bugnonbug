Merger of two different Firefox.Exe Versions in installed in two different directories
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; AIRF)
Build Identifier: Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.3

To secure my WinXP running desktop, I disabled a few services termed not essential, by resource tool kit and guide. And now the one started first i.e. firefox.exe (3.0a.1), of Gran Paradiso installed in D:\Program Files\Gran Paradiso\Firefox.exe, takes over the firefox.exe (2.0.0.3) installed in separate directory i.e. D:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe or vice versa. However, FF3.0a.1, do show the webpage, when its started first, but FF2.0.0.3 fails to show the webpage, though IE6, is working fine, with the services curtailed. Is there some problem with FireFox 2.0.0.3, in restricted WinXPSP2 services mode? And the merger is unprecedented ever seen. Where IE6 works flawless, Firefox2.0.0.3 has problem loading page. Dont know, which typical service has to be enabled for the later's smooth functioning. Please help.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.With Cable Internet enabled, double click Firefox2.0.0.3 to show home page google search site.
2.Problem loading page. Double click IE6 with SP, all webpages load fine. Can logon to bugzilla & all sites needed.
3. Double click Gran Paradiso 3.0a.1 (installed by default in different directory than Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.3), still the shortcut to Gran Paradiso runs Firefox 2.0.0.3. with the result problem loading page.
4. Reboot Pc. Start IE6. Everything flawless for net connectivity.
5. Double click Shortcut to Gran Paradiso, net connectivity seems ok, though delayed.
6. Double Click shortcut to Firefox2.0.0.3, and starts is a fresh window of Gran Paradiso, showing home page and ok connectivity.
Actual Results:  
Firefox 2.0.0.3 is dependant on some non essential Win XP service, which i disabled. Gran Paradiso and IE6, both could show webpages, in the same restricted scervices environment. Only, when Firefox was started first, Gran Paradiso could not open its own program, but instead opened up new window of Firefox 2.0.0.3

Expected Results:  
Naturally, considering Firefox 2.0.0.3 more secure and stable & O/s independant, than IE6, it should have been working perfect and IE6, should have failed, which should be highly dependant on WinXP SP2 services. And above that, the version 3.0a.1, which is still in alpha stage, was working against the final release of 2.0.0.3, which is a paradox. Further, nothing to exzplain about, shortcut to FF2.0.0.3.exe loading GP3.0a.1 and vice versa, in restricted environment.
