[e10s] Firefox hangs or crashes when opening and closing 50 tabs
Hi,

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/xnotifier/ 

130k users so might be a problem with it being an option on the newest nightlies...

This addon was working perfectly with 0 crashes before the beginning of August with e10's enabled. I had reported it as a working addon when arewee10syet.com first started, yet somethings recently changed.

Now it works like it should, however I can easily reproduce a crash with this addon under certain conditions. Again, this has only happened since around the 12th of August or so (I can't pinpoint the exact changeset).

1. Install this addon and set it up with a gmail account etc
2. Open a new e10's window and either A. Open a ton of bookmarks or B. run the Membench benchmark.
3. After many tabs have been opened, right click on one of the opened tabs and click "close other tabs".
4. The plugin-container.exe goes to 0% CPU and firefox stops responding. The RAM use drops on the child process, which is interesting as something must still be happening. Firefox's main process CPU, at least on my system, sits at 2% like it normally would. If you don't get a crash, repeat step 2 and 3 until it happens. Sometimes it takes more than a few attempts.
5. Kill the plugin-container and Firefox starts responding and gives an "oops the tab has crashed" error.

I'm not sure why this only started happpening recently or how this addon even is effected by unrelated tabs closing but who knows?

Chris, I had emailed you about this problem. This is the problem addon I was trying to diagnose.

I can reproduce this easily so if you'd like screenshots etc please let me know.

Thanks
