master password dialog input field not editable after restarting Firefox
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:32.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/32.0
Build ID: 20140923175406

Steps to reproduce:

Large number of open windows:
62 total open windows
20 windows open for each of 3 major websites 
[to different pages on the site]
i.e. http://thinkprogress.org, 
     http://www.motherjones.com/, 
     http://www.anime-sharing.com/

many html elements are shared by all open pages for the website
1 page requires a login [not one of the 60]
i.e. http://www.filefactory.com/search/


Actual results:

1) Restart Firefox [use restartless restart or activate/deactivate an add-on]
2) Firefox restarts it's main executable
3) Firefox opens all 60 windows and resizes/positions them to match there
    state before restart
4) Firefox displays the Master Password dialog as soon as the window that 
    requires a password starts to render

5) The Master Password dialog input field is not editable at this time.

6) All 60 windows continue to render [this takes more than 2 minutes]

7) When all 60 windows have finished rendering the Master Password dialog 
    input field becomes editable


Expected results:

The Master Password input field should have been editable as soon as it was displayed.
