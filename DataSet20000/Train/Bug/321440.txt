Non-functional browser window opens; home page and bookmarks are not displayed.

A browser window opens with no bookmarks in the bar, and the home page does not display.  The address bar does not function.  The only way to navigate is by clicking the doodad at the upper right to go to the Firefox home page.  Also, the green "updating" symbol shows up in the menu bar and does not disappear.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Double-click an Internet shortcut TWICE.  The Internet shortcut must be configured to open Firefox.
Actual Results:  
Here's what I think happens: Two browser windows open.  One is functional and shows the opened web page.  The other is the dead window as described above.

Expected Results:  
Two copies of the web page should have opened, both functional (unless the browser is configured to open all web pages in the same tab and window).

I believe a sentence to the effect of this bug has appeared in at least one magazine publication.  I have not yet downloaded Firefox 1.5.
