I was reading a pdf document and when I wanted to close the page, firefox froze
down, and it took 30+ seconds to close the tab, halting all other tabs or
Firefox instances.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a pdf document either from the hard or online
2. Close the tab
3. Firefox freezes for 30+ seconds, halting all other tabs or Firefox instances.
Actual Results:  
The actual results are under step 3., Firefox freezes for 30+ seconds, halting
all other tabs or Firefox instances.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have closed the tab containing the pdf document instantly, like
the other available browsers do.

any extensions/themes cause the problem.
