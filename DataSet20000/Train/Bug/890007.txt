Why are my pixels changed on some computers

Steps to reproduce:

I send attached image from server as base64 datauri.

Then I load it and extract pixels from it using Canvas

var img = new Image();

img.onload = function () {
                var imageData;
                 
                canvas.width = img.width;
                canvas.height = img.height;
                ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0);
                imageData = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, img.width, img.height).data;

                for (var i = 0; i < imageData.length; i = i + 4) {
                  //This is where i check pixels
                  //imageData[i],imageData[i+1],imageData[i+2]
                }
                
            };

 img.src =...datauri

As you can see picture from attached file has only required chunks (IHDR, IDATA, IEND), no color correction information or anything like that and no alpha channel.
            


Actual results:

On a few PCs some pixels from this picture has R,G or B raised or lowered by 1.
Just for viewing this wouldn't be such a problem, but I have encoded data in this picture so every byte has to be the same. 
We got report from one of our customers.
We have managed to reproduce this issue on one of our laptops and one pc.


Expected results:

On almost every pc I get exactly the same pixel as from the original picture.
This is expected result.
As I could get from specification, image should be rendered (and should return exactly the same data) like the original picture if there is no color correction information embedded into it.

Important notes:
On our pc this was resolved when we updated graphics driver ???
On other pc this had no efect on result.
We used same versions of firefox on few PCs. On some works excellent, on some not.
Even on PCs with problem almost every other picture returns same pixels except this one.
Also, every pc with problem has some low budget graphics card.

We tested it on version 21 because client who reported it has that version.
I have to say that on those PCs image returns correct result on Chrome, but not on IE
