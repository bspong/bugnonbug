Admin Login session for two different application (JIRA & BAMBOO) times out.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.5; Linux) KHTML/3.5.4 (like Gecko)
Build Identifier: 2.0.0.3

If I open two windows or two tabs and login to the admin console for the applications (JIRA - http://localhost:8080/ and BAMBOO - http://localhost:8085/), one of the session logs out and I have to login again. I can login only to one of the applications and do the administration. If I try to open another window or tab to administer the other application, then I am logged out of the previous application. I tried this with Firefox 1.5.0.7 and later on with 2.0.0.3 . Both the version does the same thing mentioned above. I used another web browser (Konqueror) and tried the same thing and it works fine (Windowed or Tabbed) i.e. I can use both the admin console and move between them as needed. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install/configure evaluation copy of JIRA and BAMBOO.
2. Open up a FIREFOX browser window and type http://localhost:8080/
3. Open up another FIREFOX browser window/tab and type http://localhost:8085/
4. Login to both the window/tab as ADMIN/USER
5. Try using one of the link in either of the window/tab. You would be requested to LOGIN again. 
Actual Results:  
I was logged out of the login session.

Expected Results:  
Login session should have been retained until, I logout.
