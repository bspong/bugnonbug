Images displayed as broken
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040219 Firefox/0.8.0+

firefox wont display many of images even with reloading. you can use the view
option in right click to view broken images then the back button and it will
load that one image only. Also on this page
http://fileforum.betanews.com/detail.php3?fid=1028299275
the image of url http://fileforum.betanews.com/screenshots/1028299275.jpg
shows up as broken. Both these pages load fine using netscape 7.02
(Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.0.2) Gecko/20030208 Netscape/7.02)
which is my current everyday browser.  

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.used bookmarks to go to pages which didn't load images, tried reloading with
no luck
2.tried viewing images on iexbeta... most would load after using back function
on the betanews page I could get the large jpg to load by clicking on it or
viewing taking it to a seperate or next page but going back/reloading original
page still showed broken image.
3.tried same pages using my netscape 7.02 browser, which I have been visiting
both sites for over a year with no problems... both come up with no images
missing on it using same internet connection at same login session.



Expected Results:  
software should have loaded iexbeta site images properly and
should have loaded the image (large) at a smaller size like many
of the screenshots on the betanews sites load.
