Removal of blue focused tab in Dark Theme makes it near impossible to tell focused tab from unfocused ones

Steps to reproduce:

Nightly updated to v57 and now has poorly thought through Dark Theme elements.


Actual results:

The Dark Theme no longer uses a blue tab to indicate which tab has focus. Because of this it is now near impossible to tell which tab has focus. Apparently firefox is going to get a "blue line" across the focused tab? The mockups I've seen for this implementation are not impressive. More needs to be done to differentiate which tab has focus. It is important to always consider people with visual disabilities when making decisions like has been done here: removal of a clear focus-indicator to one that is near impossible to differentiate from other non-focused ones.

What is the argument for abandoning the blue tab for indicating focus? A "blue line" across the top of the focused tab is not a sufficient indication of focus.


Expected results:

The focused tab should be clearly differentiated from the other non-focused tabs. The entire focused tab should be a different color or a dramatically different shade. Nothing about the difference should be subtle.

The decision to switch the color of the focused tab was clearly poorly thought through. The decision to have a blue line differentiating tabs should be abandoned until a better design is put forward.
