Firefox CRASHES & A Major Bookmark Annoyance
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:14.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/14.0
Build ID: 20120628060610

Steps to reproduce:

- I Recently upgraded Firefox to Beta 14.0 from 13.0.1


Actual results:

- Since then it has been SUDDENLY closing down and then needs to be restarted.
I even tried Starting in Safe Mode and Disabling ALL my Extensions and Plug-Ins.. this has helped but Not eliminated this problem.

This has happened over a dozen times (lost count) over the recent past, and sometimes closes down right after starting back up when I click on a tab!

The last time I had 23 tabs open, but in previous months, with a previous release of Firefox, I have had over 30 and did not have this kind of sudden shutdown occurring. I even started closing down all other unnecessary programs, but this apparently has not had much effect on the problem (thought it was a memory thing - and may still be with how Firefox has a tendency to gobble up my 4 GB of memory).

- The "New Folder" selection under Bookmarks > Bookmark This Page > Down-arrow next to "Folder", has a VERY annoying problem that begs to be fixed..

I have a very large and long list of bookmarks, often having a subfolders list that reach beyond the bottom of the screen when I open its parent folder, so when I click "New Folder" after having selected the Parent Folder:
(a) it Highlights the Parent Folder for a Very Long time, then Creates a "New Folder" at the Bottom of the Child List, which can not be seen since it is often off the bottom of the screen.
(b) to add insult to injury, when I scroll down to the "New Folder" and double click it to change its name, it stays selected for change ONLY FOR A FEW SECONDS, then, while I am still trying to type, it is no longer selected for change, thus my typing starts the process of Firefox searching for the Bookmark Folder with the First letter of what I am in the process of typing - taking me anywhere but where I wanted to be, which was to finish changing the name of the "New Folder", which is now only partially done.  This aggravating effect of the Bookmark Folder staying selected and ready for change for only a second or two keeps repeating, sometime four or five times (or more)!


Expected results:

- Firefox SHOULD NOT BE CRASHING LIKE THIS, especially with No Warning!

- (a) You would think, since I am trying to create a new Sub-Folder, that the Focus would immediately go to that Folder and highlight it to be changed to the name I want - but it doesn't!

- (b) There should be a LONG, or at least reasonable, time allowed for modifying a Bookmark Folder’s Name.
