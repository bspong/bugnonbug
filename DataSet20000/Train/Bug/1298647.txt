hi folks, stale cache regression bug again, also in chrome
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:48.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/48.0
Build ID: 20160823121617

Steps to reproduce:

problem with extra </div> supposedly, but this is not in my latest source. maybe apache 2.4.23 is broken. but i restarted apache and refreshed page and again viewed source and this did not fix. source code is still wonky-looking (not well-formatted like it should be).
as it is local, I do not have a set of files for you. it is a local test server and since this is beta code I don't dare put the code out in public yet.


Actual results:

stale cache, old-looking, old-formatted code with extra red </div> tag in view-source: which has not changed, and I suspect the browser will never change this page again unless something is done to fix the problem. it does nothing apparently, some old version of the page is still floating around. I may have to wipe some history again like I did yesterday.

this is a regression. many times I have come across a stale cache in ff and chrome and IE over the years. try lamba #include in c++ with winmerge?


Expected results:

there are all sorts of HTML cache invalidation code in the page, it should have invalidated the cache for this page and reloaded it.
