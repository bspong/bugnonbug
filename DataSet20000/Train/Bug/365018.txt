Drop down menus (where exist) in the preference panel flickers for a split second when switching from one panel to another. Examples would be the "Default font" menu under "Content", and "Accept cookies from ..." under "Privacy".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Preference Panel
2. Switch between panels with drop down menus, such as "main", "content", "privacy", etc.
3.

Actual Results:  
Drop down menus flickers once when panel first appears

Expected Results:  
No flicker at all.

I've narrowed it down using official nightlies to 2006-11-12-06-mozilla1.8 working ok, but 2006-11-13-03-mozilla1.8 flickers. Regression likely introduced by https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=348304 checked in that period.

This also means that the official Firefox 2.0.0.0 does *NOT* exhibit this behavior, but 2.0.0.1 does.

Further, Thunderbird 2.0b1 also exhibits this problem.
