Hello,
I'm using Firefox ver 1.5 browser. When I click a new mail alert icon in the yahoo messenger or system tray it supposed to auto login with my yahoo id "senthilkumar_pr" but now a days i'm getting different id "jrw_3rd". I'm sure noone have used this id in my system, it  is private system and only used by me. 

One more think is, when i click a mail subject to read yahoo mail, Firefox crashes. 

I'M AFRAID SOMEONE TRACKING MY NET ACTIVITIES COLLECTING DATA. COULD YOU PLEASE INVESTIGATE.

THANKS.

Truly,
Senthil
