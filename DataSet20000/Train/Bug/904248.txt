Restore options to turn off image loading and javascript
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:22.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/22.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130618035212

Steps to reproduce:

When version 23 was introduced, it was introduced with bug fixes 851701 and 851702, each of which rendered version 23 unusable. One removed the option to shut off javascript, the other the option to load images. Both options are frequently used, and without them render the browser unusable.


Actual results:

Javascript is used to provide stupid web tricks, such as keeping you on a web page when you want to leave it, by opening a new window when you click the close tab. Often the only way out of this is to go to options and shut off javascript. There are many other reasons to shut off javascript.

When loading images are shut off, the alt text is displayed, and the website loads faster. This can be critical for users who are on a metered ISP service, and would otherwise go over their data limits.


Expected results:

What should have been available is an easy to use by everyone option to turn off javascript and image loading. I am not interested in using a work around add-on to try to reproduce this basic functionality that should be available in any browser. The arguments about why it was removed are specious and ludicrous.
