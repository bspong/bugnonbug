Changing URL midway through a png download shows "cannot be displayed, because it contains errors." before the new URL loads.

I went to the given URL, if halfway through the image being loaded I go to any other URL it displays the message:
'The Image "http://inkscape.osuosl.org/screenshots/gallery/inkscape-0.45-gradient-mesh-experimental.png"  cannot be displayed, because it contains errors.'

This is aesthetic only, the new URL loads as desired and no functionality is lost. If the image URL is loaded again it loads from the previous point without error.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Link to a png image
2. Halfway through the image loading click on a different URL
3. Check for error message within the main window.

Actual Results:  
An error message appeared in the current tab.

Expected Results:  
The png image should have stopped downloading and shown a static incomplete image.

Various open source software packages installed, but nothing that should conflict I don't think (gaim, inskscape, gimp, devc++, blender, azureus, etc.)
