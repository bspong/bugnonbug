I tried printing the page, http://www.twiki.org/.
The bar on left, (contains TWiki.org, Success Stories, Mission) prints down through the page number and off the page.  It cuts of at "TWiki fosters information flow". That sidebar is not continued on any of the other pages.

The only content at the bottom of the last printed page is the page reference counter and the Revision notice.  The line "TWiki is a trademark of Peter Thoeny..." that's supposed to appear at the bottom of the last page prints at the top of page 4 (page number missing), overprinting the content. The line "Ideas, requests,..." that's supposed to be at the bottom of the last page appears at the top of the 5th page overprinting the content at the top of that page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to http://www.twiki.org
2. Select File/Print
Actual Results:  
described above

Expected Results:  
1. The sidebar should be continued on subsequent pages.
2. All page numbers should appear.
3. Content that's supposed to be at the bottom of the last page should not appear at the top of various pages.
