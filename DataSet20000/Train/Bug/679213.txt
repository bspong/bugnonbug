very destructive virus come through my firefox when not it use..
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.18) Gecko/20110614 Firefox/3.6.18 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build ID: 20110614230723

Steps to reproduce:

i was on my computer doing some work. the only browser i had open was one tab on google chrome..(sry). all i had open in the window was google images on the main page, i wasnt in a site. i soon close the window and i have alot of security software on my computer. i had a pop up that firefox was installing a plug-in..im  normally on firefox so i thought nothing of it for about 10 mins.


Actual results:

my different windows on my screen started just dissapearing. i immediately hit clr,alt, delete and brought up the task manager. it was another one of those "sfl.exe" viruses i potted it, ended the process and checked the others and started running virus scans with multiple programs..none of the had a chance to even get started, the virus took them over and froze them. i also saw that they were in my hkcu files,took care of them. about 2 secs later my whole screen when crazy, looked like a busted plasma screen, i killed the power but not fast enough. the virus destroyed the majority of my program files...i tried to recover what i could but i was mostly gone...had to throw in the backup disk, which are like a year old, after i wiped it clean.


Expected results:

from what i saw and how things reacted, other firefox has a major malfunction of some body had developed a fake plug-in that automatically installs a virus without the user knowing. the only reason i noticed is be it tripped a firewall but i got it set to automatically accept any plug-in of add-on it just has the little banner telling me what it was doing. but the biggest thing is that it stared "firefox.exe" on its on..it wasnt running..i got a task killer. but just figured i let you all know so maybe the next person wont loses hundreds of dollars worth of programs and data.
