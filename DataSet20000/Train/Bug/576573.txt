On the Google Wave Site, after opening the Link To Wave dialog to get a URL that will directly link to the current wave, I am able to highlight the URL that is presented, but I am not able to scroll through the text of the URL or copy that text to the clipboard.

Reproducible: Always

1.Open Google Wave site
2.Select a wave or create a new wave
3.On the Wave pane, click the "..." menu option on the toolbar at the right side of the pane

5.Click the text under "Copy and paste this URL:"
6.Right-click and click copy, or press Control-c to copy the text.
7.Open a new tab

Actual Results:  
No text is pasted, clipboard is empty.

Any information previously on the clipboard is cleared, but new text is not copied to the clipboard.
