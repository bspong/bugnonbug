web pages are a mess, text/images not aligning properly as they have for years with FF 3 and they do when created in Text Wrangler
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0
Build Identifier: Firefox 4.0 (downloaded yesterday) thought this was an approved update--iMac--OSX.6.6

web pages not displaying correctly.  Images and text are not properly aligned.
This is my business!!!  I need a quick fix.  This is critical.

Related sample images pages (multiple)  for example http://akmk.com/alaskascenics.com

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
It's just there.  I changed nothing but my browser and my photography business web pages now do not display correctly.
Actual Results:  
I go online and open my own web pages and they are now a disaster.

Expected Results:  
Text should be under images.  Images should be aligned side by side in tables.

The pages preview correctly with Text Wrangler.  They have been fine in all previous versions of Firefox 3.

Aligned the images properly.  Displayed the text (captions) directly under the images.

I guess it's good I got to test this, because no doubt others are seeing the problem as well.

Someone just told me FF4 is not as forgiving as FF 3 was.
