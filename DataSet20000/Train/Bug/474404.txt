Firefox opens files and does not release them, making them inaccessible for either modification or deleting.

It has taken a long time to narrow this problem down to Firefox. I develop websites. Files that have been opened by Firefox are often locked, so that they cannot be modified or deleted by other programs. That it is Firefox that's doing this is confirmed by use of Microsoft's Process Explorer and the fact that closing Firefox allows the files to be processed accurately.

Worse, exiting the page from Firefox, but leaving Firefox open, does not resolve the problem.  Files are still locked, making it impossible to modify them.

I'm using Blumental's WeBuilder.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open .html or .shtml file locally (not via server) with WeBuilder.  (This problem does not occur with .css files.)
2. Display file with Firefox.
3. Make a change - any change - with WeBuilder and attempt to save.

Please note that the file is sometimes saveable on the first try.  But always by the second attempt to save, an error is produced.
Actual Results:  
A WeBuilder error is returned: The file cannot be saved with the specified name. 

If is also impossible to delete the file until Firefox is exited.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should release the file so that it can be modified or deleted.

Please note that this problem exists only when dealing with local files.  Obviously, it has nothing to do with files served by an ISP. 

Although there is no program or system crash, the problem is quite severe for website developers.
