Missing UI toggles that are supposed to be there

According to http://www.mozilla.org/unix/customizing.html, there is supposed to
be a UI for browser.link.open_newwindow in the Preferences.  There is no such UI
toggle.

According to http://www.mozilla.org/access/type-ahead, there is supposed to be a
"Keyboard Navigation" sub-pane in the Advanced pane of the Preferences.  There
is no such sub-pane.  Hence, there is no UI toggle for settings such as
accessibility.tabfocus.

So far, these are the only preferences where I have seen explicit mention of UI
toggles that do not exist.  If I find more, I will update this bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Preferences
2. Look for the UI toggles mentioned above
3. Don't find them. =)


Expected Results:  
According to Mozilla's own webpages, these UI toggles are supposed to be
present.  Under MacOS X (10.3.9), for Firefox 1.0.6, these toggles do not exist
and the only way to modify these particular prefs is through about:config.
