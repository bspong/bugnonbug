eTLD list blocks second-level .pe domains which now exist

I have a site with the domain example.pe . With firefox2 and opera the cookie is sent to the server (Apache 2 web server) but with firefox is not.
I test the same site (with the same configuration) moved to example.com.pe and it works fine. When I activate cookie logging in the server I have this in example.com.pe calling to play.php (var dump of $_COOKIE array) :

SESS3a18a87e35b377c6c0cf5b6f1151d000=d94f5s2pd4rlm4m1gi5isvb0j2; PHPSESSID=pv47dlprhjebgkajm2e5q33f21; SESSda8e28f0348737896c3a34376fef8171=1egr87ki7nrff19avm8is56681 GET /play.php HTTP/1.1 [12/Aug/2008:18:53:41 -0500]

But with example.pe:

- GET /play.php HTTP/1.1 [12/Aug/2008:18:53:58 -0500]

The cookie were sent empty or not sent at all. Also I tried with another domain example2.pe with the same results. But with firefox2 and opera it works fine.

I check with other tools like firebug and firecookie and the result is the same, the cookie is not sent to the server from firefox3. I deactivate all the addons and clear the private data with the same results. We test first if was a problem with the application and everything is ok.
