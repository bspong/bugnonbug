moving urlbar / searchbar can put fullscreen window controls on wrong side of screen ( customize toolbars )
Using customize toolbars, it's possible to put the urlbar and/or searchbar to the right of the window controls element.  This means when you go to fullscreen with F11 the minimize/restore/close window controls are on the left side of the screen instead of where they should be on the right.
