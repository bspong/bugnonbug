I have a problem loading pages of a certain website using Firefox.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3

There is a message board that I visit, www.northsidebaseball.com and I have recently started having problems loading some of the pages.  Sometimes when I click to load a certain part of the page, the browser doesn't load the page and instead just shows a blank page with the word "Done" at the bottom as if the page is loaded.  For some of the forums on the website it does the same thing so I can't see the topics.  I found a way around this.  If I click on the Forum (it doesn't load), close Firefox, start it up again, go up to 'History' on the toolbar and go down to that Forum, it will load it up.  But if I reload that page, it does the same thing and gives me a blank page.  I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox but to no avail.  The website works fine if I use Internet Explorer on my computer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.northsidebaseball.com
2. On the left side of the page, I click on 'Message Board'.
3. Then I try to click on some of the forums (Baseball Discussion, Game Threads, Transactions) and the page doesn't load and just shows 'Done' at the bottom.
Actual Results:  
After I perform the steps above, the page doesn't load.

Expected Results:  
It should have loaded the forums and showed the topics in the forums.
