Frames load but are overwritten by original pages

If I visit a page (e.g. the google code page above) and click on a link that loads content into frames using javascript, the content loads but is almost immediately (up to 1 second or so) overwritten by the original frame content.  In Yahoo! Mail, this overwrites the inbox contents with the Yahoo Mail front screen; in Google code, it overwrites the product window with Android descriptions, flipping between this and a blank (copyright only) frame. This problem does not occur in Internet Explorer on the same system.

Problem first noticed in Yahoo! after complete system rebuild and upgrade to Firefox 2.0.0.14.  Java versions 6u6 and 6u10 have both been tried, as has cleaning the system and reinstalling Firefox and Java.
