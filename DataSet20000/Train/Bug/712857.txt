Steps to reproduce:

Please note: this happens on every page.  It is not limited to a few websites.  This error didn't happen in the previous two versions, but I believe this bug has occured once before in version five or six.  These errors seem to occur straight after the update and continue until a new release is made.  Therefore, in my opinion I believe this is a Firefox bug and not an issue on my side.  

In short: After the 9.0 Firefox update - Firefox automatically selected and highlighted text on its own.  Please refer to the image for an example.  




Actual results:

I will use Google Reader as an example. 
I was checking my feeds on Google Reader and as I scroll down the page, Firefox automatically selects and highlights text.  Further - another example is I might be writing a blog on wonderhowto.com and I as I'm typing Firefox for some odd reason highlights itself and then as I press the next key-stroke I lose what ever work I've written that was highlighted.  


Expected results:

Firefox shouldn't have automatically highlighted text.
