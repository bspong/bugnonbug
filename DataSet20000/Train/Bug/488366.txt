Underline weight varies when font size changes within the same paragraph element.

The website I previously developed (under IE7) uses underlining of title lines within each page. To emphasise the title, the initial letter of each word is set to a larger font size than the letters that follow, and the whole is underlined (the font type and style remain the same). The result is that the the weight of the underline changes with the different font sizes used. To paraphrase the bug report 50410 which I believe reports a problem with the same root cause - "it looks weird".

Actual Results:  
As per the Summary and Details given earlier.

Expected Results:  
As per the detailed description.

Provide a consistent underline weight as can be seen if the page is viewed using IE7. Preferably, the the underline weight should remain constant irrespective of the font type, style and size. The effect is the same whether one uses the deprecated <u> tag, or via the preferred "text-decoration: underline" route.
