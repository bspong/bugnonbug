In firefox 3.0.x it was possible to use keyboard shortcuts (left arrow, right arrow, Home,End) to move quickly between tabs (for example:End key to jump to the last tab)

It doesn't work in Firefox 3.5 RC1, and in the trunk(Minefield) . The "End" key for example, will cause a move to the end of the current page, instead of to the last tab.

The reason for the problem is probably because tabs are not "selected" like they used to in Firefox 3.0.x .
A mouse click on the tab chooses the tab and highlights it, but in Firefox 3 it would also mark it with a rectangle as if it is selected, and marks/signs that keyboard commands work currently on the tabs instead of on other objects (the current page, for example)




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open many tabs, choose a tab by clicking it with the mouse
2. Try to navigate with the keyboard shortcuts between tabs, moving a tab right, moving to the last tab, moving to the first tab, etc.

Actual Results:  
keyboard shortcuts navigate on the page of the current tab

Expected Results:  
keyboard shortcuts should be navigating between tabs
