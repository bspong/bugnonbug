scripts can automatically submit file uploads selected by the user

The gmail web application automatically uploads attachments selected in the background, so users can continue to compose their mail while the file uploads. Essentially, immediately after the user selects a file by clicking on the "Browse" button of a file <input> field, the script can begin uploading the file.

This could be a security problem if the user accidentally selects the wrong file (ex: confidential banking information, etc) and the script has the authority to commit the upload automatically.

I propose that form submissions involving file uploads that are triggered automatically (via javascript) offer the user a warning dialog box. Perhaps something like "The site http://www.gmail.com is attempting to automatically upload the file 'mybankinfo.doc'. Should gmail.com be allowed to upload this file?" with Yes and No options. This way, a user who made a mistake and selected the wrong file has an opportunity to correct the situation and select the right file before allowing the upload to proceed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Using gmail example:

1. Compose new message.
2. Attach a file.
3. Wait as gmail uploads the file.
Actual Results:  
The file is uploaded (silently).

Expected Results:  
My browser should confirm with me that I intended to upload this file before it allows the script to trigger the upload. On the other hand, if I purposefully submit the form by clicking a submit button on the page, I'm responsible for authorizing the upload and the browser need not confirm it a second time.

This could be made into a security setting so that users who were annoyed by the extra step to confirm an automatic upload could turn the feature off.
