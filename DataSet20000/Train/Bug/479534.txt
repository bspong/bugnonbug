Been using Wiki On A Stick (http://stickwiki.sourceforge.net) for a long time in Firefox. All parts work after updating to 3.06 except embedding a new image which fails with an "ActiveXObject is not defined".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load Wiki On A Stick (version 0.9.6b; 0.9.7b)and set up a wiki link in an existing page to trigger image embedding "[[Include::Image::mynewpicture.gif]]". Click this link and the wiki prompts you to "Browse" for the image file, choose one and click "Embed"
2. Occurs every time in every OS I have access to (Win2000, XP, Vista, Ubuntu Hardy, Intrepid)
3. 
Actual Results:  
Debug console:
[Exception..."Component returned failure code 0x80520001 (NS_ERROR_FILE_UNRECOGNISED_PATH) [nsILocalFile.initWithPATH]" nsresult: "0x80520001 (NS_ERROR_FILE_UNRECOGNISED_PATH)" location: "JS frame :: file:///xxxxx/xxxx/woas-0.9.6b.htm :: mozillaLoadFile :: line 1793" data: no] Exception while attempting to load

ReferenceError: ActiveXObject is not defined

Expected Results:  
I'm not sure how "the magic happens" but the java file should embed the image data into its own self-contained database.

I think you get (and have always got) a similar error when using Internet Explorer; though it often won't load the main file at all anyway. I don't embed that many images in my wiki notebooks so this bug may also be in slightly earlier versions. But it certainly worked flawlessly in the initial release and all versions of Firefox 2. The wiki file itself is not corrupt because my current workaround is fine - which is to use portable Firefox 2 from PortableApps.com in parallel just to perform this function).

Oh, if you get this far, thanks for taking a look. Cheers.
