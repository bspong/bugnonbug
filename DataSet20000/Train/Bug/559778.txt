Build Identifier: Firefox 3.6.3

Firefox starts OK, but gets progressively less responsive, with drop-down menus, the minimising or closure facility and new tab opening taking longer and longer until the whole thing freezes - leaving the 'Close window' instruction on the taskbar menu as the only way to close the program.  It seems similar in a way to the problem reported in Bug number 557938.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Use Firefox over a period of 15 minutes or more
3.
Actual Results:  
As stated in the description above, Firefox gets progressively less responsive, with drop-down menus taking longer to appear, minimising the program window or closing a tab creating an ever longer pause before occurring, until eventually none of the various facilities work - for instance, one can't close the program other than from the pop-up menu that appears when clicking on the taskbar icon.
