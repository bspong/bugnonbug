Open-Source CVS version of FF forces me to accept proprietary, non-Open-Source EULA (license)
As some of you may remember from the dark old times, mozilla.org is an Open-Source project. Apart from Open Source values (like freedom, privacy, user-centric, fairness), it means at the very minimum to use Open Source licenses (or Free Software licensese, as defined by OSI or FSF).

Unfortunately, Mozilla Corporation derived from that, using a non-Open-Source, proprietary license for the *binary* distributions of Firefox. In that sense, it is no more free than Netscape 6 was, which used a very similar license and almost identical setup (almost completely Open Source source code, but proprietary licences for binaries, and trademark).
So far so bad.

At least the source code is free of that, I lied to myself.

No more. Now, when compiling and starting CVS trunk "browser", I get a EULA which forces me to accept the proprietary license. I am not willing to, preventing me from using the official Mozilla browser. I don't want proprietary software on my computer - that was one of the big reasons why I contributed to Mozilla.

This is an Open-Source project, nothing else. Proprietary licenses have no place here. The removal of this EULA is *mandatory*.
(BTW: The click-through licenses have no effect in Germany, one of Firefox biggest userbases, anyways, clicking "Accept" does not make the user legally accept the license.)
