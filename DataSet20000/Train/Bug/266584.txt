default browser setting sets the "open" action without ensuring that it's the one being used (avant browser stays default browser after "Set as default" in Firefox)

i installed firefox a few days ago. before that i used avant browser.
making firefox my standard browser (in "options") did not work. it says that
firefox is already the standard browser, but every application (e.g.
thunderbird, trillian) opens avant browser for web links.

i think cause for that is:

avant brwoser creates a new standard action for url:http called "avantbrowser"
firfox only changes the open action but does not make it the standard action
same applies for https

making open the standard action again solved the problem for me

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. install avant browser and make it the standard browser
3. make firefox the standard browser
4. open a web link in a mail with thunderbird
Actual Results:  
the page will be displayed in avant broweser

Expected Results:  
the page should be displayed in firefox
