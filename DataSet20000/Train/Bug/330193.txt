When performing a Websearch using the new Windows Desktop Search Engine avalible for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, Firefox does not correctly interpret the search query string that is sent to it via a command line and instead displays a visualised file listing for 'file:///C:/?searchquery', which forms in to just a listing of the root of C:.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
With Firefox as the default browser:
1. Install the latest copy of Windows Desktop Search from here:
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=971793f2-95ac-4788-8006-92d848e67a40&DisplayLang=en
2. After installing, go to the new Search Deskbar and enter a query to search for.
3. While typing, the quick search panel opens, click the Web Search button.

Actual Results:  
A page is displayed showing a rendered listing of the root of C:, titled with 'file:///C:/?' followed by the search query (with spaces replaced with %20's)


Expected Results:  
The browser performs the same behaviour as typing '?searchquery' in to the location bar (with searchquery being the place holder for the search keywords), queries the default search engine with the displays the results page.

According to the Microsoft developer in at http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=277684&SiteID=1 this is due to a change in the way Firefox handles requests sent to its commandline in 1.5.x and above. MSN Desktop Search I should point out worked correctly prior to my upgrade to W-DS over MSN-DS.
