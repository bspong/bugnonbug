Add telemetry probes for page metadata collection
As Firefox starts collecting page metadata in bug 1393924, we'd like to add some telemetry probes to monitor more details of this feature, furthermore, we want to leverage those metrics to understand various potential impacts on Places database.

The data collection proposal,

# Objective

To better understand the impact on Places of page metadata collection. Specifically, the storage impact, query performance, and data expiration policy effects on Places database. 

# What to collect

We'd like to add following probes to http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/modules/ContentMetaHandler.jsm,

* To monitor the size (in bytes) of page metadata, for both description and preview image url in bytes.

* To gauge the availability of page metadata, which could be attained by counting the total number of page metadata parsing success, divided by the total number of page metadata parsing attempts.

# When to collect

All the probes will be activated when the user visit a page. Some metrics will only be collected if applicable, for instance, only record the size of metadata if it parses it successfully.

# Target channel

All the metrics would be calculated in aggregate but not individually, the target audience is for the users on the prerelease channel.

# Who will be using this

Both Activity Stream and Firefox Search teams will be analyzing it.
