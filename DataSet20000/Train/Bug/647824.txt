Session can't be restored if start page is other than about:home
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

When Firefox is opened after a disastrous failure, if the Start Page is other than about:home the custom Start Page will be opened and no option to restore the previous session will be shown to the user.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Change FF4's Start Page to another URL
2. Open lots of tabs and/or windows with relevant pages to you (research material and such)
3. Crash FF4 (i.e. powering off the computer)
4. Run FF4 again

Actual Results:  
Voila! You lost everything (your session will not be restored)

Expected Results:  
As this behavior differs from 3.6's, when a popup window would come and offer a clear option to restore previous session, FF4 depends on a page that may or may not be shown depending on user's configuration. Two ways to fix it are:
1. Restoring the popup window, or
2. Opening the about:page in when running it after an unclean exit.


The current way it's bein handled makes a PITA if you had 5 windows with ~20 tabs each, your Startup Page is different from about:home and FF4 exited uncleanly.
