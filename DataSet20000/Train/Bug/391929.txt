Hi,

Here's a suggestion for a little extra feature that will make Firefox stand out. 

I will usually use the bookmarks menu to save something I will refer to in future. However I often find that I'm cluttering up the menu with a ton of bookmarks that might not even visit in the next 6 months but still want to find again if required.

To remedy this the suggestion would be to have a new option in the file menu to simply save the url as a url file on the hard drive. There could also be an extra option in File Save as to save a complete web page and the url file in question in one sweep. For someone who is doing some little research on the web and is building up some reference material locally it would be invaluable and a lot more efficient than having to dig through bookmarks in Firefox or having to drag and drop through a maze of directories.
