When we try and move a smaller application window over the Firefox window ,
firefox depicts refresh/repaint problem.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1)Open a couple Firefox browser windows and open certain URLs within them.
2)Open a couple (or just one) other applications (Paint in my example).
3)Resize the application to a smaller window and then move it over Firefox
window(s). 


Actual Results:  
The application frame leaves behind a trail of unpainted frames and leaves the
background unreadable.

Expected Results:  
The application window should not leave any remains or trails behind while
moving. The browser window should be refreshed just in time while the
application window moves over it.

Follow up Tests :
a) we tried to carry the test for other browsers like internet explorer and
opera.The refresh/repaint problem was not evident.
b) we tested the application on slower computer running on low virtual memory
and fater computer with high virtual memory. Both gave almost similar outputs.

Importance of the Bug:
a)This bug gives inconvenience to the user, who must figure out how to force a
refresh, is so severe that no self-respecting software company should allow
known, egregious refresh bugs.
