Cannot check extensions compatibility after upgrading FF due to proxy password requests

When upgrading FF (e.g. 3.0.3 to 3.0.4), compatibility of add-ons is being checked, but when I am behind the proxy requiring a password, which is stored by password manager and protected with master password, many - MANY - requests for this master password are made simultaneously (see a screenshot on URL above). Some of them are "defective" (no text field to write the password into, shrunk buttons with no label) and even those that seem all right do only accept text input but do not react at all on either clicking on buttons or pressing Enter or Escape keys. Therefore the only way to go on is skipping the add-ons compatibility check by killing FF completely and run it again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. get behind a proxy requiring an authentication
2. store your proxy username and password and protect it by master password
3. get some add-ons
4. upgrade or downgrade FF to different version to force add-ons compatibility check
Actual Results:  
Multiple requests for master password (probably at least one for each installed add-on), some of them defective, none working, making desired compatibility check impossible to finish.

Expected Results:  
One master password request, working of course, which would decrypt the proxy password and use it to authenticate all subsequent proxy request enabling finishing of add-ons compatibility check.

On Windows the behaviour is similar, but not that bad, since it is actually possible there to enter the master password and send it to the application for the first time and then just dismiss all subsequent requests for it and send proxy password anyway. Annoying, but working.
