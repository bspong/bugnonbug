XP sp2. Adobe SVG viewer 6. Very basic svg file on desktop.
Access file through Firefox, perfect. Same with explorer.
Right click file and open with explorer, perfect.
Right click file and open with Firefox opens a box that tells me that it cannot
find the file but the file is opened by Firefox and displays properly.
This also happens when the file is opened directly by clicking on it.
No problems with explorer and no problems with Firefox except the annoying
warning is activated. The really annoying part is having to continually close
the warning if you are just testing a svg documentfrom a closed condition. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Firefox as default browser with adobe svg viewer 6.
2.Basic svg document on desktop which defaults to Firefox.
3.Click on svg document icon on desktop to open it.

Actual Results:  
Windows opens a box that says it cannot find the file but it does.

Expected Results:  
It should not have activated the error box as the file was found and opened
correctly.
