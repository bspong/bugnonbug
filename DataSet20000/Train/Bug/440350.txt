If my live bookmarks fail to load (because I have the proxy setting active for example) and then I change my proxy settings, the live bookmark loads as normal but the error text stays as the first item in the list for the live bookmark. The live bookmarks in question are on the Bookmarks Toolbar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add a live bookmark to the Bookmarks Toolbar
2. Load the feed for the live bookmark
3. Change the network settings to a non-existent proxy for example
4. Restart Firefox. The live bookmark should say "Live bookmark feed failed to load"
5. Change the network settings back to normal
6. Let the live bookmark feed reload by itself
7. Check the feed
5. 
Actual Results:  
It has the error text "Live bookmark feed failed to load" has the first item in the feed with the actual feed items below it.

If you reload the feed manually the error text disappears and the items reload correctly

Expected Results:  
It should remove the error text and replace it with the normal feed items
