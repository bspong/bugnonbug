Hotmail continually reloads page in later Firefox 3 versions *and* in Internet Explorer 9 Beta.

Title says it all - saw in the news today that this problem affects Firefox 4 so I wanted to mention that I have had the same exact issue with the last three or four releases of Firefox 3 and with Internet Explorer 9 Beta, as well. 

Details:

In the last three or four releases of Firefox 3, and in Internet Explorer 9 Beta, clicking on an email subject to open email results in new page continually reloading. Most of the time text of email does not load at all even after page stops reloading (which often never happens).  

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Sign into Hotmail account, click on Inbox, click Subject of email to open it, watch email fail to open and/or display text as page reloads continually.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Page never stops loading and/or text of email never loads even if page does stop loading.

Expected Results:  
Text of email does not load and page reloads continually. 

Software should load text of email and page should not keep reloading. 

I'm reporting this because I strongly believe it's a bug also currently present in Firefox 3 and exists in Internet Explorer 9 Beta, as well - which could mean it might be Hotmail's fault, or at least a defect common to both browsers, in which case a different solution than expected might be needed. 

For what it's worth, I have a slow/ extremely unpredictable wireless Internet connection, which might mean the problem is originating from how Hotmail loads up emails.
