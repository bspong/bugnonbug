[UX] UX for Sync Migration while migration is in progress
This bug is to breakdown the UX for the sync migration *during the migration* - ie, once the user has opted to begin.

Specifically, part of the migration process will require the user to create a FxA account and wait for verification.  While we can open about:accounts to begin this process, we can't force the user to complete the process, and have no control over how long the notification email takes to arrive (if it arrives at all).

Note that the browser might exit during this process - the browser could crash, the user could accept an upgrade notification, or the user may simply forget what they were doing.

With the current thinking, the primary states the migration will be in are:

* Offer accepted, waiting for signin to FxA account.
    We can open about:accounts, but must wait for the uer.

* Signed in to FxA account, but waiting for it to be verified.
    We can't really do anything to help this along other than remind
    the user we are waiting.

* Account verified, but waiting for us to upload the FxA account name for migration on subsequent devices.
    This doesn't require user interaction, but will depend on the 
    state of the network and even our Sync infrastructure.

* Waiting for the first FxA sync to complete
    Although once we are in this state we are effectively complete, so
    there may be no need to have any special UX in this state.
