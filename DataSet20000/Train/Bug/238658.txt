Thunderbird can't launch URLs from restarted Firefox. Profile Manager shows instead.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040217 Firefox/0.8.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040217 Firefox/0.8.0+

If Firefox is started by clicking in a link in an email message, everything
works fine. However, if Firefox is subsequently restarted, then when you click
on a URL in an email, the Firefox profile manager shows up instead, and you
can't select the same profile because it's already running.

This is very similar to bug 177996, but they claim that's a Linux bug rather
than a Mozilla/Firefox bug, and suggested filing a new bug on this.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start with neither Firefox nor Thunderbird running.
2. Launch Thunderbird and click on a URL in an email. This launches Firefox.
3. Click on another URL. This still works fine, and just brings up the URL in
the open window.
4. Close and restart Firefox.
5. Click on another URL in Thunderbird.

Actual Results:  
The Firefox profile manager appears, not allowing you to launch the URL.

Expected Results:  
The URL should have been displayed in the existing open Firefox window.

This used to work a few months ago. I'm using Thunderbird build 20040214.
