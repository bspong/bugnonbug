Add telemetry for sync migration progress.
As part of migrating users to Fxa sync we want to capture some metrics.  Bug 1019395 is the meta bug for all such metrics (ie, including those that can be captured by the various servers).  For this bug I want to focus just on telemetry in the client.

For background: The migration will be driven by a state machine.  The states are, eg:
* waiting for the server to advertise a migration offer (ie, server sends "EOL" notifications)
* waiting for the user to create an FxA account.
* waiting for the user to click on the verification email for their account.
* waiting for an existing sync to finish
* waiting for us to write a migration sentinel
* aaand, we are done.

The UI will help the user through these states (eg, open about:accounts at the right time, etc), and in edge-cases the states may move backwards (eg, user logs out of their FxA account before they verify it).

I'd like to capture the progress of these states via telemetry.  Eg, "how many users saw the offer to upgrade but never made an account", or "how many didn't get past the 'verify your account' state, etc.

gps, benjamin: I'm looking for advice on how to best measure this in telemetry.  Eg, should I have one new probe name per state and count how many times we enter it?  Or maybe assign a number to each state and record the max number we reach?  Or something else entirely?

Note we have existing probes for "is this using legacy sync", and "are they using the default servers" - so we'd also like to be able to determine how many users with legacy sync saw that offer to upgrade (which once this is unthrottled, should be everyone using legacy sync against the default server) - I assume we can make these correlations - is that correct?
