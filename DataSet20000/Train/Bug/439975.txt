Wrong URL address opens from clicked email message link

I upgraded to Firefox 3 yesterday. Now when clicking some specific links in Windows Live Mail Desktop messages (Firefox as default) the link opens a referring page. Example: Click http://picasaweb.google.com/RussellJumonville/PoliticsAndMore/photo#5213014542656927714 , page that opens is http://picasaweb.google.com/RussellJumonville/PoliticsAndMore/photo#5079063345422906706 . If I copy the link and paste it into the Firefox address bar, the correct page opens. If I change the default browser to IE7, clicking the link in the email message opens the correct page. Problem did not exist with Firefox 2. I cleaned the Cache (history, cookies, etc.) for both Firefox and IE7. I did an error check of my hard drive and restarted computer. Problem still exists.

System: Windows XP Pro, SP3; Firefox version 3.0; Windows Live Mail Desktop version 2008 (Build 12.0.1606).
