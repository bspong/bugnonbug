FF crash every time on attempting to render this page in normal or safe mode

Immediate FF application crash when attempting to render this page.
I have the following extensions: Adblock v.5 d2 Nightly 39
Flashblock 1.2.9 / BugMeNot 0.7 / FlatStyle 0.9.2.1 / TabBrowser Preferences 1.2.8.5
However, problem occurs in FF Safe Mode too, suggesting that extensions are not
the cause. 
The page uses moderately complex Javascript - I wonder if that is the trigger
for the crash?
This occurs on two separate PC systems on my home LAN - hardware summaries below.
