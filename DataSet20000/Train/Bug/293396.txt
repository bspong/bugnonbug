Home Page Multiple Tabs - Last tab URL malformed
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.3

I've used the Mozilla suite and Fx for over 2 years and just found a bug that
seems to have started in 1.0.3.
My Home Page consists of 9 tabs. The last tab gives an error. The other tabs
come up correctly.
But the last tab, whatever, website it is, is problematic. All the the actual
URl and the URLs referenced in the Home Page location box are placed here.

The Home Page location box appears ok, with each URL appearing correctly,
separated by the | symbol, including the last one.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to website, new tab, browse another website
2.Repeat for a few tabs
3. Tools Options- General- Use Current Pages
4. OK
5. Close and reopen Fx
6> Check last tab - 

Actual Results:  
the URL in the address box will be malformed: it consists of the desired address
followed by the contents of the homepage location box eg.
http://tv.yahoo.com/grid?http://www.mail.com/http://mail.lycos.com/scripts/common/index.main?signin=1&lang=us|https://selfcare.bcgi.net/boost/index.htmhttp://tv.yahoo.com/grid?lineup=us_DMA807&.hier=us_DMA807http://www.craigslist.org/http://www.worldtimeserver.com/?locationid=AU-VIChttp://www.garlic.com/~triblet/swell/wamglance.html

Expected Results:  
Open a group the group of tabs in the same state as they were saved
