Youtube video links on web pages create moments of unresponsiveness
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:16.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/16.0
Build ID: 20121010144125

Steps to reproduce:

Browse forums with embedded Youtube links. 


Actual results:

It makes Firefox unresponsive for several moments only when you mouse over the embedded video graphic (but not clicking). It's obvious because the mouse cursor turns into a hand, then you can move away from the graphic and it stays a hand for several moments. But the longer you leave the page up, the quicker it responds. Eventually going down to about 1-2 second response. I have the latest Firefox and Flash afaik (just updated them). Flash 11.4.402.287. Firefox 16.0.1 (ok, i see there is yet another update, I'm about to apply it and see if that helps).

It is on this site: http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=379599

And it has been happening ever since I updated Firefox and flash about a week ago, and still after another flash update this morning. About to update Firefox again. 


Expected results:

Cursor should have been nearly instant response when I simply mouse over the graphic and continue past the graphic.
