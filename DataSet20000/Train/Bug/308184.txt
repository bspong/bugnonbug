Tried to install 1.0.6 over my 1.0.4 (at your insistence!);
After eintirely eliminating my 1.0.4 installation (bugger!) the installer
gave an error message, something about -214 not being found.

The User Forum has similar reports, but the only suggestion was to delete the 
files in Windows' Temp folder, which did not help as I still got the same error
message the second time I tried.

BTW, all I wanted to do was to install an extension, but found that someone in
their infinite wisdom decided to not permit it until after I installed the
latest release.  Now, I can't even use Firefox at all!  Wouldn't it have been
kinder and more user friendly to relate old Extension versions to the versions
of FF that they'd work with--and permit access?  Maybe I didn't really want to
be bothered with waiting on a full half-hour upgrade download, not to mention
the days(!) delay in trying to correct the mess someone's installer has made of
my system.  BTW2, the previous 1.0.4 installer worked like a charm!
