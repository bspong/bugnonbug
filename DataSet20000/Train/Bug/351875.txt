Closing Firefox cause XP crash and auto-reboot

This is the second time this has happened in the last couple of months. I click the upper right x to close Firefox, immediately get a blue screen for less than a second (not enough time to read anything), then screen goes dark and shortly reboot starts.  After letting everything get initalized, I start Firefox.  All bookmarks and search engines are gone.  I close Firefox and look in my profile.  I  have not made a lot of bookmarks since I lost seven years of bookmarks in the first crash.  Both the .html and .bak files are 31K.  I double click the .html to have a look at it.  The page is blank.   I close Firefox.  I see both file lengths change to 1 KB.  

I'd be glad to provide more data if anyone cares to work on this.

From looking at bugs about bookmarks, i take it this is two problems: Something caused the crash.  The longstanding habit of deleting bookmarks and the like in various circumstandes has not been fixed.
