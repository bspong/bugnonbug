Selecting remove personal data description text should clearly state that it removes *all* Firefox personal data

It is possible several versions of Firefox on one Windows computer. I usually use the stable version and sometimes install betas. When i uninstall a beta, i am asked: "Remove my personal data and customizations". If the checkbox is checked, all cookies, extensions, bookmarks etc. are removed and it pertains to all installed versions. This is confusing and desctructive. For example, a bookmark that is added in Fx 2 is not seen in Fx3, but when Fx3 is unistalled, it is deleted. It happened to me today - i uninstalled Firefox 3.0b5, and i thought that only the personal data for the beta will be removed, but when i came back to 2.0.0.14, all my bookmarks were gone. I mark this as critical, because it did cause me to lose data. I understand that betas can give you unpleasant surprises and i guess that i should have been more careful, but the installer should have notified me about the danger.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 2.
2. Install Firefox 3 beta on the same computer.
3. Add a bookmark in Fx 2.
4. Add a search engine to the search bar in Fx 2.
4. Open Firefox 3. The search engine is seen. The bookmark is not seen, which is probably OK, but kinda confusing.
5. Uninstall Firefox 3 and check "Remove my personal data and customizations". All bookmarks, search engines, cookies etc. are deleted.
Actual Results:  
All bookmarks, search engines, cookies etc. are deleted.

Expected Results:  
Something else. At least there should be a clearer warning: If you do this, then personal data for ALL VERSIONS OF FIREFOX installed on this computer will be destroyed.
