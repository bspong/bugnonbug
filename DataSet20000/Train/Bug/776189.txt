bug 771826 breaks Marionette's navigate() method
Created attachment 644556
test case

bug 771826 has broken Marionette's navigate method, which is implemented here:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/marionette/marionette-listener.js#494

Specifically, setting curWindow.location no longer has any effect (and produces no errors in the logfile); before https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/934ef44ce5af it worked normally.  See bug 776117 for full bisection details.

To reproduce:

 - download a debug build from TBPL, or make a build yourself with ENABLE_MARIONETTE=1 in mozconfig
 - launch Firefox, and add the pref marionette.defaultPrefs.enabled = true; restart Firefox
 - go to m-c/testing/marionette/client and run 'python setup.py develop' to install Marionette Python dependencies
 - download the attached test and execute:  python navigate.py

results:  Marionette opens a new tab (as it should) but the navigate command has no effect.  There are no errors in the logfile.
expected results:  After opening a new tab, the browser would navigate immediately to www.mozilla.com.

In stepping through Marionette code, everything works correctly until http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/marionette/marionette-listener.js#495; setting curWindow.location now has no effect.
