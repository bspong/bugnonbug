Add (more) UI for appcache alert/permissions
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20131028225529

Steps to reproduce:

Since firefox 26 "There is no longer a prompt when websites use appcache" ( http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/26.0/releasenotes/ ). 

But "Menu bar > Edit> Preferences > Advanced > Network > Alerts when a website request storage for offline use" is still checked but does not warn the user. Moreover in "about:permissions" blocking one website is not working anymore.

 * open http://www.whatwg.org/demos/offline/clock/live-demo/clock.html
 * notice there's no alert while "Alerts when a website request storage for offline use" is still checked in preferences.
 * close the clock tab 
 * empty offline data

 * go to http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/offline.html#offline
 * open another tab to "about:permissions" and forbid whatwg.org to save offline data
 * open http://www.whatwg.org/demos/offline/clock/live-demo/clock.html
 * switch to offline mode
 * reopen http://www.whatwg.org/demos/offline/clock/live-demo/clock.html
 * notice that the data were saved in appcache while specifically forbidden in "about:permissions"


Actual results:

appcache now ignore the user settings for both "alert" and "about:permissions"



Expected results:

The alert setting should be disabled by default, but still be working if changed by user (See 887102; 648064).

The "about:permission" settings should be respected.
