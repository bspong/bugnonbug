At the url above when you click on one of the links prefixed with "Part xx:
xxx", a RealPlayer soundtrack stream starts playing. When I click on the link in
the popup window called "Unfiltered Player" sometimes Firebird crashes. In the
JavaScript console I get the following.

 Error: Newwin has no properties

Line 7

I don't know why it crashes. It does not do at every time. It may be that it
only  crashes when RealOne Player is already open.
I have Firebird set so it will automatically open the files there in RealOne Player.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the url and click on one of the links to play a part.
2. Click on the link titled Unfiltered Player in the popup window.
3.
Actual Results:  
Firebird crashed.

Expected Results:  
Kept on with it.

I always close the popup windows as soon as I click on Unfiltered Player and the
file opens in RealOne Player.
I like to play it in the player rather than the window with no controls.
