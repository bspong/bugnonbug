Filtering by multiple tags in OSX 10.5 Wiki does not work - reverts to all results.

Any attempt to filter by more than 1 "tag" in the OSX 10.5 Wiki returns all results.  Reproducible in Firefox and Opera, but Safari behaves as expected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Example:

Wiki page "ONE" w/ tags "small", "odd"
Wiki page "TWO" w/ tags "small", "even"
WIki page "THREE" w/ tags "small", "odd", "prime"


--NEW Search w/ no criteria returns all 3 pages. Displayed URL is:

https://<server>/groups/<group_name>/search/?q=


--NEW Search w/ tag "odd" returns 2 results - ONE and THREE and shows additional tags as checkboxes to further filter results.  Displayed URL is:

https://<server>/groups/<group_name>/search/?tag=odd

----Check filter by "prime" SHOULD return just "THREE" but actually returns all 3 results as if the search had been re-set.  Displayed URL is: 

https://<server>/groups/<group_name>/search/?q=&sortDirection=reverse&kind=all&sort=date

The same action in Safari produces this URL:

https://<server>/groups/<group_name>/search/?q=&sortDirection=reverse&kind=all&sort=date&tag=odd&tag=prime



SOS-APPL claims they can't reproduce it, but it happens for me on multiple clients in multiple non-Safari browsers.  Safari behaves normally.

Can anyone else at least confirm this so I can go back to Apple and lean on them?
Actual Results:  
The search resets to no tags, returns all results.  If I copy the correct URL from Safari (see Steps to Reproduce) and paste into Firefox it shows the correct result, but clicking another checkbox to add a third tag filter reverts to the empty search (all results)

Expected Results:  
Adding tags to filter by should return increasingly smaller list of results.

Apple support claims they were unable to reproduce.  I suspect this is a lie.
