Pausing a Flash Player fullscreen Video and permitting screensaver does not repaint correctly.
Created attachment 575807
OS's Screen after dropping out of Screensaver with a paused fullscreen Video.

When on YouTube sometimes it is necessary to pause Flash Player Video (that is playing in fullscreen).

After some time (when the Video is paused and the Computer is unused) the screensaver will activate.

Hitting a Key or moving the Mouse will deactivate the screensaver but Firefox does not repaint the Screen correctly.

What you end up with is:

1. Firefox's Chrome (restored to last position and size), 'on top'.
2. The Operating System's Taskbar.
3. The paused Video still in fullscreen ('under the Chrome').

See attachment of the Screenshot.
