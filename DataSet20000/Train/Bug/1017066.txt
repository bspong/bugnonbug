localStorage and sessionStorage corrupted / unavailable after browser update, before restart
Sometimes, localStorage and sessionStorage objects cease functioning. This appears to occur after a browser update, and has been observed on Fx 29 through Fx 32, on 64 bit OS X and Ubuntu.

I have not managed to deterministically repro this bug, though I have experienced it firsthand.

CarlFK on IRC just experienced this bug on Fx 29.0, running on 64-bit Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

Symptoms:

- After performing `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade`, Persona started showing him an "Unsupported Browser" error message, which was rooted in broken localStorage support.

- When visiting the Persona Troubleshooting page at https://people.mozilla.org/~fmarier/troubleshoot.html, it reported that his browser defined both localStorage and sessionStorage, but that it did not support either.

- In the Web Console for that page, `window.localStorage` prints `[object Storage]` instead of the expected `Storage { length: 0 }` pretty-printing.

- Attempting `window.localStorage.setItem('foo', 1)` yields `[Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x8052000b (NS_ERROR_FILE_CORRUPTED) [nsIDOMStorage.setItem]"  nsresult: "0x8052000b (NS_ERROR_FILE_CORRUPTED)"  location: "JS frame :: debugger eval code :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 1"  data: no]`

- Everything works as expected in a new Private Browsing window.

- After restarting the browser (to complete the upgrade), everything works as expected.
