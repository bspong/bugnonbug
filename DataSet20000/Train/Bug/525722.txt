Double page load breaks internet banking, when charset autodetection enabled

I use an online banking service at https://ib.npbs.co.uk/

You can see the second stage of the login process if you enter a feasible customer number, such as 1200000. It shows you a frameset including 'password.asp' which asks for characters from your password and part of your date of birth.

When charset autodetection is enabled, that second stage of the login process is detected as being in the Windows-1252 charset.

If I enter my correct account details, the LiveHTTPHeaders plugin shows me that Firefox logs in successfully and sends a successful GET for the AccountSummary.asp page. However, for some reason Firefox sends a second GET for that same page, immediately after the first. As a security measure, the second GET is given a redirect to the login page, and the session is terminated.
Firefox never displayed the first AccountSummary.asp page; the effect is that I'm just logged out as soon as I log in.

If I disable charset autodetection, or if I leave it enabled but manually switch to iso8859-1 when I'm viewing the password.asp page, this double GET doesn't happen and everything works fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get an account at the Norwich and Peterborough Building Society
2. Apply for online banking access
3. Enable charset autodetection in firefox
