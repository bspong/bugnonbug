Site is almost completely flash based. Animated flash, flash animations consume 50-99% of CPU cycles. I tested with IE and though the animations in flash do indeed play and about the same as in Firefox, IE apparently polices the flash application's use of CPU much better than Firefox does. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to Pizzahut.com using Firefox. 
2.Flash animations play. 
3.CPU cycles are consumed such that you cannot click any tabs. 
4.Type control-alt-delete to start task manager, click on processes tab. Click heading of CPU column, firefox comes to top and stays there. 50-99%.
5 Close site in firefox, firefox cpu usage declines. 
6 Go to site in IE, problem does not occur. 
Actual Results:  
Firefox freezes the entire computer while playing flash animations. This might be only flash animations with certain attributes, but I couldn't determine which.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should police the flash application's use of resources.
