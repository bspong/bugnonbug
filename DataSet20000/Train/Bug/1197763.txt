Fix or remove this modeline.

browser/components/search/content/search.xml:#ifdef XP_MACOSX
browser/components/search/content/search.xml:#else
browser/components/search/content/search.xml:#endif
browser/components/search/content/search.xml:#ifdef XP_MACOSX
browser/components/search/content/search.xml:#else
browser/components/search/content/search.xml:#endif

Both of these are about ctrlKey vs. metaKey. I believe they can be replaced by just:

event.getModifierState("Accel")

browser/components/search/content/search.xml:#ifndef XP_MACOSX
browser/components/search/content/search.xml:#endif

This can be converted to a simple JS handler that gets attached in the constructor of the binding, or can be made to no-op (ensuring the event still gets propagated and handled correctly elsewhere!) on OSX.

Finally, this file needs to have its "*" removed in jar.mn
