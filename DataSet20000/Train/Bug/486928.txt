Java applet does not render correctly

When I log in to the live timing the top of the applet window is initially cut off. I can regain the top rows if I scroll down, however, when I open the timing applet in a separate window, I can not get the top rows back.
Also, the timing information does not update timely. It appears that the old information does not get updated and cleared correctly. The screen updates when I hit the 'resize' corner. The applet works correctly in Safari and on the latest stable and beta version of Firefox in Windows. I updated the OS X browser to the beta version, just to see if it would cure the problem.

Actual Results:  
Applet loads and the live timing information is displayed. The top 4 or 5 rows do not show up. Timing information does not update correctly.

Expected Results:  
All of the applet screen should display. Screen updates (sector times, position changes etc.) show immediately and correctly.
