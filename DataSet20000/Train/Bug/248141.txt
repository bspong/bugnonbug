Use of Ctrl-Shift-Tab can cause Firefox to freeze up
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.9

With several tabs open in a Firefox window, using Ctrl-Shift-Tab (to try to
select the previous tab) can cause Firefox to freeze up. This has happened to me
four times today, although Ctrl-Shift-Tabs has worked hundreds of times today
without
problems ... ;-|

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox
2. Open several tabs
3. Display one of the later (rightwards) tabs
     [[I don't know if this matters, but every time Firefox froze up on me
       I was in one of the later tabs.]]
4. Press Ctrl-Shift-Tab.

Actual Results:  
Clicking the tab handles, toolbar buttons or menus causes the cursor to change
to an hourglass, meaning "busy", but had no other effect. Firefox did not
respond to any clicks on keystrokes.
The window stopped refreshing.
Windows XP reported the application as "(Not Responding)" and so on.


Expected Results:  
Selected the previous tab

Theme: default (only one installed)
Extensions: Single Window, Duplicate Tab, LinkVisitor
