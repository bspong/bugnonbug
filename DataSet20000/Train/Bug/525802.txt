webmail 1.3.3 will not install on Firefox 3.5.4; thus I cannot get Thunderbird to be able to get my hotmail downloaded

Downloaded from Mozilla website latest versions of Firefox and Thunderbird 11-1-09.   As best I can tell from doing searches on how Thunderbird accesses "hotmail", it appears that I must first install a webmail firefox add-on, then install a specific hotmail add-on.  [The Thunderbird tutorial is woefully inadequate in that it leaves all of this out!].  However, the webmail addon will not install to the Firefox 3.5.4 version.  Help!  It's a catch 22; impossible to make Thunderbird work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create hotmail account and server settings in Thunderbird
2. go to http://webmail.mozdev.org/installation.html and download webmail 1.3.3
3. try to install this add-on to Firefox 3.5.4 and get error message
4. cannot install the hotmail add-on to Thunderbird without webmail 1.3.3 first
Actual Results:  
as above

Expected Results:  
versions should be compatible
