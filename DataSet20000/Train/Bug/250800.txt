no browsing and mousewheel functionality when "save as" open
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2

Firefox hangs until an open modal box of type "Save As" is closed. By having two
or more firefox instances open, one cannot browse on any of the instances while
the dialog is open in one of them. Various other effects, such as mouse wheel
scrolling stops working and a new instance of firefox cannot be opened.

Have two browsers open. On the one do something so that a "Save As" modal dialog
opens. Switch to the other browser and try to browse. Browsing becomes
impossible and the mousewheel does not scroll the page if one is open. On top of
that a new firefox instance cannot be started.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have two browsers open.
2. On the one do something so that a "Save As" modal dialog opens. ( be it a
file, link, page or image that you want to save )
3. Go to the other instance of firefox and try to browse or scroll.

Actual Results:  
any isntances of the browser hang until the modal box "Save as" is closed

Expected Results:  
Like with the Open File modal box it should not affect other instance of the
browser, but rather lock the particular instance that requested the dialog.
