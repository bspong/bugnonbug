EXE downloads cancelled immediately in Firefox 3.6 if Windows Internet zone security setting = High
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6

When Windows's Internet zone security setting is set to High, Firefox 3.6 is no longer able to download EXE files, even after applying about:config tweaks that used to work in Firefox 3.5.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure IE and Firefox are both closed.
2. Open Control Panel > Internet Options > Security Tab
3. Choose 'Internet' zone and drag the security setting slider to 'High'.
4. Press OK to apply and quit. Verify that the Internet zone security setting is indeed 'High'.
5. Open Firefox.
6. Download any Windows executable, e.g. paste a URL similar to the following into the address bar: http://ftp.sunet.se/pub/www/clients/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/3.5.6/win32/en-US/Firefox%20Setup%203.5.6.exe or http://download.microsoft.com/download/whistler/Install/2/WXP/EN-US/CmdHerePowertoySetup.exe
7. If Firefox prompts you "Are you sure you want to download this file?", choose Yes. If Firefox prompts you for a download folder, choose any writable folder.
8. If the "Downloads" window doesn't pop up, choose Tools > Downloads to show it.

Actual Results:  
The "Downloads" window shows the file to be downloaded with "Cancelled" written below it. A zero-byte file is also created on disk (see attached screenshot).

Expected Results:  
The download should start, and the EXE file should be saved to disk.

In Firefox 3.5 one could obtain the expected results by setting browser.download.manager.skipWinSecurityPolicyChecks to True in about:config. This no longer works for Firefox 3.6.

Other browsers like Chrome (v4 stable) and Opera (v10.10) are able to download EXEs even if the Internet zone security setting = High.

One can mitigate the issue for Firefox by re-setting Windows's/IE's Internet Zone security setting = Medium-High. However, given recent IE malware troubles, it'd be great if IE could be kept as locked down as possible without it affecting Firefox.

Note - this was tested on Windows XP SP3 only.
