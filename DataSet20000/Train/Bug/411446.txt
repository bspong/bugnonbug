Firefox 3.0b2 takes much longer to display page than 2.0.0.x
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.5) KHTML/3.5.8 (like Gecko)

The page in at http://www.jdocs.com/page/AjaxSourceCode?oid=57047 takes a much longer time to display in Firefox 3.0b2 than in Firefox 2.0.0.x. During this time, Firefox is unresponsive (This is not a network issue, as you can reproduce it by saving the page and opening it as a file).

This also affects the latest Tinderbox build (as of 2007-01-09 03:55 UTC)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start with a clean install of Firefox 3.0b2 (no plugins or extensions) and a fresh profile.
2. Go to http://www.jdocs.com/page/AjaxSourceCode?oid=57047
Actual Results:  
Firefox appears to hang for about 2 minutes. Then the top of the page is displayed, but scrolling (and the rest of the UI) is not responsive for an additional 2-3 minutes.

Expected Results:  
Firefox 2.0.0.11 loads the page and becomes responsive enough to scroll after about 20 seconds. Firefox 3.0b2 should be able to match this at least. Konqueror 3.5.8 (Debian Lenny) loads the page in about 10 seconds, and Opera 9.25 loads the page almost immediately.

System information:
 * 2.6 GHz Pentium 4 (Northwood)
 * 1GB RAM (system memory monitor shows that there is no shortage of memory, even while Firefox is loading the page)
 * Debian Testing (Lenny)
 * Xorg 7.2 using "intel" driver for 82865G, DRI available
