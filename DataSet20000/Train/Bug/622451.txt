Address bar from one window may be made to appear as if belonging to another
Hi folks,

Not sure if you care, but in the default configuration, Firefox 3.6 on Win makes it possible to hide the status bar and other essential chrome by apparently miscalculating the minimum permissible value for window.outerHeight. Try this:

http://www.example.com
javascript:void(window.outerHeight=1)

Jesse also mentioned that Firefox 4 deals away with the status bar. Both of these behaviors permit several windows to be almost seamlessly "spliced" together, so that a small window showing the address bar is shown on top of a partly obscured, aligned window that displays content from another origin.

I previously put together a demo of this for Chrome (http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/chsplice/); the same principle would apply to Firefox. The resulting document appearance is:

In Firefox, the attacker can also use focus() and blur(), which makes more convincing attacks with three windows possible.

I realize this is a fringe concern, but it may make sense to tackle it at some point. Possible options involve graying out address bars for any windows not currently on top, or at least sinking an initial click when a background window is brought into focus, so that the vector can't be used for a form of clickjacking.
