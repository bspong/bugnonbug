Firefox is not escaping parentheses when sending a mailto command to an external mail-client.

I have Firefox set to invoke Thunderbird as my mail client by defining network.protocol-handler.app.mailto in my user.js file to be a script which checks for a running thunderbird and passes it the mailto URI.
However, Firefox is not escaping parentheses which exist in the Web page title when it sends them as the subject, so thunderbird cannot parse it.
The example URI produces this:

/local/thunderbird/thunderbird -remote 'mailto(?body=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtoforge.com%2Faccess-linux-partitions-from-windows&subject=Three%20Ways%20To%20Access%20Linux%20Partitions%20(ext2%2Fext3)%20From%20Windows%20On%20Dual-Boot%20Systems%20%7C%20HowtoForge%20-%20Linux%20Howtos%20and%20Tutorials)'
Error: Failed to send command: 500 command not parseable

If I change the ( and ) in "(ext2/ext3)" to be %28 and %29 thunderbird works as expected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open example URI in Firefox
2. Click on File -> Send Link...
3. If you have Thunderbird set up as your mailer - nothing happens.
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens

Expected Results:  
Thunderbird should open a Compose window with the Subject and body completed.
