Run Mode=Silent config.ini setting not poputaling Start menu icons
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; InfoPath.1)
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.0.6

If I extract the files for the 1.0.6 build and edit the "config.ini" file and 
change it to "Run Mode=Silent" things seem to work with the exception that the 
Start menu and icons are not populated (I think this goes for the desktop and 
QuickLaunch icons as well). The steps I used worked just fine for build 1.0.5 
and things worked fine before. The program seems to execute properyl if I use 
the .EXE located in the pgram directory, but there's just no Start menu icon.

Also, the "Run Mode=Auto" still doesn't work - but I think that was noted as a 
bug in previous builds already.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the setup file.
2. Manually execute the setup file, but do not complete it.
3. Copy the contents on the extracted files within the Temp folder to get the 
installation files needed.
4. Edit the "Config.ini" file and change the line to "Run Mode=Silent" and 
save the file again.
5. Double-click the "setup.exe" file to launch the installation.

Actual Results:  
The installation runs silentlt, displaying no dialog or progress windows as 
expected. When it's finished there are no Start menu or desktop icons. I 
believe there is a "Mozilla Firefox" folder generated, but it's empty.

Expected Results:  
It should have placed the needed Start menu icons within the "Mozilla Firefox" 
Start menu folder.

I had 1.0.5 working just fine with the "Run Mode=Silent". I also uninstalled 
any existing versions using Add/Remove Programs, and also ran through the 
registry to make sure I didn't have any remnants. I also tried this on three 
other WinXP machines with the same results.
