Hi 

I already posted the bug # [Bug 555554], same problem. I got from <jo.hermans@gmail.com> the advise to replace "document.all" by "document.getElementByID("..").

I did so, but still it is not working.
"InnerHTML" with text is working without a problem, but Flash's arent.

This is working in Safari, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer > 7 and Opera.

Thank you for a feedback

Daniel
