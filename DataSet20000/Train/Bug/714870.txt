Downloads do not download into the designated folder
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:9.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/9.0.1
Build ID: 20111220165912

Steps to reproduce:

Using Tools -> Options -> Downloads, I specified a folder (Downloads) under Desktop -> (userid) -> Downloads.  I performed downloads (attachments in emails - gmail, hotmail, yahoo).


Actual results:

The download is placed in a temporary folder.
Users ->(user id) -> AppData -> Local -> Temp




Expected results:

It should have downloaded into the designated folder, not the Temp folder.  Since this is an egregious error, I have tried various things to no avail.  Upgraded to Firefox 9.0.1, changed the target folder to something else and back to Downloads, restarted Firefox, ...running out of things to try.  I did look at Run:  firefox.exe -p but the only profile shown was 'default' and I have never done anything to create special profile options, so I can't imagine how this is working everywhere else, but not for me.  I am on Vista Service Pack 2 on Acer Aspire E380 32-bit OS.  I could do some screen prints to show you that I really did enter a valid folder for my downloads, but I am not going to bother for now.  There must be something really obvious going on, but I have no clue what.
