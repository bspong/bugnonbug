Honor a user's preferences for retaining history entries
My history is set to retain 180 days, and in recent (early Nov 2007) nightlies I've noticed that pages which I *know* I've visited in the past 6 months are no longer appearing in my location bar drop down or history sidebar.

I brought this up with Dietrich in IRC, and he diagnosed:

23:07 < dietrich> hm, i think the problem is that we expire moz_places records w/ zero visits
23:07 < dietrich> that are not 180 days old
23:07 <@beltzner> don't understand the last bit there ... "that are not 180 days old"?
23:08 < dietrich> right now we don't cap moz_places records (unique urls)
23:08 < dietrich> we only expire visits
23:08 <@beltzner> oh
23:09 < dietrich> but the net effect is that your urls go away when they have no visits
23:09 <@beltzner> and you search the visit table?
23:10 < dietrich> well, the query joins against it
23:10 <@beltzner> right
23:10 < dietrich> but i think that we're overpruning (not just b/c of the 20k)
23:10 < dietrich> i think that moz_places records w/ a visit count > 0 shouldn't be removed until they hit the date limit

I would agree with that assertion; if the user has set a date cap, it's going to be strange for them to see history go missing.

The next bit of our discussion centered on the cap, and how it's implemented; this might result in some additional bugs, just recording here:

23:11 < dietrich> that's the problem w/ a deterministic cap: penalizes high-volume users
23:12 <@beltzner> so what are we pruning, the visit table to 20k entries?
23:13 < dietrich> yeah. but any URLs that end up w/ zero records due to the pruning well then get removed at shutdown, and that's really unecessary
23:13 < dietrich> well, not true
23:14 < dietrich> moz_places is the biggest percentage of places.sqlite, so it's great for performance, just not great for high-volume users
