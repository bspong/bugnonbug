Weird behavior with add bookmarks dialog (long dialogs with extra fields/delete and done buttons don't work/title not filled out)
Sorry about the title but too much going on to sum it up in a summary.

Happened to me a few times today with different builds, oldest 090704 and newest 09110? build.  Steps that I did:

1) Clicked once on the white star and the add bookmark dialog came up (first sign of this whole bug report)
2) There was no title filled out and the location and description fields were shown which usually aren't (bug 394104)
3) I hit delete to not save the bookmark
4) nadda happens, i click on the page to make that dialog lose focus and close 
5) I look in the error console and have the below errors
6) click the yellow star and delete the "bookmark"
7) try to reproduce my steps after restarting firefox and I can't reproduce

(the dialog opening)
Error: gEditItemOverlay is not defined
Source File: chrome://browser/content/browser.js
Line: 5070

(clicking delete)
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE) [nsINavBookmarksService.getItemTitle]"  nsresult: "0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/places/editBookmarkOverlay.js :: EIO__getItemStaticTitle :: line 246"  data: no]

(I guess making the dialog lose focus)
Error: this._folderTree has no properties
Source File: chrome://browser/content/places/editBookmarkOverlay.js
Line: 345

I have reproduced this a few times today but it happened at random times and seems to only happen once per build or at least once per session
