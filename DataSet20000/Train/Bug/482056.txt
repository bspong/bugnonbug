there is already an add-on available to implement the "mousezoom" feature, but i think most people could benefit from the "holding right mouse button then scroll" shortcut. it takes some time getting used to it, but once you're into it your reflex is mostly to zoom with the mouse exclusively rather than going with the control key.

it seems that to be implemented by default, the feature would need to be used by a "significant" proportion of users. and i confess, that add-on isn't much popular, but i think that's because not so many people have actually tried it. i also hold [as true] the postulate that, once used to it, that way of zooming is more intuitive than the one involving using the keyboard (but that might be my own bias, preventing objective consideration from my part.). i even think the including of such a feature might contribute to the establishment of a future new standard in the browsing industry (if at first, the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it.).
