I suddenly have to log in EVERY TIME
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

A couple of updates ago Once I logged in, till I "Tossed my cookies" I remained logged in, also www.rvforum.net, facebook, http;//community.compuserve.com/diabetes (And several other forums) even http://mail.yahoo.com would remember fo for anywhere from 2 weeks to forever.

Now I have to log in every time.. Firefox remembers the log ins ok in password manager, but it's not retaining the cookies session to session.

It only retains cookies for as long as I have the browser open

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log into any of the sites above (Being sure to check "Remember me" if offered)
2.Close the browser
3.Re-lanch firefox and return to the site


Actual Results:  
It will ask for your log in EVERY time

Expected Results:  
Yahoo Mail should ask you to log in only once every 2 weeks or till you toss your cookies. It should not ask for log in EVERY TIME you re-start the browser

Other sites I listed never ask for log in less I toss cookies.. Till now

It should have loaded the cookies from the last session and remembered it was logged into the site
