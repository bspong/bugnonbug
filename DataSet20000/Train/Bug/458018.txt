When i visit a website i frequently encounter  404 errors and often cannot find a way to notify the creator of the web page that the web page no longer is working.  It occurs that this task could be automated by the browser generating a message to the creator including the web link and updating the count number of people who could not get thru.  It could also be done at the same time as the attempt so as not to report when the users web connection is shut off.  This would have the tendency of cleaning up the whole internet a little bit.

Of course it should be optional to the user to turn this feature on/off  so that privacy issues are avoided.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to any web page.
2.click on a kink that doesnt work.
3.result 404 error.
4attempt to contact web master of site.
Actual Results:  
lots of effort is wasted informing web master whose info is burried on page, ... ... or not!!! 

Expected Results:  
broken link trigers reprorter program that informs web master of broken links location in page and url. and adds to a counter. and reports to mt that the link has been reported.  404- error.

This feature does not exist in MS products to the best of my knowelege.  and would show the superority of mozilla firefox!!!
