keyword search fails, gives error page trying to load nonsense jar contents
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

Unlike previous FF versions, this will not search in the location box on partial domains. For example, previously I could go to www.bluemassgroup.com by typing only bluemassgroup. FF would head to the right domain. 

Now if I try, I get:
Firefox can't find the file at jar:file:///C:/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/chrome/en-US.jar!/locale/browser-region/region.propertiesbluemassgroup

Apparently one or more archives did not get installed.

Other functionality, such as recalling previous sites work. When I start typing bluemassgroup, the choices appear under the location bar and I can tab to or click on one to go to the right location. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In the location bar, type a partial URL, using just the primary domain name
2. Press Enter
3. Receive jar error 
Actual Results:  
FF halts and displays the jar error.

Expected Results:  
FF to check its files, fill in the http:// plus the right extension and go to the site. It's been doing that for many versions.

I checked for updates and found none. I don't have enough info to locate and manually all the missing file(s).
