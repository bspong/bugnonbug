Hosting strategy for App Manager templates
We want to be able to open templates in the App Manager to kick start app creation.

Problem: what's the best strategy to

a) make it easy to open templates directly there
b) make it easy for more people to contribute with their own templates-thus fostering a good community

Or in Axel's words, these would be the requirements:

1) The ability for Mozilla to curate a collection of templates
2) The ability of developers to be able to try out the templates directly on a phone without having to download and deploy first
3) the ability of third parties, especially dev UI framework developers to publish templates
4) The ability to access to those templates in the App manager
5) The ability to download those templates from a desktop browser


And these are the possible hosting options we've discussed so far:

a) Put templates in a CDN
b) Put templates in Marketplace


Advantages and disadvantages of each one:

a) Put templates in a CDN:

This means we would have a series of *really good* and curated template files (in ZIP format) plus probably a .json file that we'd upload to a server --this would be a pretty similar mechanism to what we're using right now for the prototype.

Advantages:
- straightforward
- we have a mozilla CDN already, we'd need to speak to the right people
- for non official templates, anyone can upload templates to their server and through the "magic template detection mechanism" we can get app manager to open them

Disadvantages:
- vetoing process sort of slow/manual
- only mozilla can upload there
- community members have to host their own templates somewhere
- discovery opportunities are limited-there won't be a central "treasure trove of templates" unless we maintain a page in MDN linking to the best of the best
- we'd need some sort of "template detection" mechanism so Firefox/Chrome know we want to open certain links with App Manager. Namely protocol handlers.


b) Put templates in Marketplace

Anyone would be able to upload templates to the Marketplace just as if they were a normal app, via the "my apps" section, and put them under a new "Templates" category. Somehow, we will be able to download these zip files from the Marketplace and import them into App Manager.

Advantages:
- Any one can upload
- Discovery could be easier, more casual, with people finding the templates while browsing in the marketplace
- We leverage Marketplace's CDN/hosting system/experience
- Also, let the community decide what are the best templates by download numbers/ratings (whatever is the marketplace algorithm)

Disadvantages:
- People who download everything ever are probably going to download one of these templates and get very confused when they don't understand what it does. Expect bad ratings for otherwise good templates.
- We complicate the Marketplace codebase to allow for this exception: apps uploaded as templates should offer a direct "download" link
- Another exception: probably reviewers should not review these templates even though they will often be privileged.
