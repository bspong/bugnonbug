The basic idea of tab grouping has been invented and re-invented a hundred times. Examples include:

* Tabgroups-Plus (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9187)
* TabGroups Manager (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10254)
* Tab Groups (http://paranoid-androids.com/tabgroups/index.htm)
* ... and various other theoretical ideas during the recent Mozilla Labs Design Challenge (http://design-challenge.mozilla.com/summer09/index.html)

Due to the complexity of the feature, existing extensions lack stability and completeness. Since many users could benefit from such functionality, I thought that it may be best to build this into Firefox itself (hence the RFE).

The idea is to keep it as simple and out-of-the-way as possible.

The term "workspaces" is used by the OmniWeb browser (http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/), and its use would allow the "group" term to be reserved for use in grouping tabs by domain, origin, etc. within a workspace.

The following is a list of some of the behaviour and UI features that could/should be supported. (See the attached mockups first.)

- The Workspaces Bar should be hidden by default to avoid UI clutter and user confusion (can be shown using the "Show Workspaces Bar" option in the Workspaces Menu, by using the View -> Toolbars menu, or by using a keyboard shortcut).

- The Workspaces Bar is used for the management of workspaces, but may often be closed to increase the user's screen real estate. The Workspaces Menu would then be used due to its compactness.

- Workspaces can be re-ordered in the Workspaces Bar using drag & drop (the same way tabs are re-ordered).

- Tabs (as well as links) can be dragged & dropped onto existing workspace buttons.

- Workspaces should be persisted across sessions (session restore, etc.).

- It should be possible to prioritize the loading of the current workspace when restoring a session/starting Firefox. Other workspaces could load slowly in the background and get priority when selected (or not load until the workspace is opened [pref.]). Individual tabs should be loaded using strategies similar to the ones described in bug #496458.

- Right clicking a workspace button should show a menu with the following options: New Workspace, Reload All Tabs in Workspace, Bookmark All Tabs in Workspace, Rename Workspace, Save Workspace, Close Workspace.

- "Move To -> {list of workspaces} + New Workspace" should be added to the right-click menu of tabs.

- "Open Link in Workspace -> {list of workspaces} + New Workspace" should be added to the right-click menu of links.

- Preference should dictate in which workspace to load external links (currently selected or default workspace).

- "List all tabs" drop down menu on the right of the tab bar should show all tabs in the currently selected workspace. (Tooltip could be changed to "List all tabs in workspace")

- Preference should dictate if a tab overview page or the currently selected tab in a workspace should be displayed when a workspace is opened.

- Prefs to show number of tabs in workspace next to the workspace name (one pref. for bar, one for menu). Number of tabs will show in the tooltip regardless.

- Pref. to keep workspace open when it contains no tabs.

While this may be similar to bug #453984, I feel that this has a larger scope and includes a lot more detail.

The details above are somewhat unstructured, however if this bug receives attention, I will organise things on request.

Reproducible: Always
