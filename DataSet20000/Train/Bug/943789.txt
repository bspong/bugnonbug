URLs of redirect pages/domains don't shown in history
As far as I understand Bug 332120, FF is designed to don't show redirect pages/domains on some/all places in FF.

The problem for me is, that if I open the History and e.g. look at a day, I will/think I should see them.
And if I delete a day, I normally believe that I have deleted all URLs from the history, but this isn't!
And because they are not shown, I/you don't know what you have to search for.
Also I (and maybe a lot of people, too) thinking, that I see in the History the pages FF saves; all - not just some.


OK, how to reproduce?

- Take a new profile of FF to make sure there a no URLs in.
- Now take a redirecting page/domain to open. It works with a lot of
  pages/domains - e.g. advertisement/pop-up pages - but to make it easy, you
  can take fb.com, the facebook.com URL shortener.
- Now open a page on fb. E.g.: fb.com/Firefox.
-> fb redirects you now to http://www.facebook.com/Firefox.
- Now open you history.
-> You will see there an entry with http://www.facebook.com/Firefox.
- Now mark with you keyboard all entries of the day and delete them.
-> You history should now be empty again.
- Now enter in the search of the history: fb.com/Firefox
-> You will see an entry!
