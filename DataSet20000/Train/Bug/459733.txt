FF does not have focus after navigation, must switch focus away then back.
User-Agent:       Opera/9.60 (Windows NT 5.1; U; en) Presto/2.1.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3

When initially opening FF, everything works.  If I click a link, then nothing in the browser pane or the toolbar will work.  FF appears to still have the focus, but behaves as if it doesn't.  To fix the problem, I have to shift the focus away from FF then back (e.g. using ALT+TAB).  The scrollbar continues to work.

When returning to FF, I can use either the menubar OR browser pane (but not both) until a new URL is loaded, at which time I must shift the focus away then back.   

Using the right-click context menu at any time will require the focus to be shifted again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open FF
2. click a link
Actual Results:  
All elements in the browser pane and toolbar stop working.  

Expected Results:  
I would not have expected FF to lose the focus.  Even if it did, I would expect it to give the normal visual queues and then to regain the focus once clicked.

I am not the only one experiencing this problem, for example, see

I have gone through all of the steps in the "standard diagnostic" at http://kb.mozillazine.org/Standard_diagnostic_(Firefox) 

No configuration changes were made when this started.  I was using FF normally, then suddenly it began behaving as described.
