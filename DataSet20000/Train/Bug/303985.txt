Firefox hangs after being open for a long time and browsing huge amounts of websites durring that time.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

OK I have seen this happen on 3 of the 4 computers I use firefox on and the only
difference between the 4 that I can see is because I don't browse the internet
as heavily on the 4th as I do on the other 3. When I browse the web after I open
it for the first time it is fast as hell. After some time (1-2 hours) it starts
to slow down a bit. After about 20+ hours the cpu starts to stay at about 99% on
a 2.4 ghz Intel. I'm thinking maybe it has something to do with the way the
cache is indexed. I didn't look at the code but if it does cleanup after all
windows are closed but not at regular intervals durring the session then it
might get a very fragmented index file that is hard for the system to dig though
and might be causing the hang. Perhaps scheduling the "cleanup" to run every 1-2
hours the program is open would help this problem. 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Browse LARGE amounts of different complex websites.
2.Use multiple windows and multiple tabs per window.
3.Repeat for about 20+ hours.

Actual Results:  
75% of the time Firefox became unresponsive and had to be "End Tasked". Upon a
new load it takes a longer time to load then usual but then is running fine.

Expected Results:  
should not become unresponsive. Maybe run cleanup rutines periodicly durring the
session.
