I'm using a chat-Website (planetromeo.com). When you click on a message, a new window (message-winodow) pops up with the message and a text-box to enter the answer and the mainwindow stays in the background. 

Problem: When the main-window reloads the number of messages in planetromeo, the focus of the message-window with the textfield is gone. When you re-click on the textfield, the focus cannot be set back to the textfield. 

Only Menu: Window-> Select-Mainwindow and a following Menu: Window -> select Message-Window sets the focus back to the textfield.

How it should work: The Reload of the number of messages in the mainwindow should not change the focus.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login planetromeo.com
2. Klick on Number of messages -> Message-window pops up
3. Type a few letters and wait for reload of the "Number-of-messages"-frame in the mainwindow
4. After reload, when you receive a new message, Message-window is still in the front but has no focus and you cannot type anything anymore
Actual Results:  
see above

Expected Results:  
 The Reload of the number of messages in the mainwindow should not change the focus.
