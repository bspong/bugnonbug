I entered my identifier and password, however the password was entered
incorrectly. The Apple website issued an error message as a drawer (panel) to
the current window. The green back button would not back over the drawer. The
sequence goes like this: Enter an invalid password when prompted. The drawer is
closed and after consideration, the website issues an "invalid password..."
message. The back button will get back to the solicitation window but will go no
further back. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.When solicited, enter an invalid userid. The solicitation window closes.
2.A drawer announces the offer to retain the password. Click NO. This drawer is
attached to a FF window.
3.The invalid userID is announced.
4.The back button redisplays the retain password message.
5.The back button is disabled until the message is dispatched. 

Actual Results:  
Can't go back.

Expected Results:  
Not displayed the drawer and redisplayed the solicitation window.
