Live Bookmarks can be added to "Unsorted Bookmarks" and will not render in any view

places.sqlite showing the bug

If a user goes to an RSS feed, shows the preview and then adds it as a Live Bookmark, the "Add Live Bookmark" dialog allows the user to add the Live Bookmark to the "Unsorted Bookmarks" folder. When this is done, no Live Bookmark displays in this folder. If the feed url is subsequently visited, the location bar will show a star. If places.sqlite is examined, the Live Bookmark is found to be within it. It simply isn't rendering.

Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to http://ianmcdonald.livejournal.com/data/rss
2. Select "Subscribe Now" from the feed preview page (make sure the combo box at the top shows "Live Bookmarks" for the subscription method).
3. In the "Add Live Bookmark" dialog, expand the folder list for "Create in:"
4. Select the "Unsorted Bookmarks" folder as the location and choose "Add"

Result: No Live Bookmark appears in the Unsorted Bookmarks folder but it is really there.

I'm adding a default places.sqlite with only a visit to the above URL and its Live Bookmark added to it.
