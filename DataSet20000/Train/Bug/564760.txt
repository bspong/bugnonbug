To start off. My problem with Firefox is high CPU Utilization. No matter what site I go to, it stays at 99% to 100%. It happens on Firefox 3.6.2, 3.6.3 and 3.6.4 Beta. However, It does not happen to me in Firefox 3.6. Seriously, this is pissing me off and my laptop's fan is going turbo boost to cool down my CPU. And this is really making me mad and i hating the browser. Please Mozilla fix this. I get too many lags and crashes. And it does not happen to my computer as well. It happens on my other machine and my cousin's machine. Seriously, I suggest you fix this. Go to a site with Flash and you expect 100$% CPU utilization and other browsers don't use 100% CPU utilization when viewing flash. I expect you to fix this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Browser. Going YouTube. Hmmm... Watching video. Hmmmm!! I open up Windows Taskmanager. And I look and say WTF? 100% CPU Utilization. My fan start running fast.
2.Close Browser and open. SAME DEAL! >.<
3.Restart = FAIL still the same thing >.<
Actual Results:  
NOTHING WORKS

Expected Results:  
The CPU Utilization should be less than that. I mean this never happened to previous versions of Firefox. It only happens in Firefox 3.6.2, 3.6.3, and 3.6.4. On regular basis the CPU Usage should be at 35% to 50%. 100% ?? WTF.

I EXPECT YOU TO FIX THIS.
