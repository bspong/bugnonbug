Print page results in very wide margins that permanently changes print and print preview
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5
Build Identifier: Firefox/1.5

When I go to print a page from a website that does not allow for a preview, i.e. automatically pops up the dialog box for the printer, the resulting page has very wide margins and only a portion of the text is displayed in what amounts to a 1"x3" size area on the paper.  Once this happens, all further attempt to print a web page are similarly affected.  To fix the problem, I do a clean install of firefox (save a copy of the profile,use control panel add/delete to erase the program, run Registry First Aide, restart, reinstall Firefox (without opening it), reinstall the profile and things work again.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to a website that doesn't produce a print preview page, rather just opens the printer dialog (e.g. Asia Times Online)
2. select printer, press ok
3. 

Actual Results:  
Printer churns out pages with wide margins, just portions of the text in 1x3" size blocks

Expected Results:  
Printed the page with 0.5 inch margins

Previous printer was a Brother HL-1440, current printer is HL-5140 connected to my (home made) wintel machine via a Netgear print server.  The problem also occurs with my Epson 2200 which is connected directly to the machine via USB port.

Wix XP Pro SP2 with all the updates.

I've notice one other person's noted this problem on the support site, not bugzilla.

I *have not* been able to reproduce this problem on my other wintel machine which runs XP Home SP2 with all the updates.  

Thanks!
