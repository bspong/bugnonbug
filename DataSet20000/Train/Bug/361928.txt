Upon pressing the middle mouse button in Linux with any version of Firefox (to my knowledge), Firefox performs a Google "I'm feeling lucky" search on any text that Linux user happened to have previously highlight. This cannot be changed to any other search engine, and can only be disabled by use of the middlemouse.contentLoadURL=false option in about:config. This is a confidentiality threat for every Linux user, and is unnecessarily an unchangeable feature that benefits one corporation. However, since this can be considered a convenient feature for some, “middle-mouse” click can be easily made to correspond to an about:config variable that can search using a specified engine (like the browser.search variables in about:config).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.highlight a word (or any text)
2.this text will be copied to the linux clipboard
3.click the middle mouse button within firefox

Actual Results:  
The clipboard text was searched for by use of Google's "I'm feeling lucky" search.

Expected Results:  
In Linux, clicking the middle mouse button pastes text. So Linux users who don't know about this issue have Google search for text that they meant to paste (unless it was an accidental click)
