XUL dialog very slow with 3.1 and 3.2, but fast with earlier versions

On testing my extension (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2318) with 3.1b2 and the latest 3.2 I found the options dialog to be unusable (8 secs to load compared with <1 sec on 3.05 and excrutiatingly slow to use. So I created a stripped down extension to narrow this down to the .xul, then created the smallest .xul that still showed signs of the problem (test31.xpi).

I suspect it is the nested tabs, each with a reasonable number of components on each tab, that is causing the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install test31.xpi or totalvalidator.xpi on Firefox 3.1b2
2. Open the options dialog in Tools->Add-ons menu
3. Try to use it and click on Cancel to close
Actual Results:  
Dialog opens with noticable delay, is slow to respond to mouse clicks, and slow to respond when click Cancel to close. CPU use goes up noticably when using the dialog.

Expected Results:  
Install on 3.05 (or earlier) and dialog opens, responds, and closes very quickly with normal CPU usage.

If you can't see a noticable delay using test31.xpi (your PC may be too quick), try replacing options.xul with http://www.totalvalidator.com/downloads/options.xul which has the full .xul from TotalValidator
