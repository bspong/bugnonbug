Hi.

On most youtube sites I don't get javascript functionality. This started about two weeks ago, maybe after updating Firefox to 3.6.12. 
For example on <http://www.youtube.com/user/TotalHalibut#p/u> I can't switch between the parts "All", "Uploads", "Playlists" or between "Player view" and "Grid view". Also I get the youtube error that I don't have Flash installed, which I have. I use the add-ons "Noscript" and "Flashblock", BUT I am certain, they allow youtube content, as all worked until two weeks ago and there were no changes to the add-ons.

I can watch youtube videos like <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJJquWLUCxw&feature=list_related&playnext=1&list=PL742D77D277BFF21E> but there I lack the images on the right side for suggested videos (and flash works...).

I tried another browser today, Google Chrome, just to test youtube pages, and all works fine. This Firefox behavior is present on 3 computers, all the same Firefox version, update history and add-ons.


Regards.
