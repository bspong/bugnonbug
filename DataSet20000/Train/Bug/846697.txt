Entire FF window intermittently disappears for 5-10 secs upon opening article.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:19.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/19.0
Build ID: 20130215130331

Steps to reproduce:

1. Started FF.
2. Clicked on a website (in this case http://money.cnn.com) from the new tabs page.
3. Clicked on an hyperlink (http://money.cnn.com/2013/02/26/technology/mobile/intel-mobile/index.html?iid=HP_Highlight) for a particularly article on that page.



Actual results:

1. During the loading of that page the entire FF window disappeared.
2. To reappear after 5 - 10 secs, after which the loading of the selected page completed successfully.

Note that this happens intermittently, i.e. the second time I repeated step 3 in "What did you do?" the problem did not occur. Nor does the problem seem to be related to the article being loaded as I have noticed it happen while loading other articles as well. In addition please note that the problem does not seem to be related to version 19, since I have experienced it with release 18 as well, but didn't report it then.

The problem may be attributable to the site or other sites that it includes content from though, since to date I have not experienced it with other sites.


Expected results:

I expected the page to load without the window disappearing for some time in the process.
