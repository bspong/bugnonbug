After running Firefox for a long time with multiple windows and multiple tabs, I went to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_Non-Aggression_Pact and noticed that in the first line of the article, after some Chinese characters appeared, all the Roman characters were spaced irregularly and too widely.  See http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/Widetext.png where I uploaded a screenshot.  After I quit Firefox and restarted it, the problem disappeared.
