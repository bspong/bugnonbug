This is happening in Firefox 3.0 Beta on Mac OS X.  The automatic spellcheck is treating partial words as words.  This is especially true in contractions.  The spell check will underline the first few letters of a word only, even though the word is spelled correctly - it seems to be ignoring the last few letters of the word.

However, it is not a consistent bug.  Sometimes didn't passes the test, sometimes it doesn't.  But it's not just contractions.  I was typing the word "what" and it underlined the wha but not the t.



Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a website with a text field
2. Start typing, especially using contractions
3. it may help to stop typing for a few seconds in the middle of a word - or mistype the word at the end and go back and fix it.  (example:  didn;t - didn't)
4. look for the bug
Actual Results:  
It was happening hit-and-miss on gmail - but not on this page I'm using now.  (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox&format=guided)

Expected Results:  
It should treat whole words as whole words.  didn't isn't one 4 letter word and one 1 letter word - it's one word.
