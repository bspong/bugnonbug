Clicks discarded when right click menu shown for flash and an alert pops-up (context, dialog)

If you right click on a flash animation on the screen, and while the menu is
open an alert happens (Such as one saying that the URL cannot be found), the
flash menu is not closed, and all clicks afterwards are discarded.  All keys
still work and you can regain control just by pressing enter.  The version of
flash I am using is 3.0 I think.  I will try with the latest and see if the
problem is still there.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View a page such as mail.yahoo.com that has flash animation on it
2. Type in www.askdhfksdahgkdshgkd.com in the address bar
3. Position your mouse over the flash animation
4. Press enter and then immediately afterwards right click the animation

Actual Results:  
The flash right click menu is displayed and so is the "Cannot find URL" alert. 
The mouse cannot interact with anything in Firebird but you can still press
enter to clear the alert.

Expected Results:  
Closed the flash menu before displaying the alert.
