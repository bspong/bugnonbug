Firefox AVIARY only, `Resolving host xyz.foo.bar...' should be `Looking up xyz.foo.bar...'

This is the Firefox analog to bug #105892, to summarize (from the other bug):

------------------

To reproduce:
1.  Go to a Web site on a server you haven't been to in a while (such that it's
    not in your DNS cache).
2.  Look at the status bar.

What you see:
*   `Resolving host nameOfServer...'

What you should see:
*   `Looking for nameOfServer...'

Q & A from bug 97028 (from which this bug is spun off):

Why not `Resolving host'?
    Because only a miniscule proportion of the population knows what a `host'
    is, let alone what it means to `resolve' it. `Looking for' is much more
    understandable, while still being correct.
Why not `Looking up' instead of `Looking for'?
    For the same reason. Most people are unaware that IP numbers are stored in
    an index, so `Looking for' makes more sense while still being correct.
Eventually, we need to design several UI behaviors, tailored to various users.
    Uh, this is a Web browser's status bar, it's not a wedding dress. Even in
    the highly unlikely event that we wanted the status text to be themable
    independently from the rest of the browser, that's waaaaay outside the
    scope of this bug.
I know, let's redesign the status bar text for every networking state before we 
change anything!
    Uh, no. Firstly, it would take a long time to spec, and even longer to
    implement. Secondly, no matter what the status text for the other states
    ends up being, `Looking for {serverName}...' will be the status text for
    the initial domain resolution. (I will do a spec, once someone sends me a
    list of all those networking states.) And thirdly, `Resolving host' is the
    most obvious status text currently (especially on a high-speed connection),
    so its disturbing obfuscation should be fixed promptly.
Won't changing this string confuse Networking QA people?
    I think they're smart enough not to be confused by this, really. And
    anyway, Networking QA people make up a positively microscopic proportion of
    users of Mozilla distributions.

------------------

I'll just add that this is the same wording ("Looking up") that IE uses, which
would be much more familiar.
