When you view the site i submitted the page scrolls slow with the background image even when i lowered the resolution and size of the image to 60%. Also the Flash elements and Script elements within the page (ie: the SHoutbox on the front page) lags behind when you scroll up and down quickly. This does not happen in IE7 at all and scrolls perfect. Basically any website using a fixed background that has Google Ads will experience this too as the Google ads lag behind and overlap other elements of the site temporarly. 

Of course one can not use fixed backgrounds but then this is ruining the web surfing experience as i am sure alot of myspace sites use this feature.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load up any website with a fixed background
2. Scroll up and down really quick 
3. compare same site with IE7
Actual Results:  
What happened is the web site scroll very slow and flash elements lag behind and look choppy.

Expected Results:  
it should perform like IE and scroll fast and all elements should stay fixed in there tables instead of lagging and overlapping other parts of the site temporarily.
