Steps to reproduce:

When I'm debugging a Web application, I think that it would be useful to count with an option to set a "tracepoint" instead of a "breakpoint", in the JavaScript Debugger of the Web Developer Tools.

In other languages, a "tracepoint" is like a "breakpoint" that doesn't stop the thread(s), and gives you the possibility to print selected variables of the current scope to the console. I know that you can use the "console.log" method or any of its multiple variants ("console.debug" or "console.trace") in your source code. But "tracepoints" don't require that you modify and reload the source code every time. And it's not invasive: it doesn't clutter the source code.

In other contexts, such as in the one of NetBeans IDE and Java, this option is not called "tracepoint". Instead, it's just shown as an extra option when you set a typical "breakpoint". The IDE lets you choose how you want to suspend the execution: in the current thread, in all threads or without suspending the thread(s) at all. The Debugger of Firefox could show something like that too. If it's hard to implement, it could be limited to 2 options: suspend or not to suspend.



Actual results:

The Debugger doesn't allow to set "tracepoints".



Expected results:

It would be useful that it allowed to add "tracepoints".
