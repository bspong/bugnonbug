Intermittently, very frequently visited pages have disappeared from my location bar autocomplete list.  For instance, "http://slashdot.org/" will not appear in the list, even though it is usually the first result as soon as an "s" is typed.  As more of the URL is typed, it still does not appear, although various subpages start to show up.  Manually typing in the full URL and re-visiting the page seems to restore it to its proper place in the auto-complete results, at least until this bug reoccurs.

I have not been able to determine what triggers this; I have only seen it on very frequently visited sites that should be the first autocomplete results, although its possible that I simply haven't noticed it occurring to less visited sites.  I have seen this happen to a group of frequently visited sites all around the same time, but I have also seen it happen to just one, leaving the others unaffected.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Normal usage of the browser.
2. Start typing a URL into the location bar.
Actual Results:  
The most commonly visited site that is usually the first result for the typed  characters is not present, and does not appear no matter what is typed into the location bar.

Expected Results:  
The usual first result is present.
