Normally u can drap and drop a file from Windows Explorer onto the Firefox Bookmarks menu.  However the sensitivity is too great.  When Firefox is in the background, the menu opens when an active drag even momentarily crosses the word Bookmarks.  What's more is that the menu does not close when the drag is kept away, other windows are brought forward, or the drag is released on another window.  The Firefox window itself has to be brought up and clicked on to make the Bookmarks menu close.  This is a huge problem when the menu obscures the point where u want to drop the dragged file.

Reproducible: Always

1. drag a file from windows explorer with Firefox in the background

Actual Results:

Expected Results:
