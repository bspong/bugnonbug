Firefox - very slow page loading

Mozilla Firefox - slow loading.mp4

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0
Build ID: 20160623154057

Steps to reproduce:

Webpages loading in Firefox is very slow. It takes several seconds to connect to the website and when the website starts to appear, it takes several seconds to display all content. It behaves like I would be on very slow connection.

But when I open different browser (e.g. Edge, Internet Explorer etc.), all websites open immediately. I write URL, press ENTER and all content is loaded instantly. E.g. I see that Firefox takes long time to connect to website, I open different browser to load the same website and this browser loads the website immediately - even before Firefox!

I use Firefox on several computers (at work and at home) and this problem happens on all computers! Although I like the Firefox features very much, I'm thinking about changing the browser, because it limits browsing experience a lot. I have 100 Mbps connection and the Firefox works like I had 1 kbps.

Please, do not point me to clean/restore my profile. I did it milliontimes, maybe it helps but for several minutes only. Then Firefox starts to be slow as hell again.

I'm attaching example video to demonstrate the wrong behaviour.



Expected results:

Firefox should display the requested content immediately. Like other browsers do.
