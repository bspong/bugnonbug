Trying to delete a Places folder with three layer of subfolders causes Minefield to hang.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select a Places folder that has more than 100 bookmarks in three levels of subfolders, either in menu or Library.
2. Right-click and select Delete from context menu.

Actual Results:  
First level bookmarks deleted. Subfolders not deleted. Contents of folders not deleted.

Browser hangs, must be killed from Task manager.

Expected Results:  
Folder should be deleted.

With today's build I removed places.sqlite, places.sqlite-journal and the bookmarkbackups folder in my Minefield test profile. I opened Minefield, found - as expected - an empty Library, closed and restarted Minefield. This reconstituted the Most Visited folder on the Bookmarks Toolbar, left the rest of the toolbar empty.

Then I imported my 4368+ bookmark collection from my fx2 bookmarks.html file. 

Then I copied the contents of my fx2 Bookmarks Toolbar Folder and pasted them into the fx3 Bookmarks Toolbar. I now had a fully populated toolbar. Places menu, sidebar and Library all functioning well.

After browsing a bit, tried to delete the old (now unnecessary) fx2 Bookmarks Toolbar Folder from menu. The browser hung, could not be recovered. After killing this with Task Mgr, reopened browser without restoring the old session. This time tried deleting the folder from the Library. Same results. 

I waited several minutes each of the 4 times I tried the deletion. The CPU usage approximated 1-2% after the initial spike to perhaps 15%. There was disk activity. Since this is a WinXP system, the disk is usually quiet. 

Martijn has a copy of my bookmarks, if you need it.
