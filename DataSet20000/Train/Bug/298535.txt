form not shown on asp page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; pt-BR; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050524 Fedora/1.0.4-4 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 & WinXP; pt-BR; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050524 Fedora/1.0.4-4 Firefox/1.0.4 & Mozilla/1.7.8

The page is not properly rendered. It is supposed to show several fields of a
form and a few images to switch between the 3 pages of forms. Works on IE6 but
not on Firefox 1.0.4 (tested on Fedora Core 4 and WinXP) and or Mozilla 1.7.8
(on FC4 too). View-source shows that the source has been properly downloaded,
though.

I use the extensions NoScript and Adblock on Firefox, but both have been
disabled for the site or are latent (triple checked). Mozilla doesn't work
either and it does not have those extensions, so they are not the problem. Also,
I tried to allow all cookies for the site, but to no effect.

I suspect we will need some tech evangelism, but am not sure. If this is
confirmed, I will do it myself.
