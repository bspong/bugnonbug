On my desk I've got my powerbook and a second monitor positioned vertically above the powerbook.  using system preferences I've arranged the displays to act like they do in the physical word - that is, in a stack.  When entering data into an HTML form text field (the single line field, not the textarea paragraph entry) Firefox drops down a list of previously-entered options for the user to choose for an autocomplete action.  On the bottom screen this list is drawn over the text entry box instead of below it, obscuring the text that's been entered.

The autocomplete works properly in the top display.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. have more than one physical display attached to your mac
2. using the system preferences -> displays -> arrangement pane, configure your displays so that they are stacked vertically
3. go to any web form with text entry lines.  
4. observe what happens when entering text in a firefox browser on the lower display.
Actual Results:  
incorrect output

Expected Results:  
the autocomplete options should appear below the text entry box
