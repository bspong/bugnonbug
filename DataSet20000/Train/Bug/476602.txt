Randomly jumps to different opened tabs without clicking nor any other action

Firefox is always up to date. This problem has been happening for about 1 month.

While reading the information on one tab, Firefox frequently jumps to a different tab that I have already read. 

I tried opening a second Firefox window to see if it would stop. The jump can even go to the window I am not reading. When this happens, the Windows Taskbar still shows the active window to be the one that I had been reading; not the one I am now forced to look at.

The jump destination tab seems random. It is not the previously read tab, nor to the left, nor to the right. I have tried jerking the mouse up, down, left, right to see if it is responding to mouse gestures. It is not.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have several tabs open.
2. Read one tab.
3.


Expected Results:  
It should stay on the tab I am reading.

No pop up error messages appear.
