Favicon in Fox does not respond to new favicon stored on site

I changed the favicon.ico graphic on my website, and Fox will not use the new icon.

The icon -does- populate with the new icon if I look at the site content, as mirrored locally, using Fox.   My local home page [a separate html page] also uses the new, locally stored favicon.ico file, and that works.

The new one also shows up in MS IE, locally and on the website.

In an effort to isolate what is going on with FOX, I tried these steps:

1.  Deleted the ico file outright, on the web site.  Fox still reports the old icon.  [odd, that!, especially since the new icon is seen by IE, so the site and my ISP aren't caching something, somewhere, I suppose...]
2.  Deleted all history references to the site's pages in Fox, hoping this would force use of the new icon.
3.  Removed the site's references from the "Most Visited" Tab
4.  Used the "forget about this site" and the delete, inside bookmarks where I found any reference to the site.   [What is the difference between "Forgetting" and "Deleting", anyway?  They both seem to delete a single bookmark, anyway...]
5.  Closed/restarted Fox after the above items...

Site and Icon: WWW.ComplianceOfficer.Com/favicon.ico

Where does Fox store the reference to the old icon?

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
I should see the new icon.
