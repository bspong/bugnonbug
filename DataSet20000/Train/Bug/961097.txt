Very janky regular expression introduced in bug 923856
The code introduced in bug 923856 looks like this:

    if (/^application\/(\w+[\.-]?)+\+(xml|json)/.test(aMimeType)) {
      return true;
    }

in current Firefox builds this is throwing an exception because Yarr gives up after 1000000 iterations in the regexp interpreter when aMimeType is "application/vnd.google.safebrowsing-chunk".  Sadly, this happens a lot: every time we contact the safebrowsing database.  Once per chunk.  So I timed how long this regexp takes to run on that string:

    var perf = window.performance;
    try {
      var start = perf.now();
      var result = /^application\/(\w+[\.-]?)+\+(xml|json)/.test("application/vnd.google.safebrowsing-chunk");
    } catch (e) {
      var end = perf.now();
      alert(end - start);
    }

and the answer is about 50ms on current trunk before it throws.

The reason this is throwing is that the regexp doesn't match (because aMimeType doesn't contain "xml" or "json" in it, or a "+" for that matter).  So the regexp execution starts backtracking, trying to match the (\w+[\.-]?)+ pattern against the string in various ways and hoping that after that the "\+" will match.

As a thought experiment, let's think about the different ways (\w+[\.-]?)+ can match an alphanumeric string with n characters in it.  The answer is the number of partitions of the string (if we ignore the optional .- bits, which add more options), which is 2^(n-1).  So in this case, we're matching against "vnd.google.safebrowsing-chunk" which has length 29, so we're going to try something like 2^28 different matches.  In practice I think Yarr actually tries 2^29, but in either case it takes way too long.  ;)

And the real issue is that the regexp is wrong, in my opinion.  It should be something more like this, if you want "dot or dash separated words":

    if (/^application\/\w+(?:[.-]\w+)*\+(xml|json)/.test(aMimeType)) {
      return true;
    }

That will return false in .05ms for the "application/vnd.google.safebrowsing-chunk" case and will return true in the same amount of time for "application/vnd.google.safebrowsing-chunk+json"....
