javascript problem: password entered is said to be null / "Banco do Brasil" online banking / Java virtual keyboard
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041111 Firefox/1.0 (Debian package 1.0-2)

Account data and password is entered, but applet always warns:
 "Warning: password: null content"
(in Portuguese: "Atenção:  Senha:  Conteúdo nulo !")
in red, right below the keyboard.

Java Plugin Versions tested: Sun's 1.5.0 and 1.4.2_06.

But I think it's not about Java. Javascript console says:

Error: document.applets.tclJava.getSenha is not a function
Source File: https://www2.bancobrasil.com.br/aapf/includes/formatadadosns2.js
Line: 103


Notes:
1. "senha" in Portuguese means "password".
2. it works ok in Mozilla 1.7.3 (that's why I am reporting here)
3. account data "00000" (agency) and "00000" (account number) seems to work for
testing (I really doubt this account exists, but I am not sure). You can't shoot
any data because last digit is a check.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter Banco do Brasil site (Bank of Brazil) http://www.bb.com.br/
2. Click "Acessar sua conta" (access your account, blue button at top-right)
3. Type in account data (or the fake one above) and click buttons in the virtual
keyboard applet to enter a password (minimum 8 chars). Real keyboard is not
supposed to work.
Actual Results:  
The message "Atenção:  Senha: Conteúdo nulo !" appeared. It means "Null
password". But I have typed it.

Expected Results:  
Normally it should:
Login into account for banking operations, when valid data is entered,
 -or-
"Invalid data" ("Dados não conferem") or something alike.
