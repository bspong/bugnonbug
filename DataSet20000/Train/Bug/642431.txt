ClearType on webpages not enabled after starting Firefox from non-ClearType Remote Desktop
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

Firefox does not enable ClearType on (newly opened) webpages (but does enable this on its own GUI) when the Firefox instance was started with ClearType disabled (for example, through Remote Desktop).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login on Windows with Remote Desktop, but with font smoothing (ClearType) off.
2. Start an instance of Firefox and open some webpages. The GUI and webpages correctly display the non-ClearType font.
3. Logout from Remote Desktop, while keeping the session open.
4. Login on the computer itself (not with Remote Desktop).
5. Go to the still opened Firefox instance.
6. Open a new (another) webpage.
Actual Results:  
The computer has re-enabled ClearType for all applications, and the Firefox GUI correctly shows ClearType'd fonts. The opened webpages however are still displayed without ClearType, and newly opened webpages are still ClearType-less.

Restarting Firefox resolves this issue.

Expected Results:  
ClearType should be enabled for newly opened and reloaded webpages.

My computer has ClearType on by default.
My Remote Desktop has ClearType off by default.
