web console height resizing should count border and padding too
The vertical resizing of the Web Console input box is a great improvement but doesn't take into account border and padding on the textbox.  (Screenshot coming.)

Is there a way to calculate the height so it takes all size-related styling into account?  scrollHeight apparently doesn't.

As a result, if the textbox has padding and border, you have the textbox getting shorter as soon as the user starts typing into it.  It grows in height with each new row of input, but it's never quite as tall as it needs to be.

On first input, the height decreases (DEcreases) by 9px, exactly the amount of vertical border and padding on the textbox in my case.

With Winstripe:
                                        margin      border      padding
hbox.jsterm-input-container             0           0           0
  textbox.jsterm-input-node             2 4 2 4     0           0 0 0 16
    hbox.textbox-input-box              0           0           0
      html:textarea.textbox-textarea    0           0           0

In my case:
                                        margin      border      padding
hbox.jsterm-input-container             0           0           0
  textbox.jsterm-input-node             2 4 2 4     2 2 2 2     2 2 3 13
    hbox.textbox-input-box              0           0           0
      html:textarea.textbox-textarea    0           0           0

STR:

1. Install NNL nightly (will follow up with link after I post it)
2. Restart with it
3. Open web console in any page
4. Start typing in the console input textbox
5. Notice the height change and cropped contents
