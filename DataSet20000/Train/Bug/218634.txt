Several times my linux system has frozen when I have had several tabs open and
then I click on one, decide I don't want to go to that tab and while the button
is still in I drag the pointer away. The pointer changes to an "L" shape (like
the edge of a square) and I can't do anything after that - the whole system
needs to be reset causing a serious loss of data.


Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click on a tab and keep the button in
2. move the pointer away from the tab


Actual Results:  
Linux freezes and nothing can be done.

Expected Results:  
Given back control of the system.

At this time I unfortuantely can't afford to intentionally reproduce the bug,
though based on the link mentioned above
(http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=23406) others have experienced
the same problem.
