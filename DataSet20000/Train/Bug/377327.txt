since installing Firefox 2 i have had constant problems with pages NOT loading from typed searches and URL's and from clicking on links and saved bookmarks.  Once this operation has been attempted the original page stays up and the word "DONE" is displayed in bottom left corner of browser.  The 'load' bar sometimes appears but may then disappear and the same result occurs.  I usually have to click a numerous amount of times until the 'loading' bar stays on for longer than 5-10 secs.  This has become very frustrating as i am a fan/supporter of Firefox and their products and services.  PLEASE HELP!!!    I recently bought & installed Zonealarm Antivirus (internet security) & Firefox has FULL access always...however the problem existed prior to this.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.load 'google' homepage
2.click to load any bookmarks, typed URL's and some searches
3.multiple clicks until it works or just give up and use IE
Actual Results:  
result=homepage remains (Google.au)

Expected Results:  
linked me to site i wished to visit

sorry i dont know terminology for what happens.  But the above is pretty much what happens
