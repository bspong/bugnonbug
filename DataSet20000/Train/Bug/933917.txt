Remove about:permissions from Firefox
2:54 PM <bsmedberg> about:permissions isn't exposed in the UI anywhere, is it?
2:56 PM <•gavin> it isn't
2:58 PM <madhava> bsmedberg: nope
2:59 PM <madhava> though... hm.
2:59 PM <madhava> now that we're looking at doing in-content prefs
3:00 PM <madhava> I wonder if there's a more sensible way to integrate it
3:03 PM <bsmedberg> madhava: I was just making sure because of a question from mkaply
3:03 PM <bsmedberg> madhava: we already expose plugin permissions in pageinfo
3:04 PM <madhava> yes - and we have plans to let users change more of their prefs from the site identity panel
3:04 PM <madhava> aka larry panel
3:04 PM <madhava> so that when you're on a particular site you can revisit decisions you've made about it
3:04 PM <madhava> it's just odd that we've had this other UI for it build and landed but unsurfaced
3:05 PM <bsmedberg> perhaps removing it is the right option
3:06 PM <shorlander> Probably considering it isn't really what we want and we don't expose it anyway
3:11 PM <jaws> yeah
3:14 PM <jaws> but should we wait until we have a better replacement before removing it?
3:15 PM <jaws> there are probably some people that depend on it, and removing it without putting in something better doesn't sound like much of a win
3:19 PM <shorlander> jaws: I don't have a strong feeling on removing or keeping it before replacing it since it is largely hidden and works AFAIK. Depends on if it is causing problems or not.
3:20 PM <jaws> it's one of those things that doesn't cause problems, and it works, but occasionally people forget to update it. for the most part it's a minor nuisance when working with the code (similar to in-content preferences right now)
3:20 PM <jaws> with the exception that we want to push forward on in-content preferences
3:22 PM <•gavin> we shouldn't hesitate to remove it if it isn't what we want
