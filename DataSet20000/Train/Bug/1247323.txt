A screen shot of loaded facebook login page

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:39.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/39.0
Build ID: 20150630154324

Steps to reproduce:

My University has a hardware firewall named Fortiguard, in order to use internet by Wifi we need to install a particular certificate belongs to the firewall company. So I installed the certificate and I browsed pages using Firefox without any issue.  


Actual results:

But there was this feeling that whenever I click on and open firefox it shows me that it is not responding for a while and within 10 seconds time it becomes normal.Also when I search using browser's default home page I need to type and press enter several times in order to firefox to begin browsing. Nearest incident was today when I tried to access my wordpress site using local server firefox showed me that it is not responding. But it didn't became normal as usual. I had to end processing of firefox and it happened so on. So I refreshed Firefox and now it wouldn't let me access even Bugzilla at once... it keeps on displaying untrusted connection page.
And when reloading for several times pages get loaded but only the html content. It won't load the stylings css jquery whatever.


Expected results:

Firefox should have let me browse pages
