Firefox became very slow after crash in ndvidia dirvers, after resintall too.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/38.0.2125.101 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

- Start Firefox on Windows 8.1 x64 after crash
- Open a page for browse


Actual results:

My Firefox (version 33) just crashed once, and after that I was not able to start it again. The "Firefox crashed" dialog jumped up always when i try to start it. Its only started when I have chosen the Safe Mode start. After that I could start it normally but it became very slow. (For example scrolling in a page is not smooth, and the it takes much more second to start up.)

I have an ultrabook, so its not caused by slow hardware, and it's still fast in Safe Mode. My PC runs a genuine Windows 8.1 and its up to date.

What I try so far to solve the problem:

Disable the extensions
Reinstall it
Reinstall it again, but before I install it I
  Delete the following folders:
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox folder
   C:\Users\Attila\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla
   C:\Users\Attila\AppData\Local\Mozilla
   C:\ProgramData\Mozilla
  Delete the registry keys from:
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Mozilla
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Mozilla
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\mozilla.org
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\MozillaPlugins
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Mozilla
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\MozillaPlugins

But these steps not help, what could cause this problem?


Expected results:

- Firefox start up as fast as usually
- Browsing a single page is fast as usually
