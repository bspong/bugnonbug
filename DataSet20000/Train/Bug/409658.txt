Any pages displayed within www.facebook.com have a blue background (usually it is white). And the icons and arrangements within these pages are messed up too. There are no problems displaying all other web pages. However, these pages that failed to be displayed properly can be displayed in the usual manner using Internet Explorer. Attached will be the images of the same page showed by the 2 browsers. I have never had this problem until today. Please fix it asap. I tried uninstalling my firefox and reinstall the latest firefox but the problem still persists. (Erm, I cannot find any place to attach images of the problem (i printed the screen), please email me if you need the pics)
