http://65.36.181.67/ihtml32.aspx works fine in mozilla,
http://65.36.181.67/ihtml40.aspx which uses left and right frames containing URL
link-lists with images that when clicked should target the center frame but do
not do anythiing at all after the initial link is clicked meaning the first time
a link in the left frame is clicked it works and target the middle frame but
after that if a link on the right is clicked  the click results in no action
taken by the browser...perhaps a document.history issue givien a related article
I read  regarding javascript document.location issue with frames also in
Mozilla.  Thanks for all you do.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click a link in left frame of http://65.36.181.67/ihtml40.aspx
2. Click a link in right frame of http://65.36.181.67/ihtml40.aspx
3. The first linked clicked works fine and the second linked click will not work.

Actual Results:  
The same exact 1.2.3. steps I have written above happenned after I performed the
steps above.

Expected Results:  
If frame web page A target frame page B, then frame page B is being targeted by
frame web page A, which is just another frame page in a frameset web page, the
targeted frame web page B should display the contents of the framed/non-framed
web page associated with the link that was clicked in frame web page, A.
where
A is the shooter
B is the target.
