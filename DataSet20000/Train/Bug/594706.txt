Menu selector (in e.g. bookmarks toplevel menu) lags behind the mouse cursor

I think this started happening after I updated to beta 5. When I open a large menu (such as bookmarks menu), the selector (blue highlight) lags behind the mouse cursor significantly. While it is only a matter of milliseconds when it catches up, it still gives an application a laggy feel, like it's struggling to complete such simple operation as selecting a menu item. This happens in any menu (including right click pop-up menus), but particularly noticeable in large menus, such as bookmarks menu with lots of bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add a lot of bookmarks to bookmarks top-level menu.
2. Click to open the bookmarks top-level menu.
3. Move the mouse quickly up and down the menu and observe the menu selector trying to follow the mouse.
Actual Results:  
The selector lags behind the mouse. Lots of CPU power is consumed (up to 50% on my 2 core CPU).

Expected Results:  
The selector always stays at the mouse cursor. No significant CPU resources are consumed.
