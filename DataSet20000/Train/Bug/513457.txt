Firefox locks up when editing comments on very large HTML page (244Kb) not including thumbnails

I was editing a very large page in the Zen Photo Album when Firefox locked up for 7 seconds. If I continued typing into the comment box(es), it would lock up again for 7 seconds with less than 5 seconds of typing.
The html (php) file is 244KB and the thumbnails are a further 833KB.

Opening Task Manager, Firefox showed 99% CPU useage. No typing and Firefox would idle on 1% and sometimes go up to 7%. Start typing and within 5 seconds it all freezes. When it unfreezes, the text entered is shown but it becomes hard to edit fields when it is frozen :(
The actual HTML file (php file actually) is at http://bacchuswood.org/admin.php.html
Note that the file will not show any thumbnails. The page is only accessible through the Zen Admin page sorry.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Zen Photo admin page and log in.
2. Go to "Edit titles, descriptions, and other metadata."
3. Click on GNW_XI photo album and wait til it loads (takes a while)
4. try to type info into comments for each photo.
Actual Results:  
It freezes for around 7 seconds whenever I type into any of the comments fields.


Expected Results:  
Should not use 99% CPU and therefore should not freeze.
