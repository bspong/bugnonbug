I had to finally report it: When I use firefox 2.0.0.4 and earlier to print out websites it lays out the pages so badly some of the pages more than 50% empty (from the bottom). I don't know why - the objects that are moved to the next page are more than easily fittable on the remaining space of the previous page

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

2. Print out the page
3.
Actual Results:  
prints 5 pages

Expected Results:  
Internet Explorer 6 prints 3 pages. Expected is fitting more objects in the remaining pages. Please see attached pdfs for comparison - example why is more than 50% of the bottom of the first page empty? objects on the second page are just text and small icons which could be easily fitted one the reminder of the first page?

I'm reporting it a bug not an improvement request because of high annoyance it causes
