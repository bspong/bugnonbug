First of all, this bug occurs only in my computer. I'm doing a CSS tutorial in spanish for my classes. I have uploaded this page to a server and it looks fine in Firefox, but the local copy of the same page with the same CSS saved in my computer, looks a bit different. I have defined an internal style in this HTML document for the <a> elements inside a certain div container to colour the background in green.
In the same document there is a navigation bar with a list of links. This list is in a different <div> with a different style for <a>. The problem is that the first link of the list looks green with the style of the other container.

I know it's not an important problem, but could be a clue for other troubles.
I'm going to test the same document in different computers this week to see what happens. Feel free to ask me any question if you are interested on this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the HTML document in my hard disk with Firefox.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Display of an element with a wrong style.

Expected Results:  
Display the same HTML document with the same CSS the same way in my computer and when uploaded to a server.

This is a screenshot of the page when I open the local copy. There are no different CSS files or a different file structure. I really can't figure out what happens.
