Since i have upgraded from Firefox 2 to 3 a few weeks ago i am getting frequent crashes in ntll.dll while downloading files. I have gone through the steps suggested for download crashes like deleting download history, but with no success.
Today i was able to reproduce the crash a few time on downloading the file in the link i posted here. I had the taskmanager open and could see that right before Firefox crashes the ntdll.dll the memory consumption skyrockets from like 50mb to 1000mb in just a few seconds.
The crashes do not happen on all downloads but large and especially fast downloads it is pretty often. Restoring the session and also the download will cause it to crash right again.
A different browser does all the downloads just fine.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Starting FF
2. Opening a download Site
3. Start a download
Actual Results:  
At some point of the download the memory usage of FF starts raising fast until it causes a crash in ntdll.dll at around 1000mb memory usage.

Expected Results:  
Finishing the download.

Here is the error message from the event log of windows, the error address is allways the same:
Fehlgeschlagene Anwendung firefox.exe, Version 1.9.0.3224, fehlgeschlagenes Modul ntdll.dll, Version 5.1.2600.2180, Fehleradresse 0x0000256d.

And my computer configuration:
Windows XP prof SP 2
Ahtlon A64 3500+
2GB RAM
Ati graphics
