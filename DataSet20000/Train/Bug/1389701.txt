Newly loaded child RemotePageManager can register pages too late to properly manage created documents
In the process of investigating bug 1382373, I made a video from holding cmd-T and noticed some tabs ended up erroring:

JavaScript error: resource://activity-stream/data/content/activity-stream.bundle.js, line 754: ReferenceError: addMessageListener is not defined

This is well after opening many about:newtab pages successfully, so RemotePageManager is handling most of them. For some reason it misses some. This happens even with newtab.preload=false (as there's too many browsers needed to wait to use the preloaded one anyway).

I added some dumps to portCreated@RemotePageManager and on "RemotePage:Load" and opened 10 tabs from the browser console:

for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) BrowserOpenTab()

command line showed:

JavaScript error: resource://activity-stream/data/content/activity-stream.bundle.js, line 754: ReferenceError: addMessageListener is not defined

port created 85642:1

In this latter set of 10, the resulting tabs shown along with the tab hover title:

1: bad 85640
2: bad 85641
3: good 85642
4: good 85633
5: bad 85640
6: bad 85641
7: good 85642
8: good 85633
9: bad 85640
10: bad 85641

Mossop: any suggestions on how to debug? Or maybe we can just work around by detecting missing addMessageListener and reloading the page (note: addMessageListener never appears later, so something got lost in creating the port).
