Bad value in content-type with some pdf files

Steps to reproduce:

Hello,
We use SOGo as a Webmail and Firefox (46 and 47) with Windows7
When we send some pdf files, some of them are unreadable for recipients and in send mailbox. The files seems be blank. PDF file type is the one who be concerned by this problem, we haven't this result with other file type. When we send this same file with an other navigator, we haven't this problem.

This problem is aleatory.


Actual results:

When we received files, they seems be blank. If we inspect source code, we see :

------=_=-_OpenGroupware_org_NGMime-16013-1470296048.391775-5------
content-type: text/html

The content-type value should be application/pdf and not text/html. We already had this problem with old Firefox version but that seems be resolved for some time but we have this problem again now.

This problem is very aleatory, we haven't this problem with other navigator and with other files types.


Expected results:

The file should be upload with content-type: application/pdf value.
