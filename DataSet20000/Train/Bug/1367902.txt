Firefox messed up my bookmarks after signing in from another pc...
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:53.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/53.0
Build ID: 20170518000419

Steps to reproduce:

I signed in to mozilla account from my new Surface Pro 3 running Windows 10. This was the first time i signed in to mozzila using this device.


Actual results:

Once i signed in from my new Surface Pro 3 and after the sync ended successfully i noticed that i dont have all the bookmarks that i had on my other pc (the one that i am using to file this bug report). I thought that the sync messed up the process and lost some of the bookmarks but when i got to my most used pc (the one that i am on at the moment) i noticed that even on that Firefox the bookmarks are missing and are the same ones as on my new Surface Pro 3... As i can notice the bookmarks are not missing actually but they are returned to the state from few months ago (and the newer bookmarks are lost only and they are the ones that i really need).


Expected results:

When i signed from my new device Surface Pro 3 after the sync of firefox i should have got all the bookmarks imported to that firefox and on my old pc the bookmarks should have stayed as they were...
