Freeze up problem.Detailed description below:
Using Firefox version 3.6.6 I was on a web page in which the "plugin-container.exe" in my task manager was running ( I seen this after I did the ctrl/alt/delete in my XP home system ).
I also had "my documents" folder open at the time when I "x"ed out of firefox.
The web page image covered all the contents in "my documents" folder and just froze there.
I could not "x" out of anything.
I had to "end task" on explorer.exe then,
I rebooted to get out of this situation as all I could now see was my desktop with no icons or taskbar..
My 2 other browsers ,ie and google chrome NEVER had this issue.
Googling this problem I had shows many people have a similar problem.
Please advise if this is going to be fixed soon.Thanks!
