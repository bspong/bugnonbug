firefox does not display any pages where URL ends with 5468x
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

given example URL cannot be loaded - neither by writing it manually into address
line nor per mouse click. obviously firefox 1.0 does not like urls ending up
with 5468x - works fine with 5467x and 5469x though. all heise.de pages work
fine with MSIE 6.0SP1, but every newsticker page today with 54680 up to 54689
does not load in no way with firefox - it simply does not TRY to load the page
at all.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. visit www.heise.de/newsticker
2. try to click at the news "SMS-Fahndung verläuft im Sand"
3. voila - page does not load!

Actual Results:  
pages with URLs containing numbers between 54680 and 54689 do not load at all.

Expected Results:  
load and display the URLs clicked at or written into address line.

stepped over this problem some time ago with firefox 0.9, but thought it was an
heise.de error that time. as i reproduced this error today i tried out other
browsers, so i could find out it is really some firefox bug and not any kind of
loading/routing-problem.
