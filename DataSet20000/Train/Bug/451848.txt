I can't get firefox 3.0.1 dutch to open standard a linkpage on a webpage in the same window as a new "tabblad" (dutch name for it), though the option in preferences is given.

I can't get this new firefox to open standard a linkpage from a website in the same window (being a new "tabblad" - sorry, that's the dutch name for it). Preferences doesn't do it, the only way is everytime again and again: rightclick mousemenu+t. That's cumbersome. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a website
2. open a link on the website

Actual Results:  
It opens always in a new or another window, despite of preference to open in the same window (from the options menu). Sometimes if there are already window open, it even opens behind te current window, the only workaround is to open a link everytime by rightmouseclick+t. 

Expected Results:  
If I indicate in the options menu that I want to open it as a "new tabblad" (dutch) I do expect that a left mouseclick on a link has the same result as rightmousclick+t. Just as I was used to get with Firefox 2.
