Since upgrading to latest version Firefox 3.5.5 on mac OSX - when making changes to a blog post / then clicking "update post / status bar on bottom left goes thru process then says "stopped". Click "visit post" and pop up asks if I really want to leave page as changes aren't saved. I try again. Same. Then I leave page anyway - sometimes things are saved at actual post but most often not - and getting worse. Also unable to save changes to image captions. Finally realized might be browser so switched back to Safari - everything works fine. look forward to fix!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.edit blog post
2.click "update post"
3.try to visit post (not site)
4.get pop-down
5. doesn't happen when changing "sticky" - happens w/post content (somewhat intermittent)
Actual Results:  
log out to look at post anyway - sometimes changes have been saved anyway - or part of them. sometimes not. Particular difficulty with spacing between paragraphs

Expected Results:  
should have saved my edits - shown that it was saved - and should have appeared when I visited post

theme I'm using is DYI Thesis - no problems on Safari
