Multiple windows will not work.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/525.27.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.2.1 Safari/525.27.1
Build Identifier: Firefox 3.1 Beta 2

After opening one window and closing it, the desktop/start menu shortcut will fail to launch, saying "Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window, you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart your system." Also running the executable file from "E:\Z3-1 LAPTOP\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox 3.1 Beta 2\firefox.exe" does not work. I have it installed on a removable external hard drive (E:\), which could be the problem. However, after I end the process "firefox.exe" in Task Manager, relaunching a new window will work. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox 3.1 beta 2 by Start Menu/Desktop Icon.
2. Close after the loading of your Home Page.
3. Open Firefox 3.1 beta 2 by the same shortcut used in Step 1.
4. A window should appear, saying what is written in "Actual Results"
Actual Results:  
A window reporting, "Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window, you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart your system."

Expected Results:  
It should have opened a new window.

I am using a WindowBlinds theme, though it seems to happen also with the default. I am using a Dock Program called RocketDock (http://www.rocketdock.com) similar to the ones on OS X. I am not launching the shortcut from only this dock. I am also launching it from the Start Menu and the Desktop. The Firefox 3.1 Beta 2 software is installed on an external hard drive. If the hard drive is plugged in, the first window will appear, but after closing, the problem persists. As expected, if the hard drive is not plugged in (via USB to specify) Firefox will not open because it cannot find the executable file.
