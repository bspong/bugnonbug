I had been using Firefox on Intel Mac since January, a week ago using Firefox 3.6 (I don't really remember if I update before that) Firefox didn't start.
I uninstalled Firefox 3.5.x using AppZapper (which uninstalls everything about an app) Today I installed Firefox 3.6.2 and the problem continues.
I made some test, I deleted everything in folder ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/ and then Firefox starts happily. Then I updated my persona, it went OK, then I installed Weave Plugin, Firefox ask to restart, it quits and it won't start again. I deleted ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/ again, then I update my persona again -fine, then I installed TabMixPlus plugin, it restarts OK, but then I reinstall Google Toolbar and it won't start after that.
My conclusion, Firefox won't run with certain plugins.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Clean Firefox 3.6.2. installation in Intel Mac OS 10.6.2
2.Completely close Firefox several times, it should be OK
3.Install Weave or Google toolbar plug-in (this two at least generated the error for me)
4.When Firefox asks to restart after plug-in installation it won't start again.
5.If you want to be able to run Firefox again, delete ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/ content.
Actual Results:  
Firefox won't run after instaling certain plug-ins (Tested with Weave and Google toolar)

Expected Results:  
Firefox should start without problems after plug-in installation

As I commented, I made test updating my Persona (Firefox Girl2) and without updating it (using the regular theme).
I  have the Firefox icon on the Deck bar, after the problem you click it, the icon "jumps" (as usual) once, then it stop "jumping" and the light blue spot (which indicates that the app is running) below the icon disappears.
