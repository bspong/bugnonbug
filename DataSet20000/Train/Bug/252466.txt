FFox 0.9.1 hangs when replying slashdot comment

I know that my slashdot comments are not specially good, but FFox seems to
dislike them more than anybody. I would say 70% of times I try to reply a
slashdot comment on an article (not the original article itself), FFox starts to
go wild. Here is what top says:

  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
15744 c0p0n     25   0 63824  34m  33m R 97.1  6.8   0:44.20 firefox-bin

So I have to terminate the process. Last time it was running by almost 1hr (I
was curious to know if it was a temporal hung), so I think that it ended totally
crazy. 

Curious thing about this is that FFox 0.8 hunged (segfaulted) on another
slashcode website (www.barrapunto.com), this time when clicking on a comment
link. It did that always, but when FFox 0.9 arrived that behaviour dissapeared.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open slashdot.org
2. Click "reply" on any comment 
3. Wait a couple of seconds for some magyck!!

Actual Results:  
FFox getting all CPU time.

Expected Results:  
FFox working normally, and not getting all CPU time.
