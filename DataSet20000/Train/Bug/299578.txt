the fix to bug 76831 helped to cover up the slow paging of gecko apps by causing
them to get paged out less frequently.  the paging problem still exists, though,
and should really be addressed.  i've come up with a reproducable testcase to
demonstrate this problem without setting config.trim_on_minimize back to true.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. use firefox for a few hours, open new windows and tabs, get the memory usage
at or above 100 MB
2. open a few large images in photoshop (or most likely the gimp, or anything
else that will also use around 100 MB of memory)
3. minimize both apps and leave the computer on overnight
4. restore both apps

Actual Results:  
photoshop becomes completely usable after 10 to 15 seconds.  firefox takes about
60 seconds to get about as usable as it's going to be, and still has a noticable
feedback lag compared to a fresh start.

Expected Results:  
firefox becomes completely usable after 10 to 15 seconds, just like photoshop.

not being very familiar with the mozilla codebase myself, i find the excessive
font handles mentioned in comments to bug 76831 very suspicious sounding.
