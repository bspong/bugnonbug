Messenger Plus! Live version 4.60.0.324 - Released 19/03/2008, with StuffPlug 3 Disabled.

The script editor causes the Firefox interface to "freeze" when opened. For example, Firefox does not display "Firefox" when it's switched from another window. It still displays the previous window's contents, until the screen is moved.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download Messenger Plus! Live (http://www.msgpluslive.net/)
2.Open Script Editor ((A new menu after File, Contatcts... Help) Plus!-> Preferences -> General Tab -> Scripts (on the left hand side) -> Create New.
3.Feel free to write a script.
Actual Results:  
Switching back to Firefox was normal.

Expected Results:  
Sometimes, switching back to Firefox causes the contents of the Script Editor to be displayed still (like Firefox was frozen), until mouseover some buttons, then those buttons will appear. Otherwise the rest of the window still consists of the Script Editor.
