Search bar auto-hiding causes focus stealing with virtual desktop auto-switch
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.7) Gecko/2009030422 Ubuntu/8.10 (intrepid) Firefox/3.0.7

 I'm using Kubuntu 8.10 32bit with KDE v4.2.1, in KDE I set up several virtual desktops.

 Firefox has a feature named "Search as you type" (I use it a lot when
translating KDE). If I start typing then Firefox instantly shows search bar (at
the bottom of window) and in web page searches for my typed text and highlights
what found. If I stop typing then after few seconds Firefox hides search bar.

 If I switch to another desktop once I stop typing then after ~5 s (when
Firefox auto-hides search bar) auto-switch to Firefox desktop occurs.

 I think that is not good when Firefox aggressively steals focus.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable "search when type";
2. When web page loaded then start typing something for search;
3. When You stop typing then immediately (before search bar auto-hides) switch to another virtual desktop;
4. Wait few second for search bar in Firefox auto-hides.
Actual Results:  
Desktop automatically switches back to Firefox desktop.

Expected Results:  
Firefox must "silently" auto-hide search bar
