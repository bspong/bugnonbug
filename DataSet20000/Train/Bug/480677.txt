After a system crash caused by another program firefox wouldn't start anymore. When attempting to start firefox the entire system would stall. First other programs cannot be started anymore, then a few seconds later running programs would start to not react anymore until the entire system freezes and a hard-reset is the only option.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox
Actual Results:  
System freezes.

Expected Results:  
Firefox start

Facts:
I run a Vista 64 SP 1 with all recommended updates except the Silverlight update.
I had no problems running firefox before the system crash. I did not change any relevant system configuration or updated firefox in between the last successfull running of firefox and the system crash. I cannot recall if firefox was running during the system crash, but it's very possible. The system crash was propably not due to firefox (I was running a game when my system blue-screened on me; I was not able to recognize the error code), but it may have been.
Reinstalling firefox without removing the user data would not fix the problem.
Purging firefox (including user data) before reinstalling it fixed the problem though. Firefox runs fine now again.
I cannot reproduce the failure now anymore.

Speculation:
The crash left firefox (more precise its user data) in a state that would cause the entire system to malfunction when firefox was started.
Sadly I did not backup the firefox user data before purging it, so I cannot provide the propably corrup data for inspection.
