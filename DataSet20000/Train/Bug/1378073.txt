Improve perceived Speed on slow responding page/slow webserver

Steps to reproduce:

open url https://wiki.mozilla.org/Quantum/Flow#QF_Dashboard

this page seems to be slow at times (what is not the problem I am reporting here).
the page takes seconds to load, because the server-side seem to collect data or something.

In this situation the end-user only sees a spinner in the browser tab and a empty window.
-> on a bigger screen (e.g. 22'') you see a huge area/empty canvas with gray background and the tabbar at the top with a loading indicator.


Actual results:

the site (or browser?) is perceived as beeing slow. Its not transparent to the user whether its a browser issue or a webserver issue, but it feels slow/unresponsive.


Expected results:

I dont have a concrete UI in mind, but I think at least a "loading progress" indicator within the browser window would be awesome.

the progress could maybe even be explained to the end-user, like 
"we are resolving the servers hostname for you" (in case dns is slow)
"the webserver seems to respond in a slowly fashion. please hang on" (in case connection was opened, but the webserver didnt respond with content yet)
"we download the content of the website for you" (in case the page is huge)

this kind of "progress indication" would only be worth it when a sites performance is "slow", I dont think it should be displayed for a page which takes "just 1-3" seconds or similar.
