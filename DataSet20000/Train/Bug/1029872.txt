adobe flash or shockwave crashed using Firefox 31.0 Beta update channel
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140623175014

Steps to reproduce:

I did nothing. I fact, I was typing an email when the message popped up.


Actual results:

A message popped up telling me ShockWave had crashed. Then I saw another popup saying Adobe Flash Player had crashed. I do not know what all that means. THIS HAPPENED LESS THAN 10 MINUTES AFTER A FIREFOX SECURITY AND STABILITY UPDATE. Some stability. 
Here is the text of other messages that have gratuitously popped up over the last couple of days:

Buttons: Continue and Stop Script

Another one in less than 30 minutes:

At your suggestion earlier I updated to the Beta track. I'm still getting these gratuitous errors. I allowed the latest update just a few minutes ago because I thought it would fix this nonsense. Please forgive my misplaced optimism.

Oh yes, and sometimes Firefox just gratuitously flips behind some other program or behind the History/Bookmark form if it happens to be up. Or it flips from one tab to another three or four tabs away. This behavior just started within the last couple of weeks I believe.

I'm using Win7.


Expected results:

People, not wanting to hurt feelings, but this has been going on for years! You have the best browser out there - but it needs to work and not annoy!!!
