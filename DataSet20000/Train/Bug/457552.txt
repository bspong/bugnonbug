Normally, if you visit a (https) website whose cert issuer is not included in the local cert db, there is a nice xul page instead of the page telling you about the problem and letting you add an exception.
If you use "autodetect proxy settings" or "use proxy configuration url", this page does not show up but instead a popup occurs. This popup does not allow to add an exception.
Please see the images attached.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. set proxy settings to "use proxy configuration url" and supply some wpad file
2. visit https://www.html.de (or any other page whose issuer cert is not included in firefox)
3. see a popup where an info page should be
Actual Results:  
A popup occurs.

Expected Results:  
An info page allowing to add an exception for the cert.

My net supplies me with a wpad file, so both options "use configuration url" and "autodetect proxy settings" lead to this popup. The options "no proxy", "system settings" and "manual proxy" do not trigger this failure.

This really makes visiting webpages with self made certs annoying.
