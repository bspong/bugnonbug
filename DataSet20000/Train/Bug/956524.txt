Steps to reproduce:

1. Go on http://tim-philipp-schaefers.de/poc/
2. Try to close the box!
3. You are not able to do that. 
A normal User would not find a way to close the browser (with process explorer/task manager), so you are able to execute javascript for a long time. So you are able to calculate bitcoin or sth. like that.



Actual results:

Instead of creating the dialog which allows you to prevent additional dialogs, the page refreshs all the time and creates a new "js-alert" box. 
So for an attacker would it be possible to execute javascript for a long time (perhaps calculate bitcoin or crack hashes ;because some BDU don't know how to kill a process), if someone goes on an effected domain.


Expected results:

Normally if a "js-alert" of a website appears you are able to close it. If you try it two times there is a dialog: "Prevent this page from creating additional dialogs" with the checkbox - but not in this case.

Possible fix:
There should be implemented a control which points out how often a js-alert was shown and if it is several times there should be add the normal dialog: "Prevent this page from creating additional dialogs" with the checkbox.
