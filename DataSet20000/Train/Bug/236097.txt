Currently you can only specify one parameter for custom keyword searches or
queries, using %s. This potentially limits the input you can pass to specific
websites where it may be advantageous to use custom keywords. Example below,
quoted from <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=57271">more
identifiers like %s - MozillaZine Forums</a>.

for example: the 3 strings between the '*' in the following link are editable
http://www.tvtoday.de/tv/programm/programm.php?ztag=1&sparte=*alle*&uhrzeit=Ax*01*&sender=*HS*
(if you want to visit that page you have to remove the '*')

So my question: are there more identifiers like '%s' so that i can edit all 3
variables? (I want to type something like 'tv [time] [sender] [genre]'

It would also be useful for currency conversion websites.

I would suggest that the bookmark should be able to store %s, %s1, %s2, %s3 and
so on, and that a specific character is used to differentiate between them in
the location bar, such as ~ or something which is generally not searched for.
