./mach build devtools doesn't reload files anymore
I've been having this problem for a few days. It started right around the time 2 things happened:

- we changed the way devtools resource URLs look like (see https://github.com/jryans/devtools-migrate/blob/master/resource-devtools/README.md)
- I played with the gcli 'tools reload' command.

Since then, every time I execute './mach build devtools', then none of the changes I made to my source files are loaded in firefox when I run it with './mach run -P dev'.
I have to do a full './mach build' for it to work.

Thinking this might have been related to me playing with the gcli command, I removed the srcdir pref and stopped using it.

I'm on Windows 10.

Let's take the example of this file:
/devtools/client/animationinspector/components.js

- I do a local change to the file in Sublime,
- then I run './mach build devtools' (or even './mach build devtools/client', it has the same effect for me),
- then I run firefox './mach run -P dev' and open the devtools

I can see that my change wasn't taken into account.

In fact, if I then open this URL in a new browser tab:
resource://devtools/client/animationinspector/components.js
I can see that my change isn't here.

I kept on digging around a bit more and found out that if I execute this piece of code:

  let target = "resource://devtools/client/animationinspector/components.js";
  let resourceHandler = Services.io.getProtocolHandler("resource")
                        .QueryInterface(Ci.nsISubstitutingProtocolHandler);
  let resURI = Services.io.newURI(target, null, null);
  let uri = Services.io.newURI(resourceHandler.resolveURI(resURI), null, null);

then I get uri.spec = file:///c:/Users/Patrick/dev/fx-team/obj-x86_64-pc-mingw32/dist/bin/browser/chrome/devtools/modules/devtools/client/animationinspector/components.js

Using the windows explorer (or a new tab in Firefox), I can see that this file does exist but doesn't have my changes.

In fact, keeping an explorer window opened on the parent folder while running './mach build devtools' shows that this file isn't being overridden.
If I run './mach build' then it does get overridden.

One more thing, the file doesn't appear to be a symlink file to the actual source file (which is what I think happens on Linux).

I'm not sure what are the next steps that I should take to investigate this further, but something is definitely wrong here.
