Multiple tabs cause browser window to not display any content exept for 50px on left of screen

Any time I open Firefox 2.0 and add a 2nd tab (either by link, new tab command etc) it clears the browser display of all content except for approximately 50px on left of window. When new tab is opened the only visible elements of the tabs themselves are the 'new tab' icon, and the left and right tab select buttons.

I also have Firefox 2.0 installed on my mac @ work which runs OSX 10.3.9 and it has no problems. Only difference I can see between the 2 setups is version of OSX and here at home I have the Google Toolbar installed (however when i disabled this toolbar it did not fix this bug). 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Open a new tab via file menu, Cmd +T, URL link, etc...
3.It happens.

Actual Results:  
It clears the browser display of all content except for approximately 50px on left of window. When new tab is opened the only visible elements of the tabs themselves are the 'new tab' icon, and the left and right tab select buttons.

Expected Results:  
Displayed tabs correctly, and the content of the window correctly.

Using default Firefox 2.0 theme, have Google Toolbar installed
