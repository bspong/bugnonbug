Firefox 1.0 Lockup during startup, attempting to connect to homepage
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox

Upon startup of Firefox 1.0 Final Release, browser locks up attempting to 
connect to http://daw-systems.com/v-web/bulletin/bb/index.php. I have not been 
able to connect to any other site, as the browser locks up within 3 seconds, 
and if I manage to click "stop" before the lockup, the program locks anyway. I 
have used this address as my homepage for approximately 2 months with no 
difficulty. It worked until approximately 12:00 PM local time (PST). I shut 
the system down, and upon restarting, Firefox simply quit working properly. I 
have uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox, restarted the computer 6 times, and 
the software still does not work.
