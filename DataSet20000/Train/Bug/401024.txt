Firefox gone mad when browsing with 20+ tabs

I've been browsing the web like I normally do.I go to www.hi5.com and start opening profiles.After about 20+ open profiles,Firefox starts to behave rather oddly.I don't know if it's because of the security bug that IE suffers from too or whatever (you guys should know :P ),but it's a problem for me.
After opening 20+ tabs,I can only switch to another tab with immense lag times.I click on another tab and it takes about 3-5 minutes before it does this.If I close the tab I'm currently browsing,it switches very nicely and fast (as it normally should ) to the next tab.Also,addresses of the type : "http://www.hi5.com/friend/photos/displayUserAlbum.do?albumId=82670224&ownerId=119624346" go mad.Characters and even numbers change at a rapid pace (about 30-60 combinations a second),operation that lasts about two seconds.During this time,I can't do anything with Firefox.Also,the scroll doesn't work except manually.I have to manually hold click on the scroll bar to make it work.It doesn't accept input from the keyboard's directional keys,page up or page down keys or even the mouse's wheel.After going below 20+ tabs,all Firefox functionality is back to normal.But the abnormal changes in the address still occur.The change of the address doesn't jump me to the address that is being changed.I still remain on the page I'm browsing.
Hope this helps.
Love&Peace!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to hi5.com
2.Open 20+ tabs of profiles of people on hi5
3.Try to switch to another open program or try to switch to another tab.
Actual Results:  
Immense lags when trying to another tab (3-5 minutes) or to switch to another app (1-3 minutes).Direct switch to the next tab,should I close the one I was currently browsing.Addresses were changing by themselves.Scroll bar wasn't working except in manual mode (holding left-click on it).

Expected Results:  
Instant tab switch.Instant switch to another app.No addresses changing by themselves.Scrollbar that works in full-mode ( using directional keys from the keyboard,page up and page down and the mouse wheel).

Theme in use : Noia 2.0 (eXTreme).
