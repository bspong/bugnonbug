This bug is pretty strange...
It happens always when the firefox process ran a long time.
Then it starts to create new windows (like popups) that displays parts of the contents (I think mostly frames or images but sometimes also the whole site) from sites that are currently opened.
On these sites the region where the content was is no longer redrawn (which leads to the nice effects when you draw other windows over it ;) ).
It also happens that more than one such window opens.
Typically this happens with advertising parts of websites.

When I close those windows firefox crashes.
When I close the tab/windows from where the content come,... the tab/window is closed and the damaged windows, too.

I can actually "use" (click on links, etc.) the non-stolen parts of the original window/tab (but not those parts the went into the new windows) and I can also "use" the stolen parts in the damaged window.

This happens with and without the use of tabs,...

I experience the bug for a long time now,.. probably since 2.0 (was to lazy until now to report it ;) )

I use the binary nvidia kernel drivers,... Xorg 7.3 and i use a dual screen setup but with two X-screens (0.0 and 0.1) and not with Xinerama or sth like that.

Ah,.. and btw: I think that new (damaged) windows are only opened when I reload/open a new page.
But this happens very ofte because I use the TabMixPlus extension and have auto-reload set to 10 secs at some sites,... and this all the day ;)

Any ideas?
If you need further information please ask.
