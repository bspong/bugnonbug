Browser fails to shutdown completely; running in the background
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; InfoPath.1)
Build Identifier: 1.5.0.7

Often,but not always, after closing the browser, when I try to open it again, there is a message saying firefox is already running, even though I don't see it or have access.  At first the only solution was for me to reboot my computer. Now, whenever that happens, or if the browser hangs upon opening, I do a ctrl+alt+delete and find that firefox.exe is listed in the processes. I delete it and then can open the browser.  Seems as if the browser is not completely shutting down.  
This is all after a clean re-install of the latest version.
Please advise.

Thank you,
Daniel
