After changing window decorations in KDE 3.5.1 Level "a", Firefox and Thunderbird 2.0.0.6 segment faulted at startup (after powering down and back up).  Firefox ran ok from a different account and ran ok when desktop manager was switched to Gnome.  Running the KDE Desktop Wizard and accepting all defaults (thereby resetting window theme and decorations back to default) "fixed" Firefox and Thunderbird so that they no longer segment faulted.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  When failure starts it is everytime.
2.  Unknown what changes in window manager window decoration causes failures in FF and T to start.
3.  Unknown if Reinitializing window decoration with wizard (or some other tool) will always fix problem.
4.  If problem reoccurs when I change my window decorations again, I will update this report.




Other observations that may be helpful:
1. Segment faults on both Firefox and Thunderbird began the next day after changing the window theme from default to "smooth blend" (i.e. after a power down and back up).
2. During period when both FF and T were reliably crashing, KDE component kcompose was reporting "KomposeGlobal::initSharedPixmaps() - Pixmap not available" in my ~/.X.err file (there are hundreds of these).  kcompose was killed and restarted and the error was no longer reported.  FF and T still crashed at that time.  Ff and T are working properly now and error is not being reported.
3. No changes were made to Firefox or Thunderbird bits to fix their startup segmentation faults.  That is, neither program bits nor any file under ~/.mozilla was changed or reinstalled. 
4. OpenSuSE 10.1, KDE 3.5.1 Level "a", Firefox 2.0.0.6, Thunderbird 2.0.0.6.
5. Seamonkey ran ok during the period that Firefox and Thunderbird were segment faulting.
