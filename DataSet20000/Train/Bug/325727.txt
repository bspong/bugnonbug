Menu background colour streaks across <pre> enclosed content.

When going to the web page http://www.quirksmode.org/css/condcom.html and scrolling through the page, the right side 'Contents' menus background colour appears to bleed through to the content area where the page content is enclosed within the <pre> ... </pre> HTML elements, leaving streak-like lines randomly, as if it were scratching the content area.

This generally only happens if the 'content' menu moves over the far right side  of the <pre> ... </pre> enclosed content. On a larger screen res for example (above my 800 x 600) the menu doesn't move over the <pre> ... </pre> enclosed content, and so no streaks are left. Also, if the browser window is resized to be smaller horizontally, there is a point where the streak effect will again stop appearing. It's as if there is a small zone on the web page that Firefox doesn't like, and streaks it when the menu moves over it.

I'm sorry to say that I didn't really know how to brand this bug, so couldn't find a previous bug report in Bugzilla, so if this is a duplicate, I apologise.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load up http://www.quirksmode.org/css/condcom.html in Firefox 1.5 (I'm using the GB build).
2. Scroll down the page to where the code example for the IE conditional comments are shown (this section is inside the <pre> ... </pre> HTML elements), making sure the 'content' menu directly moves across the content (too far right and the menu won't go over the content and hence won't cause the streak effect).
3. Scroll back up the page to view the streaks left in the same colour as the menus background.

Actual Results:  
Streaks left over the page content which is enclosed within the <pre> ... </pre> HTML elements.

Expected Results:  
No streaks to be left, and instead the page to scroll as normal,

The software should not have left the streaks over the content.
