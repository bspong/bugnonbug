"running but not responding" should not appear while the previous instance updates extensions
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.7) Gecko/2009030422 Ubuntu/8.10 (intrepid) Firefox/3.0.7

Firefox behaves user-unfriendly regarding second instances, while updating its extensions. (For example, first instance updates, second instance launched by clicking a link in Thunderbird. Currently, the second instance warns about a not-responding first instance, making the user think it crashed. They have to wait until updating completed, then click the link again.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch firefox with outdated extensions, you see the update window
2. Launch another firefox with an URL
Actual Results:  
The second instance it will tell you a previous instance is running but not responding.

Expected Results:  
The first instance, that's currently updating should respond to the second instance, save their URL to the session, continue update, and after restarting open the saved session, including the URL the second instance wanted to open.


This new behaviour should be announced somehow: show an information bar "Page %s will be shown after updating is completed", set WM alert state for the window.
