It would be nice if the link to the main page in live bookmarks were moved to the top of the rss list instead of the bottom. scrolling over a large list of rss titles is a lot more inconvenient than mousing over the site link to get to the first feed update. I think seeing the updates and having access to the site link at the top are more important than having the newest feed item at the top.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a live bookmark from an rss feed on the bookmarks toolbar.
2.Try to use the live bookmark to go to the main page.
3.Scroll through a potentially long list of RSS items before reaching the link.
Actual Results:  
I have to do a lot of scrolling to load the rss main page.

Expected Results:  
Being able to more quickly get to the rss main page by either moving the link to the main page from the bottom of the feed items or make it so I can double click the live bookmark to use it as a regular bookmark.
