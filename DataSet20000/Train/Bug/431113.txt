Extremely slow AJAX/Javascript performance with Firefox 3.0b5 for Linux
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9b5) Gecko/2008041514 Firefox/3.0b5

I am not a web developer so I'm not sure what type of code is doing what. But it seems like AJAX or Javascript related websites are causing serious slowness on the couple of machines that I have.

#1  Gmail scrolls extremely slowly when in the inbox (compare to normal HTML mode for Gmail which can be selected at bottom of the page)

#2  http://www.tuaw.com scrolls extremely slowly (especially compared to Windows XP on my same machine)

#3  Any website with the AJAX style images (that pop up on screen) for example:
        http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/downloads/ssotd/#latest
        http://www.transmissionbt.com/screenshots.php

#4  http://www.shacknews.com/
      This page is the worst.  When an image near the top transitions to the next image it freezes Firefox completely until the transition is complete.

#5 Countless other sites with this kind of code.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox 3.0 b5
2. Goto any of the websites listed above


Expected Results:  
Compared to Windows XP version of Firefox 3.0 b5 on my same machine performance is EXTREMELY slow.

I run Ubuntu 8.04 i386 but I have also tried the 64 bit version with the same results. My computer is:  Athlon 64 3800+, 2gb RAM, NVIDIA GeForce 8600GT if that has any impact. This happens with both Compiz-Fusion enabled AND disabled. This also occurs with both the open source NV drivers and NVIDIA's "restricted" drivers installed via apt-get.


I have also filed a bug report on Ubuntu's bug website here:
