Having any add-on enabled pegs CPU usage at high, consistent amount
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:17.0) Gecko/17.0 Firefox/17.0
Build ID: 20120924042009

Steps to reproduce:

Windows XP. Disabled all plugins, themes, and add-ons and closed all Panorama groups and tabs (except for the add-ons manager) and restarted the browser. Firefox is now at 0% CPU usage. Enabled one add-on (doesn't really matter which, reproduces with *most* of my add-ons, but *not* all; a partial list: Firebug 1.10.3, Adblock Plus 2.1.2, TileTabs 7.1, User Agent RG 1.0) and restarted the browser. Does not matter if the add-on is restartless or not (no effect on CPU until after restart).


Actual results:

95% of the time, Firefox's CPU usage is now pegged at ~50% (the other 5% of the time it remains at 0%, as normal). If the add-on is restartless, disabling it has no effect on CPU.

Interestingly, I can then disable the add-on and restart the browser once more, and Firefox will *still* be pegged at 50% CPU usage, even with no add-ons whatsoever enabled. One more restart is required to return to 0% CPU. After that, additional restarts will not cause the 50% CPU usage to recur until an add-on is enabled.


Expected results:

With no plugins, themes, or tabs, and only one add-on, Firefox should remain near 0% CPU rather than a consistent 50%. The browser should not still be using this extreme amount of CPU even after restarting without any add-ons.
