Confirmation dialogs for quitting appear in a funny order with multiple windows open

If you have two FF windows and you select File -> Quit, you'll get a confirmation dialog for each window that has more than one tab. Now, if you those windows are in different workspaces, sometimes (most of the time?) the first confirmation dialog will be attached to the window that is *not* on the current workspace one is seeing. Maybe the dialogs are put up onwindows repsecting the order in which the windows were created or something like that.

IMHO, the way to fix this is to have exactlly *one* confirmation dialog pop up on the Quit command, with a message reading something along the lines of "you have 13 windows open. are you sure you want to quit?" Note that I'm counting windows and not tabs here---and I'm even counting windows with one tab in them.
I would not show the confirmation dialog if there is exactly one window. (The rationale being the same as the one that makes it logical to not confirm closing a window when there is only one tab: the user is in view of the whole thing)

If that change is too copernican, then maybe the confirmation dialogs can be reordered so that the first one to pop up is attached to the window in which the Quit menu item got run? 

This is not an enhancement: it is a bug ;-)

Reproducible: Always
