I have a video running in one tab and then start a web cam (from some site) in another tab - the result is a crash (i.e., --firefox has encountered an error and will now close --). Also to note, radio/audio is running in another tab prior to starting the web cam. Audio and first video work ok together; the crash happens when the web cam is attempted to be started. 

Also, the web cam and the audio, two separate tabs, (no other video) work fine as well at the same time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start a internet radio station (e.g., last.fm)
2. start a movie (e.g. youtube)
3. start a web cam from some site (e.g., maronvseder.tv)
Actual Results:  
Crash, i.e. firefox displays an error message and you are directed to close, or is terminated automatically

Expected Results:  
continue working with the web cam on - multiple videos (movies) seem to work simultaneously in different tabs

web cam freezes happened in the previous version I used as well, firefox 2.something, not exactly in the given scenario but just on their own: live web cam streaming would result in browser freeze
