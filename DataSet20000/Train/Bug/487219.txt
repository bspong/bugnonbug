Current session data is lost upon browser restart if the option to clear browsing history upon shutdown is set

If the option to "always clear my private data when I close <browser>" is set and includes the "Browsing History", then restarting the browser will result in the current session being lost. 

I understand that if the clear private data on shutdown option is set, that the session data should be deleted when the browser is closed regardless of the browser startup options (see bug 398817), but the session data should not be cleared when the browser is restarted as most users would not consider a restart to be "closing the browser".

As is, if the setting to clear private data on shutdown is set, then the current session will be lost if a user installs an add-on, upgrades the browser, disables/enables an add-on, etc and then clicks "Restart" when prompted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Check the "always clear my private data when I close <browser>" option and make sure it includes "Browsing History"
2. Go to addons.mozilla.org and install any add-on.
3. When prompted to restart the browser, do so.
Actual Results:  
The current session is lost.

Expected Results:  
The current session should be maintained on a restart, regardless of the clear private data on shutdown setting.

This issue was caused by the fix to bug 483566 and exists in the Firefox 3.5 and trunk branches.

See bug 398817 for the initial discussion about clearing the session data on shutdown.
