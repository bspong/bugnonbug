I really like the new context menu that puts search results into a new tab (when right-click on highlighted text and choose Search ...).

I think it would be a nice enhancement if I could make this the default behavior for *any* search from the search toolbar, as this would match my normal usage pattern a great majority of the time.

I would propose adding a new checkbox (or radio button) in the Manage search engines screen, either next to or beneath the "Show suggestions" checkbox.

For a check box, the check box might say "show results in current tab" (defaults to checked).  If unchecked, then the search results would be either in new tab or new window, depending on the user's preference in Tools / Options / Tabs for determining what to do when opening a new page.

For a radio button, the choices I would imagine are "Show results in current tab vs. Show results in new tab vs. Show results in new window".  Default would be, obviously, "Show results in current tab".
