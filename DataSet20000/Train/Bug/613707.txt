Ok, this happens mostly when loading QuakeLive, on the map loading screen in the game, there are these green dots, some of them stay solid while others occasionally flash, they go away once the game is actually loaded. When exiting the game, I can see the dots flashing in by browser frame, as I am typing this, I can see this green dot flashing like crazy and it goes away once I minimize or close firefox. I don't see it anywhere else other than in firefox... I am running an Asus m3n-ht deluxe (w/ onboard 8300) with an amd phenom 9950be, and a dual nvidia 9800gt sli setup with version 3.6.12 - i believe this is the only version in which these artifacts have popped up because I have never noticed them before until the past couple of days. At first, I believed that I may have to RMA my video card, or replace my monitor for that matter... but I have not reproduced these artifacts in any other programs or games.

Reproducible: Always
