Firefox automatically upgraded itself to 3.0.11, but did not do so successfully.  I now get constant messages saying it cannot connect...  I have uninstalled and reinstalled it, uninstalled it and installed a newer beta version, but nothing gets rid of the "cannot connect" message.  If I use IE7 I have no problem connecting, and I also have no problem connecting via Outlook, but Firefox seems stuck in a bad place, presumably trying to connect to the "installed new version" page, but it will also not connect to any other URL I have tried, e.g. CNN.com.  Very frustrating!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install 3.0.11 (first time with problem
2.try to connect 3.Uninstall and repeat 1 & 2;  substitute beta 3.5 for 3.0.11 if desired; restart computer if desired


Expected Results:  
connected to the page "Firefox has just been upgraded"
