Firefox exhibits poor performance when accessing Hotmail
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0


  During periods of high load (10am - 4pm PST) Hotmail is nearly inaccessible
using Firefox.  The symptoms vary - sometimes my mailbox comes up showing 0
messages when in fact there are hundreds, sometimes the response time is slow
(~20 seconds), sometimes when I send email it sends blank messages.  However,
when I use Internet Explorer the symptoms are *much* reduced.  I've started to
notice this ~2 weeks ago even though I haven't changed versions of Firefox.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into a Hotmail account from 10am - 4pm PST
2. Hit the "Mail" tab multiple times to observe the response
3. Attempt to send an email message

Actual Results:  
Performance and success rate varies between Internet Explorer 6.0 and Firefox

Expected Results:  
Performance of a large site like Hotmail will certainly vary under periods of
high utilization, but it seems that performance is always worse with Firefox vs.
Internet Explorer.
