Firefox 3.6.13-2 will not start in safe-mode or at all.  When attempting to start firefox, either by the command line, or in the KDE menu on Centos 5.5, you will see that firefox attempts to start, but never opens the browser window and crashes less than a minute later.  

Firefox will not start in safe-mode at all and when the firefox -safe-mode command is entered at the command line, nothing happens.  

We have attempted to uninstall/install from the command line with an RPM and also using the package manager utility but that has not fixed the problem.

We have also attempted to run Firefox from the command line using the dubugger (eg firefox -g) and it would still not start.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox from either the applications menu, the command line (eg firefox), or safe mode (firefox -safe-mode)

Actual Results:  
Firefox will not start

Expected Results:  
Firefox will not start

Firefox should have started
