Application crash in OS X after latest software update
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en-ca) AppleWebKit/418.8 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/419.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7

Firefox automatically updated September 16, requesting a restart
After restart, the entire application crashes upon viewing any page containing JavaScript
Repeated re-installs and reboots failed to correct the problem.
The first crash occurred after watching YouTube for about 30 minutes - I thought maybe there was some kind of overflow error happening from playing 200MB-300MB worth of video data. Clearing all cache items failed to resolve the problem.
I deleted the .app and re-downloaded from the main page, and it still crashes.

I am running a PowerBook G4 laptop with OS X 10.4.7 and other applications, including the Safari browser are running OK. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Delete your old version, removing the .app file and Dock icon.
2. Download the latest public release for OS X from http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/
3. Install and run the .app
4. View a page that includes JavaScript. Reliable crashes are produced by this page:
     http://www.translink.bc.ca/

Actual Results:  
Firefox application crashes upon pageview.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should be able to view pages that display JavaScript - it always has in the past.
