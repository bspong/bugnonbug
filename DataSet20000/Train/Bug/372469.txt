Firefox gets stuck (blocks, need to close window to continue) on a digg.con Java script on www.littlegreenfootballs.com but only at certain hours (around 05am swiss time). 

I'm sure it's digg.com script as I use NoScript module and could isolate the culprit. 

Safari works with no problem when Firefox gets stuck !

Several digg / littlegreenfootballs.com users have reported the problem that's only affecting Firefox on Mac OS X

Even stranger, next morning everything works again without changing / rebooting etc... How can a script block at some specific time (some days it doesn't block) and work perfect at different hours without ANY changes ?
I just put my main computer at sleep during my nights (days...), wake it up when I wake up, allow digg scripts again, reload the LGF main page and all is fine... till 05 am...
