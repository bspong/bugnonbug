firefox hangs when this page is loaded (as does netscape 8 beta)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

this section of code hangs firefox:

for(i=0; i<document.all.length; i++)
{
		document.write(document.all[i]+"<br/>");
}

i can see why as document.all may contain a fair amount of data however other
browsers e.g. opera8 and sadly IE6 cope with it.

netscape 8 beta also hangs, suggesting the issue has existed for some time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load http://www.thedotproduct.co.uk/firefox/index.htm or any other page
containing:

for(i=0; i<document.all.length; i++)
{
		document.write(document.all[i]+"<br/>");
}
Actual Results:  
firefox hangs and does not seem to recover.

Expected Results:  
rendered the page or warned that the script was using too many resources.

i have several extensions installed however i do not believe these have any
effect since the issue is exactly the same in netscape 8 beta which is based on
firefox 0.9.6 and has no extensions or themes installed as i use it only for
testing.

my build config is:
