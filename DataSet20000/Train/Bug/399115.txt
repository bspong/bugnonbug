problems with feed loading and scrambled article lists in live booknmarks
Using Build identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-IN; rv:1.9a9pre) Gecko/2007100804 Minefield/3.0a9pre and also back to m8 builds I've seen feed entries not show up in a live bookmark in the order that I'd expect.  I've noticed something like this for the last several days.

I have a live bookmark for http://planet.mozilla.org/ 
(the feed is set for http://planet.mozilla.org/atom.xml)

but looking at the list of entries show up in live feed it shows the following articles at the top of the list
http://www.bitstampede.com/2007/10/02/working-the-doc-list/
http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jason/archives/018582.html
and http://www.kaply.com/weblog/2007/10/02/getting-microformats-working-with-web-services/

http://www.silfreed.net/content/mozdev-sysadmin-meeting-minutes-2007-10-02 is the earliest article

When I look at the planet live feed in 2.0.0.7 I don't even see the "working the doc list" article, and  http://hecker.org/mozilla/foundation-activities-2007-10-05 is the latest at the top of the list as is currently shown if I visit
http://planet.mozilla.org/

looking closer I see that maybe I might be in some suspended state from a while back.   When I click on the live bookmark link, at the top I see "Live bookmark loading"  but if I click on that I get an error dialog.
  "url is not valid and can't be loaded"

Then later I go back and the feed seems to have loaded ok and the GranParidiso/Minefield build shows the same ordered articles as the planet page and as I've been viewing in 2.0.0.7.

wonder if anyone else is seeing scrambled article lists in their live bookmark feeds and or strange delays or problems with the feed loading getting stuck with trunk builds.

I'll watch continue to watch for conditions that might explain what is going on a bit better...
