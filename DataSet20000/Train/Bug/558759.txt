Firefox cannot recover after its process is suspended
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When Firefox process gets suspended, opening a new instance of Firefox will do no help at all. User cannot do anything to start working with Firefox again until one of the following actions are performed manually:

1. Resume the Firefox process.
2. End the Firefox process and start Firefox again.
3. Restart the computer.

For a novice user, the step 3 is the only reliable solution. When a new instance of Firefox is opened, it also gets hung and does not show any GUI.

Please note that this bug report is not intended to discuss the reasons for the Firefox process to be suspended unexpectedly; this is ONLY to depict the weakness of the Firefox's ability to recover beyond any unexpected suspensions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
While Firefox is running in memory, suspend it manually. (Eg: By using kernel32.dll in Windows or simply use an external tool for this)
Actual Results:  
Firefox hangs. Opening a new instance of Firefox will not recover it nor opens a new window. Both of the processes will be in memory without any active GUI where user is impossible to communicate with Firefox directly in anyway.

Expected Results:  
Of course, the suspended process cannot recover itself when it has been suspended. But, when the user starts a new instance of Firefox, it should do either display some GUI for the user without being silently running in memory or it could resume the suspended process of the original instance thus letting the user start working with Firefox again.
