Bookmark this page function is not working and I can't even modify the url of another bookmark by going right click properties.

Also clear recent history is only working if I pick Today, if I pick everything it fails.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.navigate to a web page any way you like
2.try to bookmark the page
3.normal dialogue box where you select the folder to put the bookmark in etc never appears and the bookmark is not created. I have even looked in other folders and can't see any evidence of it anywhere.
4.To get around this I tried copying the URL of the page I wanted to bookmark and then went right click properties on an old bookmark I no longer cared about and tried to change the URL and name but the changes never get saved and the bookmark reverts to it's old settings.
Actual Results:  
Nothing, after I click bookmark this page nothing happens, no folder selection dialogue box not even a crash.

Expected Results:  
Open the select folder etc dialogue box and place the bookmark in the selected folder.

Fully legal version of XP pro all updated, with Zone Alarm extreme security. Have tried going back to Firefox 3.5.1 and 3.5.8 and no change.

I have also run the Zone alarm registry cleaner and registry def-rag tool, but again no improvement.

I wonder if this is something specific to my machine though given Bugzilla is not full of similar complaints.
