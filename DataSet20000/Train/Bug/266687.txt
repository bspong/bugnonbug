the default character encoding list isn't populated when accessing the options page via the windows xp start menu
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; fr-FR; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040910

Under Windows XP when Firefox is registered as the default browser you have the
ability to display the Options page directly from the start menu by right
clicking on the internet icon.
When you access the Options page this way you can't set the default character
encoding.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup Firefox as the default browser : the "Internet" start menu icon is now
"Mozilla Firefox"
2. Right click on this icon and select "Firefox Options"
3. The "Options" window pops : hit the "Languages..." button in the "Languages"
section


Actual Results:  
A tiny "Languages and Character Encoding" window pops with no item to choose in
the "Default Character Encoding:" list.

Expected Results:  
Display some character encodings to choose from.

Workaround : access the "Options" window by choosing "Tools / Options..." in the
Firefox menubar instead of using the start menu "<right-click> / Firefox
Options" shortcut.
