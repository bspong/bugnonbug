Firefox restart loses URLs

When closing and restarting Firefox, one has the option of restoring the previous sessions (all pages open in tabs will be reloaded upon restart). There is a bug in the implementation in which the URL of the page does not appear in the location bar until _after_ the page has loaded. This has three consequences:
1) The user cannot bookmark or copy the URL to another location.
2) If the page fails to load, then there is no way to determine which URL was in the particular tab. The best one could do is grep the History. However, users like me who erase their History upon closing Firefox are SOOL.
3) If Firefox is closed and reopened before the page loads, then the page is lost. Firefox does not remember which pages were loading in tabs that did not load before it was closed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a slow-loading page in Firefox.
2. Close Firefox.
3. Reopen Firefox. Note that the URL is inaccessable to be copied or bookmarked.
4. Close Firefox before the page loads.
5. Reopen Firefox.
6. The tab is blank!
7. ???
8. Profit!!!
