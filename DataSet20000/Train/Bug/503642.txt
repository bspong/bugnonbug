Hi GUys,

Am having issues with firefox not being able to add bookmarks. When I hit ctrl-D or the pulldown menu nothing happens. The following was extracted from the error console, when a bookmark was attempted, with firefox running in "all addons turned off" safemode :

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsINavBookmarksService.insertBookmark]"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: file:///usr/lib/firefox-3.0.11/components/nsPlacesTransactionsService.js :: PCIT_doTransaction :: line 374"  data: no]

I have tried the http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Toolbar+keeps+resetting 's "method 1" fix but it didnt make any difference.

I then tried creating a new profile via ProfileManager and still the problem persists only this time the error console spits out this:

Error: this.bookmarks is undefined
Source File: file:///usr/lib/xulrunner-1.9.0.11/modules/utils.js
Line: 884

I tried reinstalling XULRUNNER 1.9 from synaptic and retrying in my default profile gives :

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsINavBookmarksService.insertBookmark]"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: file:///usr/lib/firefox-3.0.11/components/nsPlacesTransactionsService.js :: PCIT_doTransaction :: line 374"  data: no]

And then retrying it under the new profile:

Error: this.bookmarks is undefined
Source File: file:///usr/lib/xulrunner-1.9.0.11/modules/utils.js
Line: 884

Interestingly enough when I try to add a group of tabs into a bookmark folder the "add bookmark" window pops up but hitting add doesnt do anything. This is the output for when I try to add multiple tabs:

UNDER DEFAULT PROFILE:
Error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsINavBookmarksService.insertBookmark]"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: file:///usr/lib/firefox-3.0.11/components/nsPlacesTransactionsService.js :: PCIT_doTransaction :: line 374"  data: no]
Source File: file:///usr/lib/firefox-3.0.11/components/nsPlacesTransactionsService.js
Line: 374

UNDER NEW PROFILE: THE "BOOKMARK ALL TABS" OPTION IS NOT SELECTABLE

It seems to be summarizable to the following 2 issues:

1.Under default profile(safemode) adding a bookmark results in:
"0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"

2.In a new profile it results in "this.bookmarks is undefined" error


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.launch firefox in either default profile/new profile
2.try to add bookmark by ctrl-d'ing or through the bookmarks pulldown menu
3.
Actual Results:  
nothing happens, no bookmarks in the bookmark list

Expected Results:  
bookmark window should have popped up
