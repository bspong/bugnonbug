Firefox process runs, but no window opens
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows 98; yie6_SBC)
Build Identifier: 

After using firefox successfully for several months, i tried to open it today 
and it did not open.  no window opened.  windows ie opened, however.  i 
unistalled the software, restarted the computer, and downloaded firefox again.  
when i clicked on "finish,"  no browswer window opened.  
  when i hit "control-alt-delete" to see what programs were running, firefox 
was running.  i tried to open firefox through the shortcut and from the "start-
programs" menu but no browswer window would open.  
   i attempted to uninstall the software again, and before i could do so i was 
instructed that i must close firefox before i could uninstall it.  
   i uninstalled and re downloaded the software, same results.  
   i have not installed any new programs in the time when firefox worked and it 
didn't work.  
    it seems that firefox is opening up and running (as seen on the list of 
programs running), but the browswer is not opening.  
    i use zone alarm firewall, but have given access to firefox.  i have had 
zone alarm for several months also, with no ill effects until today.
  please advise
