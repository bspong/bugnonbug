TYPO3 modules vanish when I klick on a module
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5

When I work as admin in TYPO3 the frame normally consists of 3 parts: left is the module list, in the center is the page tree, and right is the content.

When I use the backend of old TYPO3 projects (version TYPO3 3.*) that were updated to version TYPO3 4.* the following error occurs in Firefox:
The TYPO3 modules (left frame) vanish completely in Firefox 3.* in Windows.  It is impossible to work with this error.

This error does not occur with Firefox 2.* or Microsoft IE in XP, also not in any browser on Linux (Firefox is named iceweasel in Linux Debian).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Program a TYPO3 program with an old version of TYPO3 (3.*).
2. Update this program to an actual version of TYPO (4.*).
3. Start the Backend of this program with http://<url>/typo3.
4. Klick on some module name.
Actual Results:  
Then the modules (left frame) vanish, only the page tree (middle frame) and the content (right frame) is shown.

Expected Results:  
3 frames should be displayed: modules (left), page tree (middle), content (right)


Please fix that or I cannot use Firefox 3 any longer. The same trouble occurs also on http://info-partner.info/typo3.
