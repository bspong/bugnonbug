Firefox 2.0 hangs on Windows 2003 server Enterprise Edition Service Pack 2

OS: Windows 2003 Server Enterprise Edition Service Pack 2

Every now and then Firefox hangs after one or two hours of usage.  Can not terminate the process using either the Task Manager dialogue or the "pviewer.exe" program.  The only way to regain control of the machine is to reboot.

The best way to reboot is to be patience, open the task manager, lower Firefox process priority, and then use Windows reboot option.

Initially, I was getting frustrated and hard booting the system and file system was getting corrupted.

NOTE: So far, I have not encountered this problem on Windows 2003 Server Standard Edition Service Pack 2
