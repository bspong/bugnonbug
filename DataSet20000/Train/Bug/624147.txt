Firefox closing totally when closing "all other tabs" if one pinned tab is Google Talk Gadget
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:2.0b9pre) Gecko/20110108 Firefox/4.0b9pre
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:2.0b9pre) Gecko/20110108 Firefox/4.0b9pre

Firefox is closing without being asked, though I just asked to close every other tab than the focussed one.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open my personal iGoogle page
2. launch the Google talk gadget and chat with someone
3. Expand the google talk window so that it becomes a tab (can be done with a little arrow icon on the small window)
4. Pin the google talk gadget tab (with live conversation in) 
5. Open a couple of other tabs
6 focus on tab #5 (I mean whatever tab which is NOT iGoogle tab and NOT google gadget pinned tab)
7. with the context menu choose "Close all other tabs"
8. The focus is automaically set on iGoogle tab with an alert telling "If you close this page you may lose data".
9. Of course it is intended you will lose the google talk gadget conversation since it works in correlation with the iGoogle page, but you decide to click "Close this page" in the alert.

5. Open several other tabs
6. Focus on tab number 5 (just an example, I mean tab 5 is different from iGoogle tab and is not google talk gadget)
7. with context menu, choose "Close all other tabs"
8. Now the iGoogle page is focussed and tere is an alert message 
Actual Results:  
Fiefox closes completely

Expected Results:  
I expect Firefox to stay open on the unique tab (#5 in my example) on which I initially decided to "close all other tabs".
(Note tthat I don't complain on losing google gadget conversation but on Firefox completely closing)
