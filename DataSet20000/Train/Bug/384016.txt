Firefox frequently freezes and requires Force Quit to restart

First of all, your bug-reported page is extremely cumbersome and un-friendly for the user.

The latest version of Firefox is riddled with bugs. The browser freezes up constantly, requires Force Quit to fix (and a restart!), and loses me time and data. Java seems to hang up the program frequently. MySpace is a frequent culprit. When I visit my MySpace page and navigate around on MySpace for 20-30 minutes, I am almost certain to have Firefox freeze up.

I've been using Firefox for years. This is the first version I've used that's had this many problems. It's getting to the point where I'm thinking of switching back to Safari or ANY other browser I can count on.



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit any web site that requires frequent back-and-forth mobility, such as MySpace

2. Try to backspace to a previous page

3. Firefox reports I am "Done" but does not move -- no previous page, no forward, no being able to type in a different URL and navigate away from the site.

4. I have to use Force Quit, lose everything in Firefox (if I have multiple windows open) and restart
Actual Results:  
It doesn't happen all the time, just 50% of the time.

Expected Results:  
Worked properly. No frozen up. No refused to move. 

I've talked to others who have updated Firefox to version 2.0.0.4. They voice similar problems. Apparently, some MAJOR bugs exist in this version of Firefox! Can you fix it quickly before all of us switch to a different browser?
