PDF files are not properly created by Firefox when attempt to print and printer selected is Adobe PDF (running ver. Acrobat 9.0).  All lines are truncated and print only as abnormally narrowed (excessively wide margins, with information beyond margins lost).

Lines are truncated and the page width is greatly shortened so that lines
that otherwise fill a full page when viewed as HTML in the browser only print the first few characters, generating PDF's numerous (narrow) pages even when the original document is only a short 1 page.

It would appear that erroneous header information is being passed that fails to set up page margins correctly or correctly size the page.

All pages printed are viewed with very large magnification factors (eg. ~ 800%)and with numerous (usually greater than 20-50 pages) pages even for very short documents.

Although this problem has appeared on my system (Dell XPS 1330 laptop) upon
upgrade to Windows7 and to Acrobat 9.0, everything was running fine on a previous version of Firefox running on this machine under Windows Vista and using Acrobat 8.0.
This is a firefox problem as PDF's correctly 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Generate an HTML page in browser
2. Select Print
