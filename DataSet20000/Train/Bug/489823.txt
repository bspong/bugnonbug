When i login to the website it gives message ''Flash player 7 or later plugin required'' However it is already installed

When trying to login to certain websites, such as www.meezanbank.com when i login, it says flash player 7 or greater required. even when I Install flash player latest (10 i think) for firefox, and go to the website it again tells me that flash player 7 or greater plugin required.

This seems some compatibility issue.

Note:  this happens on firefox browser running on windows vista only. (on Windows XP it worked fine). The problem has been checked on two different PCS both running firefox .  One running windows visat business edition and the other running windows vista home premium.

On windows xp, it works completely fine.

pls investigate.

thanks
