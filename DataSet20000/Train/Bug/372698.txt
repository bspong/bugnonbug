Horizontal lines, not longer than 20 pixels, spaced out evenly vertical across the browser window. Happens, if the Browser gets behind other program windows, or gets minimized and restored after a while.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open some websides (don't know, which do the glitching and which not)
2. Bring the opened Browser behind other opened programs/ windows or minimize the window
3. Restore the window/ maximize it. Sometimes it occurs during surfing (without minimizing)
