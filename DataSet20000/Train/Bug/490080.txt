I experienced the "MEGA VISTA Operating system crash probably the same time firefox upgraded itself to to 3.0? from 2.??. all bookmarks were lost. I am grateful to you for providing such a great program  but saddened to to report you never did heed my advice concerning AUTOMATICALLY placing a copy of these bookmarks into a place that could be automatically  backed up. 
     Sticking these bookmarks in a "HIDDEN SYSTEM FILE or whatever" {in a spot completely unbackupable was sadly criminal and negligent.}
     Sadly the stability of firefox was also a defeat, and your arrogance in doing an upgrade from 2.?? to 3.0? and messing around with a very stable and reliable system without warning to you users  that the bookmarks were at risk was in my mind unacceptable. It will take probably six to nine months to restore the lost bookmarks all tools in my work.
   I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO PROVIDE USERS AN OPTION TO AUTOMATICALLY PLACE A COPY OF THE BOOKMARKS ETC INTO A BACKUPABLE PLACE OF YOUR USERS CHOICE SO THAT THIS arrogant act of destruction can  never happens again.
