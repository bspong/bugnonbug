show a tag button instead of the star button if the current url is tagged
show a tag button instead of the star button if the current url is tagged

see also bug #395267 and bug #395257, where we will be showing the tag icon in url bar autocomplete results and in bookmark organizer search results.


I claim that tagging is greater than a bookmark.  meaning if something is both bookmarked and tagged, the tagging outweighs that.  (you can be bookmarked without being tagged, but not vice versa.)

dietrich points out some issues.  from irc:

<dietrich> hrm. there's currently no way (via the UI) to tag something w/o bookmarking it first
<sspitzerMsgMe> right, but:
<sspitzerMsgMe> if we show tag icon in the url bar results
<sspitzerMsgMe> and in the search results
<sspitzerMsgMe> I think we should consider showing the tag icon in the url bar
<sspitzerMsgMe> to match the tag icon in the results
<dietrich> well, the icon technically isn't in the url bar now
<dietrich> but that's a separate issue
<sspitzerMsgMe> hmm, good point
<sspitzerMsgMe> for people who don't tag, this is a non issue
<dietrich> hm, IMO the value of iconic consistency outweighs the value of tag vs. bookmark
<sspitzerMsgMe> but if you do tag, I think it might be useful to see that tag icon
<sspitzerMsgMe> let me start a bug with what I'm thinking, and cc you faaborg and mconnor
<dietrich> i think having mixed icons there send mixed messages about the purpose of the button
<sspitzerMsgMe> hmm, that's a good point
<sspitzerMsgMe> except that click on it does bring up the tag editor, no?
<dietrich> as well as the bookmark property fields...
