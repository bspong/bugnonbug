Firefox can't handle the playback of webm content on my pc
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:12.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/12.0
Build ID: 20120420145725

Steps to reproduce:

I have an old Athlon XP 2600+ with a Radeon 9600 Pro video card but still Firefox seems unable to use hardware acceleration on this specs while playing webm video.
Youtube webm videos barely can play even at 360p windowed mode the CPU usage hits 100%, in Fullscreen mode I get like 3-5 video frames/second which cannot be considered video playback at all.
Webm 720p unable to play in windowed or Fullscreen mode at all, let alone 1080p.
Instead I've downloaded from Youtube with FlashGot the same webm clip that I was trying to play on Youtube page with Firefox and tried to see how it plays in a standalone player like VLC.
Guess what with VLC the 360p video played in windowed or Fullscreen mode using just 15% CPU usage, while the 720p version uses only about 35% CPU usage.
So why Firefox can't play webm content using such low CPU resources and making webm content actually playable ?


Actual results:

Firefox hits 100% CPU usage while playing webm video content on webpages while VLC player uses only 15% CPU resources playing the same video.


Expected results:

Try fix this crap sooner than later. :)
