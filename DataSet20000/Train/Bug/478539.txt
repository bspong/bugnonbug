Whitelist Cookies cleared after restart of FF 3.0.6

I observed that cookies vanished although they are mentioned in a whitelist. The cleared cookies are on the whitelist since FF2 and there were no trouble until the last FF update to 3.0.6.
Reguarly I order FF to clear all cookies except the cookies on the whitelist.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In the above example (http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/advchart/frames/frames.asp?symb=LNUX) change the timeframe to 5 years
2. Store chart settings and confirm with ok
3. You can see the new cookie in cookies sqlite
4. Make "bigcharts.marketwatch.com" and "marketwatch.com" whitelist members
5. Make a copy of cookies.sqlite

When the cookies disappeared I restored the cookies.sqlite file and all seems ok for a few new starts (maybe 3-5) of FF. Then the cookies got lost again. 
Actual Results:  
The cookies vanished after a few starts, means the timeframe of the showed chart shrinks to one year again.

Expected Results:  
There should be no change, means the timeframe of the chart should be 5 years as long as the cookie is on the whitelist.
