Testcase

Page cache invalidated after moving dynamically created textarea before existing textarea

The page cache saves the page content including textarea content and JavaScript state when navigating away from a page (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Using_Firefox_1.5_caching). This page caching breaks (i.e. the page cache is invalidated for this page) when moving a dynamically created textarea before an already existing textarea.

Please open the the attached testcase and follow the instructions to replicate this bug:

1. Change content of original textarea
2. Click the Google link
3. Come back to the testcase page by using the left arrow button
4. The changed content of the original textarea is preserved, i.e. the page cache has not been invalidated
5. Click the button to move the dynamically created textarea before the original textarea
6. Click the Google link and come back as before
7. The changed content of the original textarea is not preserved, i.e. the page cache has been invalidated

This is a major problem for rich text editors such as the Wikipedia editor wikEd because edits get lost when navigating away from the editing page.

This bug has been observed in Firefox 14.0.1 under Windows XP and is probably present since at least March 24, 2012 (see https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22680). The testcase works as supposed under Chrome 21.0.1180.75 m.
