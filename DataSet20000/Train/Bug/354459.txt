Search box disappears after upgrading Firefox 2
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20060918 Firefox/2.0

I have seen this problem several times.  Sometimes, when I upgrade a Firefox 2 version to a higher one (for example, Beta 1 to Beta 2, or recently, Beta 2 to RC1), the search box together with the search button disappear, and I have to add it again through the toolbar Customize dialog.  Basically, this feature becomes invisible to the average user.  If this happens when upgrading from FF1.5 to FF2 after FF2 is released, this would be a major problem.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Upgrade FF after being prompted by the auto software updater.
2. See the search box disappear.

Actual Results:  
The search box disappears.

Expected Results:  
The search box shouldn't disappear.
