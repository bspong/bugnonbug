We're using barcode readers to read data into our intranet website.
Unfortunately our readers does not support hungarian character layout, we have to use its feature to enter the ascii codes.
When num lock is off, ascii codes containing number 4 translated as ALT+left arrow (browser back), 6 translated as ALT+right arrow (browser forward), and the browser navigates back or forward. It's not an option to turn num lock on, because we're using notebooks where the num lock usually turned off.

Tested on Windows Xp, vista, seven rc, and max osx 10.5.7

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. be sure, back or forward option is avaliable (you're not on the first page on the tab)
2. turn off num lock
3.enter any ascii code containing 4 or 6 (eg ALT+45) into an input field
Actual Results:  
the browser goes back while the result of the code appears in the field

Expected Results:  
the browser stay at the same page, and the result of the ascii code appears in the field
