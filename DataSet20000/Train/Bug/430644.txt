firefox keeps prompting for certificate with https client auth

When accessing a website through https and that website asks for client certificate auth, the popup prompt for the certificate appears way too often (I don't think it's for every request, but almost so).


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Connect to some https sites
2.Select the client certificate to authenticate with
3.See the prompt reappear soon after (sometimes on the same page)
Actual Results:  
When navigating, the client auth certificate selection popup keeps reappearing

Expected Results:  
Select one certificate and navigate the site without further prompting

I had a single client certificate installed on my computer at first, I added another from another source(in case the first one was messed up) without any change of behavior.

Checks with other browsers/versions:
- Firefox nightly as of Apr. 24th 2008 -> same behavior
- IE 7 -> single prompt (expected behavior)
- Firefox 2.0.0.14 -> no prompt

I'm not sure if this happens on every site or if there's specific conditions to be met for the caching failure. This is very reproducable on my vmware server 2 beta 2 installation (for which I can't give a link as it is private).
