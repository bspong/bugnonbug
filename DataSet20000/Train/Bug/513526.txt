Recent updates have introduced a major slow down to viewing such a page.

Admittedly there are a lot of radio buttons on this page.
However, prior to recent updates this type of page rendered very fast.
Safari, IE8, and Chrome continue to render this page fast.

However, firefox now has major fits and starts, burps and belches when viewing this page. This demonstrated by clicking on one of the options.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View the page -- there will be a new and unusual slow down at this point.
2. Click on a different radio button -- there will be a new and unusual slow down
3. Try to use scroll thumb. This will demonstrate the slow down.
Actual Results:  
I think the result is most easily reproduced by making a form with a bunch of radio buttons.

Expected Results:  
The page has rendered quite fast with previous versions of firefox.

The bug is devastating to me and my users. 
However, I don't know how many folks in the world use this many radio buttons.
So maybe not a major bug.
But, it could be that this page has uncovered a previously unseen memory leak or weirdness in handling the group entity.
