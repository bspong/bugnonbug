The new autocompletion feature in the urlbar is very nice. Unfortunately it is also quite slow. On a 2.8 GHz P4 the urlbar freezes for several seconds after the first one or two characters have been entered. I don't know whether it is slow because it reads the whole file, or because matching a very short string results in a lot of matches.

If it's the former, an index or a cache might help, or reading it in the background may make it less noticable for the user.

If it's the latter, you could stop after the first few matches (only a small number is displayed anyway) or the current match operation could be aborted when the user hits the next key. 



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use FF for a week or two (to fill up your history)
2. Start typing a word into the urlbar
3. After the first or second character, the display freezes
4. Continue typing - you won't get an echo
5. After some seconds, the dropdown menu with matching URLs appears together with the rest of the characters you typed.
