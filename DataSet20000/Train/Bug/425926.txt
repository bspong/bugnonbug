It may be a choice, in which case it is probably one of the worst choices ever, but anyway I'm quite sure other people than me will one day try to report it or wonder what has happened, so it's worth reporting it as a bug.

The default installation has no home button in the navigation toolbar, it has been moved (hidden ?) to the bookmarks toolbar. IMO far most people use the navigation toolbar than the bookmarks toolbar, so it shouldn't.

Moreover, the steps to correct it are not so obvious : you need to activate the bookmarks toolbar if disabled, then open View > Toolbars > Customize, then drag the home icon from the bookmarks toolbar to the customize window, and finally drag the home icon from the customize window to the navigation toolbar ! (Direct drag from one toolbar to another won't work).
