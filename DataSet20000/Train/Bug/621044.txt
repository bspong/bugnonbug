The website sets some cookies. Don't mind that it has adult contents only. It is a serious site.
A user can add a model to his "Poppliste" by choosing a model and clicking on "POPPLISTE" at the upper edge of the girl's pic. When a user goes to the website in another session he can open his list by clicking "Meine Poppliste" at the end of the navigation bar. That worked fine with the old FF. The list contained about 20 entries.
Two days ago I installed FF 4.0 Beta 7. FF 3.6.3 is still present luckily. When a user opens the list it contains no entries. The cookie "poppliste" was replaced by calling the page using this cookie. The bug appears in the old FF version as well in the Beta version. So I visited other websites of which I have stored login data. The login do work so the cookies are okay.
It is highly curious that the installation of the Beta changes the previous installation.
