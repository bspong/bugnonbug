[10.5] Google Search News Button won't work with Leopard
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko/20071025 Firefox/2.0.0.9

I installed Leopard 2 days ago on Mac Mini. Since then I have received message "Problem Loading Page" and Server not Found - Firefox can't find the server at www.google.com. - at least 250 times. 

This always happens when using Search Google News by clicking on Google News Button in Toolbar. But if I click on Google News elsewhere, not using the Toolbar Button, Google News opens.

Also web pages load extremely slow and the spinning progress icon continues to spin even after a page has loaded.

Yahoo Calendar with Daily Events will not show. Only the monthly view. None of my 5 days of events show, even though they are set to be displayed.

Odd thing is that Parallels with Vista Internet Explorer works great. Loads all pages, no conflicts. That is weird. I expected Parallels not to work.
        


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on Search Google News in Toolbar
2. Message - Problem loading page - is displayed in tab
3. Message - Server not Found - Firefox can't find the server at www.google.com, appears in browser page window
4. If I go to Google News by another method, not using the toolbar button, it opens!
Actual Results:  
Page does not open. Message says Firefox cannot find the server

Expected Results:  
Google News should open

My Home page is set to Yahoo. I have Yahoo Calendar set up to show monthly view plus the day view for the next 5 days from todays date. The monthly calendar shows in the home page, but not the daily schedules. I have open and closed and Restarted Firefox numerous times, and I get the same problem every time.

Everything worked fine in Tiger
