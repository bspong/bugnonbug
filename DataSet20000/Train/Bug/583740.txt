The calendar function has firefox at 47%-50% of CPU (Task Manager) for a much longer period than IE8.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Logon to BAC and go to Bill pay
2. Enter a dollar amount
3. Click the calendar Icon - watch utilization zoom and hold it for a while.
Actual Results:  
Firefox simply takes a long time before it is ready to respond.

Expected Results:  
A fraction of the time taken.  IE8 is much faster.  

BAC has also been notified of this.  However, their position in the past is they DO NOT support Firefox.  I have not gotten a response back on this issue.

this is more of an aggravation than a "bug."  I don't like sitting idle waiting on the computer to do things.

IE:  8.0.6001.1872
Firefox:  3.6.8
