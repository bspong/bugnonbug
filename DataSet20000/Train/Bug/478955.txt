Pages in Firefox don't respond properly to the pg up and pg down keys like they have been historically, and like they still do in IE.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011913 Firefox/3.0.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Page sticks or jumps and sticks again at the bottom of the page when I try to navigate up or down the page using the page up or page down keys on my keyboard. This was never the case before the last day or two. I tested the same scenarios on IE and it works perfectly, like Firefox always has.  So, if the page is longer than the screen length (which they usually are), I can no longer use the page up or page down keys to scroll up or down a page length at a time, and even the scroll up and down arrows have a jumpy time of it and don't work consistently. Again, this is not happening on the same pages with IE. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a long page like news.google.com or gmail
2. page down -- page hops to the bottom of the page. 
3. try to page back up again, and it doesn't work. jumps and sticks back at bottom of page, or hops all the way up to the top of the page. can't page down or up, screen by screen length anymore.



Very frustrating because I realize now how much I use this to navigate a page. Thought it might be a key stroke function accidentally set, but it works properly with IE.
