The Mac OSX installer can be dramatically improved by creating a symbolic link on the disk image to the Applications folder; creating an Arrow icon and simple instructional tex, "To install Firefox/Thunderbird drag its icon to the Applications Folder."

Here's a review of the installer in Tidbits, a popular weekly 'zine
http://www.tidbits.com/tb-issues/TidBITS-809.html#lnk1
"Ironically after my article about simplifying installation in TidBITS-807, the Firefox disk image provides only graphical instruction that's actively confusing. An arrow leads from the Firefox icon itself to a smaller, greyed-out version of the Firefox icon that is presumably being dragged, to judge from the non-Mac-like pointer and + badge, and then to a greyed-out icon that looks like the Applications folder. Unfortunately, it's all representational - the Applications folder is just a picture, and not a symbolic link, and there are no textual instructions to clarify what to do. I've already heard of people not realizing they had to copy the Firefox package and instead running it from the disk image. Worse, the instructions on the Firefox Web site say "double click the Firefox Disk Image to open it in Finder, and then drag the Firefox application onto your hard disk. Drag the icon to your Dock if you want it to appear there." I'm sure there are people who will promptly drag the Firefox icon from the disk image to the Dock, instead of copying it to the Applications folder and then dragging the copied version's icon to the Dock. Obviously, there's nothing all that hard here, but that's no reason not to make it easier yet."

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a symbolic link to the Applications folder.  In the terminal type:
ln -s /Applications ~/Desktop 
Move this link to the disk image.
