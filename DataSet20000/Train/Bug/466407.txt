The History menu in Firefox often shows duplicate menu items for recently-visited pages; each time a new page is visited (or a previous location re-visited), it is inserted twice at the start of the menu.

When a new page is visited, existing duplicates may be cleaned out from the menu (so that only the newest item is duplicated), although this does not seem to happen in every case.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. launch Firefox
2. open the History menu
3. choose a page from the middle of the menu, and wait for it to load
4. re-open the History menu
Actual Results:  
The revisited page appears twice at the top of the History menu.

Expected Results:  
The entry for the revisited page should be moved from its position in the middle of the History menu to the top of the list, but should only appear there once.

This has been observed on both Mac OS X and Linux builds from mozilla-central. I'm not sure if it is reproducible 100% of the time, but it is pretty consistent when browsing around some simple URLs such as
   http://www.mozilla.org/projects/minefield/
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Installing_Mercurial
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Configuring_Build_Options
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Build_Documentation
etc.

Note that the duplication is NOT seen when using "Show All History" to view the list in the Library window; it appears to only affect the menu.

It is not clear whether this is related to bug 424208, which refers to the History suggestions shown while typing a location.
