This has nothing to do with batch operations. When you're in a photo and you want to send just that photo to a group, you click "send to group" above the photo, then chose the group. In MSIE, once the drop down appears, you can scroll through the groups with the page up/down keys or use the mouse. In firefox, you can't use the keys, you can only use the mouse. 

Also, Firefox doesn't remember the last group you added that photo to (in that current "send to group" session) but MSIE does. Each time you send a photo to a group and then click "send to group" again to send to another group, MSIE scrolls down to the last group you added to (listed alphabetically) so you're not looking through all the others you already passed.

Not sure if the two issues are related so I put them both here.

I will start another report for the "remember" issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a photo
2. Click "add to group"
3. Attempt to use page up/down keys to scroll through the drop down that appears
4. try step 1-3 in MSIE and it will work
Actual Results:  
Using the page up/down keys in FF would make the entire page scroll, not the contents of the drop down menu. But the drop down would scroll with the keys in MSIE.

Expected Results:  
Drop down should have scrolled with the keys, not the page.
