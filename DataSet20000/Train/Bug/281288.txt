1. Uncontrolled, automatic scrolling of pages:  2. Getting to Bookmark without auto-scroll

Two issues: 1.The spontaneous, difficult to control scrolling function of
Firefox makes getting to a particular address in the Bookmarks, or point on a
page a pain.  Sometimes, opening up Bookmarks and clicking on the first letter
of the item (e.g. "r" for Reference) gets me into the R's, but other times does
something entirely different.  Going down into the list itself and trying to get
down to that item gets the whole list scrolling, with the "circled arrow" icon
floating around in the middle of the field.  
	One has to click outside to stop it and then try again.  
	I would vote to eliminate that auto-scroll function and simple permit one to
work down themselves or to enhance the "first-letter" function to get there. 
Having to deal with the auto-scroll on any particular FireFox page is a drag.
