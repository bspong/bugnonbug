FF 2.0.0.x crashes.  Happens daily, but I don't know how to force it to happen
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20070226 Firefox/2.0.0.2

At seemingly random times, FF will crash.  The crash always occurs when I try to take some action with the browser - something as simply as clicking on a tab will do it.  That is, if I am not interacting with the browser at all, it doesn't just up and die on its own.  Mostly it is stable and the same action will not reproduce the problem for me.

When the crash occurs, I see the following in my terminal from where I started FF.

(Gecko:18450): Gdk-CRITICAL **: gdk_colormap_get_screen: assertion `GDK_IS_COLORMAP (cmap)' failed

(Gecko:18450): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: g_object_ref: assertion `G_IS_OBJECT (object)' failed

(Gecko:18450): Gdk-CRITICAL **: gdk_colormap_get_visual: assertion `GDK_IS_COLORMAP (colormap)' failed

firefox-bin exited with non-zero status (139)


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open browser and use it for some time
2. Possibly leave it idle (overnight for example)  [not sure this matters]
3. Possibly start a java applet [not sure this matters]
4. Use it a bit more and it crashes.
Actual Results:  
The browser crashed.  As in, the process stopped running entirely.

Expected Results:  
Normal operation.

I have definitely see the crash occur without leaving the browser idle overnight.
