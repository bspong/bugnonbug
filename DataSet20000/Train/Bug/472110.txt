I use Craigslist.org frequently. Up until about 3 days ago, I never had a problem like this: When I click on an item for sale with an accompanying photo, the photo does not show-up. I tried several categories and items (furniture, household, etc.). HOWEVER, if I open Craigslist.org in INTERNET EXPLORER, it runs fine and photos show-up.  Just to see if this was a Nashville site problem, I tried other states/cities and the lack of photos occurs across the board in Firefox - not in Explorer. Thanks for any help with this. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log onto http://nashville.craigslist.org/ - or, any craigslist.org city
2.Click on "furniture" (for example), on an item that is for sale and has a photo (has "pic" indicated), click on that item
3.Item description with photo should appear - but, description has been appearing without the photo. Try several - no photos ever load.
Actual Results:  
See above - no photos show. Even when I try other craigslist.org cities and categories.


Prior to approx. 3 days ago, photos always appeared when item description was clicked on (if a photo was included in the description). No problem if I use Internet Explorer.
