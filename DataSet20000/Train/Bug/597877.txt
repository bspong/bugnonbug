FF4 beta 4,5,6 lagging heavy / feeling slow with updated flash
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/7.0.517.5 Safari/534.7
Build Identifier: FF 4 beta 4,5,6, running Win 7 German language

I switched from FF 3.6.10 to the latest FF 4 beta 4, 5, and later beta 6.

All of those feel really slow or some kind of lagging on my computer. I can especially notice this on websites with flash. When running a flash video or even my webcam video (uses .mjpeg) the FF 4 beta is so slow that I often cannot open or close (!) another tab. I have to hit the close button many times until a tab closes. Also, when I connect locally to my webcam and try to run the .mjpeg video I can see the pictures building on the screen like they were tearing from top to bottom. Even when opening my favourites and just hovering up und down I can see the highlighted markings of the favourites under the mouse pointer do lag behind.

FF 4 beta feels like my CPU would be too slow although. I just installed 3.6.10 again and found all these problems gone. Google Chrome 7 beta also runs fine without any problem.

I have an Intel Core 2 Duo @ 2.1 GHz, 2GB RAM and an Intel GMA 3100, running Win 7 Home Premium with all updates and the latest avaialable drivers as well as latest Flash plugin.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install FF 4 beta 4 or 5 or 6
2. watch a flash video site, or watch my webcam video as -mjpeg
3.


Expected Results:  
FF should feel / run faster
