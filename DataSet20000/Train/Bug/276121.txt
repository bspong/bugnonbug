FF Hangs on loading inbox for Yahoo Mail

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. goto http://mail.yahoo.com
2. login click enter
3. upon loading inbox firefox hangs and computer requires hard restart
(Ctrl-Alt-Del does NOT work) and while mouse (w/ hour glass) is still movable
nothing is clickable

Actual Results:  
I had to restart my computer

Expected Results:  
Shown me my inbox

I found a work-around: using adblock I blocked all images "*" and noticed I
could  now view my mail. Working backwards (with several restarts) I found that
the only things required to block for a working site is the key:
  http://*yimg.com/i/us/pim/r/medici/*
which blocks 3 images and a javascript (but I always block the javascript and
still hangs). I was able to view the individual images without problem. There is
a .css file included in the wildcard and it is unblocked but causes several
errors in the JS Console. Problem occurs in Win98 and Win98SE.

My system is currently: Gateway G6-450; 450MHz P2; 320MB RAM; Win98SE; Hangs on
Firefox 1.0, Firefix Nightly Dec26, and Mozilla 1.7.5

I am trying to setup the computer for gf's folks and they need yahoo mail
otherwise they'll use IE.

Thanks for looking; I hope this isn't a dupe, but I don't have that much
debugging info, because it causes me to restart.
