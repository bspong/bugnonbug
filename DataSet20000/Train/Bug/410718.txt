Dragging and dropping toolbar bookmarks moves bookmarks to wrong location or duplicates them
Created attachment 295308
places file for this bug.

I have a sample places.sqlite file derived from my own (imported some data from mine into a completely clean profile). I have attached it.

If you open a profile containing this places.sqlite, open the bookmarks sidebar, and begin dragging and dropping the items in the bookmarks toolbar folder to different spots in that folder, various weirdness happens. This includes incorrect bookmark placement on dropping and duplication of bookmarks. No errors will show up in the console.

Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a profile and then add the attached places.sqlite to it.
2. Start Firefox
3. Open the Bookmarks Sidebar
4. Open the Bookmarks Toolbar folder
5. Drag the "Flickr" bookmark one place down (under "Cadmus") and drop it.

Result: Flickr is moved two places down. 

If you then try to move the Flickr bookmark back to its original location, it will move incorrectly again. I've found at this point that I can duplicate the Flickr bookmark. Also, at this point, if I attempt to move the "Cadmus" bookmark around, I can get duplicates of it as well.
