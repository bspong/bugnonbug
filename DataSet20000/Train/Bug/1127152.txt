Runtime Monitor: Support exporting JSON log of timestamped data points
I work on the Gaia Email app and we get a lot of bugs filed relating to the email app being involved in stuff where the OOM killer kills the email app or all the other apps, etc.  In these cases a screenshot of the Runtime Monitor (or from firewatch) tends to be the easiest way for me to get data from the bug reporters (usually QA people happy to help) to help identify what is going on.

It would be great if in this situation I could have them export a JSON log and attach it to a bug instead of a screenshot.  Core reasons:

- Less need to manually correlate the screenshot with the timestamped logcat (and squint and estimate pixel positions using gimp, etc.)

- Less worry about the effective scaling level of the monitor's graph.  (Unfortunately, on nightly, the monitor hangs for me after about 3 minutes and the entire WebIDE seems to die as well so I have to restart the browser.  So I'm not clear if the runtime is a sliding window like firewatch after a certain point, or if it's always trying to show all the data points all the time.  I kinda like the idea of "all the data points", but if so, it could make screenshots pretty hard! :)

If the devtools are already listening for the GC notifications that happen, those would be great to include.  It is super handy to know when we're dealing with a MEM_PRESSURE gc versions a COMPONENT_UTILS, versus etc.

And in the event the monitor ever starts capturing logcat as well, they could then both go in the same handy log.


I know the team is pretty busy kicking ass already, so if this is something I can help out with, I'd be happy to, just sorta point me in the direction you want me to go.  Thanks!
