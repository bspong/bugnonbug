Started with your installation of version........16 Tuesday night.  Problem affects all screens in all programs tested for both accounts on the computer.  Control & +/-/0 can change size for that page only; no known way to lock system on the proper size.  Sliding left/right/up/down for every line is a pain and a large timewaster.  Get fix out today, I'm installing a new computer this weekend and I don't want garbage in the new set.  Also, Control/Alt right click and wheel worked for one time adjustment, feature no longer works.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any screen/page
2. Picture is too large to show full width of the document/picture/etc.  Tall documents show only the top half.
3.
Actual Results:  
Using Control/Alt & +/- fixes only the screen showing; any change of page, screen, etc and you start all over again.  Control/Alt/0 sends one to the largest closeup immediately.

Expected Results:  
Software change to version .....16 should have left the size of the picture alone.  An alternate could have been - provide a "make this size the default size" keystroke to lock in the operator's desired change until the operator goes through the + - routine.

The lack of a timely way to contact Mozilla Firefox is a problem.  The addition of a telephone number to a live, North American, English speaker would help significantly.
