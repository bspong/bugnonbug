Ghostery + Addon SDK localization causes widget to always move back to Addon Bar after Firefox restart
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20131205075310

Steps to reproduce:

Test 1:
1. Install testicon-withproperties.xpi from attached example zip file, also install Ghostery.
2. Move icon for the test addon to main toolbar.
3. Restart Firefox.
Test 2:
1. Install testicon-withoutprop.xpi from attached example zip file, also install Ghostery.
2. Move icon for the test addon to main toolbar.
3. Restart Firefox.
Test 3:
1. Install any addon like previous tests, but uninstall Ghostery.
2. Move icon for the test addon to main toolbar.
3. Restart Firefox.


Actual results:

In Test 1, icon moves back to Addon Bar after restart.
In Test 2 and 3, icon does NOT move back to Addon Bar after restart.


Expected results:

In all 3 tests, icon should have stayed where user moves it to (the main toolbar) instead of going back to Addon Bar.
Some useful notes as I noticed while debugging/producing example:
1. The only difference b/w Test 1 and 2 is that in Test 1, I have one empty en-US.properties file in locale directory in the addon source (see test-icon-withoutprop.zip and test-icon-withproperties.zip), in Test 2, I have locale dir but do not have any file inside.
2. Ghostery modifies currentset property of the main toolbar, which had caused issue for other addons before but they could work around it as they don't use localization. I don't know how to work around this issue because I want localization in my addon.

One comment: Despite that one could argue that this is a Ghostery issue (true to some extent), yet it only affects localized Addon SDK-based addons that also use widgets. So the issue also lies with the SDK too.  I will, of course, send this bug to Ghostery developer as well because modifying currentset might not be the best idea.
