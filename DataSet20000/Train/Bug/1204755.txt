recording causes app crash on flame device with 41.0a1 and nightly desktop
Using latest nightly desktop connecting to nightly build on a Flame device. Can start recording, and upon stopping, get an error profiler could not be found. If the profiler actor really wasn't found, this tool should be disabled.

Probably the same as bug 1204711.

A promise chain failed to handle a rejection. Did you forget to '.catch', or did you forget to 'return'?
