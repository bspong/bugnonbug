You should be able to set the handling of different file types in the options window. To do this, there ist a list which shows all registered file types. My Firefox suddenly showed up an empty list, after I had set a default application for an unknown type.
I reinstalled Firefox because I didn't manage to get it corrected. But again it the list just showed up, until I set a new handling rule.
So I checked the file mimetypes.rdf in the profiles directory and (because of long, bad experiences with other products ;) ) found the problem:
The rule I entered pointed to an application (Acrobat Reader) which had a blank in it's installation path. Such as:
<RDF:Description RDF:about="urn:mimetype:externalApplication:application/pdf"
                   NC:path="C:\Programme\Adobe\Acrobat 7.0\Reader\AcroRd32.exe" />
Obviously Firefox is unable to parse the path including the blank. After changing the blank to an underscore (and doing so with the installation path of the reader as well) everything worked fine again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox
2. Open unknown file type from a link
3. Tell Firefox to always use a application which ist installed in a path that includes a blank

Actual Results:  
List of associated file types in Firefox is empty.

Expected Results:  
List should be filled with programm extensions
