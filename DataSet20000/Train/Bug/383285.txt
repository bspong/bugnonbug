Loss of values of input components (components within a html form) when accessing site by https

The latest Firefox Release 2.0.0.4 seems to have problems when accessing sites by https that contain html form elements.
We have a webapp which is built with JSF 1.2, Tomcat 6.0.13.
If I access our app by https and enter values in the fields and select elements from a combo and the submit the form, sometimes it happens that the value of an input field is empty although I entered the value. Another example is that the selected value of a combo isn't being submitted to the server.

The whole stuff works most of the time but if I submit the form many times (maybe 30 times or so), the value of e. g. an input field is empty. The submit before that one however contained some text in the input field.

This issue only occurs if I access the page by https, if I try it by http everything works fine.

For testing purposes I installed Firefox 1.5.0.4 where everything works fine - no input field loss, even with https.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Submit the form (sometimes 3x and sometimes > 30x)
