Memory-Leak when opening oversized GIF-Image.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; de) Opera 8.01
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.0.6 [de] and other

Everytime trying to view the given image, Firefox crashes my system by 
allocating all memory (about 10MB per second).

The same error is present in Netscape 7.02. Opera and IE displays the image 
without problems - without memory leaks.

Not every systems seems to be affected, since there are users that can view this 
image without having trouble.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the image in Firefox or Netscape and look at Taskmanager for memory-
usage.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
In Firefox my system totaly crashes. I have to do a hard reset. Even Ctrl-Alt-
Del doesn't work.
In Netscape 7.02, memory usages rises as in Firefox, but stops at about 100MB. 
System still responds.

Expected Results:  
Error-handling for oversized or damaged images. IE or Opera 8.01 don't have 
problems with memoryleaks while opening this image. If Image is too big, it 
should not be displayed.
