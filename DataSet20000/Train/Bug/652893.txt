specific webpages will not load completely, if at all. Some of these are my home and my profile page on facebook.com, eBay, Amazon, and a few of the firefox help and support pages. 
I have reinstalled, firefox 4.0 rather than the beta, turned Java on and off, installed the latest Java build, verified my security suite settings, & played with firefox without addons enabled. 
Using web console, it would appear that there are many errors involving both css & java. The error console provides similar clues. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.type in web address name (facebook), ctl+enter
2. watch page load, frames are there, but nothing else
3. search frantically for solution

Actual Results:  
page or portions therof do not load.

Expected Results:  
web page to load properly
