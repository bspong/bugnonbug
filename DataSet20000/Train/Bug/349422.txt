Fails to start; XML Parsing Error: xml processing instruction not at start of external entity
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.13) Gecko/20060724 Epiphany/1.6.1 (Ubuntu) (Ubuntu package 1.0.8)
Build Identifier: Mozilla Firefox 1.0.8, as from current Ubuntu Debian package

No update or features added; one minute it worked; closed all windows, came back five minutes later, and suddenly it didn't work anymore.

At startup, I get a large message box reporting
--------------------------
XML Parsing Error: xml processing instruction not at start of external entity
Location: chrome://browser/content/browser.xul
Line Number 1, Column 1:

--------------------------

Tried complete uninstall (including removing /usr/lib/mozilla/ and ~/.mozilla folders after package uninstall) and re-install from package, to no avail.

Using the quite shoddy Epiphany to submit this error report, hence I do not have the exact build version; version given is as retrieved from `firefox --version`, which still works; I just can't start the browser itself.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox.
Actual Results:  
Error message as described.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should start normally.
