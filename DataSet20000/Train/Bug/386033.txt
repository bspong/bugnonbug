Some Turkish characters are not correctly dispalyed if the system language is set to Turkish.

If you set the system language in Mac OS X to Turkish, some Turkish characters are not correctly displayed. The characters our QE reported and I confirmed are:

U+011F(&#287;): LATIN SMALL LETTER G WITH BREVE - displayed as Euro sign
U+015F(&#351;): LATIN SMALL LETTER S WITH CEDILLA - displayed as a ligature of f and l

There might be more characters not shown correctly.

I tired to create sample HTML files in some text encodings - UTF-8, Windows-1254 and also numeric entities in ISO-8859-1 - and the results are same in all of them. Strangely, they are displayed correctly in the title bar (by specifying <title/> element) but not in HTML body.

I'll attach a screen shot and sample HTML files.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open System Preferences and select International.
2. If Turkish (actually "Türkçe") is not in the list "Languages" on the left, lick "Edit List...".
3. Check "Türkçe" in the list and click OK. (see the attachments SystemPref.png)
4. Drag "Türkçe" to the top in the languages list.
5. Once log out then log in again.
6. Launch Firefox and open sample HTML files I attach.

Actual Results:  
U+011F(&#287;) is displayed as Euro currency sign.
U+015F(&#351;) is displayed as a ligature of small letter "f" and "l".


Expected Results:  
These characters should be displayed correctly.
