I am running my new laptop (philips feevents X58) with a pre-installed version of Windows Vista Home Premium. I have mzilla firefox installed as my web browser. I can acces some sites eg www.bbc.co.uk without any problems but with many others I get the 'Server not found message'. There doesn't seem to be pattern, but it always has a problem with the same pages. I am self employed and this is causing me problems. I am reporting this on our family Pc which runs with windows xp and mozilla firefox. The problem doesn't occurr on this machine.
