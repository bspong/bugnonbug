Consumes lots of RAM (memory) when idle, returns RAM when title bar clicked, with Yahoo mail
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86_64); en-GB; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3

I noticed this morning that Firefox was uising 2.4G of RAM this morning, according to top.  I have 4G of RAM installed.

When I clicked on the title bar the was Disk I/O for over 30 seconds and the RAM used dropped to less than 500 M.

I think this kind of behaviour has happened before.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Leave Firefox running overnight
2. (Look at top)
3. Click on title bar
4. (when disk I/O stops, check top again)
Actual Results:  
Too much memory used, slows down system responsiveness, RAM recovered on clicking on titlebar (provably anything that gives it focus)

Expected Results:  
RAM consumption should not be excessive whem Firefox is essentially idle from the user perspective

I think (not sure) that the only tab open tab was for Yahoo mail, and that I had fired up Firefox from a trminal logged in as another user.  These facts 'should' not be relevent... (famous last words)
