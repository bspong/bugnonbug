cache does not clear itself and reloading fails
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040626 Firefox/0.8

After clearing the cache (ie, clearing out everything,
Tools+Options+Privacy+Clear All), the Reload icon fails to reload a page. After
changing a website page that uses links to a CSS page, after changing CSS
statements inside a stylesheet, the browser will reload but fails to present
itself properly according to the reloaded information.

I specifically changed a font-size from 8pt to 10pt and then back again to the
8pt size and I cannot get FireFox 0.9 nor 0.91 to go back to present the 8pt
font properly without rebooting the computer. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Change a font-size on a style sheet.
2. Reload the page via the browser's Reload button or CTRL+R.
3. Take note.

Actual Results:  
The page does NOT present itself properly. The font-size should present itself
properly.

Expected Results:  
The page should present itself properly. IE works properly.

No crashes. Just editing webpages and changing font-sizes on linked CSS and
tried inline styles as well.
