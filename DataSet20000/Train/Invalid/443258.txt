Can only do one transaction at a time with Browser then have to use control/alt/delete click task manager close task manager and continue.

My mail account which lists all my mail has been condensed into half of the width of the window, except the header and the menu items listed across the bottom these are still full width.

Neither of these problems existed with Firefox V.2.0.0.1

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Browser
2.click on Tab
3.click on website
4. Now need to use control alt delete > task manager >close to continue to use Browser.
5. Do one more click on Browser then have to repeat 4. again to continue and so on and so forth.



When I close the browser the problem disappears.

Have used v. 2.0.0.1 since it was introduced and its predecessor, but never experienced this problem.
