Hi,

I am not sure if this is a security violation, and it appears IE7 and Safari both allow this behaviour. I would like to use it, but it strikes me it could be used as an exploit for a cross-site security vulnerability. Therefore I'd like the devs to confirm this is expected behaviour.

Issue:

A page "http://site1/page.htm" has a frameset. It has two frames, "one" that is set to point to http://site1/subpage1.htm and "two" is set to point to http://site2/page.htm

http://site2/page.htm executes the javascript: 

window.parent.frame["one"].location = "http://site1/subpage2.htm";

This is allowed as long as the page it navigates to is in http://site1 on Firefox and Safari, and seems to be allowed to be anywhere on IE7 - eg "http://site3/another.html".

I would like to use this behaviour to pass data between two domains, using the query string on that redirect, and navigating to a page that can process that data. In my instance its benign - I am trying to pass data between two pages on two sites I have created, but it occurs to me that if you were able to navigate a subframe to a malicious site, that frame could make calls to the server using the session cookies etc.

Is this behaviour by design and will it likely continue into the future? I am trying to avoid using a mechanism that will suddenly stop working.

Kind regards,

Alex 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
As above
Actual Results:  
Works

Expected Results:  
Not sure, but probably a security violation when the frame is redirected from http://site2
