It comes up after click onto websites after search on Google/Mozilla.  Address comes up as: xxfindmywolrdhq.com (note incorrect spelling!)  Cannot access websites beyond initial search.  Help!


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Google search page.
2. enter Compuserve
3.  Once Compuserve comes up with various options cached, click onto email login.
Actual Results:  
Rather than the page to log in for email/webmail, xxfindmywolrdhq.com comes up on web address line, quickly changes, to various shopping websites.

Expected Results:  
Instead, when I clicked onto the email log in, I should have seen the Compuserve log in page and proceeded to go to my email.

This began happening about March 5th/6th, 2009.  I have not been able to use Mozilla Firefox searches since.  I have purchased McAfee security and this has not stopped the problem.  Full Scan did not reveal this problem, but it continues to exist... misdirecting each time.
