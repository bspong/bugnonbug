If starting FX after a crash, you are asked if you would like to reset your session.

If you choose to do so, and you had multiple windows when the crash occured, all windows and tabs will be reset.
However, Mozilla Firefox does only succeed with loading the tabs for the first window. All other windows' tabs will stand and try to load, which leads no where.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start multiple windows with multiple tabs in each window.
2. Kill the Mozilla Firefox process in the Operating System
3. Start Firefox, when asked to reset the last session, select "Restore session"
Actual Results:  
All windows should load the tabs' respective web pages.

Expected Results:  
Only the first window succeeds with loading each tabs' respective web pages. All other windows fail to load their tab's web pages and will continue to try to load the pages.
