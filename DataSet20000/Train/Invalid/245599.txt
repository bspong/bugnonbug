Paragraphs break intermittently at the beginning of a hyperlink and don't obey width specified in style sheet. Refreshing causes the problem to go on and off.

On http://mrpcli.com/computer.htm and http://mrpcli.com/networking.htm you'll
see that I have several paragraphs. On each page there is a hyperlink in one of
the paragraphs. The paragraph starts a new line and does not obey the width
anymore at the beginning of the link. Refreshing the page seems to make it go
away sometimes, and other times it comes back. It's about 50/50. I noticed this
on a Windows 2000 Pro machine, and confirmed it on a Windows XP machine with the
same version. IE and Opera do not exhibit this behavior. The CSS file is at
http://mrpcli.com/css/styles.css if you need it.

Contact me if you need any other information or want me to try anything else.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the page.
2. Refresh the page.
3. Goto 2.

Actual Results:  
The problem described in the details section happens...

Expected Results:  
It should have rendered the paragraphs the way it rendered all of the other
paragraphs. Roughly half the time, it seems to render them correctly.
