Using IBM laptops equipped with TrackPoint, scrolling is by pressing the middle button and apply force on the TrackPoint by default. In this mode, Firefox and extensions do not recognize any middle button clicking.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
No response to middle click.

Expected Results:  
e.g. Middle click on link opens in new tab.

Anybody knows how to report this to IBM too? I guess their TrackPoint driver screw things up, but without it other windows cannot be scrolled.
