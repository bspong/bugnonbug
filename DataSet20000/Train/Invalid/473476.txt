New Version Entirely Buggy - Please Allow Me to Download an Older Version

I am having four problems with the new version, 3.0.5. 

The first problem is apparently widespread, as I have found numerous pages detailing the problem when I ran a Google search. Flash videos do not play sound, and stop playing every few seconds. 

The second problem is I cannot open a new Firefox window. I can open a new tab in a window, but no new windows.

The third problem is that my touchpad is seriously disabled in Firefox only. I cannot tab or scroll, which I can do in IE and Safari.

The fourth problem is the most troubling. I can view the page I have open, but I cannot navigate to a new page, follow a link, or do anything but view the current page. I can open a new tab, and type a new address, but then I cannot press enter. If I use another way to open a new link or page (such as using the Mozilla Help), I get a blank tab with nothing in the address bar, and the page goes no where. I cannot use the home button to navigate to a new page. I cannot use my favorites, as I get the same response. All buttons, links, etc appear to work visually - they highlight, etc, but then there is no response from the program.

Please advise. I hate IE and I don't much like Safari, but I am stuck using them until this problem is rectified.

Thank you for your time.
