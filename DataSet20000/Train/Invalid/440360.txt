Mouse control does not seem to work after following a link
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

After following a link using the mouse, firefox is not controlable by mouse anymore.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I am reading a site using Firefox. 
2.I follow a link by clicking it using the mouse.
3.the new page is loaded but I cannot use the mouse in Firefox anymore, the keyboardcontrol still works though (the mouse works again if I unset the windowfocus and reset it by doing a "ctrl-tab, ctrl-tab"). It does not matter if I have one tab or more tabs open.

Almost the same happens with extra windows (such as the addons-window) if I open one I wont be able to use the mouse inside (but I am able to control it by keyboard).

Actual Results:  
I cannot use the mouse anymore to control firefox.

Expected Results:  
Nothing special, just the that the controlling by mouse should work.
