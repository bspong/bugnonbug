When private browsing is set then new passwords for entering sites, forum etc don't trigger the password manager with the question what to do. Therefore you can't save the password in your password list. This has nothing to do if your private or not. Now you have to reset private browsing in order to get password saved and go back to reinstall private browsing. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. set private browsing
2. go to a site and register, password manager does not come up
3. disable private browsing, go to step 2 and now password manager comes up with a question


Expected Results:  
No matter what, as soon as someone enters a password for registering, even when private browsing is set, the password manager should come up with the question what to do.
