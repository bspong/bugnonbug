Once you have many items in your bookmark toolbar and some are hidden under more icon (>>), if you delete them while looking under >>, the list does not get refreshed automatically, and if you try deleting the same item multiple times you will end up deleting other items as well without getting a clue!

Losing bookmarks is a pretty annoying bug, should be considered major.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add a couple of items into your bookmarks Toolbar
2. Customize settings and move bookmarks section onto the same line with
address bar/search input
3. Tune width of address bar so some bookmarks get hidden under '>>'
4. Click on '>>' and try deleting the same item a few times!

Actual Results:  
As long as you had multiple items under '>>' you end up deleting as many as many times you have clicked 'delete' in a single item

Expected Results:  
A single item should be deleted, and a listupdate should reflect it instantly
