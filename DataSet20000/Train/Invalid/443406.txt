File -> New Window from the menu, or CTRL+N from the keyboard does not open a new window.  The only visible change is that the mouse cursor changes to the "pointer + hourglass" cursor.  No new window is ever created.  Opening tabs works fine, but opening new windows does not work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load firefox
2. Press CTRL+N, or select New Window from the File menu.
Actual Results:  
No new window was created.

Expected Results:  
A new window should've been created.
