Browser hang with hourglass, 0 - 5 CPU usage
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: version 1.8.20080.40413

When using FF 2.0.0.14 on Windows XP, and several other applicaitons active, Word, Excel, PPT., and trying to access a page using FF 2.0.0.14 the browser will hang. 

And "hang" means having to use task manager to kill the process, since FF is completely unresponsive. 

Associated with the hangs, is the following entry in the windows event logs : 

15/08/2008 12:21 Application Error Faulting application firefox.exe, version 1.8.20080.40413, faulting module firefox.exe, version 1.8.20080.40413, fault address 0x00296361.&#x000d;&#x000a; 
Upgrading to FF 3.0 resolves the problem, but FF 3.0 cannot be used in my organization yet. 

Also, occasionally, closing some applications, and attempting to reaccess the page is successful. 

Does anyone have any suggestions as to what may be the cause and/or the resolution ? 

Thank you.
