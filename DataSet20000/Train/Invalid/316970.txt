Extension install originating domain is not correct.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

When using a link on a webpage to install an extension, the orginating domain offered in the "Allowed Sites" window isn't correct if the linked extension is from a different domain.

For example, a webpage on www.domainA.com has a link to www.domainB.com/extension.xpi
Clicking on the link will bring up the blocked install notification.  Clicking on the "Edit Options" button brings up the "Allowed Sites" window.  The domain that is entered into the address field is www.domainA.com, not www.domainB.com which is the orginating domain of the xpi.

Couple this with a hidden status bar or some Javascript that changes the status bar text (I know it's disabled by default but still), the average user could be tricked into installing an extension from a malicious source.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://greaseblog.blogspot.com/
2. The latest entry is from the 12th September and has a link to the 0.6.2 version of Greasemonkey hosted on userscripts.org
3. Click on the link to install the 0.6.2 version of Greasemonkey.

Actual Results:  
The install is blocked by Firefox, clicking on the "Edit Options" button brings up the "Allowed Sites" window.  In the address bar is greasemonkey.blogspot.com.

Expected Results:  
The address in the "Allowed Sites" window should show userscripts.org as that is where the xpi is actually coming from.
