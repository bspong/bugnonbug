some problem with any component on the page with firefox. It gets hanged most of the time i enter the above site. i am using multiple tabs most of the time (same sites) - fifa.com, gmail, lastpass vault and wimbledon. all others are ok, but the momebt wimbledon is tried to be laoded - even in single tab - it hangs!!! I presume it is handing as it shows page laoding sign forever, and if i try to do anything, top bar says (not responding)

Reproducible: Always
