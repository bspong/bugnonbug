Missing option: "Bookmark All Tabs" option missing in Bookmarks menu

Before (Firefox 3.5/3.6) user was able to select:
- Bookmark This Page
- Subscribe to This Page...
- Bookmark All Tabs...
- Organise Bookmarks...



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on the bookmark menu button
2. Check the drop down menu

Actual Results:  
- Bookmark All Tabs...
is missing

Expected Results:  
- Bookmark All Tabs...
should be also there

You only see that "Bookmark All Tabs " item in the Bookmarks menu if you use the keyboard (Alt + B)

Maybe related to Bug 626825 - Hide redundant menu commands unless the user invokes the menu using the keyboard.

BUT, I think this menu option should be there and not be hidden because not redundant.
