Middle-clicking the feeds button in location bar has no effect if there are multiple feeds on the page
STR:
1. Open http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Special:Recentchanges
2. Middle-click the feed button in the location bar to open the subscription UI in a new page.

Actual results:
Nothing happens, as there are multiple feeds, which means you're supposed to left-click the button and select one from the popup menu.

Expected results:
Either open the popup menu on middle click or just open the subscription UI and let me choose the feed in there. (Maybe pre-select a feed, as some pages just send the same content in Atom and RSS and frankly I just don't care which format the feed is in.)
