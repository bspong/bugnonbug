About screen (credits) puts the trademark symbol on any branding
If you bring up the about screen and click "credits" on a deer park build, it says that "Deer Park" is a trademark.

The trademark symbol should only be there if it is an official Firefox build.

Not sure the best way to do this. I'm wondering if we should create a brandFullNameTM that contains the Trademark so that it can be easily referenced (and set to not having a TM if necessary)
