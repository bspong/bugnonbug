In this page I have some button like "Repost-Email-WWW or warn ...." with code
<img class="imgfade" onmouseover="this.className='imgfull'" onmouseout="this.className='imgfade'" src="images/english/postbit_warn.gif">
The class have any effect on images and there is no change onmouseout and ....

This worked well in 3.0.11 or 3.0.11 and also IE

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
It should be look like old version
