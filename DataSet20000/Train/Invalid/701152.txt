Pages do not expire even if > browser.history_expire_days.mirror
I am using Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:7.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0.1 from Fedora.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Set browser.history_expire_days.mirror to 60 and restarted firefox.
2. Open history, add the column "last accessed" and use it for sorting.

Actual results:
1. History still has an entry for "Older than 6 months"
2. "Older than 6 months" lists pages that were last accessed a year ago (30.11.2010 as I file this bug). This is even bigger than the default hard limit of browser.history_expire_days.mirror (180 days) and way bigger than the limit I set manually.

Expected results:
1. There should be no "Older than 6 months" but only "Older than a month" or "Older than 2 months"
2. "Older than X months" should not list pages that were last accessed before browser.history_expire_days.mirror
