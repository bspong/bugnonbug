This has happened with one URL so far, but i cant report it as a Broken Page, because Firefox becomes unusable and i must to kill its process.

When i load provided URL i cant switch between tabs with a left click, only right click is working on tabs, and i can close tabs, i can close this tab, which is causing the problem, but that doesnt help. If i close Firefox it dissapears, but i still have to kill its process to be able to launch it again.

Reproducible: Always

you may open few tabs before it, so you can see that you wount be able to switch between tabs with a left click
Actual Results:  
Firefox becomes unusable, i can still open new tabs, close tabs, but i cant switch to tabs that were already opened. And after closing Firefox its process is hanging, so i have to kill it.

Expected Results:  
It should show only "Java Applet Loading Failed" nad maybe error page and not hanging whole browser.
