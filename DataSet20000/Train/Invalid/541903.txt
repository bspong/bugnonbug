Standard Windows response to double clicking a window's titlebar icon is to close the window. FF 3.6 requires two double-clicks to do so - the first doubleclick is ignored.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any FF window
2. Doubleclick title bar icon (FF logo next to page title)
Actual Results:  
Window remains open until doubleclick is repeated

Expected Results:  
Window should close

Occurs in safemode with all extensions/plugins disabled as well. Worked fine in 3.5. Clicking the X button on the window works as usual.
