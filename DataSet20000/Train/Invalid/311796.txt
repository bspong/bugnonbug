Flash and Java elements are not visible on a page with the latest firefox beta.
If I navigate directly to a .swf file it works, however.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a site with flash or java content.

Actual Results:  
The element with the flash or java was not visible (but sound plays in some cases)

Expected Results:  
The flash or java should have been visible.
