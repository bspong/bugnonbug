flash plugin freezes firefox, corrupted double-linked list detected by glibc
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060207 Debian/1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.1-1 Firefox/1.5.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060207 Debian/1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.1-1 Firefox/1.5.0.1

When visiting www.webwereld.nl or other sites with flash content, Firefox sometimes freezes completely, where not even the window is repainted when you move another window over it. In some of these cases, glibc also prints messages about corrupted pointers on the console:
*** glibc detected *** corrupted double-linked list: 0x0930d9a0 ***
or:
*** glibc detected *** free(): invalid pointer: 0x0929e4d8 ***

It is clearly related to the Flash plugin only (version 7.0r61 and 7.0r25). I can reproduce the problem with only the Flash plugin installed, and with a fresh ~/.mozilla directory without any installed extensions.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox with installed flash plugin on the commandline.
2.Go to a website with lots so flash, such as www.webwereld.nl.
3.Click on a few article headers.
4.Restart Firefox if it does not freeze after a few pages.
Actual Results:  
Sometimes Firefox freezes and/or messages about corrupted pointers will appear on the console.

Expected Results:  
No freeze and no messages about corrupted pointers.

This is on a Debian system with libc6-2.3.5-13. The windowing environment seems to have an influence. On a KDE desktop, the problem seems to occur more frequently than with a desktop with the icewm window manager.
