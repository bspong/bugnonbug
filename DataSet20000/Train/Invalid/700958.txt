Tab sticks to mouse when clicking it

Steps to reproduce:

This problem exists since Firefox 3 and earlier, and I have no clue why and how this is even possible. What it is: When I go to http://kdenlive.org and switch tabs by clicking with the mouse on the different tabs, the kdenlive tab often «sticks» to the mouse for half a second when clicking it, as if I would drag it. So if I click the kdenlive tab and then move my mouse right after this, the tab gets dragged somewhere and usually opens a new window.

I could reproduce this on multiple Linux systems (Windows not tested), for maybe 2 or 3 years now.
