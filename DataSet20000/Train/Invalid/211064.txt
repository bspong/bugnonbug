Some extensions seem not to install correctly if MFB is not restarted between
installations.  Specifically the javascript debugger fails to install.  Download
of a new nightly build made no difference so suspect my configuration files I
believe to be held as part of my profile.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install an extension. Don't restart
2. Install Javascript debugger (Venkman)
3. restart
4. No installations can I see!

Actual Results:  
Javascript debugger never installs.

Expected Results:  
Installed debugger like Mozilla 1.4
