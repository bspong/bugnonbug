When I open Firefox I get a Javascript Application dialog box with a message that says "Fireuploader Error:  Database Not Created"  and there is an "OK" button.  I have to click on the button three times before Firefox will open.  Then, occasionally if I am in a webpage I will get this message again if I am trying to do something (like checkout from an online store).  This started happening when I downloaded the most recent upgrade maybe 5 days to a week ago.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open firefox
2.
3.
Actual Results:

Expected Results:  
got dialogue box error message 3x
