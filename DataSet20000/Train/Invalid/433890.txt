Mozilla Firefox trademark information in credits is incorrect
The credits.xhtml claims:

Mozilla Firefox and the Firefox logo are registered trademarks of the 
Mozilla Foundation.

And it puts a registered trademark after Mozilla Firefox.

This is incorrect.

Mozilla Firefox is not a registered trademark. The correct terminology is:

Mozilla, Firefox and the Firefox logo are registered trademarks of the Mozilla Foundation.

Also, there is no need for the &reg; in the claim itself.
