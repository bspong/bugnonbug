Cannot locate any urls since 1.0.4 upgrade
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; MSN 6.1; MSNbMSFT; MSNmen-us; MSNc0z; MSNc00)
Build Identifier: Mozzilla Fire Fox 1.04

Cannot locare urls with Norton Firewall active. Other 43 other browsers work 
fine. Firefox was fine until I upgraded to 1.04. I do not like to use browsers 
that allow hackers to use the active x controls to climb into your system. 
Please fix this problem. Or are you telling me I no longer need the firewall up 
and active wiyh the new code???? Thabks
