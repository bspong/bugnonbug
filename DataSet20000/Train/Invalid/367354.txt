some pages do not load when pop-up blocker is enabled. Others browsers work correctly
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1

When I enter this page: 

http://sabadonoche.tk/ 

i get a blank page. There appears the cross in the bottom toolbar and if I allow pop-ups for that page then the web loads. I have tested it under opera and works fine even if I have pop-ups blocked.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable firefox 2.0.0.1 pop-up blocker in preferences.
2. Load the web   http://sabadonoche.tk
3. Check that there is a blank page and try the same page in opera for example.
Actual Results:  
The problem is persistent.

Expected Results:  
The webpage should be loaded correctly. This can be that the web checks for loading pop-ups prior to loading the web or may be a firefox problem.

I can workaround the problem enabling pop-ups for the specified pages.
