when will firefox be completely compatible with x3100 graphic cards and drivers?

Reproducible: Always




you might want to contact Intel for the details on the possible upcoming updated driver for x3100 cards because they haven't released an update for windows 7 x3100 since 2009. And could mess with gpu and cpu acceleration of firefox 4. So Please Make firefox 4 Fully compatible with x3100 because a lot of users are using computers with x3100 drivers and it lags when direct2d 10 is enabled so please fix that incompatibility as soon as possible. 
Thanks
