I'd like to see some options of mozilla 1.7 rc1 ported to firefox;
* A new option to prevent sites using Javascript to block the browser's context
menu.
* It is now possible to fine-tune Mozilla's pop-up blocking using two
preferences (dom.popup_maximum and dom.popup_allowed_events) but there's no UI
for that yet. Even without a UI, users should notice a greater variety of
pop-ups blocked (primarily mouseover pop-ups) and a limit of 20 or so open at
one time, regardless of whether pop-up blocking is active which provides some
protection from sites that open hundreds of windows in a loop. (but then with a UI)
And, an option to open target="_new" links in a new tab. I don't mean javascript
popups because you can't create a new tab with different sizes etc.
A feature to block irritating marquees would also be great.
