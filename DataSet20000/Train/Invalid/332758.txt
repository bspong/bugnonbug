Ok, someone just posted a link to the url, I was pretty sure it was something like this, but opened anyways, noticed my browser hung, tried to close the browser and the whole OS hung, no response to Ctrl+Alt+Del or anything else.
I quickly got a copy of the page with wget so it wont go offline before I get the chance of examining it, and noticed some kinda malformed javascript code, apparently able to write directly to the memory.
I didn't try the page on a linux version of the browser because I couldn't figure out what the "shellcode" does in the page.

Also, I would want to take down the local copy of the file(the URL I provided) as soon as possible, because I don't want to be considered a distributor of the "exploit".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open url with the malformed javascript
2. wait
3. yer dead

Actual Results:  
Browser hung, OS hung

Expected Results:  
just that, I guess

Tested on Windows XP running finnish Firefox 1.5.0.1
