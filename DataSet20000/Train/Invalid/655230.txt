Firefox looks exactly like Google Chrome after update to 4.0.1
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1

Same look as Google Chrome (beurk!) and AVG (antivirus) works partially only.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
Can I return to the previous version of Firefox?
