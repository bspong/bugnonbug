Bookmark Folder gone after FireFox 3.0 RC upgrade

Running all FF3.0 betas with no problems, today automatic update to 3.0RC - only to find that although some bookmarks have been retained, a specific bookmark folder (cannot remember what this was called as the name of the folder was unimportant to me probably called something like Main Sites)- with my most recent and used links, is no longer there....why? I have now lost a load of links, that I will painstakingly have to find again...something that I should not have to do... 




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just let Firefox automatically upgrade to FF3 RC
2.
3.


Expected Results:  
ALL bookmarks and sub folders should be in place, nothing overwritten...
