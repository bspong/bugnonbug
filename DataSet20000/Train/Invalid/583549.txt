browser.urlbar.autoFill should be enabled by default and fix few bugs regarding it
User-Agent:       Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 6.1; U; en) Presto/2.5.29 Version/10.60
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; Windows NT 6.1; rv:2.0b3pre) Gecko/20100731

All modern browsers such as Chrome , Safari and Opera support this small feature by default. It will be easier for the users migrating from the above mentioned browsers to Firefox 4.0 if they find such feature enabled by default. In short , it will be more "user friendly"

Bugs regarding it IMO:
-> It should not take the user to visit that address 3~5 times to get it in autofill's "history" , instead , after visiting once should make that url available for autofill.

-> www. should be ignored while searching for such urls. For example , if i visit arewefastyet.com 2~3 times , it comes in autofill , but if i visit www.facebook.com , it will never come into account of autofill. This is not desired

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Vist any site
2.Type the site's address one more time

Actual Results:  
the desired url comes in drop down menu

Expected Results:  
the url should automatically come in location bar and get "autofilled"
