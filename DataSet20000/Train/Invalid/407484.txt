Smart Bookmarks folder uses too much real estate in bookmarks toolbar
I can fit far fewer bookmarks on the bookmarks toolbar under Firefox 3 than Firefox 2.  This is because the Smart Bookmarks folder takes up so much real estate on the Bookmarks toolbar.  It was bad enough when the folder title was Places, but now that it has changed to Smart Bookmarks it is much worse.

I have removed the title from the folder and now it is just a folder icon with no title.

This gave me the idea that what is probably needed is a different icon for this folder.  Also nice, would be preferences to show the folder or not and to show it with or without a title.
