When session crashes, upon restart if "Do not restore session/Start new session" option is selected pinned AppTabs are forgotten.

I shutdown my machine without closing firefox. On the next startup, when I opened firefox the restore session window came up. I opted to start a new session and quickly discovered all my pinned AppTabs were no longer their.

Reproducible: Didn't try



Expected Results:  
The software should always remember the pinned AppTabs. Only unpinning an AppTab should cause an AppTab to be forgotten.
