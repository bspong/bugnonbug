Currently smart bookmarks name is too long on the limited space I have for bookmarks toolbar. 

I propose we rename Smart Bookmarks to Smartmarks. This would also bring parity with the Livemarks name we give to live bookmarks and free up much need real estate on bookmarks toolbar. 

Also I propose we should have an icon, such as a star as current generic folder is very ugly on a toolbar full of favicons.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Look at bookmarks toolbar
2.See folder smart bookmarks.
3.
Actual Results:  
Smart Bookmarks on bookmark toolbar.

Expected Results:  
Should be called Smartmarks and have an icon
