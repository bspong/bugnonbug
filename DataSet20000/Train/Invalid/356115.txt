This is actually not a bug, but a complaint on missing features that were present in FF 1.x.
The  tools-->read Mail option disappeared in FF 2.x and pressing ctrl-M to write a new message doesn't work either. Why were these features removed? or will they be re-instated in the final 2.0 version?

Reproducible: Always
