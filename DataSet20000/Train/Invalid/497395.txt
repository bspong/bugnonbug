Drag Drop Tab to Taskbar and browser misbehaves

I dragged gmail tab to taskbar on windowsXP. it opened up a new browser window with gmail alright. but then i tried playing around with the windows - simple as minimizing, maximizing (both using taskbar as well as button on the window) and weird things are happening. Example, it would not minimize. Example, I had 2 tabs left on one window and one on the other; when i clicked on the tab that was not active, instead of that coming up, the other window would all of a sudden pop-up. I had Pandora and Firefox 3.5 homepage open on one window and Gmail on the other. Hence, I would consider that the browser is hanging up in this case as I am not able to use it further in any possible way until I close and reopen it.

Reproducible: Always
