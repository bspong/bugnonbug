Throbber for the location bar places search is visually similar to geolocation
I just did a complex search in the awesome bar and for a split second caught myself finding it strange that Firefox was reporting my geo-location to someone.  The two icons are extremely similar, and appear in nearly exactly the same place.

I recommend do one of these (in order of difficulty):
-swap in our connecting throbber
-remove the throbber entirely (there is so much lag before it shows up that it doesn't really provide feedback in the current implementation)
-design a new throbber for local search, like a flashing search glass
