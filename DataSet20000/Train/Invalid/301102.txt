Previously, I could ALWAYS click on a link with my mouse's scroll button (the
"center" or wheel button which lets you scroll up and down after you click it)
to open that link in a new tab. Now, certain web sites (like the example URL
given) do not open new tabs; instead, nothing happens. Try clicking the links at
the bottom of http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/ (i.e. Lookup,
Welcome, etc.) using the scroll/wheel button of a mouse.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
The bug is always reproducible but only for certain web sites, such as
http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences. I haven't been able to figure out a
general pattern of sites where it is/is not reproducible.
Actual Results:  
Links do not open in a new tab.

Expected Results:  
Links SHOULD open in a new tab.
