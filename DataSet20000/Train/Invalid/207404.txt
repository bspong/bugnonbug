MozDev.org projects/"extensions" don't work in Firebird

Firebird should (but doesn't) display the browser window always with the Yahoo
Toolbar for Mozilla beneath the [Firebird] Bookmarks toolbar.  Furthermore, the
Extensions panel within Firebird's preferences (Mozilla
Firebird->Preferences->Extensions) don't work and remain blank.

I did try a couple of other projects or what Firebird calls "extensions" found
at http://texturizer.net/firebird/extensions.html and yet each of those
respective projects failed to work too.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://companion.mozdev.org/installation.html 
2. Click on the US install link
3. Hit ok to the install permissions link that pops up
4. Quit Firebird
5. Relaunch Firebird
Actual Results:  
Although Firebird indicates that the download worked, and upon
restarting/relaunching Firebird one realizes that the MozDev.org project failed
to work in Firebird (albeit it does work in its parent Mozilla)

Expected Results:  
Firebird should (but doesn't) display the browser window always with the Yahoo
Toolbar for Mozilla beneath the [Firebird] Bookmarks toolbar.  The Extensions
panel within Firebird's preferences (Mozilla Firebird->Preferences->Extensions)
should work by listing any "extensions"/MozDev.org projects one has choosen to
install in their copy of Firebird.
