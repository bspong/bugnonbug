Bug 318564 has NOT been resolved
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915
Build Identifier: Firefox/1.5

Multiple clicks on the HOME icon, when a home tab group has been set, raises an entirely new batch of tabs, rather than refreshing all tab pages.

This behavior does not occur in any other version of Firefox or Mozilla.

It is NOT the issue that may or may not have been fixed in the Bug reported as its predecessor duplicate.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set up multi-tab home group (say, M tabs)
2. Set current group as home.
3. Click on the home icon.  N clicks ===>  N x M tabs now appear: you can get hundreds of tabs this way, if that's what turns you on.....



Expected Results:  
The original M tabs should be refreshed. NO new tabs should have been added.

Firefox 1.5 bug.  Mozilla 1.7.12 and all previous have never worked this way.

No config file tweaking helps.
