Untrusted SSL server certificates should be given standard http treatment

On encountering certificates from HTTPS servers which chain to an authority which is untrusted, the user interface and experience should be virtually identical to the user interface for standard HTTP.

This means:

- no display of the blue SSL site-assurance bar
- no display of the green EV bar (obvious, but listing it anyway)
- no display of any change in authentication level
- A warning for every form POST to that server, with the following wording:

"The information you have entered is to be sent over an encrypted connection, but it is possible for it to be intercepted and read by a third party.  This is most potentially dangerous when connecting through public wifi hotspots or other untrusted networks.

If you have previously seen a blue or green badge in the address bar and do not see it now, YOUR INFORMATION IS BEING INTERCEPTED, and YOU SHOULD NOT CONTINUE!

Are you sure you want to continue sending this information?"

I recommend making this a mandatory warning for all UI submissions via https to servers with untrusted certificate chains.

The user should be able to import self-certificates for known sites and have the UI forcibly inform them when the credential has changed, with wording similar to the above, and possibly with a red badge.
