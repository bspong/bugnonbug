Secure Connection Failed error page only displays in release builds
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko/20090723 Minefield/3.6a1pre

If I visit an https site with SSL disabled, I get a different error page depending on which build I am using.

STR (on a new profile):
1. Open the preferences dialog
2. Click Advanced > Encryption
3. Uncheck Use SSL 3.0
4. Close the preferences dialog
5. Visit https://www.verisign.com

RESULT:
Minefield -> Connection Reset error page
Firefox -> Secure Connection Failed error page

EXPECTED:
Secure Connection Failed error page should display in both instances.

NOTE:
I checked Minefield all the way back to June 22nd (which is before Firefox 3.5.1 was cut) and it displays the incorrect error page as well.  Is it possible for the Secure Connection Failed error page to only be turned on in release builds?
