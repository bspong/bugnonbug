Panorama access is MUCH faster with browser.panorama.animate_zoom set to false.  Rather than waiting 2 seconds for the animation to complete (twice - zooming in and zooming out), I can do a 3 finger swipe, and immediately find the next tab to switch to.  There should be a preference checkbox to expose this functionality.  It makes panorama much nicer to use.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  browser.panorama.animate_zoom is true
2.  Panorama access is slow
3.  browser.panorama.animate_zoom is false
4.  Panorama access is fast, and more pleasant to use.
Actual Results:  
Setting browser.panorama.animate_zoom to false makes Panorama much easier to work with, because you don't have to wait through animations all the time.

Expected Results:  
Panorama is fast and unobtrusive.
