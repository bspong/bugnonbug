Keywords added using the add bookmarks popup window does not save keyword, only the bookmark.  In order to use a keyword, it has to get added to properties after the bookmark is stored.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. navigate to any web page
2. ctrl-D to open add bookmark menu
3. add keyword in the "tags" line - click "done" to save
Actual Results:  
When keyword that was added is used, it tries to go to the http://<keyword> location rather than the actual bookmark url. Keyword is not saved with bookmark.

Expected Results:  
The keyword should be stored as part of the bookmark and the keyword should navigate to referenced bookmark url when used.

This is probably a duplicate of some other bug but multiple searches only shows similar bugs from years ago.

If the key word is manually added to the properties after the bookmark is added, then the keyword is then stored and functions.
