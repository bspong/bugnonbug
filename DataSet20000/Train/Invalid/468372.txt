This is a fresh XP install and I am re-establishing all of my bookmarks, passwords, etc.  In the past Firefox would remember this page, but now it cannot.  I have deleted all of my cookies and internet history, ensured that "remember passwords for sites" and "accept cookies from sites" is checked.  Nothing from the Yahoo domain shows in my "Saved Passwords" list.  Despite having logged in to my email more than a dozen times I have never been prompted to remember my password.

In the previous install this was not a problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to the above web site to log in
2.  Enter login ID and password
3.  Watch Firefox not request to remember password
Actual Results:  
Yahoo! ID fail to populate.  After ID entry, password fails to populate.  After login, Firefox fail to prompt to "remember password".

Expected Results:  
Firefox prompts to "remember password".  Upon next login, Yahoo! ID populates.  After ID entry, password populates.

There should be some error trapping here.  If the password is not on the "Exceptions" list and not in the "Saved Passwords" list then logically something is in error.
