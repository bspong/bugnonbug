Flash files displayed incorrectly using Firefox 3 & Camino 1.5.5. Displayed correctly in Firefox 2, Safari, Opera, IE5.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008061004 Firefox/3.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008061004 Firefox/3.0

The page (www.chrispahlow.com) contains a number of Flash files. Each contains a preloader, which consists of a white bar (which grows as the file loads) on top of a black background.

This works fine on Firefox 2, Safari, & Opera on Apple OSX, and IE5 on Windows XP.

When this page is displayed using Firefox 3 or Camino (both of which, I believe, use the new Gecko rendering engine) not all these files are displayed correctly. Some are displayed correctly, with the white loading bar on top of the black background. But in others the background is not displayed, showing only the white loading bar with a thin black outline around it.

The background may appear a bit later, or it may appear when you scroll down the page.

Also, this is not consistent. The page may work properly the first time it is viewed, but upon refreshing/reloading, the flash files may not work. Different files will not work on different attempts, there seems to be no consistency.

Because of this inconsistency, and because it works fine on older browsers, I believe this is a bug in the Gecko engine, and not a problem with my flash files.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to www.chrispahlow.com
2.Reload the page several times to view the inconsistency in displaying the flash files
3. Move the scroll bar to get the flash files to render correctly

Actual Results:  
A few of the flash files loaded without their black backgrounds. Moving the scroll bar, or switching between tabs, causes the black background to appear.

Expected Results:  
The black background should be displayed from the beginning.
