I am not sure if this is a firefox problem or not, but on my system, It does  not happen to any other apps other than firefox that I know of, As I said in the description, every single space 
is    really    excessively    big 
Each space takes up what looks like should be 3 of them
When I load firefox I get 
 ** (firefox-bin:pid): WARNING **: Exception in gr::RangeSegment
several times

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I don't exactly know how to reproduce it, It just happens to me, 
my OS is Debian/GNU sid(unstable) Linux kernel 2.6.22 and firefox 3b4 




It happens to me with the default theme as well as any other theme, and It does not happen with any other gtk2 apps on my system
