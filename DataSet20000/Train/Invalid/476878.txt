Adblock Plus add-on causes firefox to hang when going to blackboard.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008121622 Ubuntu/8.10 (intrepid) Firefox/3.0.5

While the Adblock Plus add-on is enabled, logging into blackboard causes firefox to stall.  It seems like it has crashed but if you wait 5 minutes, the page loads.  Simply going to blackboard.com does not cause the error, you must login so that the java applet loads.  Turning off Adblock Plus from Adblock's menu does NOT solve the problem.  However, disabling Adblock Plus from the firefox add-on/extensions menu does fix the problem.  (While Adblock Plus is disabled, blackboard will load almost instantly as opposed to 5 minutes).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Adblock Plus (1.0.1)
2.Login to blackboard so that the java applet loads
3.Firefox will hang for about 5 minutes
Actual Results:  
Firefox stopped responding for 5 minutes and then started working again.  blackboard does load after the 5 minutes.

Expected Results:  
Blackboard should load immediately.

I am running Firefox 3.0.5 on the OS Ubuntu 8.10.
I have other add-ons installed to, but even if I have all of those disabled, Adblock will still cause firefox to stall when going to blackboard.
