If I have bookmarks side bar open and try to open some bookmarks, it loads in side bar.  Happens with a number of sites, American Express, Schwab,  Citibank, BBC etc.  Doesn't happen with other sites, MacFixIt etc.  If I load from Bookmarks Manager, same thing.  If I load from History Side Bar, works OK.  Too many bookmarks to give you a total list

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.View Side bar
2.Click on Bookmark
3.

Actual Results:  
Open in side bar not in main window

Expected Results:  
opened URL in main window
