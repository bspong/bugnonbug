Aero Fox 3.0.1 theme renders Firefox 3 UNUSABLE and unrevivable.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Zune 2.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Aero Firefox theme

I downloaded the most popular Aero Firefox theme and restarted my browser immediately. While an object for Firefox appeared in the taskbar, no window will appear. I attempted to run Firefox in multiple modes found by right-clicking my FF3 desktop icon, going to Properties, and choosing different options found under the "Compatibility" tab. None appear to work.

Also, right-clicking the FF3 object in the taskbar does not reveal Minimize & Maximize options like it does for all other taskbar objects that I right-click on. The only way I am able to close the taskbar  the program is through the Alt+Ctrl+Delete method. According to the Task Manager though the browser does not physically appear it still uses the same amount of memory as it is when it's working.

I wish I was able to give you the exact details of the theme and possibly all the extensions I have installed but I AM NO LONGER ABLE TO USE FIREFOX! 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the popular Aero Firefox theme on Windows XP PC.
2. Restart Firefox 3.
3. Click Restore Previous Session button.
Actual Results:  
Firefox opens in taskbar but the actual Firefox browser does not open. 

Expected Results:  
Firefox opens with a new functional and visually appealing theme.

Since I am not able to open the Firefox browser, I can not even able to switch back to Firefox's default theme.
