With enough tabs open for scrolling to be required, scrolling is animated even when the the browser.tabs.animate preference is set to false.

Strangely enough, animation does not happen for the very first scroll, i.e. when you add the tab that causes scrolling to be needed. Adding more tabs or switching cycling through tabs will be animated.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set browser.tabs.animate to false in about:config
2. Keep opening tabs until scrolling is needed (and observe tab opening a new tab is thankfully not animated)
3. Open another tab
Actual Results:  
Existing tabs scroll to the left, with animation

Expected Results:  
Existing tabs jump to the left
