In the browser I have some tabs opened, in each tabs I have opened some sites. In one of the tabs I have open this site: http://www.imdb.com/
for example (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361862/). If i want to close this tab, the browser crashes. I have to reopen it again. The occurrence is systematic: every time when I want to close a tab in which I have opened www.imdb.com it crashes! And this happened only for this site.

2. If i want to close this tab, the browser crashes. If I want to close other tabs (but not this), firefox doesn't crash.
3.
