A colleague made this page which works as expected in IE7 and Firefox 2.  It does not work as intended in Firefox 3 beta 5.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Click the link on the provided example page.
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens - whereas in Firefox 2 or Internet Explorer 7 the page background will change.  The page checks out tentatively at w3c, so it isn't a problem with the page.

Expected Results:  
Should have changed the page background as intended by the page code.

The example code is probably the best test.  I don't know if any other code will cause the same problem.
