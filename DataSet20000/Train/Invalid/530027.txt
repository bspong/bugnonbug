After spending half an hour or half a day typing in a TEXTAREA, there are many ways to lose your work.[1][2]  You haven't yet managed to enhance Fx to guard against every possible such way.  :)  That's why the form-saving extension Lazarus[3] has been downloaded half a million times, and Textarea Cache[4] thirty thousand times.

But some users don't install preventive extensions until it's too late.  To help them, please make Fx remember the contents of the last TEXTAREA or two that they've worked on.  Perhaps in a formbackups directory stored alongside the bookmarkbackups profile subdirectory.  Maybe you could also provide a UI to access the backups.  The backup functionality should work on all http:// sites; if you want, it can work on https:// sites too.
