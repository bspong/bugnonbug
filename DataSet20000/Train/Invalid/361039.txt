For the page abovethe text below the bit which says
"Here begins the Good News about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God." should display using the Abyssinica SIL font, (which I have loaded from http://scripts.sil.org/AbyssinicaSIL) as it is Ethiopic text. It is set in the preferences. It used to work on FF 1.5, and I haven't changed the preferences since I upgraded.

It works in IE which has the same font configured for Ethiopic text.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download font above.
2. Check that font family for Ethiopic text is set to Abyssinica SIL.
3. View the above page.

Actual Results:  
Text is displayed with roman characters.

Expected Results:  
Text should be displayed with Abyssinica font, as IE does.
