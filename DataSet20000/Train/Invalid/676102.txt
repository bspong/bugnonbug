301 Redirection Cache Error
And that's about the best title I can think of, if someone wants to try their hand at re-describing this, you're more than welcome.

The story:

On my server, I have set up a subdomain to redirect (301) to another page on the main (www) domain. Specifically, (domain masked)
http://webmail.example.com/ -> https://example.com:1234/folder/subfolder/page/

On every machine I have access to, except one, the redirection is followed. On the exception, it's not followed, instead it follows to an old redirection:
http://webmail.example.com/ -> http://example.com:1201/

I've tested that it is indeed something with the profile on the exception because when I invoke Firefox through the profile manager and generate a fresh profile, the new redirection is followed.

I've also purged the history, any bookmarks pointing to my domain, and even used sqlite to walk through all the database's and eliminated every reference to my domain, and the problem persists.

P.S. Component was selected because it was the closest to the issue at hand.
