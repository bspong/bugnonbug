The app will start up, atleast it seams, when I've got the outher frame loaded with the Adres line, buttons and so on it won't run any command. Not able to open enithing nor shut it down (xp version, the linux part works fine)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: ??? don't reaaly understand what you want me to fill out here. But I use(d) firefox 1.0.3 wich I updated yesterday evening through the automatic update function

I've downloaded the latest version through the automatic update of this app, 
I've installed it like before in the standard folders etc. and since then it 
seams not to be working at all, I've redowloaded the app and reinstalled but 
the same trobles occur. The adres line and buttons seam to appear right butt 
when I try to open any url it wont do anything. The weard part is also that 
the sub menú from the adres line opens blank at the upper left side of my 
screen. Don't know what is wrong with the dutch build 1.0.3 from today but 
it's working at all on this pc anymore. I've installed 1 theme (classic), 
useragent changer, adblock, spoofstick, rss reader and weather forecast in the 
previous versions of firefox (fine app by the way) maybe there is something 
wrong there(if I deinstall ff and the reinstal it, are these files still on my 
pc?) 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Installing the latest build in Dutch (even the UK version got the same 
problem here)
2.starting the app
3.




Currently my pc is running XP with sp1 and all security patches and this 
worked till I updated this version of mozilla Firefox. Firefox is the latest 
thing I've changed.
