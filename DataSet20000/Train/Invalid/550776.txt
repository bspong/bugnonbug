I dont really have a bug, but a nice idea to be implemented in firefox.
If I would have the aility to open firefox with an adjustable list of websites I like to regulary visit, and check for new content (please add the option to open in separate windows or not), it would be very convenient.
I mean, a desktop button firefox, as it opens now, and a separate desktop button "check my sites". One click, and all the sites I want to check open up. That would be wonderful.
Now, one has to open them 1 by 1. And sometimes one forgets a site. So that is why I am contacting You. I hope You like it, and are willing to implement it in future cersions of firefox.

Reproducible: Always
