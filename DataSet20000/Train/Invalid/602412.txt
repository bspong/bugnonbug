it is that little required part of the GPL license that looks like a tag <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/> in the /* .... */ comment which causes the browser to give an error about the xhtml content.  this is wrong.  anything in a javascript comment should be ignored!



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.make xhtml document
2.insert javascript, and in the javascript  /* <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. */  although may with with simply /* <j> */  because it is not a regular tag.
3.serve up on properly configured apache server (should not serve up xhtml as html!)

Actual Results:  
XML Parsing Error: not well-formed
