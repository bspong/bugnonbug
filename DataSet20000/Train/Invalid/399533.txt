Phishing concern for the new location bar auto-complete
Here is an attack I'm worried about:

1) a variety of pages that the user visits do a very fast redirect through a phishing site, which has the title "paypal."  These pages get recorded in history (I'm pretty sure), and the frecency starts to go up.  For instance, this fast redirect occurs on every thumbnail image in a gallery the user is browsing, and the frecency score of the phishing site increases as the user navigates back and forth.

2) the user types "paypal" into the location bar, and selects the first item, unintentionally navigating to the phishing site, because their mental model has not adapted to the new behavior of the location bar (full history instead of only things you have personally typed in).

[* alternatively the page dynamically shows phishing/non-phishing content based on if it is being navigated to from a hyperlink vs. directly navigated to with the location bar, (I'm also assuming there is a way to pull that off)].

Potential solutions:
-be careful about what we store in history due to this new attack surface
-give results in the location bar auto-complete that have EV certs a different visual treatment, so the user may be cued that this isn't the result they expected.
