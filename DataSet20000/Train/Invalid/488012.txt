After uninstallation trial versions of Adobe CS4 products (I saw it after deleting Photoshop on one machine and after deleting Fireworks on another) the process msiexec.exe hangs the system. I kill it in Task Manager. Then after running Firefox the process System hangs, it takes 100% of processor resources. After restarting computer and running Firefox again the process System hangs and takes 100% of processor resources again. Other browsers do not hang the System process. In other words it's a some kind of "integration bug". 
It is solved by uninstallation (profile not deleted) and installation of Firefox. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Uninstall Photoshop or Fireworks
2. Kill msiexec (if it's needed)
3. Run Firefox


Expected Results:  
The process System takes 100% of processor resources
