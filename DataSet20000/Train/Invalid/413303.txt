Well, it happend again (and I have no idea why)
This time I can restore my bookmarks and they do not disappear when restarting
firefox but I can not save any changes that have to do with the tollbars.
Now I also tried to make these changes with latest-trunk version but they are
not saved after restart, either.
Can anybody tell me if there is any file that I have to delete (because it
might be corrupted)?


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
john that would make what you're seeing a different issue that should get its
own bug, in which you should attach the file with your bookmarks that you think
are doing this
