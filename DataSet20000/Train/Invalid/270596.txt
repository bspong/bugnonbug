Adding a few options for enhancing tabbed browsing
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

To make it short, I miss few functionalities from other tabbed browsers, which
could improve Firefox IMHO:
- New tab from address typed in address combo
- Open all tabs from previous session on Firefox startup automaticaly
- Close all tabs (including last), so one can hide whats he/she looking at
- Tabs position (top/bottom)
- Scrolable tabs (if there are many tabs opened, it can be difficult to locate
desired one)
- Option to open link in new tab instead of new window by default (not with CTRL
key)

Reproducible: Always
