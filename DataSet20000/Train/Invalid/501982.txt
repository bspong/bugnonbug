Private Browsing Tag not showing in Title Bar

I noticed when you go into private browsing it will say it up in the title bar that your in private browsing, but when you turn the option on to have the browser start in private mode by default it doesn't tell you when you open the browser that its in private browsing mode.  It just is confusing, and leads to second guessing are you really in private mode, then you have to go into options and see there if you are or not.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set options to "Automatically start Firefox in private browsing session".
2. Re-open browser

Actual Results:  
Title bar at top does not display that your in private browsing mode, like it does if you just go into private browsing mode right from the browser.

Expected Results:  
It should show that your in Private Browsing Mode.

Using Windows 7, have a the NASA Night Launch theme, using noscript.
