Setting Opacity on a div covers floating div that shouldn't be covered

If you have a Div "A" that has a floating div "B" floating over it, and you set div "A" to be an opacity < 1, it covers the floating div with the opacity. 

I would expect it to not cover a div that is on top of the affected div. The major issue is that all links in the floating div are rendered un-clickable. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Very simple HTML to reproduce:
1) create HTML file with the following HTML
2) View the HTML in firefox

<html>
<body>
	<div style='float: right; width: 200px; background-color: #FFFFCC;margin-right: 10px;'>
		<a href='#'>Testlink</a><br>
		<a href='#'>Testlink</a><br>
		<a href='#'>Testlink</a><br>
		<a href='#'>Testlink</a><br>
		<a href='#'>Testlink</a><br>
		<a href='#'>Testlink</a><br>
		<a href='#'>Testlink</a><br>
		<a href='#'>Testlink</a><br>
	</div>
	<div style='height: 100px; opacity: 0.3; background-color: #FFCCCC;'>
		Opacity Div, can't click links to the left.
	</div>
	<div style='height: 100px; background-color: #CCFFCC;'>
		No opacity, you CAN click the links
	</div>
</body>
</html>
Actual Results:  
Can't click links in the floating div due to the opacity being overlayed over it instead of only over the div that the css property was applied to. 

Expected Results:  
I would expect the floating div to float over the opacity since it was already floating over the div that the css property was set on.
