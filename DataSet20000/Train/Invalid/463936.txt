"Remember on this computer" is always selected when I come back to Hotmail but I am not remembered.
"Remember my password" is never selected even when I have selected it during the precious Hotmail session.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to hotmail.com
2. enter username
3. enter password
4. select remember me on this computer and remember my password
5. login
6. logout
7. got to hotmail.com

Actual Results:  
the username and password fields are blank and the "remember" my password box is no longer selected

Expected Results:  
the username and password fields should be filled in so I only need to click sign in
