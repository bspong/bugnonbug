Bookmarking a page makes text on the Web Developer Toolbar disappear
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

With the Web Developer Toolbar installed and its options set to show icons and text ("Display Toolbar with Icons and Text"), the text will disappear whenever you bookmark a page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have the Web Developer Toolbar installed and visible with the icons and text showing ("Display Toolbar with Icons and Text" under Options)
2. Press Ctrl-D or select Bookmarks -> Bookmark This Page, which will open the small dialog box where you choose where to file the bookmark.
Actual Results:  
The text on the Web Developer Toolbar will disappear, leaving only icons that all float left.

Expected Results:  
The text should remain.

I'm not sure if the bug is in the Web Developer Toolbar or in Firefox itself.

You can restore the toolbar's text by opening the toolbar's options and immediately clicking OK -- this resets the toolbar's text/icons option -- or by opening a new window.
