The browser history in the address bar will not delete no mater what. Nothing works. Even if i use the delete key on them they re appear the next time the arrow is clicked. I have tried "clear private data" and deleting history in the side panel. and manually deleting each entry from the bar, but nothing works.

Reproducible: Always

1.click on links to a website
2.try and delete it any way
3.check if it is there
Actual Results:  
the entries were still in the address bar.

Expected Results:  
deleted the entries.
