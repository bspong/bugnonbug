box appears saying "The update could not be installed. Please make sure there are no other copies of Firefox running on your computer, and then restart Firefox to try again."

Killed firefox.exe and tried again. Still the same.

Re-booted. Tried again. Still the same.

Disabled ad-blocker. Tried again. Still the same.

Disabled Zone Alarm and NOD32. Tried again. Still the same.

Searched the Internet but no-one else seems to have reported problem.

Please advise?

Thanks,
