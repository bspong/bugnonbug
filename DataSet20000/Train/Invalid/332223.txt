I was automating the script for mail server. Noted the script and when run it again in the live environment , it always fails when the script comes to the point where the autogenerated number ( take example of yahoo mail server) is to be filled . Tried a lot of ways but could not got the solution

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open the yahoo mail and select new mail id
2.when the page pops up fill all the details and also note the script.
3.Run the script again in the live environment and it fails at the point where autogenerated no is to be filled as each time it changes and also we have no  
control on this no.

Actual Results:  
Each time the script fails at the same point as the autogenerated number changes every time.

Expected Results:  
To successfully running the script the script should pass this point also which  it does not

we can take the example of yahoo mail for simulating the same environment.
