Improve anchor behavior in Firefox history
This is a bug to track potential changes in anchor behavior in Firefox. See: http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.apps.firefox/browse_frm/thread/f2078651cc7f5bb0/ea8c0bd212e0348e#ea8c0bd212e0348e

Note: what happens is: nsDocShell::InternalLoad calls nsDocShell::OnNewURI to add the anchored URI to history. This needs to be updated to also transmit the referrer, which looks like it is present and correct in InternalLoad, but OnNewURI doesn't have a parameter for it.
