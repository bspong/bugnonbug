The web page at the above url contains two flash files, one above the central
picture and one below. Both load and run ok in ie, but only the top one loads
and runs using firefox (downloaded yesterday). The bottom one, if right clicked
(guessing where to right click is fun) , returns a message stating that it has
not loaded. Both flash files where created the same way with and are essentially
the same, but with different text.
