The WoW Launcher.exe is unable to connect.

Check network settings error message .

Non of the on line solutions work .

Going back to the current version of Firefox caused the problem to go away.

Took me all afternoon to find this solution .  :-)  !

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Try & open WoW in RC4
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Error message

Expected Results:  
WoW opened normally

The WoW Repair.exe won't work for the same reason .

Unfortunately I am unable to recall the exact error message - but I know it is infinitely repeatable .

It seems to me that some element within Firefox RC4 is used to connect but is unable to allow this connection .

I did have full internet access at the time .
