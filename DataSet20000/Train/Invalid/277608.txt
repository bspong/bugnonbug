fonts are changing form/colour without reason
I've isolated the problems on this page, but I've also seen them elsewhere

-open it in firefox 1.0 (also seen in 0.8) (both XP and OSX)
-drag your mouse over the text, and the text changes form and colour
-scroll down, and the background moves (it's supposed to be locked)
-open it in iexplore(XP) or safari(OSX) and it seems okay
