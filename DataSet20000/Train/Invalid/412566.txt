I have a textarea defined as follows:
<textarea rows="3" cols="20" style="overflow:hidden">
</textarea>
While typing in text, when the number of rows exceeds the value of rows attribute, the textarea does not scroll.User is unable to see what he is typing in.

Reproducible: Always

<html>
	<body>
		<textarea rows="3" cols="20" style="overflow:hidden">
		</textarea>
	</body>
</html>

2. Start typing text such that the number of rows exceeds 3 ( the rows attribute)

Actual Results:  
The text area doesn't scroll. so the user is not able to see what he is typing in.

The textarea should scroll so that the user can see what he is typing. This is how it works in IE
