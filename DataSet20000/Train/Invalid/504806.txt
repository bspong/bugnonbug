When opening a new tab from a tab which uses HTTPS, the blue/green box next to the URL fails to clear on the new tab. The old URL remains in the location bar too. Both are cleared by switching from the new tab to another tab and back again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox and navigate to any page using HTTPS
2. Open a new tab using either ctrl+T or file | new tab
3. Check the location bar
Actual Results:  
The URL in the location bar and blue/green box from the HTTPS tab are still present

Expected Results:  
The URL should be cleared and the blue/green box removed

Occurred on a fresh setup of Firefox.
