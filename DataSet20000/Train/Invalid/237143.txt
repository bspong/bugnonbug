In the properties of a bookmark, under schedule, the minutes field will accept
all types of invalid characters. When returning to check this field, the value
has been saved. This occurs in all previous versions of Firebird and in the
Mozilla browser.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the schedule property of a bookmark.
2. If the 'every minuts(s)' field is inactive:
   a)choose an option other than 'Never' in the 'When' combo-box
   b)make sure a notification method (ie. Display an alert) is checked under the
     notify tab.
3. Enter a character other than an integer (ie. A,/, or even 1.5)
4. select OK
Actual Results:  
This value is accepted and saved. In turn, no update notification is given.

Expected Results:  
An error or warning message should be displayed and the value should not be saved.
