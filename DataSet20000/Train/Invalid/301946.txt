on pages that have JPEG images (my.yahoo.com), the images download but do not
render on the downloaded page, though there is an appropriate amount of white
space indicating the browser believes an image is present. right-clicking on the
image white space, and selecting "View image" enables a second window to pop up,
with the image visible.
 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. goto my.yahoo.com
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
page downloads, images appear to download, white space is visible, but no image
is displaying

Expected Results:  
display images instead of whitespace.

To ensure this is not a "system dll" related issue, I have also tested with IE
on the same machine. images display properly in IE. so the issue is related to
firefox and/or some firefox / xp interaction. I am running XP with SP 2, latest
automatic updates installed, IBM T40 1 GB RAM. 

I have windows firewall off, no antivirus/antispy software currently running.
machine has been swept for spyware and viruses.
