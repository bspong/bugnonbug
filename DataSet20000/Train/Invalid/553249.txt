Printing - multiple pages, layout wrong
I'm trying to print landscape slides in a 2x2 per landscape page format, using the builtin acrobat viewing in Firefox 3.6 (Win7). When I select that I have to select autorotate the page to get the landscape slides on the landscape page. However, the slides are misordered - the first (colourful) slide should be at the bottom left corner, not in top left, which is where the third slide should go.

In Firefox 3.0 (which I have access to on Ubuntu) this can be fixed by selecting Landscape in Portrait/Landscape radio buttons. However, these buttons are not visible on the Windows 7 dialog. Is this a regression in functionality? Well, no, because the portrait/landscape buttons are in the separate 'Print Setup...' dialog. So the task of laying out the slides right can be accomplished, but the user interface is poor and suffers cross-platform, and needs a rethink.

I wouldn't have figured it out if I didn't have access to two separate systems. 'Autorotate' needs to be a whole lot smarter, or there needs to be a way to explicitly select the start tile and how the tiles are ordered in the sheet.
