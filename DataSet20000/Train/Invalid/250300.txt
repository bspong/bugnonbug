Each time I attempt to execute FirefoxSetup-0.9.1.exe under WinXP SP2 RC2, the 
installer opens a DOS command window, reports "Program too big to fit in 
memory" and then exits without installing.

I am using a Compaq Presario 1510US notebook computer running Windows XP 
Professional recently patched with SP2 RC2 from Microsoft.  All other 
applications have been running without incident.  I have 512MB of RAM, and 
Task Manager reports 162MB of available RAM at the point of installer 
failure.  I have successfully installed Firefox 0.9.1 on other computers I 
own, including an IBM Thinkpad running Win2000 SP4, and a homebuilt Windows XP 
Professional machine, also runing SP2 RC2.
