Bookmarks slow to open at start of Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

Each time I open a new window in Firefox, when I click on Bookmarks, they last about 30 seconds to open.
My bookmarks file is 56Ko.
I have tried to uninstall and reinstall firefox. It didn't change anything.
I have tried to suppress all my bookmarks and also to suppress almost most of them: it works OK.
Should I therefore understand that 56Ko is too much for Firefox?
What is the upper limit for a quick functioning of Firefox bookmarks? (I do not have the same problem with the same bookmarks file with Internet Explorer)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start Firefox
2.click on bookmarks
3.
Actual Results:  
bookmarks very slow to open (approx. 30 seconds)

Expected Results:  
immediately open the bookmarks
