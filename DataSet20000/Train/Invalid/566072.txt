since the add ons manager (about:addons) landed, some extensions do not work anymore, they fail to load Components.classes['@mozilla.org/extensions/manager;1']
mostly to get the path of the extension.
is Components.classes['@mozilla.org/extensions/manager;1'] still available and just broken in trunk or is this a change in the api?

Reproducible: Always
