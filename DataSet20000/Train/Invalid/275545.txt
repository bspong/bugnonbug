Firefox allows any web site to install .xpi extensions if the file URL is written manually in the address bar
One of the issues listed in said blog refers to the Flashblock extension which
installs if the URL (http://mozdev.xmundo.net/flashblock/flashblock-1.2.5.xpi)
is written in the address bar although the site is not in the allowed list. This
is not related to just one extension, of course. User interaction is required,
and I couldn't figure any way to trick the browser via javascript, but who knows..
