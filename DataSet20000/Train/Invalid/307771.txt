always freezes computer when trying to view media player files - begins showing
file, but freezes after just a second or so, freezing thw whole system.  cannot
move mouse (stuck) and ctrl+alt+del does not release system.

i have loaded/reloaded IE6setup.exe a couple different times trying to eliminate
the problem - unsuccessful.  i have the 'mozilla update' as my homepage, to
download the updates for this software (media player), and this also doesn't
correct the problem.

i have encountered this with media in emails mailed to me, as well as in
mozilla.  the ONLY thing that is different is that i had just loaded mozilla as
my default browser.  the system used to work fine w/ IE as browser.  

thanks so much.
