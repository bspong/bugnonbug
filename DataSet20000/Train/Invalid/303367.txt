FireFox doesn't load linked stylesheets
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20050603 Netscape/8.0.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20050603 Netscape/8.0.2

When I include a linked stylesheet in my homepage, FireFox 1.0.6 and Netscape
8.0 won't load them. I link them with <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"
href="style.css"></link>. Research in newsgroups has yielded that the ISP hasn't
associated the correct MIME type with stylesheets. It should be noted that my
ISP runs Microsoft technology. However the problem also arises when I load the
web page from the hard disk.

Reproducible: Always
