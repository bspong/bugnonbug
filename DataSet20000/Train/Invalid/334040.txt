places-popup shown up in cycle-windows
todays 2.0 branch, on Mac OS X 10.2.8
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20060414 Firefox/2.0a1

The places-popup shows up in the list of windows - both in my windows-menu, and when I press cmd~ (which cycles thru the windows). The window doesn't have a title bar or other decoration, but works completely normal.

Bug 333863 is fixed in this build. So should be bug 329337, but it still doesn't work for me. Maybe the second one just missed the build.

I'll check tomorrow again, to see if it was just a bad or incomplete build, or there is really smtg wrong.
