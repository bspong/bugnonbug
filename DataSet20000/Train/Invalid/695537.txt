Firefox freezes for several seconds, ad related
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.7; rv:7.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0.1
Build ID: 20110928134238

Steps to reproduce:

While loading webpages, Firefox will often freeze for 10-20 seconds and give the spinning rainbow wheel (I'm on a mac).  The message in the lower-left corner says "Transferring data from ad.doubleclick.com".  This occurs on many webpages (presumably all ones that use content doubleclick.com), but does not hang up when loading content from any other web pages (ads or otherwise).  After ten to twenty seconds, it finishes/unfreezes and I may continue to browse.

This happens multiple times during a single browsing session, but does not happen more than once while loading a single web page.

I do not use any ad-blocking extensions or tools.
