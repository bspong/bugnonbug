Performance of Firefox vs Chrome on OS X
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.7; rv:11.0a1) Gecko/20111113 Firefox/11.0a1
Build ID: 20111113031758

Steps to reproduce:

I normally run the nightly builds of Firefox on a Mac Pro.  However, I've run unto enough performance issues with it lately that I decided to try Chrome.  Firefox is better in some areas, but lags significantly in others.  Note that on Firefox, I have the following custom settings in about:config.

network.http.pipelining;true
network.http.pipelining.maxrequests;100
network.http.pipelining.ssl;true
network.http.proxy.pipelining;true
nglayout.initialpaint.delay;100


Actual results:

Areas where Chrome is faster or performs better:
-Startup, especially when multiple pages are being restored.  Chrome assigns a new process to each tab, and processes them all in parallel.  Firefox tabs starve.  It can take 1-2 minutes to completely load about 10 tabs.  Chrome does it in a few seconds.
-Opening multiple tabs simultaneously.  (Open all in tabs.)  Chrome is much faster at this, for the same reason that startup with multiple tabs is faster.
-Scrolling through complex web pages, such as Engadget, is much smoother on Chrome.  Page scrolling is jittery on Firefox on complex pages.  Even more so if there are other tabs open that have video playing, or are doing something complex.
-Memory usage is significantly better on Chrome.
-Instant - Chrome pages download before you finish typing what you are looking for.
-OS X integration - Chrome properly supports Lion's full screen mode, It also supports zooming with an expand gesture (inverse pinch), and rubber banding for scrolling.  However, neither fully supports the range of gestures that Safari does.
-Dragging tabs in and out of a window works better in Chrome.

Where Firefox Nightly is better:
-Single page download and render is faster
-URL bar (awesome bar) history search algorithm is MUCH better
-Pinned tabs retain the site I've pinned
-Adblocking can block virtually all ads.  Chrome adblock can't
-Firefox interface is better


Expected results:

Changes should be made to Firefox to address the areas in which Chrome performs better.  Note that without my custom pipelining and initialpaint.delay settings, Chrome would feel significantly faster than Firefox.
