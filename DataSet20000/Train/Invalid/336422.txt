Ubuntu users reported that various of the dialogues and windows accessible from Edit / Preferences were too small for their contents.  I was able to reproduce this with a fresh profile from the Ubuntu build.

Note that Ubuntu's firefox generally uses pango for most of its font rendering, which might have an effect on the overall layout.

I have gone through all of the dialogue boxes which were insufficiently large and changed the sizes in our version, and will attach the corresponding patch to this report after I have filed it.

However, the system strikes me as fragile.  Some of the dialogue boxes have sizes in ems, at least, rather than pixels, but even then changes to the content seem not to be reliably reflected in dialogue size changes.  Surely there should be some kind of automatic sizing mechanism which would avoid these kind of problems ?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
For example, in Ubuntu 1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.2-0ubuntu1, select
 Edit / Preferences ... / Connection Settings ...
and observe that the RHS of the dialogue contents are off the RHS of the dialogue box.
