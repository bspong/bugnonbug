In the cookies options:
Allow sites to set cookies: Enabled
for the originating site only: Enabled

Exception rule:
Block *.doubleclick.net

Visit a site that will usually set cookies from doubleclick.net such as cnn.com or reuters.com, doubleclick.net cookies will be allowed. First of all, a block rule should override any other options so regardless of my other options, that cookie should not have been allowed. Secondly, it should not have been allowed from cnn.com or reuters.com as I only want to allow cookies to be set for the originating site.
