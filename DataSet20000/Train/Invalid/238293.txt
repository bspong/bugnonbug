When enabling "Block Images from …", it works with jpg format from various sites
and gif format from local site, but it doesn't always work with gif format from
other sites

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit  http://www.cnet.com/ on Firefox 0.8 browser
2. Right click on the product pictures (which are gif format by checking
property) under Search box and enable "Block Image from a.r.tv.com", which means
the picture is not local
3. Reload the page and notice these pictures are not blocked.
4. Right click on the cnet.com icon picture on the top (which is also gif
format) under Search box and enable "Block Image from cnet.com", which means the
picture is local
5. Reload the page and Notice the cnet.com icon picture is blocked, but the
product pictures are still not blocked
6. Right click on the advertisement picture (jpg format) just under the cnet.com
icon picture and enable "Block Image from i.i.com.com", which means the picture
is not local
7. Reload the page and Notice the all the pictures mentioned above are blocked,
which is strange
8. Uncheck the "Block Images" option for product pictures and verify the
corresponding images can be loaded after refreshing the page (may need move
mouse on top of these pictures to see).
Also try http://abc.go.com/ and notice "Block Image" is not so effective for gif
format.

Actual Results:  
The gif format pictures that are not from local site are not blocked correctly

Expected Results:  
The "Block Images" option should work consistently for both gif and jpg pictures.
