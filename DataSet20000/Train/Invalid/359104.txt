Firefox 2.0 and Internet Explorer conflict
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; es-ES; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; es-ES; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

I am using Comodo Firewall.

A problem was found using Firefox 2.0 navegator.
If I use Firefox 2.0 all works well.

If I open Firefox after the opening of Internet Exporer (IExplore.exe), Comodo Firewall shows this alert:

......................
Firefox is trying to act as a server. What would you like to do?

Details:
Application:  Firefox.exe.
Local: IP 127.0.0.1  Port 2056  TCP

Security considerations 

C:\Archivos de programa\Internet Explorer\IEXPLORER.EXE has tried to use the Parent application explorer.exe through OLE Automation, which can be used to hijack other applications. IEXPLORE.EXE may be using explorer.exe to conceal its behaiour in an attempt to connect to the Internet with firefox.exe

ALLOW                DENY
........................................

If I allow, I can surf with Firefox
If I deny, all the surfing is blocked in Firefox (BUT NOT WITH I. EPLORER !!)

I must close both programs and run only Firefox

I.Explorer is trying to kill Firefox ???

Thank you
