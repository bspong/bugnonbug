Middle clicking a bookmark with 'javascript:location.href' doesn't refer to the current page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10.1

See attached image.
If I click that bookmark with "javascript:location.href" in it, it gives me
wayback result (in this case) of the current address.
But if I middle click it to open in a new tab, it refers to 'about:blank'
instead of to http://update.mozilla.org/ (or whatever the current page it)

In my opinion this is a bug that should be fixed.
