Firefox stalls out in loading pages very frequently.  In most cases the bar across the bottom never completes, leaving pictures, icons and other items not loaded.  Sometimes it stalls before any of the page loads.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just try to load almost any page.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Didn't fully load page.

Expected Results:  
Should have fully loaded page.

I've uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox several times with the same result.
I have been using Seamonkey with no problem.
