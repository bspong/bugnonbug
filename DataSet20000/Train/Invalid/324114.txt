In Firefox, I see a line of boxes spanning the width of the page, just above the images. These boxes are NOT visible when viewing the page in Internet Explorer, which is as it should be. This is my website: there is nothing in the source which I can identify as causing the issue.

The same thing happens at a companion page, http://www.virtualvermont.com/towns/indgalpix.html

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View page in Firefox
2. Compare with page viewed in IE
Actual Results:  
As described

Expected Results:  
SHould have displayed the page without a line of boxes.

None
