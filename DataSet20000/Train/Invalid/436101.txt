Custom Vista Color Scheme in menus disappeared - now more difficult to read. Worse.

From the awful pale blue of the Vista default color scheme I visited http://www.aeroxp.org/board/lofiversion/index.php?f41.html a year ago and did my homework and added a few colors for myself. Been working fine ever since. Useable.
Now, I installed Firefox 3 RC1 today and the Firefox menus are back to Vista Pale Blue! Not only is it more difficult to read and to distinguish separators it looks like my girlfriends bedroom. Unuseable.
I got a dual installation with Firefox 2 and Firefox 3. Firefox 2 has retained my custom color scheme while the Firefox 3 is the problem.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox 3.
2. Use any menu.
3.
Actual Results:  
Custom Vista color scheme (that runs good in Firefox 2) has reverted to Vista default color scheme.

Expected Results:  
Custom color scheme

Made the menus more readable.
