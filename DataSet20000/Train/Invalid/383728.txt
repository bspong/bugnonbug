Create Add-Ons User Interface Guidelines

Many extensions place their own menu items in the Tools-menu (or others), very often these are then just links to the "Options"-windows of these add-ons, which should be accessed from the Add-Ons Manager.
Also, extensions behave very differently with toolbar-icons or icons in the status bar.
Some kind of User Interface Guidelines could help to unify the way how add-ons modify the Firefox UI experience.

So my suggestion is that there are UI Guidelines that can be used as a reference by Add-Ons developers.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Google Gears
2. Go to "Tools"-menu
3. See the unnecessary "Google Gears Settings"-menu-item
Actual Results:  
I see an unnecessary menu item, that shouldn't be there

Expected Results:  
the settings-menu should reside in the Add-Ons Manager
