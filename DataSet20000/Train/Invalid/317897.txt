I lost my mozilla browser completely, do not know how this happened, all I know is when I clicked on my desktop mozilla icon (as I do every day)the browser did not come up-the profile manager came up? I never saw this before so I did not understand what it was? did not know what it wanted? the next thing I realized that my original browser, bookmarks, everything was GONE?? tried to retrieve it using "start/run" did not work-tried using "search" did not work tried using firefox.ex.profilemanager--did not work? cannot find my original browser? please help me

do not understand why mozilla instructios on how get to profile manager did not work/help me? also why did the "profile manager" dialog box come up for no apparent reason, after I been using the browser fo at least 6months? and why did I loose everything and how do I get it back? I am not a tecnically proficient person so I have tried to explain exactly what happned as I experienced it.did someone/something hi-jack my browser?
