Feature request: Turn off net-nanny

Steps to reproduce:

Not playing net-nanny is way to show respect to developers. 

FF has grown into such a net-nanny. Changing config? I have to "promise I will be careful" [sic]. Checking out a forgery site? No. Only if Google allows it. Looking at a web page with old cert? I have to click on a dozillion of disclaimers that I "know what I am doing". Wanting to give my scripts more permission? NO. Can't do it. Need to consider all kinds of workarounds, extensions, greasemonkey add-ons.

FEATURE REQUEST: I want a "turn off net-nanny" mode with the semantics of "do exactly what you were ordered to, without whining, complaining, requiring promises of being careful, telling Google, throwing exceptions and refusing orders for the mere reason that someone thought it was not a good idea". It isn't exactly helpful to only think of John Doe users and piss off developers making them develop workarounds, extensions and stuff, just because Mozilla thought they should not be doing what they want to do.
