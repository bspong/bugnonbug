I use Cisco Call Manager and I am not able to load the Administration GUI
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1b1) Gecko/20081007 Firefox/3.1b1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1b1) Gecko/20081007 Firefox/3.1b1

After successfully logging in to the secure administration page I receive the following error:

Failed to create ASP object for:_RemoteScripts/rs_device.asp

This is the function to list all devices (phones, users, etc.) for the default field when the page loads.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the page. I cannot give you a link as it is an internal server.
2.Happens with FF 3.0.1 and Chrome also, FYI
3.
Actual Results:  
Error described above and no function on the page work

Expected Results:  
Functional page as with IE.

I would be willing to let someone watch my screen as I duplicate the error.
