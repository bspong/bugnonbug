Hi!

I don't know it is a fixable thing, but the Date object behaves weird.

When I create a new Date instance the year points to the right year. The day points to the right day. But the month is begin from 0.

I know it is documented, but instead of that can't you do something against it? It is difficult to compare real dates with this. Especially all websites I know stores January as the 12th month.

Thx for your time.

David
