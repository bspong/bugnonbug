Ability to get around the exception list for web sites allowed to install software

I found a way to get around the list of exceptions for web sites allowed to
install software.
See the url above.

Basically I have a PHP script like this:

$file = file_get_contents($_GET['file']);
$mime = 'application/x-xpinstall';
header("Content-Type: $mime");
echo $file;

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the test url

Actual Results:  
It won't be blocked but the confirmation dialog will come up.

Expected Results:  
You would expect the regular "To protect your computer, Browser prevented this
site from installing software..."

I'm marking this as a security bug just in case. Better safe than sorry.
