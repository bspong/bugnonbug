the Firefox browser has changed my "home" page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

My default setting for my firefox browser was :http://www.pa-legion.com/keystone_boys_state/ - which is the info in my "internet options" home page.

Tonight I got a new web page ? ?  I assume something has evaded my AVG firewall & security systems    http://templates.doteasy.com/ErrorPages/error404/

Reproducible: Always




I would like to know how to "reset" my original setting.
