Microsoft overwrites always my setting to firefoxe
I'd like to inform you about the follwing problem.
For some weeks I use your excellent program.
Unfortunately, I have a problem that also T-online.de, my provider cannot solve.
I use  the " t on-line program "  to get on the Internet. The setting for the 
browser is  firefox. However, whenever I restart the " t on-line program ", the
setting is overwritten by Microsoft and instead of firefox is put down iE.
I would know with pleasure where one can complain to such impertinent wheeling
and dealing of Microsoft? And if ther is a way to get rid of?
If you'd like to contact the biggest InterNet-provider in Germany here ther
addresses
e-mail: hotline@t-online.de  website: http://service.t-online.de

Yours sincerely, Peter Schild, Germany
