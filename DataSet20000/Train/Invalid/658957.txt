When closing a tab (which is not the last tab), width of the remaining tabs are not set correctly, which causes unused area in the tab bar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try opening many tabs (so that width of tabs equal to min-width)
2. Close one of the tabs (not the last one)

Actual Results:  
Width of the tabs are not increased after closing the tab.

Expected Results:  
Width of the tabs should be increased after closing the tab.

You should use middle click for closing the tab. The issue doesn't occur if you use Ctrl-W.

A simple workaround is to move your mouse a bit so that the tab bar is refreshed.
