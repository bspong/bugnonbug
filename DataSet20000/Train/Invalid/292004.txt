Opens but freezes and doesnt load home page.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; Media Center PC 2.8)
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.0.3

When I start up firefox, Firefox will open, but then freezes and doesnt load 
the homepage. (Wich is the firefox google page.) It does show the title of the 
page in the title bar though. Rolling over buttons will not show 
their "rollover status" however I have the googlebar installed and if I click 
the "googlebar options" button, the googlebar options box does come up. I 
cannot type urls in the addresse bar. if I press ctrl+T to open a new tab, and 
close firefox, (even though its frozen) it tells me I am about to close 2 
tabs. (like it should)

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:

type addresses in the addresse bar.

FireFox opens, loads homepage and has its full functionality.

I recently updated to 1.0.3 and updated googlebar too. although I had problems 
with googlebar and had to uninstall it then reinstall it.
