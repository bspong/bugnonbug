After some modifications of extensions (e.g. an update) some buttons from customized toolbars (and sometimes also from "Customize Toolbar" window) get lost [caused by ubufox]

When one of extensions gets updated and want to restart Firefox, after a restart I loose my buttons, RSS bookmarks etc. on personalized toolbars. After next restart of the browser, it *USUALLY* (not always) appear again. Sometimes, though, even next restart doesn't help and, moreover, buttons are not accessible via "Customize Toolbar" menu.

For example, I moved my "Bookmarks Toolbar Items" item to the menu bar (right to menu positions) so that it doesn't waste space in the screen. I also have few extensions-connected buttons (Adblock  Plus, Read It Later, Video DownloadHelper) that appears on "Navigation Toolbar". All that sometimes disappear in a manner described above.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install or update any extension to a Firefox instance having some personalized toolbars (e.g. buttons added by extensions such as Adblock Plus or "Bookmarks Toolbar Items" moved to the menu bar)
2. A button "Restart browser" will show up - click it and wait for the restart.

Actual Results:  
After the restart all those personalizations disappear; missing buttons are sometimes visible in "Customize Toolbar" window, but sometimes not.

Expected Results:  
All personalized toolbars should keep their actual state, nothing should disappear from them.

This bug might be a fault of some extension. Nevertheless, it appears after an update/installation of any extension, so I consider it to be a Firefox-general issue.
