with any site I go to, firefox stops responding for 30seconds to a minute
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.20) Gecko/20081217 Firefox/2.0.0.20 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

just like the summary says, and when it starts again it gets a bit choppy and happens again. When the update for firefox 3.0.6 came out, nothing changed, the 2.2.0 is what I am running right now to send post this and I don't know why it works better than 3.0 versions, but it ticks me off cause all my bookmarks I have backed up will not work and/ or show on 2.0 versions. And I noticed theres a secondary window open when it starts up called the XML layer, why does this open up separately, this takes resources.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start firefox 
2.just surf no real steps for this to happen to me with 3.0
3.it doesn't happen with 2.0
Actual Results:  
it stops responding over and over for 30 seconds to a minute

Expected Results:  
not stall up over and over, I know it may happen from time to time normally, but this is retarded, seriously

the backup bookmarks file should be universal, so i don't know why i can't load 3.0 bookmarks on 2.0 FIX this please.
