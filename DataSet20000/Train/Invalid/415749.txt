Firefox inner windows is resized when I opened a tab in a blank page

Strange bug.

I have "about:blank" as start page. I used ctrl + t to open a new tab, and suddenly, the window shrinked. When I opened tabs with url other than about:blank, main window returned to its starting size.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Get a young trunk build (less than 2 days old)
2.Launch it and set start page as about:blank
3.Close firefox
4 Open it and use ctrl +t
Actual Results:  
Windows resized !

Expected Results:  
Nothing about window size

I got this error in error console :

Warning: Empty string passed to getElementById().
