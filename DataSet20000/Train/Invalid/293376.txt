Hello!
I want to report some bugs in Firefox 1.0.2.
When i try to open my web page (online and offline) that can be found
online at this adress http://geocities.com/grupa413c i notice that some 
visual effects are not display correct: using css style i set the scroll
bars color to yellow, in your browser the scroll bars colors doesn't change,
also i notice that the image that are falling are not display at all, also
the page contain sound ( some mid files that are empty 0kb) the browser
want to install quick time 6.5 plugin but mid file can be play with
media player and i belive that media player plugin should be enough, to
see what i want to say view the web page using Opera 8 and using Firefox
1.0.2 and you will notice the difference (the web page is in romanian). Also
disable by default the network.prefetch function because is a huge security 
risk. I also notice that some page in the virtual domain tk are not display
, your browser don't jump to the source page.
I hope that this thing will help you in building a great browser.
Bye!

Reproducible: Always
