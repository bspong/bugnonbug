www.ogame.com.tr

I'm playing an online game. As shown above, i use this site to play. In this game there is  settings menu. At settings menu, we can choose an avatar for entire game . there some url for avatar e.g. "http://80.237.203.201/download/use/epicblue/"
If i use this url there is no problem. But if i write an adress e.g. "e:/ogame/epicblue/" , this avatar CANNOT BE LOADED for the game. 

But if i use internet explorer instead of firefox, if i write "e:/ogame/epicblue/" , avatar IS LOADED.  By loading avatar files from harddisk,   i do not download same pictures again and again for every click. so process is faster.

I looked for a solution but i couldn't find.

This game is played by maybe more than 225.000 people in Turkey. So we need help about this problem.

Thanks
