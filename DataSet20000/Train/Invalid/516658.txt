Top menu (File, Edit, View, ect) steals focus when idle for short time period

The top menu tends to steal focus at random times, and very often when I pause typing.  (For example, as I started typing this, I activated a random menu choice because the top menu stole focus).  It is most noticeable on facebook, out of various sites, since it involves entering text in fields a lot.  It is not consistently stealing focus - sometimes it steals it at a pause, other times when I am in the middle of entering a few sentences at a "normal" speed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to site that requires entry in test fields (Example: facebook, or bug entry form)
2. Attempt to enter text, pause a couple times as you might while gathering your thoughts
3. At some point, the top menu steals focus, and your keystrokes will activate a random menu item
Actual Results:  
Menu bar still stole focus (File menu item is always the one it highlights as having focus initially, until unaware keystrokes activate another menu item

Expected Results:  
The menu bar should not be stealing focus, it should remain where it is (i.e the box I am typing in) until I direct it somewhere else either via keystroke or mouse click
