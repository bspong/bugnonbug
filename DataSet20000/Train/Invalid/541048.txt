Firefox 3.5.7 UserAgent has the word "Gecko" missing
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; InfoPath.1; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; MS-RTC LM 8)
Build Identifier: Firefox 3.5.7

Firefox 3.5.7 reports UserAgent as following
  Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727

The word "Gecko" is missing from above UserAgent string and hence Firefox detection by looking for the word "Gecko" in UserAgent string fails for many implementations.

Can we please have the word "Gecko" restored in Firefox 3.5.7 UserAgent string?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on "Help->About Mozilla Firefox"
OR
1. Type Javascript:alert(navigator.userAgent) in Browser address bar and hit Carriage return

Actual Results:  
The version or UserAgent string is reported as
  "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727"

Expected Results:  
The word "Gecko" should have appeared in the UserAgent string as is done with all earlier Firefox versions

Restore the word "Gecko" in Firefox 3.5.7 UserAgent string.

In the absence of the word "Gecko" in UserAgent string, many implementations incorrectly detect the Browser as IE 7 and subsequently throw Javascript errors.
