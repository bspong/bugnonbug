[TabGroups Manager Addon] Back and forward buttons overlapping nav toolbar and Firefox Button
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

Whenever I right-click on the toolbar at the top to disable the Menu Bar, the new Firefox Button either gets overlapped by or is overlapping the back and forward buttons. In addition the search engine search box gets overlapped by the minimize, maximize, and close buttons while the browser window is maximized.

Basically, disabling different toolbars is broken.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Maximize browser window if not already maximized
2. Right-click the top toolbar.
3. Un-check Menu Bar option
Actual Results:  
Back/forward, minimize, maximize, and close buttons overlap the navigation toolbar and Firefox Button.

Expected Results:  
Correct placement of all buttons and toolbars when options are enabled or disabled.
