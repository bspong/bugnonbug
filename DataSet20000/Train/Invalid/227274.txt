H1 Header with CSS  tag not displayed correctly
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de-DE; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de-DE; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7

H1 line is displayed twice (and garbled).
I have put up a PNG file on 
http://www.exp-math.uni-essen.de/~ajung/firebird-0.7-snapshot1.png
that clearly shows what is wrong.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the referenced webpage at http://uml.sourceforge.net/handbook/
2.Watch.
3. On my system at least the heading appears twice on the same line, intermingled.
   This should not happen, but I have no idea if that really is an issue of 
FireBird...

Actual Results:  
On my system the <H1> heading appears twice on the same line, intermingled.
This should not happen, but I have no idea if that really is an issue of 
FireBird...or of font installation, or what else...

Expected Results:  
Header should be there only once, and nicely readable.
