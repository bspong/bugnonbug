Firefox and entire OS freezes after page load.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2
Build Identifier: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/

Firefox 3.5.2 and also installed the latest night build of minefield, freezes the entire OS after visiting certain pages.  The one listed from mlb.com is an example.  It has also happened on google images page.  I'm pretty sure it has something to do with certain js pages.  I've used FF for nearly 3 years and have never had a problem like this until I updated to v3.5.2 - I've also disabled all add-ons.  CTRL-ALT-DEL does not work when this happens and I must restart the PC manually.  I then always get a message stating 'This is embarassing....  with the page such as mlb.com which I need to restart a new session or it will just do it again.  Hope this helps.  I'm sure if this was a widespread issue it would have been reported by now, but just in case I've reported what's happening to me.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start FF 3.5.2 or latest nightly build
2. Visit http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/help/faq_index.jsp
3. Page loads but approx 1 sec after load FF and OS freezes.
3. FF & PC freezes - cannot get out, only with cold restart.
Actual Results:  
OS Freezes.

Expected Results:  
load page completely, without freezing :)
