In recent trunk builds (I'm pretty sure it regressed on 1-18), new tabs show the
wrong URL in the location bar.  The page is blank as expected, but rather than
having a blank location bar, it instead shows the URL from the previous tab.

Hitting reload clears the location bar.  Switching to another tab and back to it
also clears the location bar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open browser window to site (say, google.com)
2. Open new tab
3. New tab will be blank and location bar will say google.com
