Open http://bit.ly
As of right now it opens up a page with snow flakes falling from the top
CPU usage goes up to 70%, turning snow off lowers it down
While it has the same effect in Chromium I still don't think that it is OK

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://bit.ly

Actual Results:  
CPU usage goes up to 70%

Expected Results:  
CPU usage does not go to 70%
