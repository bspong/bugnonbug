Although JavaScript works on XHTML served as XML, but labeled as XHTML by both
DOCTYPE and HTTP-EQUIV, in that the DOM is correctly manipulated, elements
created are rendered as no-ops. In this instance, the <em> created might as well
be <span>.

If running locally, the JS works when the file is named *.xhtml and fails when
it is named *.xml.

Reproducible: Always
