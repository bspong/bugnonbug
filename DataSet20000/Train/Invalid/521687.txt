Disable the home page input field in the options menu when "show a blank page" and "show my windows and tabs from last time" are selected
The home page input field in the Tools->Options->General tab, when "show a blank page" and "show my windows and tabs from last time" are selected.  There is no point in having the input field writable when the preference is overridden by the above preferences anyways.

This will also fix bug 342340 by disabling the input field which should in turn possibly erase whatever was written in the input field before.
