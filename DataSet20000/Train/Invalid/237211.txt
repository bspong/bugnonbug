The following was sent to the gtk-i18n list.

Hello!
It's a small glich, but i alwasy get it if using gtk2.
Well, i compiled firefox with a gtk2 toolkit, and you can see a
screenshot http://fenixhost.com/firefox.png, as you can see there all is
ok with russian in the document, but not in the window title (codes
\x{0424} ...)

I recompiled firefox using gtk toolkit (gtk1), here is a screen shot
http://fenixhost.com/firefox-gtk1.png, as you can seee there all is ok
either in documtn body, or window title...

I'll keep searching for solution, but may be someone already solved such
trouble.

It's just a window title bug, everything else works good with russian
(bookmarks names, text etc...)
