Empty tooltip appears with all content

I see an empty tooltip popping up on all pages, including an empty one.  It looks like this might be some problem with CSS, since the tooltip disappears and reappears when I move the mouse between different elements on a page.  In addition, tooltips are not shown in places that should have them, only the empty tooltip is shown.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start FireFox,
2. Move the mouse (to let the tooltip pop up).

Actual Results:  
An empty tooltop box displayed.


Expected Results:  
No tooltip

I'm marking it as major, because normal tooltips are not shown too, making it more than just an annoyance.
