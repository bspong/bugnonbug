JavaScript Application ReferenceError: chanmenu_RebuildMenus is not defined
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; en-US; rv:1.9.3a5pre) Gecko/20100519 Minefield/3.7a5pre (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Every so often I get an alert from firefox that chanmenu_RebuildMenus is not defined. Upon closing this alert I'm alerted to the same thing once again. I need to hold alt+f4 down to close the dozens of alerts that have appeared. This has occured three times in the last 4 hours.

While it's entirely possible that this error is actually being caused by something in one of my open tabs using javascript like YouTube or something, I've never seen this error before, so it might be because of something in the latest Minefield build.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
I have no idea how I would reproduce this; I'm not even using Firefox when these errors happen. Firefox is simply running in the background while I work in other programs.
