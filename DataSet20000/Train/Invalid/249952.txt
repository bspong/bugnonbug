remove fly-over effect from expander button on non-WinXP systems
1. Bookmarks > Add to Bookmarks...
2. Notice expander button beside Create In has a black arrow.
3. Move your mouse over it.

Expected Results: arrow remains black

Actual Results: arrow changes to grey or blue or something, looking kind of like
it's disabled.

This is a push button, not a fly-over button.  Nothing should happen when you
mouse over a push button.  Otherwise we'd be changing the text color of OK and
Cancel as well.  I experience this on my Win2K machine.  The fly-over effect is
fine on my WinXP machine, as it's in line with all other buttons.
