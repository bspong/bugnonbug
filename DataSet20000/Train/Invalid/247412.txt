when firefox is running as root, other users on the same display can gain root privileges
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i586; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040617 Firefox/0.9

If you start firefox as a normal user and root is already running a firefox
instance, the firefox started by the normal user gains root privileges. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. open an X terminal as normal user
2. type su and login as root
3. start firefox 0.9 as root
4. open another terminal
5. start firefox as normal user

Actual Results:  
firefox can read/write with root privileges although startet as normal user.

Expected Results:  
firefox should start a new instance of firefox instead of attaching to the
currently running root firefox process.

firefox should never be run as root, but it is much easier to install global
search engines and themes as root. When run as root, another (bad) user could
use this bug to gain root access and to compromise the system.
