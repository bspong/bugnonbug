Failure to display .gif in simple web page; fine with direct URL to image
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648)

Using the simplist web page I can write, Firefox is failing to display an image in a simple <img>.  Firefox will display the image fine if the src= value from the image is placed in the Firefox URL box, so the image itself appears fine.  Its only when used in an HTML page that firefox fails to display it, although it does sometimes flash as if it were drawing then erasing it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load http://www.ipdb.org/firefox_error.html or use this simple HTML:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
<html>
<head><title>Test</title></head>
<body>
<img src="http://www.ipdb.org/images/531/Advertisement.gif" alt="Image">
</body>
</html>

Actual Results:  
432x310 pixel 89a gif Image is missing.  No errors reported by Firefox.  Nothing else unusual happened.  Nothing crashed.  Simply no way to view the image.  Converting the .gif to a .jpg with ImageMagick results in the same behavior.


Expected Results:  
The 430x310 image does not appear on the page.

Display the image.

Displaying the URL to the image directly in Firefox and it shows the image, so it seems to be able to successfully decode the image file.
