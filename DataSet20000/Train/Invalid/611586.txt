Enhance location bar hover-on link with displaying only the diff
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:2.0b7) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b7

It would be very nice if the new feature about hover-on link, would be "smarter" and compare the target URL with the current URL displaying only the difference.

So you could expect something like:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla > .../Mozilla_Firefox 

That's if you are in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla and want to navigate to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Firefox

Also ultimately it would be good if the different part of the url replaces part of the old url and gets highlighted. (I can provide some UI mockups on that)

In case the URL is completely different (left aside the protocol side http:// etc.) it could fall back to the present functionality.

Reproducible: Always
