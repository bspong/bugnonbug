While attempting to use Firefox I found that all of the favorites from IE were not available.  After attempting to update the bookmark I installed the latest version of Foxfire.  I followed the instructions to update the bookmarks list, first exporting from IE the importing into Foxfire.  Did I do something wrong or is there a glitch in Foxfire?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.export IE favorites into HTML file in documents folder
2.import into Foxfire identifying correct file
3.Check bookmarks for complete list
Actual Results:  
some of the items are in the bookmarks.  I did not see any change in the list of bookmarks at any point in the attempts to update

Expected Results:  
All the favorites from IE would be in Foxfire Bookmarks
