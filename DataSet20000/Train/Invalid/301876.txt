I've installed the lastest Version of Mozilla 2X now and each time my Scroll 
bar is Erratic. it skids like on Ice. I'm not installing the new version again 
until i know for sure its fixed. I had to use system restore each time to get 
back to the older version. Someone needs to look into this---Rick

Reproducible: Always
