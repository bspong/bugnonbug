Hello,

The majority of times I close firefox and start it up again I find I have been signed out of iGoogle, even though i have told it to remember me. Sometimes it does remember me, however. 

atm I accept all cookies until I close firefox but I have made an exception to always remember google cookies. 

This problem has happened to me for ages, even with firefox2. Also, my mate has the same trouble.

Thanks!

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to igoogle http://google.com/ig
2. sign in and click the 'remember me' box
3. close firefox, open it again, go back to igoogle and you might have been signed out
Actual Results:  
sometimes i find that google hasn't remembered me

Expected Results:  
google should remember me ALWAYS!
