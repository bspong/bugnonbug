I disabled IE but Firefox is also disabled
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

I disabled IE by using a proxy and setting the address as 0.0.0.0 and it not only disabled IE but also Firefox. I tried to use the turn off windows feature settings in control panel but darn if ol' IE still managed to sneak out to a few sites! How can I disable IE without shutting off Firefox? 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.disable IE
2.Then Firefox also gets disabled
3.
Actual Results:  
Had to to enable IE so I could use Firefox....this really sucks.

Expected Results:  
Use Firefox without having IE enabled
