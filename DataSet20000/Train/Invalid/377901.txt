I have 4 dictionariees but I can't select any of them once I right click on the field
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3

I have installed PT, ES, FR and US dictionaries in my Firefox 2.0.0.3 but I can't select any of them in Firefox anymore, every time I right click I see "Languages" but I only get "Add Dictionaries"

I created a new profile but I'm not able to choose which dictionary I want to use either.

I used ChatZilla in order to know if someone could help me and I was able to select the dictionary I want and once I select the dictionary I want the spell checker works fine but if I want to change it again I can't.
