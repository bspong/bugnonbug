Firefox is in English but google.com comes up in Spanish on Firefox and Safari
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080201 Firefox/2.0.0.12

I enter http://en-US.start2.mozilla.com/firefox?client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official
as my homepage on mozilla
What comes up every time is http://www.google.es/firefox?client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official
entirely in Spanish
Same is true for Safari, BUT Internet Explorer is OK for google, so problem seems to be with Mozilla.
Internet provider, EMBARQ, also says problem is with Mozilla

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Empty all cache and reset modem and choose "English" as preferred language under options
2.Enter www.google.com on Mozilla or Safari homepage
3.
Actual Results:  
Google home page comes up in Spanish

Expected Results:  
Google should be in English. 



We have re-booted, flushed all cookies, flushed all cache, re-booted DSL modem, re-booted router, called EMBARQ, our internet provider.
Nothing fixes this.
