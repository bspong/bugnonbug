After using Mozilla for a while pages stop rendering properly

I often browse online for hours at a time.  I'm working on my website, doing research for it or something.  After many hours (say 5 or so) or if I happen to leave Firefox open overnight, pages stop rendering.  Eventually all pages show up blank, though the status bar reports "Done."  It 'feels' like a resource leak of some kind.  For instance, I can stave it off by, if I have many windows or tabs open, closing a few of them.  Then the remaining tabs/windows will render properly for a while, but eventually they too begin to show the same behavior.  I can empty the cache, and that will stave it off for a little longer, but eventually, I have only one window left and I've just cleared the cache, and even that window shows a blank page and "Done."  If I restart Firefox, it doesn't help.  However, I do not need to restart the computer.  Oddly, all I have to do is log myself out, and then log in again, and the leaky resources have been reclaimed, and all is well and good again, until it starts to happen again.  Anyone ever seen "The Never-Ending Story?"  I feel like I'm fighting the  "Nothing"

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Firefox under my configuration for many hours, or maybe just browse to thousands of different web pages.
2. See what happens

Actual Results:  
Pages no longer render properly.  Fonts, Forms, tables, panel appear wrongly, often as if the browser no longer supported them, or can't allocate the resources it needs to render them properly.  Eventually nothing renders and all pages are displayed as blank.

Expected Results:  
It should just keep rendering pages properly as it did when I first logged in.
