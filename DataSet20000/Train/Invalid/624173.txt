There is an issue with Firebug add-on (maybe works with other add-ons too).
When a password is saved or typed into the password field on some webpage this add-on can show it very easily. You just select the password or find it in the Firebug HTML section then delete the "password" type at field option. And voilà - the password is shown. 

Better security of saved passwords is needed!

1.Select a password field
2.Right-click it
3.Choose the Firebug option
4.Delete ="password" at type
5.Confirm
Actual Results:

Shouldn't allow user to do this.
