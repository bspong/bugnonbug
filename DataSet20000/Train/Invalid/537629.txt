If i have the Google-Toolbar installed my form inputs are saved in history but will never show. ALso if Auto-Fill-Option in the Google-Toolbar is disabled. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Google Toolbar
2. Insert something in a form field

Nothing. FF doesnt show saved form entrys. In example, if i have entered "1122", it is saved as this. Then i open a similar form site or the same form again.

Firefox should now show me "1122" if i enter the first "1".
