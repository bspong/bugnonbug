Private browsing is tagged, this will untag the "remember" tags, but the "accept cookies from sites" stays tagged. 

This will give the idea that cookies are accepted, but they are not. In that case the tag should be untagged in the same way with the "remember" tags. If I'm on Google I gets a warning, but the tag for accepting cookies is on, also the tag for private browsing is on. 

Now you can say private is private, but there are a lot of things handled with that private. Cookies and passwords might still be needed during browsing and it should ask if I want to set the cookie just for the time I visit the site. Same for password. When you go to another site, by link or by typing in an other url then your back again in private browsing. Now you have to go back to your options page in order to set or reset private browsing. 

Solution might be to add a few new tags in private browsing option which will deal with cookies and passwords.
