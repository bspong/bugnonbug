browser.send_pings: setting to false does not work! FFox continues to connect to adresses like fxx-in-fxxx.google.com. I dont want this! (Phishing Protection confusion)

While sniffing my Ethernet-Connections I realized several strange connections to servers like fxx-in-fxxx.google.com f. ex. "fk-inf147.google.com". Searching for an explanation I learned, that this is a new "feature" of firefox and thunderbird. As recommended in MozillaZine and elsewhere this "feature" could be turned off by editing the browser.send_pings variable via about:config and set it to false. 
I did that. But even after a restart FFox continues connecting to these strange google-servers.
What went worng? Are there more things to do for turnig off the "ping-feature". Why is there no possibility to turn it off via the preference-dialogues? I find this new "feature" annoying. Please default it to off!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. edit about:config, add a new Boolean value "browser.send_pings" and set it to false
2. close firefox and reboot Computer
3. Open Firefox and the browser is still connecting to fxx-in-fxxx.google.com: Annoying! Isnt it?
Actual Results:  
The browser is still connecting to fxx-in-fxxx.google.com: Annoying! Isnt it?

Expected Results:  
The browser must not connect to google.com!
