Cannot launch multiple instances of firefox. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox
2. Attempt to launch another instance of it
3. Nothing happens
Actual Results:  
A second instance of firefox was not launched


This is coupled with an earlier unresolved bug I reported where exiting firefox leaves firefox.exe in memory, thereby precluding the launch of firefox until the firefox.exe instance in memory is deleted by using task manager.
