Cursor jumps from find box while searching

Whenever I use the 'find' feature (Ctrl+F) to search for a particular string on a webpage, the cursor moves out of the find text box midway as I type my word. As a result of this the 'find as you type' feature becomes ineffective. Also, I have to click in the box again to modify/change the word I was typing. I have tested find on other browsers (Chrome, IE) but this issue seems exclusive to Firefox 4. The issue happened after I updated to firefox 4.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a webpage for ex. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Kill_a_Mockingbird
2. Ctrl+F to open search bard
3. type in any string for ex. "depression"

Actual Results:  
The cursor moves out of the search box midway as I type the string to match, rendering the search futile. Have to click in the box again and finish the word to continue.

Expected Results:  
Should allow me to complete writing the word and keep the cursor in the search box even when i click enter and search for the string
