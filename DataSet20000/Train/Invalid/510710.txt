Blue screen and firefox defect after restart
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2

Blue screen when I selected the URL above. After the restart of the PC I could not start Firefox anymore, even not after running deinstall and install.
I had to delete one of these generated files (compreg.dat or xpti.dat)to be able to start.  I was always able to use Firefox from another user account.

Reproducible: Didn't try



Expected Results:  
- no bluescreen
- recovery from damaged .dat files by uninstall / install
