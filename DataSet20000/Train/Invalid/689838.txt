ESC doesn't exit full screen using the full screen api in the new nightly build
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:9.0a1) Gecko/20110927 Firefox/9.0a1
Build ID: 20110927030845

Steps to reproduce:

Firefox 9.0 doesn't properly allow a user to exit a full screen triggered by invoking the full-screen api using "ESC" key, thus enabling spoofing attack.
Step to reproduce the bug.
1. goto www.sierramellon.info
2. click full-screen (invoking full-screen api on a div element and navigate to a new page)
3. click submit (invoking full-screen api on a div element again and navigate to a spoofing page)
4. Pressing ESC doesn't help for exiting the BSOD page.

The purpose of using mytest.html to transition is to distract user from noticing the animation of menu bar disappearing when entering full-screen. In this case, a user might not notice he/she is already in full-screen and spoofing attack later is possible.

Actual results:

Pressing ESC doesn't exit the full-screen page triggered previously by the full-screen api


Expected results:

Pressing ESC should exit full screen if it was triggered by a full-screen api.
