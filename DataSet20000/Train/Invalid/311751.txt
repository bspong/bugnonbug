The browser doesnt respond to the address to which I would like to go.

The browser doesnt respond to the address to which I would like to go. For eg,
currently Iam in Japan & I typed  - www.google.com & it takes me to -
http://www.google.co.jp/-because it detects my service provider. Thats fine. 
But I would like to go - www.google.com  - & although I click - Google.com in
English- Firefox is adamant enough not to take me there.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type - www.google.com
2. Assuming you are in the local domain of google - say you are in Japan -the
page  automatically goes to - .jp
3. Now try going to the standard - www.google.com - & It doesnt respond.
4. In fact typing any other domain like - www.google.co.in - works - but not the
 standalone - .com - domain

Actual Results:  
Assuming you are in the local domain of google - say you are in Japan -the page
 automatically goes to - .jp

Expected Results:  
1. Its fine with step 2 above
2. But when I perform my step 3, It should behave as per my request.

Iam not sure if this can be classified a normal,minor or cosmetic but it
sometimes annoys :-)
