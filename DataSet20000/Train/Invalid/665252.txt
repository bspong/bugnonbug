When clicking on a web from combobox, nothing shows up.
This makes it impossible to access any such options stored in a combobox.
This happens for every combobox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a website with comboxes
2. Click on the combobox
3. Nothing happens

Actual Results:  
No combox menu appears

Expected Results:  
The combobox menu should appear

This happens with every style of GTK widgets. Also, I'm using KDE if that makes any difference.
