On certain websites where pop up windows occur, when trying to close the pop up window, Firefox 4 pops up with the message, "You are about to close X tabs, do you want to continue? Ok or Cancel?"

This was not a problem with Firefox 3 but since installing Firefox 4 it happens all the time.

3. Press cancel in the message window to continue browsing
