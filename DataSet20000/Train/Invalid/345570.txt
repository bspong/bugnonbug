The script, which show actualized blogs, causes  that cpu runs at 100% and  slow the system.

I tested it in LFS and ubuntu. It happens since firefox 1.5 to 2.0b1. In firefox 1.0 doesn't happen.

Maybe it affect to other pages.

I tested it with -safe-mode without any extension.

On windows runs correctly.

1.Open http://blogger.com



Actual Results:  
Firefox consume 100% cpu

Expected Results:
