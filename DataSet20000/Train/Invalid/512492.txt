The memory of the firefox main window isn't freed when the downloads window keeps opened

Last day I was googleing to find some files to download. When I found them, I began to download them. I then closed the firefox main window and kept the downloads window opened, so these files were downloading. I realised in the gnome system monitor that the firefox process was using 200 MiB of memory only on the downloads window, so I thought the memory related to the firefox main window or the visited pages was not freed.

It's an important fault in performance in my opinion. In my case most of the 200 Mib were on the swap memory, so the system was doing a lot of disk accesses and was very slow while downloading these files.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
The memory related to the firefox main window or the visited pages is not freed when you exit from the firefox main window and you keep the downloads window opened.

Expected Results:  
The memory related to the firefox main window and the visited pages has to be freed when you exit from the firefox main window and you keep the downloads window opened.

I was using Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty 64 bits and Firefox 3.0.13.
I don't know if that occurs in other OS and/or architectures.
