toolbarbuttons not vertically centered on Add-on Bar (addon-bar)
I am updating one of our extensions to work better with 4.0b7.  Part of the work is to use the Add-on Bar.  Items such as toolbarbuttons are not vertically centered like they are on other toolbars.

Adding style="-moz-box-align: center; -moz-box-pack: end" to the addon-bar element seems to fix the problem, at least on Mac OS.
