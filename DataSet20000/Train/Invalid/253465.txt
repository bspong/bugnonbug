CSS and Classes - Firefox doesn't recognise classes.

I create classes within my style sheet and the browser fails to recognise them.
 Instead it applies the formatting to each instance.  In the above example, I
use nested tables and only want to have the border (with no top) to appear for
the outermost table.  It works fine in IE.  Firefox should be able to recognise
different classes as it's such a handy design tool.
