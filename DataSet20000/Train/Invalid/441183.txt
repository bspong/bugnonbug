between words, spaces become replaced with "%2B" from the toolbar search field to metacrawler's search page

I use metacrawler.com's search engine as my mini search toolbar with Mozilla.  Until a few days ago, I would type a string of words to search, using the search toolbar, and the words would stay intact, with the search being successful.  Now, when I type in two or more words, the spaces are replaced with "%2B" at metacrawler's web page.  Weird and annoying.  Data doesn't transfer from the search toolbar to the web page.
Please help.
Thank you!


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.type in two or more words (such as "west coast") in search toolbar, using metacrawler.com as toolbar's search engine
2."west coast" becomes "west%2Bcoast" and throws off the search, every time
3.
Actual Results:  
"tiny tim" becomes "tiny%2Btim"  and the search results are strange...

Expected Results:  
"john wayne" would come back as "john wayne", not "john%2Bwayne"
