Pidgin conflicts with Google Video Talk / Chat Plugin (plugin appears uninstalled)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.3a1pre) Gecko/20091203 Minefield/3.7a1pre

With pidgin installed and logged into google talk, firefox becomes unable to use the video chat plugin.  This problem does not happen with google chrome, so it is at least part firefox's fault (or possibly the plugin itself, so I will list this bug directly on google, and link back.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.log into google talk via pidgin
2.log into gmail
3.attempt to use google video chat
Actual Results:  
it appears as uninstalled and does not allow video chat functionality

Expected Results:  
it ought to allow video chat.
