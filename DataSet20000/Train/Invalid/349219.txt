Over at the MozillaZine forums there has been quite a bit of whining about how terrible the new tabstrip looks. A lot of the problems are simply glitches, but I believe there's one major problem as well.

Previously, inactive tabs were darker and closer to the style of the mockups at the wiki page (http://wiki.mozilla.org/FX2_Visual_Update/Default_Theme_Update). However, some said this decreased the readability of the text (as the text was made transparent as well as the tab itself). However, the new, lighter versions also look uglier. I feel a good compromise between the two would be to decrease the opacity of the background tabs but to increase that of the text in the tabs, so that it is readable. This is, in fact, what is depicted in the original mockups, and looks very nice.
