Don't want SESSION RESTORE thank you. If a website freezes and I have to reboot, FF insists on trying to restore and locks up again. It should ask "I can try to restore - would you like me to?", then I could say "NO - I just want a clean browser session".

I don't know why, (I've never seen this in older versions of FF). But recently I've had a few lock-ups with one or several websites. This may be the website server, or maybe a temporary glitch with the ISP. However, if I reboot and try again later (or the next day), Firefox seems to think it has a restore option for me, and automatically assumes that I want it. Well, I don't !! The result is that FF attempts to re-open 2 or 3 browsers with maybe 10 active tabs, and at least one of the tabs locks up and jams the PC. It should be very simple - if FF thinks it has a session rstore capability, it should ask me and accept the fact that I'm going to say "NO - give me just one, fresh, new browser with just one tab. I don't want anything else. Please don't assume that I want anything else. I will tell you the URl of where I want to goto when I'm ready". Instead, it locks the PC and after a battle and rebooting maybe twice or three times it finally says that it is embarassed.

Can't reproduce it, but it has happened at least half a dozen times or more and is very annoying.
