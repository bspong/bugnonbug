large increase in number of FF 3.0.10 crashes after 10.5.7 update
After Apple released 10.5.7 around May 12, 2009, there's been a large increase in the number of FF 3.0.10 mac crashes.  The URL link shows the number of catch-all objc_msgSend crashes, the top mac crasher, by OS version.  Note the strange spike in 10.5.6 crashes and the steady rise of 10.5.7 crashes while other versions seem relatively constant.

Overall summary

The first sheet contains the overview, the other sheets a breakdown for objc_msgSend crashes which shot up to over 9000 last week.  The rate of Flash_EnforceLocalSecurity crashes more than tripled from the week before.  The chart is a bit hard to read in the published version, so here's a better screenshot:

Note: the 500 maximum is probably an artifact of a crash reporter limit, my guess is these numbers are probably higher.

This is based on pulling down crash reports for the last 30 days and analyzing the stack crawls.  This is just for objc_msgSend crashes.

There seems to be a lot of problems when printing, especially for folks using Canon printers.  But the rate of other bugs seems to have increased also which makes me suspect there's some sort of memory corruption problem that Apple introduced with this update.

My guess is that this is an Apple-related problem but I logged this just in case there's something we need to do to ameliorate the problem.
