SVG Filters appear outright ineffective on HTML content in HTML documents, but work just dandy in XHTML documents.  Perhaps this was reported, though search left me dry.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create index.xhtml, a page that demonstrates SVG Filters on HTML content
2. Run your page
3. Change the file name to index.html
4. Run the page again
5. SVG Filters will be totally ineffective on HTML content
Actual Results:  
SVG Filters do not work on HTML content

Expected Results:  
Blurs, masks, all of that extremely good stuff
