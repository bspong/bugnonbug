spontaneously crashing entire system
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1b4) Gecko/20090427 Fedora/3.5-0.20.beta4.fc11 Firefox/3.5b4

On any site, at (seemingly) random times, Firefox entirely crashes the system. I need to forcefully turn of my PC (by holding in the power button for several seconds) then restart it.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Fedora 11 with Firefox 3.5 Beta 4.
2. Browse any sites.
Actual Results:  
Firefox makes the system completely unresponsive. I cannot Ctrl+Alt+F* to a console. Most times the monitor ceases to get a signal. Any sounds playing (independent of Firefox) stop soon after.

Expected Results:  
Firefox keeps running.

This has happened on multiple sites, usually when a tab is loading. However, once it occurred without any tabs loading in the background.
The only plugin installed is Gnash, but I do not think any sites use it when the bug occurs. I will uninstall it and see if I can reproduce the bug.
I have tried creating a new profile without any extensions and using that. It still happened.
I use the Default theme with the Gtk-Qt engine. I will try running without it.
I use a Radeon 9100 video card with Xserver 1.6.
