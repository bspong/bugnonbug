Upgrading to Firefox 3.6 added automatically many versions of the Java Console addon

I upgraded from FF 3.5.7 to 3.6 yesterday.

After the upgrade, I saw in the Addon Manager Pane that many versions (3 in my case) of the Java Console addon have been installed automatically during the upgrade.

I think it's this addon on AMO: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5403

I have never installed this addon even if the Java (TM) Platform plugin is installed in my profile.

My profile is 2 years old and I remember I have installed only 2 or 3 versions of the Java plugin (SE 6 U 10 & SE 6 U 13, maybe SE 6 U 11).

So I suspect the upgrade to Firefox 3.6 has installed as many Java Console addons as Java plugins are or have been installed (maybe by finding some remains of uninstalled versions of the Java plugin).

Other users met the same issue with a various number of instances of the Java Console addon (like 6 or 8).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the Java plugin (1 or 2 versions like SE 6 U 10 or SE 6 U 13) on FF 3.5.7
2. Upgrade to FF 3.6

Actual Results:  
Many versions of the Java Console addon are automatically installed after the upgrade.

Expected Results:  
No automatic install of the Java Console addon.
