When a term is entered into the location bar, just append ".com" to it instead of doing an "I'm Feeling Lucky" search

Hello,

Would it be possible for you guys to make my favourite browser add ".com" extension to any word entered in the search bar instead of transferring user to the "Google - I'm feeling lucke" website?

It is so annoying to see some irrelevant website that somehow got onto first place in Google.

Please take a closer look at the problem.

Thank you in advance!

Reproducible: Always
