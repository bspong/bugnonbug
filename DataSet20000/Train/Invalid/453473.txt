Since downloading Firefox 3, I'm having a new problem.

The screen lights up with "Firefox is in the off-line mode", and then says to go to the on-line mode, without telling me how to do it.

This is particularly annoying when it happens while I'm already on the net.  Then I have to go back and reconstitute the whole thing again.
