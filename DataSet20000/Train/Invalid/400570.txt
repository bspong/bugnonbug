Was working fine until today when I noticed a window that said that a new version of Firefox was installed, and it prompted me to restart Firefox, which I did. Now it crashes whenever I click on a link or type in a url. I didn't ask for a new version and I don't like that I have no choice in the matter. THAT IS TOTALLY WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!     

YOU NEED TO HAVE SOMEBODY TELL ME HOW TO PUT THINGS BACK AS THEY WERE. I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS!!!!!!!!!

STOP MESSING WITH MY COMPUTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

IT HAS TAKEN SEVERAL TRIES TO SEND THIS BUG REPORT. THIS IS BEYOND A BUG. 

I AM NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO TAKING THE TIME TO INSTALL A DIFFERENT BROWSER BUT I GUESS I HAVE NO CHOICE. WHY DID YOU DO THIS???????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
