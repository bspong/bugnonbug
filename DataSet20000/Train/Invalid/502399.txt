While browsing digg.com SkipScreen extension began showing some potentially dangerous behaviour.  The extension triggered an alert('Howdy'); combined with a pop-in requesting feedback.  Annoying as this was, the behaviour of the alert('howdy') was the most concerning.  It reported the alert in the title as being ->from<- the site I was currently on instead of from the extension.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install SkipScreen
2. Navigate through a paged archive (ie: digg.com) until it triggers alert('howdy')
3. Observe title of dialog box
Actual Results:  
site title appears

Expected Results:  
Addon Title appears
