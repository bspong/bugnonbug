Adaptive learning matches on removed/deleted tags.  (adaptive matching overrides tags).

Adaptive learning remembers and matches the pages that do not match the strings anymore. This makes temporary tags useless after some time of a profile usage.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Tag some (preferably 6-10 or more) pages with a tag not present in the URLs or titles.
Visit those pages many times, so they have a high frecency. All or some of them should have the highest frecency among all of the places throughout the whole test.
2. Tag some more pages with that tag. The sum should be (or you can just imagine that it is) higher than the number of entries in the autocomplete dropdown list.
3. Remove the tag from some or all of the places from step 1. The untagged places should have high frecency, and there should be enough of them for step 2.
4. Enter the tag into the Location bar to get suggestions.

Actual results:
Few or none of the pages that are still tagged are displayed; the list is full of adaptive results that had been tagged before, but are not anymore, because of frecency.

Expected results:
All (or however many can fit) of the pages currently tagged with the tag should be at the top of the suggestion list.
Pages that do not match on anything but the adaptive memory should be underneath or not appear in the list at all.
