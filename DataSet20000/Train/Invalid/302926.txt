Middle-click to open link in tab works sporadically after upgrade to 1.0.6
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

On most sites, after upgrading to 1.0.6, middle-clicking a link to open a new
tab doesn't work at all. Tabs can still be opened for links by right-clicking
and selecting "Open in new tab".

This problem also exists on Linux builds.

A workaround for it seems to be to delete your profile and start again from
scratch, but IMO that isn't acceptable.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Upgrade to 1.0.6 from a previous version (<=1.0.4 in my case)
2. Choose a website, (examples that work for me are Slashdot and deviantart.com
3. Try to open links in tabs by middle-clicking link.

Actual Results:  
Tabs do not open.

Expected Results:  
Tabs open as usual (prior 1.0.4 at least...)
