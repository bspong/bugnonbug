undo close tab then the browser will start to load the content, before beginning
of loading the content(when the page is grey!not white), middle click mouse
inside the page to show the compass(for scrolling by moving). The compass will
never disappear, & when u open every new tab the compass(/es) will shown before
the new tab shown. By repeating this, there would be many compasses stay there(
each one can react to mouse hover(when u do this by middle clicking near the tab
bar ,the tab will be covered by half of the compass permanently)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open some page with a lot of contents
2.close the tab
3.clean the history(in order to have enough time to middle click while loading
the page)
4.middle click in the tab bar in order to reopen the closed tab(my mouse gesture)
5.u must be fast enough in this step, after middle click the new tab would be
grey for a soon while, then middle click again not in tab bar, in the grey
page), the compass would be shown. if u middle click near the tab bar, the
compass will cover some part of the tab bar.
6.create a new tab
7.u have to pay attention, the compass will be shown when the new tab is
grey(not white).
8. If u made one compass cover the tab bar, u can switch ur tab, the compass
will be still there! if u have ur mouse hovers the compass the compass can be
highlighted.
9. If u do the above with the compass over an image(inside the new open closed
tab), then u can see the compass's background is the grey colour not transparent
again.





Expected Results:  
disable the mouse compass function when the page is still grey not ready to load
pages. Then there will be no more this bug.
