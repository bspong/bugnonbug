The Tab froze all the open Firefox browser window after I opened twitter.com while scrolling the page down with arrow keys on keyboard which made the page and other open windows freeze.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install grease monkey script - troy's twitter script
2.Open twitter.com (login and go to Home(header link)
3.Scroll till the end of the page. Wait. try scrolling with the arrow keys
Actual Results:  
The above steps were performed exactly after Firefox 3.1 beta 3 was installed on Windows Vista. The browser window froze for 40 seconds to 1 minute and came back to its initial state

Expected Results:  
Not frozen the windows instead, only the tab should had been frozen for other tabs/ open windows to keep running independantly on their own
