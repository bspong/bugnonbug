following installation, after first reboot, firefox thread loads but no form is visible.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: 0.9.0.0

upon clicking the .exe, the computer spends a little time hourglassing then... 
nothing. doing a cntrl-alt-del i can see it's thread in processes, although no 
where to be seen in applications and there is no form visible on the desktop. 
I installed mozilla just to make sure my computer wasnt being a freak. mozilla 
works like a champ. i tried running the ziped version which incedentally is .8 
instead of .9 and the same problem arises.
