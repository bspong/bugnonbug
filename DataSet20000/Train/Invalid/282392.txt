I have been a happy firefox user for years when my company bought me a notebook
computer with a P4 hyperthreading processor. I installed windows xp sp2 on it,
and firefox after that. It freezes randomly. If i set its cpu affinity to just
one processor using the task manager, firefox works fine.
On the same computer firefox works fine under Linux.
