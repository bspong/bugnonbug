updating to 1.5.0.2 causes dial up user to have all connections refused
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

When I updated to the 1.5.0.2 firefox no longer will work at all. Using the update tool gives the best clue (AUS: Connection Refused) Any webpage attempted to go to displays the could not connect to server message.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Update from 1.5 to 1.5.0.2 using PeoplePC dialup internet (Either from the installer or using the update tool - I tried both)
2.Open Firefox
3.Experience symptoms as described

Actual Results:  
No webpage can be displayed

Expected Results:  
It should work like 1.5 or 1.5.0.1 with security updated

I have PeoplePC dial up and a shared internet over a small LAN (two computers)
