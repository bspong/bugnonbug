version 3.0.2 Multiresource client addon won't start

We use an addon from ITS called the Multiresource client. This provides authenticated access to a number of databases that we subscribe to.  In version 3.0.2 this addon refuses to run even though it appears as enabled on the list of Addons.  
I reported a similar problem to this concerning version 2.0.0.16 (#445723) and I notice that it now runs properly in version 2.0.0.17. This addon also worked in version 3.0.1. But it seems to be broken in version 3.0.2.

I can provide an example of the addon and temporary access to our system if you want to reproduce this.
