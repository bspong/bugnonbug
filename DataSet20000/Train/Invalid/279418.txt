eTrust Antivirus log viewer does not work with browser open
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

After I did an antivirus scan I pulled up Mozilla Firefox. I then relized that I
did not view the log and pulled the antivirus back up and it froze when I tried
clicking into the log viewer. I then closed the browser and did another virus
scan and found an open error (that's what eTrust called it). The pathway is:
C:\Windows\ApplicationData/Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\7o7u3n57.default\parent.lock

I tried doing this 3 times and froze all the times.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Mozilla Firefox
2. Launch eTrust Antivirus
3. Go into Log Viewer


Actual Results:  
It freezes everytime and I have to exit the program with Control+Alt+Delete. The
program then says Not Responding and I have to end the task.

Expected Results:  
I was expecting the product to let me view the log viewer.
