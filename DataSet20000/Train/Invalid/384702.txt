Closing last window causes Firefox to Quit.

I've got two Mac OSX 10.4.9 systems, both are Intel-based Core Duo.  Both have the same revision/release of Firefox 2.0.0.4.  And Firefox's Preferences are identical on both machines.  Yet when I close the last window on one system, Firefox automatically Quits.  On the other system, Firefox remains an active App and I can open a New window and continue.  There are no Preference settings that I can find that say things like "Quit on close of last window".  Yet that is what happens on ONE machine, not both.  Very strange.  Any ideas?


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch Firefox
2.Close the blank window
3.
Actual Results:  
One one machine, Firefox quits.

Expected Results:  
On the other machine, Firefox remains active.

I'm set to start with "about:blank" if that makes any difference, but that's true on both machines.

I classified this as Minor, since I can re-launch Firefox to get going again.
