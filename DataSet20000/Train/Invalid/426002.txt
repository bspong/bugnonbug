tools > options > content > advanced (to the right of Javascript)

At this point the "advanced" window is modal, as you can't select anything in the previous options window. This is expected and consistent.

Clicking "exceptions" raises a new dialog (over the "advanced" dialog), and this may be an issue but I'm not sure of the intended functionality, but the "exceptions" dialog is not modal. You can close the advanced options and continue on setting other options, although the exceptions dialog remains in the foreground until you close it. That part isn't so bad though.

The worse part is when you choose to close the exceptions dialog, it focuses the main options panel, and 'forgets' about the advanced dialog is open. Unless you moved it, the advanced options are now hidden beneath the main options panel. Also, at this point you're free to repeat this process: click advanced > exceptions, close exceptions, now you have 2 orphaned advanced window dialogs open. The main options panel will not let you ok/cancel until these are closed, as expected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open: tools > options > content
2. open: advanced (to the right of Javascript)
3. open: exceptions
2. close: exceptions 
3. GOTO 2
Actual Results:  
orphaned "advanced" Javascript menu(s)

Expected Results:  
the "advanced" Javascript menu should be modal4lyfe, not broken by the "exceptions" button.

This feature is not present in FF 2.x.
