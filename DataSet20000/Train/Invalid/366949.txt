When unread tabs are styled individually, they lose that style when any tab is moved (not necessarily an unread tab).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Apply the styles described at http://kb.mozillazine.org/Change_the_style_of_tab_markers or install an extension like ColoUnREaDTabs (available at https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/3645).
2. Make sure links that opening links in new tabs opens them in the background.
3. Open some tabs and at least one in the background.
4. Reorder tabs (i. e. move a tab).
Actual Results:  
Unread tabs lose their individual style.

Expected Results:  
Unread tabs' style should not be affected.
