doing some of our places cleanup on quit-application and some on profile-before-change
doing some of our places cleanup on quit-application and some on profile-before-change

while working on bug #389876, I noticed that on quit-application, our history code cleans up places.sqlite (drops user_title from moz_places) and expires annotations, but then on profile-before-change, nsBrowserGlue.js backup to bookmarks.html

it doesn't seem right that we're doing these things on two different notifications.

note, quit-application comes before profile-before-change.

benjamin, any suggestion on which one we should do our work on?
