Help menu separator needs to have an ID - CCK
For the CCK, we want to add a help item if people want it, but the help menu in
baseMenuOverlay.xul is lacking in IDs.

In particular, because there is a menu item that can sometime be there or not be
there depending on platform, we need to add an ID to a menuseparator so that we
can insert an item before that separator.
