"This page requires a plugin that can only run in 32-bit mode" won't shut up

Steps to reproduce:

I am using a local network appliance that has a web interface.  The web interface uses iframes in order to display some dynamic info.  One of those iframes is requesting a plugin that can only be run in 32-bit mode.  


Actual results:

I dismiss the warning, because I don't care about it.  And then it comes back.  So i dismiss it, and then it comes back.  It's really annoying.  It's reappearing because the iframe is being reloaded.


Expected results:

The dismissal should be for the window, not any iframes inside it.  Once I've told it to go away, it should stay gone away unless I refresh the parent document.  The outer HTML is not changing, just an iframe inside it.

Alternatively, there should be a way to indicate that I don't want to see that warning again, ever.
