My recently loaded firefox is identified as 1.0
1. I would like the option of viewing all bookmarks as in Explorer with the
'unfoldered' bookmarks coming AFTER not alphabetically amongst the folders.  I
create them quickly and them sort them afterwards.
2. If I wish to put bookmarks into the correct forler on creation, it would be
nice to identify the forder name by means of using the first letters of each
folder and subfolder, perhaps with a prefix such as ctrl.
3. To 'upgrade' can I just overwrite or do I have to go through the pain of
deleting first?
