Long web pages freeze browser until page is loaded.

I have found this happening quite a bit - if you go to a particularly long page then Firefox will freeze until the whole page is loaded.  Whilst frozen you cannot do anything, including changing tabs, using the menus or even switching back to Firefox if you move to another application.  Once the page is loaded, Firefox tends to 'catch up' with whatever you've clicked.

The freeze only starts after a certain amount of the page has been loaded, i.e. as the page begins to load I can still interact with Firefox as expected, but when it reaches a certain threshold the app freezes until the whole page has been downloaded.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a long web page, e.g. the one in the URL field of this bug.

Actual Results:  
Initially during the load you will be able to interact with firefox, but once it reaches a certain point Firefox will freeze until the load is complete.

Expected Results:  
No freezing.  Firefox should work as normal regardless of the page size or content.
