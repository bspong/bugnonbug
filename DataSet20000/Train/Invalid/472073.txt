When I sniff https communication between firefow and the internet with IEInspector HttpAnalyzer, I can see not crypted data.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch HTTPANalyser -> Select a running process -> firefox
2. Goto any https site ex: gmail

Actual Results:  
You can view the entire clear transmission in HTTPANalyser.

Expected Results:  
Transmission must appear crypted !

Maybe not directly a bug in firefox. But this kind of software must not be able to see ssl crypted communication. A loophole in the ssl connexion management ?
