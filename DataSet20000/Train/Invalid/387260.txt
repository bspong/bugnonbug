When I visit the Nike site http://www.nike.com/nikeskateboarding/v3/ the page loads fine.  When I scroll, the page goes blank.  The Flash content goes blank.  

The Nike animated gizmos keep drawing in the middle of the rectangle, and when my mouse moves portions redraw.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.nike.com/nikeskateboarding/v3/
2. Scroll more than a centimeter
Actual Results:  
See the white blank screen.

Expected Results:  
It should display the Flash content, scrolled.

I see this on many sites, and I think I saw this with a Java applet plugin too.  I'm running MacIntel 10.4.10 / FFX 2.0.0.4 latest Flash plugin.  There is no workaround.
