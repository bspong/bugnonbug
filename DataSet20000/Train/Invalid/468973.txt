3.1b2 doesn't honor browser.link.open_external = 2 (Open in New Window)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1b2) Gecko/20081201 Firefox/3.1b2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1b2) Gecko/20081201 Firefox/3.1b2

While 3.1b1 removed the preferences UI for browser.link.open_external, it honored the setting if entered via about:config. 3.1b2 ignores the setting and uses the default (3, "Open in a new tab in the current window"). I have not tried setting the value to 1 ("Open in current window") to see if that's honored.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set Firefox as your default browser 
2. set browser.link.open_external = 2 in about:config
3. open URL externally. Any program should work (as should "open '<url>'" on the command line)
Actual Results:  
New URL opens in a tab in the current window

Expected Results:  
New URL opens in a new window

I can't believe this isn't a duplicate bug, but I've searched quite a bit and can't find a previous submission.
