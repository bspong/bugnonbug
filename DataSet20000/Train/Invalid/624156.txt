Dear Mozilla, We recently launched our Prime new internet DNS services and have determined Mozilla is altering our homepage http searches to 'www.1.' - We would humbly ask as that you update Mozilla to allow the following http searches: 'http://1.' and '1.' to not be auto-altered as described. This would be greatly appreciated to both us and our growing user community. Thank you.

Should you have any questions, we can be reached at the following:

Prime
7660 Fay Ave, Ste. H-103
La Jolla, CA 92037

Steps to Reproduce:

Expected Results:  
Directed you to (UsePrime Homepage) location: 74.208.194.40

We understand the original intentions of the auto-alteration/modification, however given our launch of Prime and the new internet we find it now as a mandate overriding free will of the user and authoritative in nature.
