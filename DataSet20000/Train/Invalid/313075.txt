Read and Send Mail Button's option not working

The toolbar button's menu generates nothing. No app is launched.

A click on any email link generates absolutely nothing - no activity.

Read a suggestion to change mailhandler option to Thunderbird in about:config -
no mailhandler option found.

Checked KDE - Thunderbird set as default email client.

Mozex may have helped but not available.

The click to launch Thunderbird worked in previous versions but stopped with 1.0.7.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click any email client launcher link
2. Nothing happens
Actual Results:  
Nothing

Expected Results:  
Launched Thunderbird
