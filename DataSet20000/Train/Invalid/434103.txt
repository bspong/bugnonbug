Setting options for how PDF files should be handled by Firefox 3 RC1 doesn't work. Whenever I click on a link to a PDF file, it still loads within the browser window automatically, even though I've specified that I want to be asked what to do whenever PDF files are encountered.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Tools -> Options... -> Applications
2. For files of type 'Adobe Acrobat 7.0 Document' specify 'Always ask'
3. Click on a link to a PDF file
Actual Results:  
PDF document is automatically displayed within the browser.

Expected Results:  
A prompt asking me what I want to do with the file.

Firefox should ask me what I want to do, e.g. display it or save it. This worked fine in Firefox 2.
