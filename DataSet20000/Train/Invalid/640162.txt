I am using fx at work, on a computer, that is almost never restarted, only put asleep after hours. So I almost never restart firefox

I have noticed, that fx4 beta is slowly decreasing in its responsiveness. It is visible when loading pages and switching tabs. After tab focus is acquired, it takes sometimes event a few seconds before I can click anything or scroll through the page. Very annoying.

Restarting makes performance back to normal for some time. I have not monitored memory usage. While in ins underperforming state, it crashed once when opening a new tab.

Reproducible: Always
