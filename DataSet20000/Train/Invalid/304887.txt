There's no change in address bar when links are clicked in the same tab

In Deer Park Alpha 2 the address bar remains unchanged when clicking links and
opening the new websites in the same tab. For example: typing
"http://www.mozilla.org/" in address bar shows the website and the address in
the address bar; but if I then click "products" the new website is openned but
"http://www.mozilla.org/" remains in the address bar instead of
"http://www.mozilla.org/products/".
For the correct address to appear I need click in another openned tab and then
click again in the first tab.
This happens with every link in every website I tested so far.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open "http://www.mozilla.org/"
2.Click "Products"
Actual Results:  
The new website is openned but "http://www.mozilla.org/" remains unchanged in
the address bar.

Expected Results:  
Should have changed the address bar to "http://www.mozilla.org/products/".

If I duplicate a tab in a new tab with the "Duplicate Tab" extension the new tab
appears with an empty address bar but if I duplicate it to a new window the new
window appears with the correct address.
