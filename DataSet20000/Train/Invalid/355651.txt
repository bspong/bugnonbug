backport non-places changes from branch to trunk
backport non-places changes from branch to trunk

this bug covers taking care of myk's patch from bug #353571 as well as any code outside of mozilla/browser/components/bookmarks that may need to be backported.

"Here's the diff I used in my analysis.  For each chunk, I appended a comment
explaining the bug(s) it comes from and whether we need to do anything with it
(i.e. apply a branch patch to the trunk).

To extract just those comments plus the files they apply to, run the following
command on this file:

  egrep 'diff -uNr|@@' bookmarks-changes.diff"

I'll re-attach his patch.
