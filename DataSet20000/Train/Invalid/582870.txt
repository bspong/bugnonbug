unable to right-click tab after upgrade [caused by Tab Mix Plus]

Something changed between 4.0b1 and 4.0b2 and I am no longer able to right-click tabs. All I get is the standard context menu for right-clicking anywhere in the UI.

Reproducible: Didn't try




I recently switched OSes from Windows 7 to Windows XP. Before doing so, I copied my Firefox profile folder and am currently using it. Probably not the smartest idea on my part.

This bug may be correlated with next bug I'm going to report.
