Jeffs html5 fish bowl benchmark website renders the water poorly since. I think bug 605808 might be the cause

Steps to reproduce:

Visit website to run bench
http://people.mozilla.com/~jmuizelaar/fishbowl/fishbowl-gl.html 



Actual results:

Couldn't see anything but full screen of water until I unchecked the water checkmark.
This happened sometime after the msaa pref was added, and today. Thinking bug 605808 may have something to do with it, but just a guess. This is on fully patched Windows 7x64 Ultimate SP1 with nightly from 11-11-11. Prefs are d2d force enabled true, layers acceleration force enabled true, and webgl force enabled true. I have Ati Mobility Radeon HD 4650 with latest 11.10 drivers. No prior problems



Expected results:

Water should have rendered in the fishbowl like it always has. I will attach a previous screenshot with "water" checked during bench, and a new one with water checked. This does not crash nightly 11 and is still fine if I uncheck water. No regressions and it looks like it did it nightly 10.
