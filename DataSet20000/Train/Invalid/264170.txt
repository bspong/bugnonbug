spurious extra vertical space at beginning of page when DTD is for xhtml

I will attach to samml pages which differ only on the
content of the <!DOCTYPE ... > directive. One is HTML 2.0
and the other is XHTML 1.0 Transitional.

When displayed by Firefox , the pages differ in the amount
of white space above the first heading. The XHTML version
of the page displays more white space than I would expect.
Is this a bug?

IE, displays the two pages identically, without the extra
space.
