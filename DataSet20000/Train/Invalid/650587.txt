Attempt to load page always thrashes (repetitive activity reported but nothing displayed)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

REPEATABLE BUG: After normal operation for several days, I attempted to load a page which has loaded without problems in the past. No content was displayed. No error messages (e.g., "taking too long to respond") were displayed. After about 20 minutes of thrashing, I gave up and killed the tab. (The browser itself kept working normally.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type in the URL http://www.sacbee.com/walters/ and hit RETURN.
2. Lower left corner of browser shows "Connecting" and "Waiting" over and over.
3. No content after 20 minutes (occasional very brief "Transferring" appears).
4. Try same on Explorer 8.0.6001.19048. Page loads without error.
5. Try same on Chrome 10.0.648.205 (current as of this date). Page loads.
6. Try same on Firefox 3.6.15. Page loads.
Actual Results:  
No content after 20 minutes. However, Firefox was stable: Task manager reported a fluctuating value of core memory in the range of 115K-120K throughout the hang.

Expected Results:  
I expected the page to load, as it does on all other browsers including FF4.0's immediate predecessor. If it failed to load, I expected a diagnostic.

I managed to capture what appears to be the full HTML source of the page. I will add it as an attachment. (If the attachment fails to show up, please send a note to gm.exducere@gmail.com and provide an email address to which I can respond directly.)
