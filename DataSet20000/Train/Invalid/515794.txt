The password field shows the generic character of the unicode value rather then the correct bullet character

The unicode value which is displayed is 25CF which is the bullet code for some fonts (i.e. Times New Roman), however from what I have found, in other fonts the bullet character is 2022 (i.e. Arial).  The text box uses Arial font and displays the error character.  If the font for the text box is switched to Times New Roman, it will display properly.
