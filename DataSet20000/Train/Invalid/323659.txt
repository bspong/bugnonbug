Firefox 1.5 does not work with Dell's DRAC to get remote console access
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20051012 Netscape/8.0.4
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.5

I upgraded from Firefox 1.07 to 1.5, but could not get to the console of several of my remote Linux systems afterwards.  I was able to connect and sign in to the DRAC, but when I tried to access the server's console, nothing ever happened.  Firefox seemed to not do anything.  The DRACs use a Java VNC applet to make this all work.  Java seems to be invoked, but not getting anywhere.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. type in the URL of a Dell DRAC
2. Sign in to the DRAC
3. Select remote access
4. Select console redirection

Actual Results:  
The remote console is never displayed.

Expected Results:  
Displayed the remote console.
