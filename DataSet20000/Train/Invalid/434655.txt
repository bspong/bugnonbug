Starting today I believe, using the newest version of GMail, there is a near 50% CPU load all from firefox and also the chat portion of GMail does not load. After closing the tab with GMail the load returns to normal levels.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open GMail in a tab
2. Check CPU load
3. Close tab and recheck
Actual Results:  
Large CPU load during open GMail tab

Expected Results:  
Not had a large CPU load

I am using the Compact classic theme, Forecast Fox Advanced, and Foxmarks.
