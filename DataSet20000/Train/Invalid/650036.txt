... shows that the on Linux, we lack a 'bookmarks' button at the right edge of the toolbar. (to the right of the Home button)

If I invoke "Customize Toolbars", then the bookmark button magically appears while the customize dialog is open -- but as soon as I leave customize-mode, the bookmark button disappears again.

Surely this isn't intentional?
