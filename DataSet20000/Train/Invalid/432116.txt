On a computer, running Win XP, ASK Weather displays a temp with a click option for "F" or "C". On a Samsung A920 Farenheight is displayed with the "C" indicator and no option to switch to Celsius. Example: Su., 4 May 08 ASK Mobile Weather is telling me the temp. range is 39 C to 67 C. Quite warm for April in Minnesota, but accurate if read as 39 F to 67 F. No conversion option is provided as it is on a computer.
