If the "advanced" section of options (tools->options) was the last selected
section, clicking options/scrollbars/etc. receives no response. This may be
related to the mousewheel not working unless that section is focussed. Clicking
another section and clicking back seems to make this behavior (the advanced
options dialog not responding) go away.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open firefox, click tools->options
2.click on the advanced section
3.close firefox
4.reopen firefox, open tools->options
5.the options dialog should point to the advanced section
6.clicking on the scroll bars and options of the advanced sections fails to show
any change in the dialog

Actual Results:  
Whether it is actually working and just not updating the GUI, I'm not sure, but
I saw no change in the dialog.

Expected Results:  
Behave normally: scroll when scrollbars are clicked, toggle options or open
other dialogs when the appropriate options are triggered.
