When I open my mail website using an addon - Webmail notifier, it has an underline on the tab header (the website name). This underline remains when I go to some other website after that.
The underline remains on the tab name throughout as long as the tab is open. 
Only when I close that tab and open a new does the underline on website names (on the tab header) goes away. 

Reproducible: Always

1. Open webpage using webmail notifier addon. The tab will have the website name with an underline.
2. go to any other website after that and all webpage names on the tab will have an underline
3.
Actual Results:  
The underline on all website names while browsing remains on the tab 

Expected Results:  
Either there should not be any underline on website names on tabs or it should go away once I get out of the mail page.
