I don't know a lot about Microsoft computers, but when I am using Firefox, and just Firefox, the computer will randomly crash. Crash as in I get a blue screen, the computer restarts, I open Firefox, an hour or so later, it all happens again. I am using Firefox Beta 4.0.2, the exact version that I downloaded.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
I'm not entirely sure on how to reproduce it, but I didn't have any problems with the first Firefox Beta 4.
