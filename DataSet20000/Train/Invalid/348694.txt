I was prompted by a Firefox notice to update. I did. I was then told to shut down Firefox and restart the program. I did. The program restarted fine but there was no homepage loaded and no other URLs would load in any tabs. I uninstalled the program and reinstalled it after downloading from the Firefox website. Same problem occurred. I decided to install Netscape. It had the exact same symptoms as Firefox. No URLs would load . All other functions work fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Can't load URLs

Expected Results:  
Loaded my homepage and any subsequent URL
