NoScript has been working fine until Firefox 3.6.3 and Fedora 13.  My whole system crash everytime I select and click the NoScript Options such that the display screen was blank and the system revert to the login screen.  Could you investigate this critical bug?

Dell PowerEdge 1800

2.  Clicking the NoScript Icon at the bottom status bar crash the system.
3.

Firefox crashed.  Linux kernel crashed.  Display screen blanked.  System revert to the login screen.

This could be related to Firefox 3.6.  It could also be related to the Radeon display driver on very specific platform like the Dell PowerEdge 1800 as was seen in Fedora 11 and Fedora 12, but this problem has been resolved in Fedora 13.
