Unable to move folders in bookmarks in 2.0.0.8

With 2.0.0.8, if I try to drag a folder to another location, the folder does not move.  Rearranging the regular bookmarks does work, and I can move those in and out of folders and change their locations/ordering -- but folders cannot move, be dragged into another folder, dragged out of another folder, etc.

Reverted back to 2.0.0.6, and the functionality is working again.

Starting up Firefox in safe mode doesn't make a difference, either.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Bookmarks->Organize Bookmarks...
2. Try to drag a folder to another location
3. Try to drag a folder into another folder or out of the containing folder
Actual Results:  
The folders do not move.

Expected Results:  
The folders move.

Both 2.0.0.6 and 2.0.0.8 were built on Debian/etch by pulling from CVS with the release tags.  Any other details needed?
