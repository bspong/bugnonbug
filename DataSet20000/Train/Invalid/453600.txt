Full hard drives causes hard crashes

I've found that a full hard drive can cause some nasty errors, up to Firefox outright refusing to run. I've seen bookmarks disappear (already reported in #305379), been unable to open more than one window at a time, and lastly had Firefox immediately give a crash dialog box without opening any windows.

Freeing up space on the hard drive where your profile is stored (C: in my case) fixes these problems (though I earlier had to go recover my bookmarks from backups), but this really isn't acceptable behavior for something as trivial as a full hard drive.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Fill up your hard drive where the profiles are stored (likely C:)
2. Browse around for a while
3. Watch Firefox do weird things like lose bookmarks or crash



Expected Results:  
Firefox should detect errors in writing to disk (whether it's a download, profile/bookmark information, or cache) and handle it gracefully.
