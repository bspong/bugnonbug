When I upgraded to FF 4.0 for yahoo on my Vista Home Premium computer, my Yahoo Toolbar Yahoo Bookmarks drop down menu will not display the bookmarks.  However, it works on my XP Professional computer.  Wrote to Yahoo.  Been two weeks.  They are aware and trying to work it from their end, but to no avail.  The bookmarks are still there, but will not appear in the drop down menu under Yahoo Bookmarks. Yahoo suggested as a temp workaround to open the "Go To Bookmarks" page and use that as my bookmarks menu for the time being.  Have done so for a week.  tired of cumbersome workaround, so rolled back FF 4.0 to FF 3.6.8.  Tried Ff 4.0 and Yahoo_FF4.0-rc2 - - -both versions have same problem. FF3.6.8 does not have the problem.  Please fix this.
