whenever i try to duplicate the right-most tab by holding ctrl down and dragging to the right and releasing, the tab does not duplicate and the blue arrow remains.

i'm using the addon 'tab mix plus', if that might be the case.
(i have 'multiple rows' option checked, and when the blue arrow remains on a second row, when i close it the blue arrow remains there floating).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.(optional?) tab mix plus addon added
2.hold control, click a tab, and drag it to the rightmost area (not blank space, but furthest to the right so the blue arrow appears)
3.release. the tab should not duplicate and the arrow will remain.
Actual Results:  
blue arrow remained there, no additional tab.

Expected Results:  
duplicated the tab, removed the blue arrow.
