I have several extensions (adblock plus, relby, exit button firefox) that have buttons/icons that can be added to the toolbar via the "customise toolbar" box. Recently I noticed all custom buttons had disappeared from both the toolbar and the "customize toolbar" box.

Attempts to fix include uninstalling/reinstalling addons, restarting windows, checking google, and checking a previous build of firefox (3.5.5 - Missing from there as well).

All three addons appear compatible with both FF 3.6 B2 and FF 3.5.5

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Uninstall/reinstall addon
2. Open "Customize toolbar" box
Actual Results:  
Only default icons/buttons/etc. appear

Expected Results:  
default icons/buttons/etc. appear as well as custom ones placed there by addons
