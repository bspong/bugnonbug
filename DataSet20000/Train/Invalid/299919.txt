After turning off the machine improperly (by unplugging it or holding down the
power button), and then rebooting, Windows will scan the hard disk by default.
Nearly always my cookies are deleted due to what Windows reports as "invalid
file entry". 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Improperly turn off computer by either cutting off the power or by turning it
off manually.
2. Turn computer back on.
3. Let Windows scan the hard disk.

Actual Results:  
Windows reported that the Firefox cookies file was invalid, and then the file
was deleted.

Expected Results:  
The software, should have created a cookies file that Windows wouldn't recognize
as faulty.
