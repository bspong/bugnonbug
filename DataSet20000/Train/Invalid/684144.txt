ctypes.open can not load a dll from the extension's directory
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/535.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/13.0.782.218 Safari/535.1

Steps to reproduce:

I am developing an extension that loads a C .dll. I am using js-ctypes to load the dll and everything work perfectly if I placed my .dll file on the desktop, but when I package my dll with the compnent and try to load it using ctypes.open("C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\vlpoybl7.default\extensions\Extension name\mylibrary.dll"); it always fail and doesn't load unless I put a breakpoint in chrome bug and force it to run. 


Actual results:

Library fails to load and cann't use it to decalre functions


Expected results:

I should see the library loaded and use it to declare C functions into JS.
