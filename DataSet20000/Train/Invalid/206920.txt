Page Info fields are greyed out (a detraction from Mozilla)

I noticed Phoenix has greyed out the fields in the Page Info tabs.  This is a
departure from Mozilla.  Is there any valid reason why they should be greyed
out.  I propose switching back to black text instead.  It looks better (and is
more readable) that way.
Also note, that "Enter a Bug" under the general tab is also greyed out.
