SVG file not rendered properly

The SVG at the link above and other svg files at the location here:

http://vis.cs.ucdavis.edu/~ogawa/research/storylines/

are not rendered properly. The caption at the top of the page is almost completely above the window - in Google Chrome it's shown correctly.

Also when user moves mouse over one of those wiggly lines I believe all lines in the graph are supposed to gray out and have just that line colored - it happens like that in Google Chrome.

In Firefox I notice this error in Firebug:

evt.target.ownerDocument.getElementsByName is not a function
file:///W:/apache.svg.xml
Line 152

Reproducible: Always
