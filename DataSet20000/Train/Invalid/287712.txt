updated 1.0.1 to Firefox 1.0.2 for Windows now no webpages will come up. It
looks like it is trying to pickup any additional updates but never finds
anything then times out. Tried rebooting no progress. Uninstalled then clean
install still same problem. Uninstalled and went back to 1.0.1 and browser works
fine.

Reproducible: Always
