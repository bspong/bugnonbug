cache fails to update when remote page changes
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100121 Namoroka/3.6

When attempting to load a page that has been viewed previously, a cached version of the page will be shown even if the page's HTML has changed since the cached version was fetched. I can override this cached version by refreshing the page once.

This has only started happening since upgrading to 3.6.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a frequently changing webpage such as a news site.
2. Close the tab/browser for a period of time that allows the webpage to be modified.
3. Reload the webpage.
Actual Results:  
The webpage is the same as it was in step 1, until the page is refreshed.

Expected Results:  
I'd expect to see an updated page immediately, rather than a cache of it before having to refresh.

I might have completely missed a new feature in 3.6 here, but I couldn't find anything new relating to the cache in the settings.
