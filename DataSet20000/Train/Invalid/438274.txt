There seems to be a global design problem in not saving customization information over a crash.  This affects bookmarks, home pages, and options, such as stuff set by tools options and stuff modified in about:config.

All of these are lost if firefox crashes.  Bookmarks can be retrieved if the user knows where to look, but allthe other stuff is gone.

My question is, why does this get wiped out in the first place.  If a modification is made to one of these things by the user, why does firefox not write the file containing that information immediately in such a way that it is safe and still existing even if firefox later crashes.

Yes, no help if the crash happens when the write/close is being done, but that is surely a rare occurrence.

It seems to me that writing and closing (or whatever windows calls this) would be a minor performance hit, probably not even noticeable.
