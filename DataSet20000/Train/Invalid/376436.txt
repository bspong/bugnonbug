Gecko: CSS margin-top/margin-bottom doesn't work at times, while margin-left/right does.

As a web developer, I run into this all the time. I have yet to figure out why it happens (but the result is always the same). Here is an example of a script that does this:

<span style="margin-top:10px;border-top:1px solid #FF0000;position:absolute;width:94px;"><span style="margin-top:-10px;">STRIKE-OUT</span></span>

The first instance of margin-top works correctly. The second instance however: the text STRIKE-OUT should be shifting up. Neither margin-top or margin-bottom work no matter what value you put in (positive or negative).

However, try this:
<span style="margin-top:10px;border-top:1px solid #FF0000;position:absolute;width:94px;"><span style="margin-left:-10px;">STRIKE-OUT</span></span>

STRIKE-OUT does shift.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Er... see Details. But it isn't just that example where the problem occurs. But my guess why it occurs is because of a conflict between it being used previously, nullifying the second use, no matter what the value.
Actual Results:  
See Details.

Expected Results:  
In the first example provide in Details, the text should shift up.

This is not specific to my computer. This is a gecko rendering issue.

There is no true work around to this problem.
