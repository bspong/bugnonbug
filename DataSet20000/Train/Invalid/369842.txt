session restoration interferes with firefox-qs
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061217 SUSE/2.0.0.1-25.1 Firefox/2.0.0.1

Firefox-qs is a program that keeps several instances of firefox running invisible in the background so that the user can open a new window quickly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.install firefox-qs (guru,...)
2.make it start on boot
3.reboot
Actual Results:  
On every bootup the user is asked whether he wants to restore some previous firefox session.

Expected Results:  
1.) Firefox-QS should be able to start firefox in plain mode without any content and without prompting the user for anything
2.) Termination of Firefox instances still running in plain mode (no site opened) should not trigger session restoration

It would be possible to do totally without FirefoxQS if the main /usr/bin/firefox executable was a dummy program just checking if any instance of Firefox is already running.
If yes it should make the running instance fork: Just as if the user selecet File->NewWindow
If not it should start firefox-bin.
