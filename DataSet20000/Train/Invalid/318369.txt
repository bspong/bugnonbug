I used the DIV tag with JUSTIFY align to write text from database to the website, but Mozilla 1.5 didn't brake lines. The width is fixed, but the browser can't display it. For example, I vainly set the width parameter to 450, it don't brake the lines and do the align, but it write the text in one line, while it ends. It start a new line, just when I replace the ENTER char whith BR tag.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install firefox 1.5 with default options
2.Open my website
3.See the bug

Actual Results:  
My website looks terrible with the firefox 1.5. It worked fine with the old versions.

Expected Results:  
Brake the lines when it's longer then the WIDTH limit.
