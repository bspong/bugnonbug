Cursor in calendar causes wrong selection
In the calendar the cursor "resize" is used. I think "w-resize".
This causes a weird problem here: when I hover over a day on the calendar the right date is selected but when I click it selects the date to the left.
So: I click on 29 March but 28 March gets green.
I think another cursor would be better.
