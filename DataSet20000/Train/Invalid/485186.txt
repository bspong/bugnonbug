middle click on an unvisited link for a new tab causes two tabs to open

When using mouse middle-click to open a new tab from an existing link (ie middle click on link and get the target page in a new tab), if the link has never been visited, then Firefox will often open two tabs with the target page instead of one.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a page with previously unvisited or updated links (forums seem to show this most often)
2. Middle-click on a link (eg to follow a thread) in a new tab.

Actual Results:  
Two new tabs are opened with the target page.

Expected Results:  
Only one new tab should be opened with the target page.

Is intermittent, but probably happens 50-75 percent of the time. I will often use a forum and do several middle-clicks to open several thread in new tabs, and some will open two tabs.
