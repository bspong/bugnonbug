FF Browser & google.com search for any keywords does not sure current google
listings & adwords - IE & NS google.com search does show current listings and
adwords.  I've noticed this for the last couple weeks, going crazy as to why my
adwords where not showing up.  They do when using IE or NS browseres & google.com

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.OPen FF - use google.com - search key word "nipple jewelry" Odd listings & old
adwords
2.Open IE - use google.com - search keyword "nipple jewelry" Current listings &
adwords
3.Open NS - use google.com - search keyword "nipple jewelry" Current listings &
adwords.

Actual Results:  
see above, sample keyword search.  FireFox browser seems to return old or odd
results.  Definately not current listings nor adwords.

Expected Results:  
shown the same "current" results as found when using IE and/or NS

Bug may be minor to you, but to companies paying for adwords and/or top ten
listings are losing sales from customers using FoxFire browser, this is a MAJOR
problem.
