Hi,
Firefox file selector in linux only support local file browsing (it doesn't show network places or bookmarked locations). For example, uploading a file from a remote folder (usually a common operation with user files stored in a NAS server) is not possible.
This same bug is reported in a Ubuntu Launchpad:

Reproducible: Always
