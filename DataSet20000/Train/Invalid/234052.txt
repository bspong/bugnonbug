Typo: Firefox bookmarks toolbar still says "Firebird Help"

This is a typographical thing, not a software bug. The browser name has changed
to Firefox, but the help link in the bookmark toolbar still says "Mozilla
Firebird Help." If copy-editing stuff should be reported in some other way,
please let me know. Thanks.
