Google Reader causes Firefox to consume constantly increasing amounts of memory

I have subscribed to the following Atom feed in Google reader (as an example only, the same occurs for all similar feeds from this site):

https://datatracker.ietf.org/feed/comments/draft-ietf-geopriv-revised-civic-lo/

Choosing to view this feed causes Google Reader to stick in the "Loading..." state indefinitely.  This would ordinarily cause me to think that Google Reader was at fault apart from the bit where Firefox continually increases its memory footprint.

After about 5 minutes Firefox was at 1.1 Gb VM Size (most of which was paged), which is a little higher than the physical memory installed in the machine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load above feed into Google Reader
2. Try to view it.

Actual Results:  
Firefox consumes increasing amounts of memory indefinitely.  It didn't crash, but made my system unusable (due to excessive paging).

Expected Results:  
If Google Reader really is at fault, then I'd expect Firefox to clamp down on it after a short while.

This is the only https feed that I have.  It works perfectly fine in the inbuilt Firefox feed reader.
