Middleclick on nothing is buggy

A middleclick (which should open a link in a new tab) in Firefox 3.0 beta 2, when done on nothing, actually does something. It shouldn't do anything when not done on a link, but it does.

First it gave popup errors about an invalid URL. Now, it loads a page instead of the current page. This new page is both a complete surprise - no link was clicked! - and replaces the page, when middleclick should open a new tab. The site it goes to is some 'spa' site - very weird, I have no idea why.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Middle-click on an empty area. NOT on a link.
Actual Results:  
See that you get an error or jump to a strange page.

Expected Results:  
Nothing should happen, since the middleclick was not on a link.
