The tutorial on how to make your own "persona" mentions that at phase 3 (preview) you need to click a fox in the lower left corner of the screen. There is no such icon.

I'm running a clean installation.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start browser
2. ???
3. Bug!
Actual Results:  
There is no fox icon.

Expected Results:  
Display a little red fox before "Done"

The bug appears with the default theme as well as others, and it occurs with all my extensions disabled as well.
