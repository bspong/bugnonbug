HTML title attribute not rendered as tooltip

It appears that Firefox ignores the value of title attributes 
since version 1.0.5. The most recent 1.0.6 build also seems to 
be affected. Former versions 1.0.4 etc. worked as expected.

To my understanding, FF recognizes the presence of the title=
attribute and tries to display a tooltip. However, it somehow
drops the value of the title on the floor. At the time when the 
tooltip is finally written to screen, the tooltip text is empty.

I have only Linux, so I cannot comment on FF on MacOS or Windows.

The behaviour does not depend on Standard vs. Quirks mode.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load http://www.uni-graz.at/~katzer/title.html
2. Move the mouse pointer over the word "bar" in the second line
3. Observe the tooltip

Actual Results:  
FF shows a tiny rectangle with no text inside.

Expected Results:  
FF should show a somewhat larger rectangle with the text "foo" inside.
