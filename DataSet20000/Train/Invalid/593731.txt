New urlbar stop and reload buttons uses the same names as Combine Buttons extension
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.0; rv:2.0b6pre) Gecko/20100905 Firefox/4.0b6pre

I don't know if this is on purpose or just a coincidence, but the new stop and reload buttons built into the urlbar use the same ID names as my Combine Buttons extension:

#urlbar-stop-button
#urlbar-reload-button

This will cause users of my extension to see two sets of stop and reload buttons in the urlbar when using any combination like:

[ stop reload urlbar



Reproducible: Always
