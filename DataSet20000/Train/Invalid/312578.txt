scim doesn't show lookup table
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux ppc; en-US; rv:1.8b5) Gecko/20051015 Firefox/1.4.1

With all the other apps that support scim, including firefox 1.0.x, invoking
chinese input would show the lookup table, with firefox 1.5 beta, only the
characters that I have typed is shown. This happens regardless if "Embedded
lookup table" is checked or not.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. select any text field in firefox 1.5 beta
2. do ctrl+space to enable scim
3. start typing

Actual Results:  
Only the characters that I have typed is shown in a window right below the textfield

Expected Results:  
the lookup table should be shown as well.
