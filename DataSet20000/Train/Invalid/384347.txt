Greasemonkey reverses order of windows during session restore
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20070515 Firefox/2.0.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20070515 Firefox/2.0.0.4

Tested with Firefox 2.0.0.4 and Greasemonkey 0.7.20070607.0
Problem exists in prior versions as well.

With Greasemonkey installed a restored session will have the order of all but the first two windows reversed.
Closing Firefox and reopening will reverse the order again, thus returning to the original order.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable session restore in Firefox
2. Install Greasemonkey add-on
3. Open several windows (at least four)
4. Use File>Exit to close Firefox
5. Reopen Firefox, the order of all but the first two windows will be reverse.
Actual Results:  
The order of all windows in a session restore, except the first two, will be reversed upon starting Firefox if Greasemonkey is installed.

Expected Results:  
Windows should retain their original order.

This has been reproduced on a test machine with WinXP SP2 and all security updates.
No Firefox profile existed before testing.
Enabling session restore and installing Greasemonkey were the only changes over the stock install.
Removing Greasemonkey will allow session restore to preserve order correctly again.
