e.g. here is a piece of HTML code <p><sub>This is subscript</sub>, <sup>this is superscript</sup>, that's it.</p>

If you view it in Firefox you will see the "," after "</sub>" positions at the middle-top of the text, I guess it should be at the bottom line like the "sup" one, it shows correctly.

The issue also shows in Webkit and Presto. Surprisingly only Internet Explorer 6/7 get it right this time.

Reproducible: Always
