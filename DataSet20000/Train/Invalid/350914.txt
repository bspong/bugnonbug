Source code rather than interpreted HTML displays for Lessons from C-Net.

When "Lesson 1" is clicked on after signing onto C-Net for one of their courses, Firefox displays the HTML source code, whereas IE 6 displays the lesson itself.  Since C-Net is a pretty big site I assume that I have something set wrong in Firefox.
This is very similar to bug No. 285975, except that it involves a very prominent and active site.  I tried to add the comment there, but I guess I wasn't signed in properly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Sign up for a C-Net course, such as Organizing your Photos.
2.Log into C-Net and start the course.
3.Click on "Lesson 1"

Actual Results:  
In IE the lesson page is displayed.
With Firefox, my default browser, the HTML source code is displayed.

Expected Results:  
The lesson page to be displayed
