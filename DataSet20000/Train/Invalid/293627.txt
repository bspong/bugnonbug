Unconventional URL compromises tab navigation
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050508 Firefox/1.0+

When you try to navigate to a "special" url - that is one that has , and {}
characters in it - the active tab becomes unfunctional: it grays out and you
cannot close it.
On my actual build (Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8b2)
Gecko/20050508 Firefox/1.0+) I don't see any javascript errors or exceptions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a new tab.
2. Copy and paste the above link.
3. Try to navigate ... well you can't !!

Actual Results:  
The active tab becomes unfunctional: it grays out and you cannot close it.

Expected Results:  
The link should display normally
