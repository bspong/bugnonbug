Attempting to switch from the Release highlights tab in the page above causes it to flash to the new content for an instant and then back to the release highlights content.  Subsequently clicking the content tabs will not change anything at all anymore even when a full refresh is performed.

This was not an issue in 3.6.7 afaik.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the demo url
2. Click Additonal Information or supported products
3. New content will either display for a moment then back, or not at all
Actual Results:  
The page does not display correctly

Expected Results:  
The page content displays correctly.

Worked prior to updating to 3.6.8, and a clean profile was started to verify.
