Hello.

Whenever I Visit Tom's Hardware Guide, Some Of The Advertisements Say 'Click
Here To Get This Plug-In'. However I Already Have The Java Plug-In 1.4.0_01
Installed, And I Can See These Advertisements In Mozilla 5.0. This Problem Seems
To happen On Other Pages That use Java Aswell.

What Should I Do?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I Go To Tom's Hardware Guide.
Actual Results:  
Some Of The Java Things On The Page Did Not Display. It Said Click Here To Get
This Plug-In.

Expected Results:  
Displayed The Ads Correctly.
