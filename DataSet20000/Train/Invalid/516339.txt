It was done that moving tab opens URL in new separate window. But I don't see the purpose of this, it was convenient to move tab and save link as a URL-file. Please add the feature of saving URLs as *.URL files. Or add an option in Options of how to use dragging tabs.

1. Open new link in a new tab
2. Drag&Drop opened tab to Desktop
Actual Results:  
Tab opens in new window.
