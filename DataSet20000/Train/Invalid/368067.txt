If you leave your Homepage blank and then set "When Firefox starts:" to "Show my windows and tabs from last time" then it will not show your windows from last time, it will only show a blank page when it loads like it is set to "When Firefox starts: Show my Homepage".

This only happens when the Homepage is left blank. A workaround for this bug is to set the homepage to "about:blank"

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Edit > Preferences > Main 
2. Change the setting "When Firefox starts:" to "Show my windows and tabs from last time"
3. Set the Home Page field to blank (Not the word blank, no contents in the text box)
4. Close Firefox Preferences
5. Open multiple tabs and go to different websites
6. Close Firefox
7. Open Firefox
Actual Results:  
When Firefox is reopened, there are no tabs. There is only 1 blank page.

Expected Results:  
When Firefox was reopened, there should be tabs open with the websites that were in them before Firefox was closed
