If a web page contains an empty div (<div class="blablabla"></div>) it is displayed in DOM as <div class="blablabla" /> - as a single xml tag, and is not rendered on the page itself (I mean the style property is never read).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.


Expected Results:  
it should either render the <div> as without the xml closing style (which I think is not supported by XHTML and W3C standarts) or at least apply the attributes of the element.
