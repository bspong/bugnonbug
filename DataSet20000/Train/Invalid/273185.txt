SideStep.com is a handy airfare and travel website.  Works fine in IE but won't
load in Firefox.  I contacted site and was told it reqires ActiveX to load so
not compatible with Mozilla.
   Have encountered a few other sites that won't load in Firefox, but was easier
to go back to IE for those than have to contact each offending site.
    Is there a fix for the above?
