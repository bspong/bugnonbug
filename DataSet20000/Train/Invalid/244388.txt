CSS formatted content shifts when a period(.) is inserted into the text of an anchor inside one of the columns.

On this URL, if you select "Science" on the left-hand list of categories, it
brings up an entry on the right that contains a string that contains a period
(.), which causes the table widths to shift slightly.  If you take out the
period, the columns don't shift.  If you put in longer text (replace the period
with the word "dot", for instance), the columns don't shift.  If the width of
the text to the left of the period is less than a specific amount, the columns
don't shift (even if the text to the right of the period increases by the same
amount or more).  This is very strange and hard to believe, but I will give the
steps I took to test this.

1) The page structure:
This part of the page contains a table with two <td>'s.  The left <td> contains
an <h1>, an <h2>, a <p> with some text, and a <ul> with several <li>'s.  The
right <td> contains several <dl>'s, each with a <dt> and one or more <dd>'s. 
Each <dd> contains an anchor surrounding one or more words of text.  All of the
<dl>'s on the right have style="display: none;" set, to keep them from being
displayed.  Each <li> on the left contains an anchor which invokes a JavaScript
that sets the style for each <dl> to display:none, and then removes that style
from the appropriate dl, causing it to be displayed.  The layout of the columns
is controlled using CSS, and all of the <dl>'s use the same class to control how
they are displayed.  All of this works as expected.

2)The unexpected behavior:
Clicking on each of the anchors on the left causes the appropriate <dl> to
display on the right, and the layout is consistent, except for one of them -
"Science".  When Science is selected, the columns shift so that the left side is
slightly narrower, causing the content of the <p> on the left side to line-break
differently.

3)The cause:
I traced the cause of the problem to the text "Space.com" in an <a> in the <dd>
under the <dl> for science on the right side.  I did numerous tests and found
that if I removed the period, or shortened the amount of text to the left of the
period, the unexpected shift did not occur.  

3) Tests:
3a)Changing the text inside the <a>:
"Spacedotcom" or "Spaceisreallygreat" does not produce the shift, so it is not
the width of the text overall that causes the shift.  
"Spac.com" does not produce the shift, so reducing the amount of text to the
left of the period prevents the problem from occurring.
"Spac.com web site" does not produce the shift, but "Space.com web site" does,
so the amount of text on the right side has no effect.
"Spjce.com web site" does not produce the shift, so it is not the number of
characters to the left of the period that causes the shift, but rather the width
of that text.
"iiiii.com" does not produce the shift, but "SSSSS.com" does, confirming that it
is the width of the text to the left of the period that causes the shift.
Replacing "." with &#46; has no effect.  The behavior is the same in the above
tests.
Removing the anchor prevents the shift from occurring.  
Changing the content of the anchor does not have any effect.
Moving the <dd> and its content into a different <dl> does not have any effect
on the behavior (they are all controlled by the same class, so I expected there
not to be a difference).
I removed all <dl>'s on the right side, and the JavaScript, so that all I had on
the right side is one <dl> with one <dd> inside, with one <a> inside containing
the string "Space.com" and all the variations above.  Same behavior.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://www.the-noodle.com/links.htm
2. Click Science on the list on the left side


Actual Results:  
Columns shift to the left, causing the left column to be narrower, causing the
content of the <p> to line-break differently.  Click any of the other links, and
the columns shift back.

Expected Results:  
There should be no shift in the columns.

I have replicated this on two PC's running Firefox 0.8, one in Windows2000 Pro,
the other in WindowsXP.  The font & colors settings are the default:

Fonts for: Western
Proportional: Serif, Size: 16
Serif: Times New Roman
Sans Serif: Arial
Monospace: Courier New, Size: 13
Display Resolution: 96dpi
Minimum Font Size: none
The only other box that is checked is for underline links (neither Always use
boxes are checked).
I had a friend try to replicate the problem on Firefox 0.7, but he could not.
