We use GoDaddy SSL certificates for many of our customers web sites.  Here are a few for reference.

It has been brought to our attention that Mozilla FireFox 2.0.0.4 (most recent) is not accepting the SSL's issued by GoDaddy.

Essentially, GoDaddy is not a trusted CA within FireFox.  All of the tests are from Windows OS systems running FireFox 2.0.0.4.  

I.E. 6.1.xxxx and I.E. 7.0.5730 do not report errors.

The operating systems them selves have the more recent ROOT CERTIFICATE update from Microsoft, via Windows Updates/WSUS etc.

My XP Workstation with an older version of FireFox (1.5.012) does NOT provide the error.

Again, the combination seems to be specific (no all) GoDaddy SSL Certificates (Turbo version maybe?) and FireFox 2.0.0.4.
