Google Toolbar malfunctioning across multiple tabs

Comparing Firefox to Internet Explorer (IE) (and you want to do better than them!), Google Toolbar (GT) works fundamentally differently in a manner that is worse with Firefox. In IE one can use GT on multiple open tabs (I often work with up to 20 tabs open without any problems in IE). One can perform searches on each tab without them affecting other searches on other tabs. With Firefox, if I change the search terms on one tab, it is applied across all tabs, even erasing complicated searches I was performing on other tabs, which is a very serious problem for me when performing research, which I do all the time. I need to be able to have my GT searches remain stable on each tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create multiple tabs
2. Perform a Google Toolbar search on one tab
3. It will appear on all the tabs

or

1. Open one tab
2. Perform a Google Toolbar search on that tab
3. Open another tab and create another GT search
4. Check the other tab. Your search terms will have been changed.
