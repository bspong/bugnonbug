The unorder lists are rendered improperly in http://www.infinibandta.org/ibta/. 
A remotely related bug is:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=279122
in the sense that the list bullets are rendered as "ink drops", which is fine to
me. However, the shifting of the bullets and thus overlaying the text is not.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to http://www.infinibandta.org/ibta/
2.search for "Increased platform density"
3.You will see the bullets overlaying the text.

Actual Results:  
bullets are shifted, overlaying the text

Expected Results:  
bullets rendered before the text, not obstructing it.
