There was a problem with downloadhelper after I upgraded from version 3.7 to 4.0 and the preferences window stopped opening fully and became inoperable.  Then upgrading to the fix, 4.0.2, caused the total loss of the downloadhelper preferences window.  Now it is nothing but a weird line on the screen that I can move around but can't open.  There's nothing to see or read.
I'm running a Mac G4 with OSX 10.3.9

Can't wait for downloadHelper to work with my system!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. right click on download helper icon (or choose preferences under "Firefox"
2. choose preferences
3. only a line appears, independent of the browser, which the firefox window itself loses its red, amber and green colored buttons in the upper left hand corner - they just go clear
Actual Results:  
I couldn't get the weird line/window of preferences off the desktop or use the firefox screen for anything else. 

Expected Results:  
I should have been able to navigate around preferences and chosen conversion formats, etc..

Brand new version came today.  Can you tell me how to un-install DownloadHelper??
