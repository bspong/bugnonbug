"IE tab" for Firefox does not work in Minefield.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko/20090710 Minefield/3.6a1pre (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Minefield 3.6a1pre

On 2009-July-9, I downloaded & installed the Mozilla browser "Minefield version 3.6a1pre". On 2009-July-10 it found an update for itself that I downloaded & installed, but it was too fast for me to see the update's version number.

Anyway, I used the Minefield browser to this website.

I clicked on the "IE tab" add-on for Firefox (but remember that I was using Minefield), but it didn't load it. It said "loading...", but it was wrong.

There is one more Minefield bug to report. In Minefield's options, NONE of the options will SAVE. If you change them & then click the "OK" button, they will be at the default setting again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download & install the Mozilla browser "Minefield version 3.6a1pre"
2. Use the Minefield browser to go to any website.
3. Try to use the "IE tab" add-on for Firefox.
Actual Results:  
I clicked on the "IE tab" add-on for Firefox (but remember that I was using Minefield), but it didn't load it. It said "loading...", but it was wrong.

Expected Results:  
"IE tab" add-on for Firefox should work in Minefield browser.

None that I can think of.
