Intel Mac Crash-a-thon produces different crash dialog feedback
Using Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1a3) Gecko/20060703 BonEcho/2.0a3, when I crash on the Yahoo video site I get different dialog choices depending on the crash. Logging this because I think this will be a little confusing to end users and also trying to figure out if the feedback is different because the Apple crash reporter is not firing in some scenarios and that is why feedback is different.

STR:

1. Go to Yahoo Video Site to this video: http://video.yahoo.com/video/play?vid=e655785894fde4dcd1c610d0a722e5bc.6a5f52e929c47950a10047d75454e39c. I crash, and get the first attachment I will add to the bug.
2. Go to http://video.yahoo.com/video/play?vid=45f6e152e08ec9af2f677a53d59565af.528934&vdone=http%3A%2F%2Fvideo.yahoo.com%2F%3Fei%3DUTF-8&vback=featured%20videos. Crash, and get slightly different UI, which I will add as the second attachment.

The good news is that Session Restore fires right up and I am able to restore my session with no issues. This bug isn't a big deal, but I would like to just get clarification as to what is going on.
