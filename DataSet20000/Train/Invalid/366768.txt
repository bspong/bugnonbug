Simply put:

FireFox 2x is not able to save a copy of FireFox 2.0.0.1 due to "an unknown error". It is interesting that Internet Explorer is able to complete the save process. FireFox reports a 98% complete before it gives the error message.

This is with AV turned off for both. The drive I used for the save has 30 gig free space. The .exe.part file is the same size as the exe file downloaded by IE (5.69 meg as reported by Windows Explorer).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to download FireFox 2.0.0.1
2. See progress bar reach 98%
3. See error message
Actual Results:  
Unable to save due to unknown error

Expected Results:  
Get a fresh installer to repair a previous installation that had lost the bookmarks.
