Fonts on existing 2 buttons do not change color.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
There are 2 buttons on the page that change color to indicate status. One is used to enable certain parameters and the other to disable those same parameters. the two buttons are labled "Enable Notifier" and "Disable Notifier". The enable button 's font is supposed to be green when it is active,\. The disable is red when active. Both will be greyed out when inactive. Under IE this works fine. In Firefox, both 1.0.7 and 1.5RC2 the button font never changes color but remians black.
