i have posted images of the site with firefox 1.07 and 1.5

with the 1.07, the ad is blocked and the ad is also collapsed so i get the screen space back, but with 1.5, the ad blocked but the space is not given back

as you can see,  the 1.07 gave me the screen space back, but 1.5RC 2 didnt.


also 1.07 looks better and i hate the clear private data button in the tools menue because i can make a mistake and click on it and rurin my day. put it back in the options menue please. it will make all of us soooo happy.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to gamez.com using this adblock filter file (currently the best one, blocks 100% of all ads, gives screen space back, with out bothering any other part of the page)

2.with firefox 1.5 you will see tht the ad is blocked but it didnt give you the screen space back but with firefox 1.07 and using the same filter, the ads are blocked and 100% of the screen space takes away by the ad, is given back, making the site load faster and have les clutter.
3.

Actual Results:  
firefox 1.5 blocked the ad but didnt give the screen space back

but with firefox 1.07, ad wa blocked and 100% of screen space taken away by the ad is returned.

Expected Results:  
firefox 1.5 should have blocked the ads the same way firefox 1.07 did
