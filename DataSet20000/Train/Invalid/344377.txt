I recently enabled XkbOptions ctrl:swapcaps in my xorg.conf, which makes the caps lock key behave as a ctrl key (and the left ctrl behave as caps lock).  The close window keyboard shortcut ctrl+shift+w does not do anything now when I used the caps lock key as a ctrl.

Strangely, all the other shortcut keys I've tried still work fine with the caps lock key as a ctrl.  This even includes other ctrl+shift combinations, such as ctrl+shift+z for redo.  Also I can still ctrl+shift+w if I use the right ctrl key instead of the caps lock key.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add 'Option "XkbOptions" "ctrl:swapcaps"' to the keyboard section of xorg.conf
2. Restart X; caps lock key is now really a ctrl key
3. In Firefox, hold caps+shift and press w (which should be the same as ctrl+shift+w)

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
The currently focused Firefox window should close.
