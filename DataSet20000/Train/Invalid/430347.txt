Mac Proto, Back/Forward button menus do the same thing?

Proto 0.17.3 / Leopard.
1. I am now afraid to click my back button. A menu appears every time (yes, single left click). Why? Backing up quickly is now painfully slow and unbearable. The back button should be single click to go back without the history appearing

2. Clicking on either the back or forward buttons, produces the same menu! The function of both buttons is now the same!

3. The drop-down to the right of the forward button, produces the same button again!

I have three buttons here, that all open the exact same menu!
This is insane.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get a Mac
2. Download Firefox 3b5 & the latest Proto
3. visit some sites and click the back button.
Actual Results:  
A menu appears with your position in the recent history.
(The forward button, and drop-down arrow button do the same)

Expected Results:  
The browser navigates back without showing the menu

Am I doing something very wrong here, that makes this happen?
