After landing of https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=345466 icons in Options look like they were pieced together from different themes and have an incoherent look and feel.  This bug is about providing a consistent looking set of icons for Options (as well as the rest of FF, that actually looks like a visual refresh and not visual chaos) that don't look circa 1990.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Launch FF
2) Observe that the "refreshed" icons are washed out and don't fit well with recent versions of Windows
3) Navigate to Tools-> Options and observe that the icons look circa 1990 and feel like they were pieced together from different sources/themes

Actual Results:  
Disappointment.

Expected Results:  
A well thought out 2006 look and feel that fits with Windows
