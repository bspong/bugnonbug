A person had visited his website from my computer using Firefox, my email addresses was also mentioned in the list for ID's when asking for authentication for password in his website. Today when I tried to access my google account a person's ID was also listed for authentication along with my  Cloucomp@rediffmail.com ID. 
This name is not listed in tools for security where passwords are listed with User ID.
Please not I am no expert in software so my explanation could be a bit incomplete.

Reproducible: Always
