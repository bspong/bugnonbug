Transparency issue with absolute positioning
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.17; Mac_PowerPC)

I am writing a web page where I am using absolute positioning to place a small 
GIF on the (invisible) border of a DIV.  I ahve given the GIF a negative 
z-index.  This displays porperly in every browser I've tried so far (including 
Firefox for XP), but NOT in Firefox for OS X!  The GIF is invisible, unless I 
give it a positive z-index, in which case it obscures the text.  I want the 
text to sit over the GIF, which it indeed renders correctly in Safari, Explorer 
(Windows & Mac), Firefox Windows, and a recent version of Mozilla.

I can make the GIF a background image, but then it will not show past the 
border of the DIV in any browser, so I need to use z-index.  I have assigned 
backgroun: transparent or background-color: transparent various times (grasping 
at straws), but to no avail.

Because most of my clients are photographers, they tend to use Macs, so this is 
a problem.  If it didn't work in every other browser, I'd think it was me, but 
maybe it's not.

I ahve not uploaded the web page yet, so no URL, but it's a farily simple 
problem; I hope the description I gave will suffice.
