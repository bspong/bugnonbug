Tweak the shadow on the right pane of the Firefox menu
The right pane of the Firefox menu is currently using a shadow created with an inset box-shadow.  We should switch to using border colors so that we can make sure that it is perfectly native.

This effect will be used in a few different places in our windows theme, so other bugs will later be pointing over here as a reference.
