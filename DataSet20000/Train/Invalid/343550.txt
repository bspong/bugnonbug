Alt+arrow does not work when inline search button is hidden
- Put this code in userChrome.css:
/* Hide the search button */
.search-go-button-container {
  display: none !important;
}
/* Without the search button, the search engine image needs a margin */
.searchbar-engine-image {
  margin: 2px !important;
}
- Run Firefox and press alt + arrow down
- Result: nothing happens

Code once found somewhere in a Mozillazine forum topic for desperate search button haters.
