After clicking the Clear button in Privacy in Preferences, the button is greyed
out. However, you can still click it again. Typically the greyed out status of a
button means that you cannot click it. (The button is depressed when clicked)

1. Go to Tools, Options, Privacy
2. Pick any Clear button and click it 
3. Click again

Actual Results:  
The button can be clicked again despite it being greyed out.

Expected Results:  
The user should not be allowed to click the button. By click, I mean the button
appearing as depressed upon click.
