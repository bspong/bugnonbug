Some Flash animations can receive focus with the tab key (without clicking inside).

So :
- it's impossible to exit when the focus is in Flash animation 
- it's impossible to reach HTML links after Flash animation

Other examples :
- http://www.ter-sncf.com/ (France Map and advertisements)
- http://www.spie-job.com/ (World Map and video player)

But these Flash animations can still not receive focus without mouse click inside :

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go on the page ;
2. Use the tab key until the video player ;
3. When focus is on Flash animation, it is impossible to exit or to reach next HTML links.
Actual Results:  
Flash video player can receive focus with the tab key (without clicking inside).
Next HTML links can't receive focus with the tab key.

Expected Results:  
On FF 3.6 and less, Flash animations could not receive without mouse click in it.

But the ideal would be to continue the tabulation on the HTML elements located after Flash animation.
