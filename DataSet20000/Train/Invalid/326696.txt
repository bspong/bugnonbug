FireFox displays the font set in advanced settings (TOOLS | OPTIONS | CONTENT | FONTS & COLORS | ADVANCED) when TOOLS | OPTIONS | CONTENT | FONTS & COLORS | ADVANCED | "Allow pages to choose their own fonts" is checked (whereas, assumably, the checked option should cause FireFox to honor the fonts specified in the style sheet of the URL.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set font in advanced setting to a font different than specified in css.2.Check TOOLS | OPTIONS | CONTENT | FONTS & COLORS | ADVANCED | Allow pages to choose their own fonts.3. Visit/refresh URL to find that css font is not displayed; instead, the font specified in advanced settings is displayed.
Actual Results:  
FireFox displays in the font specified in TOOLS | OPTIONS | CONTENT | FONTS & COLORS | ADVANCED.

Expected Results:  
Fonts specified in the style sheet of the URL should be displayed.

The assumed/desired functionality of course is the default behavior of IE. As failure to honor the css of the site/URL is a *major* adversity to the efforts of web developers (of course, there may be some error in the cited URLs), IMHO, fixing this flaw should multiply FF market share, because this issue (or lack of documentation on how to accomplish the desired support of css) constitutes a critical, major complaint against the otherwise very respectable functionality of FF.
