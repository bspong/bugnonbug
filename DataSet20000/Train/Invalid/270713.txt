FireFox reports an Alert " the operation timed out when attempting to connect to www.radical.ca".  The website works in IE.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1

This is a functioning website that loads and behaves normally in IE but not in
FireFox.  I doubt that Radical Entertainment would block the use of Mozilla on
their website.  

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type http://www.radical.ca in the navigation bar
2. Press Enter
3. Wait for above alert message - click ok and retry

Actual Results:  
The same result as previously stated - this website won't load.

Expected Results:  
Laoded the website and allowed full browsing of its contents.

I think if you can't get to a normally coded website that's a huge problem. 
This is not the first website that I've found that gets this alert message so I
will try to list the others.  Initially I thought it was the websites but I
happened to check www.radcial.ca in IE and discovered the problem was with FireFox.
