zoom-in command key combination doesn't work for japanese keyboards
Using the English localization of FF4 with a Japanese keyboard, the zoom-in key combination doesn't function correctly.  

Steps (requires a Japanese keyboard):

1. Open a page in an English build of FF4
2. Enter Cmd-+ (i.e. <command>, <shift>, <;/+> keys together)

Expected result: zoom-in
Result: nothing happens

With either Safari or Chrome (English) this zooms in.  Ditto for Firefox 3.6en.
