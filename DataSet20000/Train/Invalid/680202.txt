Firefox 6.0 blank icons in tabs on addons screen (Mac OS X)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:5.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0.1
Build ID: 20110707182747

Steps to reproduce:

I have updated Firefox 5.0.1 PT-BR to 6.0 PT-BR in Mac OS X 10.6.8.


Actual results:

When I open the Addons screen, the icons in the menu tab on the left were blank, except the first. If I point at the place where the icons are supposed to be and I click, the tab is selected and the content is presented to the right side.


Expected results:

When I open the Addons screen, the icons should be in place and visible.
