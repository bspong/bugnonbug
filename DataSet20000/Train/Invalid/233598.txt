Pulldown menus when adding bookmark don't fully reflect folders available

When adding a new bookmark, a pane opens inviting a title and destination folder
for it.
Clicking the arrow for the pulldown menu of available folders to place the new
bookmark in only displays a small number of those that have been created.
Typically five of the fifteen I have on my system at present.
You have to place the bookmark anywhere and then drag it in the pane to the
correct folder.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open bookmark pane, which displays available folders
2.CTRL-D to bring up the add bookmark pane
3.click the arrow to display available destination folders

Actual Results:  
Only 5 of some 15 folders shown, with no scrollbar allowing more to be seen

Expected Results:  
Preferably all available folders should appear but at least a scroll facility

Workaround is to save anywhere and then drag bookmark where it's really wanted
