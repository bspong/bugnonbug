Firefox takes back focus after mouse moved into and out of Firefox window

I'm using twm, but I do not have NoTitleFocus set.  I move the mouse from window A across Firefox to window B.  After twm has already set the focus to window B, Firefox sets the focus to itself.  Now my keystrokes go to Firefox instead of window B, even though the mouse is in window B.  I have to move out of and back into B to get the focus set to B.

This happens even if I'm viewing about:blank.

I suspect this is the problem that the time argument to XSetInputFocus is supposed to fix, so perhaps it is not being called with the right value.

I'm sorry if this is the same as bug 88810.  As best I can tell, that one has to do with popping up windows or refreshing pages, whereas this one occurs just with the mouse entering the window (perhaps triggering a FocusIn event which causes a race in XSetInputFocus calls).


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Put two other X Windows with a small gap between them on top of Firefox.
2. Move mouse between the other two windows at various speeds.
3. Sometimes Firefox ends up with focus instead of window with mouse.
(If other windows are xev windows, you can see FocusOut event where Firefox takes focus from other window.)
Actual Results:  
Focus in firefox.

Expected Results:  
Focus in window with mouse.
