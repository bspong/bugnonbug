Certain web pages won't display in any web browser, they work on other computers using the same router

When I try to go to certain web pages they just don't work. I tried them on IE, Safari, and Google Chrome and none of them worked either. No error messages or anything. It says "Done" in the bottom-left corner but the screen is white. On other computers using the same router the pages work fine. Some examples would be: http://www.gaiaonline.com , http://zwinky.com , and http://www.imvu.com used to not work but now it's working fine... 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get on this computer and go to one of the above sites.
Actual Results:  
Blank screen, but says, "Done" in the bottom-left corner

Expected Results:  
Web pages should have loaded

I accidentally dropped the laptop a few times in case that may have anything to do with it...
