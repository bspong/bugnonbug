1. Toolbar could be improved (more compact (height) and better icons like Internet Explorer. Firefox icons looks poor)

2. Can't close Firefox Windows with wheel mouse button (I can do it from Internet Explorer) I have set the wheel button to close windows from "Microsoft IntelliPoint".

3. When I organize a bookmark folder (by name) the list dissapear and I have to enter again to the folder list to organize more bookmark folders.
I have a lot of bookmark folders...


Reproducible: Always
