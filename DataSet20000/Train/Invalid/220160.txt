Using simultaneously two web applications on same host but different porst
causes authorization step each time after switching applications. It seems that
Mozilla uses the same cookie to store jsessionid, skipping port context. I'am
not fluent about cookie mechanism but on IE5.5 it works fine. Is it part of
standard to use port number as context or M$' extension?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Establish IP forwarding from localhost to two different webapps requiring
authorisation, using two different ports.
2. Open two Mozilla's tabs or windows for these two apps using localhost URL
3. Try browse simultaneously these two applications
Actual Results:  
Each switching requires authorization

Expected Results:  
Remember two different contexts (not only host but port number too).
