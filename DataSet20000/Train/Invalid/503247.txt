Script lockup leads to "not responding" message without content to read or select [caused by Torbutton]
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090624 Firefox/3.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I have only experienced this while playing NexusWar so far. A script there is implemented to sort the listed entries by name, but takes too long and leads to the not responding message, which then appears without any content (see screenshot).
When clicking the X to close the message, sometimes it appears again with content; then mentioning http://www.nexuswar.com/r/js/jquery/jquery.tablesorter.min.js:2
it IS possible to move the message pane given by FF, but it is NOT possible to click blank into it or press ENTER to get any respond to end it. only X allows to close it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
as i have only experienced it in NexusWar this may be hard to reproduce without the required numbers of pets/items there

1. script to sort huge numbers of items maybe inclusive ajax
2. masses of lines/items to sort
3. run both
Actual Results:  
The message which appears does not show any content, nor does it give buttons to select from. only it's headline is shown.

Expected Results:  
it should show a message and give the URL to the not responding script, plus leave two buttons to select to end the script or not.

i am running several plugins, such as AdBlock and NoScript. but both are disabled on NexusWar and both should not lead to this result given.
This is a new problem. it did not appear with earlier versions of FF.
