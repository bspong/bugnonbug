My sister is having a problem on her laptop.  I believe she had a previous
version before version 1.0.2.  She just updated to version 1.0.3 and the page is
blank.  What more additional information do you need?

Reproducible: Didn't try



Expected Results:  
The software should have allowed a webpage to come up instead of a blank page.

When she updated to 1.0.3 from the version before 1.0.2 it installed fine but
when Mozilla Firefox was opened up the page came up blank.
