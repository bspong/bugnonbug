"Reverse Page Order" print option state is not saved (or is ignored)

The state of the print option is ignored when Firefox starts (or when the print dialog is activated).

Starting with a clean user prefs, this print option is checked the first time the print dialog is used. Unchecking this option results in printouts in normal order, as expected.

The value is saved - looking at about:config and you can see the key 'print.print_reverse' is now set to false.

Activating the print dialog again still has the option checked, ignoring the user's setting. Restarting Firefox does not help. It must be manually unchecked every time the user wants to print with normal page ordering.

Reproducible: Always

Expected Results:  
The print dialog should respect 'print.print_reversed' setting.
