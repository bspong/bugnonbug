FireFox 2 rc 2 asks for "Is not default browser" again and again.

I have install the FireFox RC2. It asked me, that it is not default browser. I pushed to make it default. Next time i have run it, it showed me this message again. And again. I even unchecked the "don't ask me next time", but nothing happened - same message again and again.

I have installed new Firefox 2 RC 2 without previous uninstall previous 1.xx. But in other directory.
Direct running of old Firefox (1.xx) goes well.

Firefox is best ! Kick'em all !!! :)
