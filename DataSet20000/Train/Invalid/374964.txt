Page opening causes C++ buffer overrun resulting in aborting of Firefox (apparently due to Spyware Doctor)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: Firefox 2.0.0.3

Same as John Chirigos--On initializing, the first display page causes a window to pop up indicating a C++ runtime error - buffer overflow which aborts Firefox. This is new as I have been using version 2 for a while. It must be some interference from another program or a windows update. I uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox several times and got the same problem.  Using PC Tools antivirus and Spyware Doctor spyware.

Open display page in Firefox.  It aborts every time indicating C++ buffer overrun error


Software used to open every page every time.  Change is recent, though after installation of PC Tools antivirus a couple of weeks ago.  Have been using Firefox 2.0 all along and just updated to latest version.
