Memory leak... If opened for 2.5 hours, memory usage (which already is high) goes up from about 100MB to 210MB or so... Performance of the system is affected very badly. Loading pages gets slower and slower, system starts hanging. When uncaught, memory leak leads to hard reboot (power off - power on) leading to data corruption and loss). I have to restart fx every 2 hours (unacceptable workaround) to avoid any 'accidents'... 

Reproducible: Always

Expected Results:  
minimal and effective memory usage. 

system is ubuntu 5.10; installed using tar file. Marked security issue as bad memory handling is a very 'nice' door for exploitation...
