Firefox uses more CPU time than necessary and tends to drain batteries

On MacOS X, Firefox appears to use CPU time for doing nothing.  Each open document adds roughly 1% additional CPU time, even when there are no animated images or Javascript or anything active.  Absolutely nothing is going on, but Firefox is using CPU time.  Why?  Compare this to Safari, which uses almost zero CPU time for the same set of web pages.  I guess this is because Safari is properly event-driven, while I'm guessing that Firefox is doing a lot of polling.

This makes Firefox hostile to notebook users.
