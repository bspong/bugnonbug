The pop-up appears on my screen and whether I mark "enable" or "disable", after the action I must conclude my bookmarks ALL disappeared. 
Happened already 10 times and I have to retrieve them all manually.
I don't want to see this pop-up ever again.
Remark : The whole text of the pop-up is written in English.
           The last sentence is written in some Scandinavian language.
             Is this normal?
