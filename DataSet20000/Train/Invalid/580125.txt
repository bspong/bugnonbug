"ADD TO CART" does not work.  Using INTERNET EXPLORER it does work.  My conclusion is that there must be a bug in FIREFOX.  Bigpond is run by the largest Telco in Australia so I would think they have the expertise to correctly code their website and it is in Firefox's interest to resolve the problem.  I have also informed Bigpond of this issue.

Reproducible: Always

1.Go to URL
2.Try to add something to a cart
3.Use IE and repeat steps 1 and 2 to prove the problem 
Actual Results:

Expect entry in cart usinf Firefox.
