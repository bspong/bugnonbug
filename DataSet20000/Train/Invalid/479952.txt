Ubuntu Firefox uses en-GB by default instead of en-US
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009020518 Ubuntu/9.04 (jaunty) Firefox/3.0.6

It seems that en-US packaged versions of Firefox for Linux are using British English language packs rather than American English language packs.

As an American, I feel deeply offended by the British spellings that are constantly being recommended by the menus and spell check.

I am able to replicate this with both distro-packaged and Mozilla-issued builds.
