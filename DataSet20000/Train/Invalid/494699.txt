http://www.mainz05.de/ crashes on load if javascript is enabled. More precisely, the only means I found to /not/ make the page crash was to disable js, which however results in a page with not much content, so its possible that the cause for the crash is something other than js (i.e. post-loaded with Ajax).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.mainz05.de/
2. FF dies



1. FF says no crash dump was created, and there was no other indication of what precisely caused the crash.
2. Page causes FF to crash no matter regardless of whether the URL was typed in, or a link from another page.
3. The website appears in the restore list. If not unchecked there, FF will immediately crash again.

Apologies for not being more precise than this. Its all I could figure out.
