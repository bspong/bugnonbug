width="100%-150" is interpreted as width="150", works fine in IE6
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1

On the page http://www.cloverdalesoapboxderby.com, which I run, the content on
the right should extend to the right side of the screen using width="100%-150"
because the div on the left is 150px.  This code works fine in IE6 and Safara. 
The problem seems to be that Firefox does not accept math in it's width and
height properties.  It should appear the way it does in Safari and IE6 (not if
running SP2, that's a totaly different problem with a JavaScript height code).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Make a site with a div and set the width to width="100%-150" so that there is a
150px space.
Actual Results:  
The div becomes 150px wide instead of 150px short of 100%

Expected Results:  
calculated the width (1024 - 150 = 874)
IE6 and Safari do this just fine

If you check the site in IE with SP2 you will notice the content is short, that
is not my problem, that's an SP2 problem that I am also looking into concerning
a JavaScript div resize code.
