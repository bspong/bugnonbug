The gnome file browser widget that firefox uses to choose the helper application is not only terrible from a UI standpoint, but is not properly integrated with firefox.

Bug: if I type /usr/bin/xmm, the widget tab completes for me to /usr/bin/xmms; however if I press enter, firefox gets /usr/bin/xmm back, and complains.

Terrible-UI-ness: if I browse to /usr/bin (and why, as an end user, should I have to know about /usr/bin anyway?) it takes easily 15 seconds before it renders the list of applications in that folder. It's simply the worst file browser that I've ever seen. Why can't firefox instead use the open desktop menu standards, so that the user can pick and application from the gnome/kde/fluxbox/whatever menu? (Of course "advanced" users can be catered to with a text entry "advanced" option.) 

The widget really is terrible. Rather than fixing this bug, you should just dump it.

Reproducible: Always
