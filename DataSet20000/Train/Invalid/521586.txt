Make Pie-chart throbber color full
Make Pie-chart throbber color full.
if you are on a fast connection you may not see the Pie correctly, 
Instead you may see a glimpse of final circle.
Which gave me an impression that there is some thing wrong in tab icon painting.

So make it color full. 
1. either by different color at different % load.
2. make the circle with segments of different colors
