downloaded and installed latest version firefox      no problem
then installed add ons  stumble on   weather  and weather channel. com
had to do reboot.
now when firefox  is maximised the vertical and horizontal scroll bar is missing
window appears truncated as more info is displayed on right side but can't expand to see it.
also when minimized to less than full screen same problem both horizontal and 
vertical scroll bars are missing.
at some sites can use tab key to scroll down.
built in help section has nothing about this.
drop down menu   "view"  select full  screen  restores right side vertical scroll bar.  BUT epands so large vertical can not click on upper border to move entire window up or down oe sideways to display desktop. also it expands so large as to hide the windows system lower status bar.
I did not see anything in the online forums pertaining to this, but may have missed it.
Please send me an email if there is a forum subject on this or another way to resolve it at   jay_krik@yahoo.com    for now it's bacl to I.E.  for me
