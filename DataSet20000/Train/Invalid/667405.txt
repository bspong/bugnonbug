No URL shown after "Open in new window"

Steps to reproduce:

I opened a web-page in a new window. This was done both (a) from bookmarks and right-clicking to get "open in a new window" and (b) from a hyperlink in the same way.

This occurred on openSUSE 11.4, KDE 4.6.4 and also on openSUSE 12.1-M2. Versions of FF5 were up to 5.0-4.1. The problem does not occur in FF4.0.1.


Actual results:

The window opened correctly but the Navigation Toolbar showed "go to a website."
I tried clicking on "reload" but that was inactive and also tried right-clicking on the window to get "reload" in the drop-down menu but it was greyed out.


Expected results:

The URL of the web-page should have been shown.
