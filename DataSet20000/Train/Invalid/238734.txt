The 'Add Site' input field allows junk values to be stored. 
The field also rejects a huge field when it contains invalid domain names while
allows other small valid/invalid field.
 


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit the Firefox browser and click on to tools. Click the option button and
go to web features. Click the add site button.
2.A blank text field appears that asks for addresses of web sites.
3.Fill the text field with a valid web site address as an input.
4.Input into the field a huge character field, alphanumeric and numeric inputs.
Observe the result.
5.Leave the field blank, press ‘enter’ and observe the result


Actual Results:  
The input field rejects a huge character field as an invalid entry but accepts
similar values as inputs when added in small data sets. 

Expected Results:  
The field should not accept any junk values and should filter input by
delimiters such as a dot (.), domain names such as .com, .edu etc and also by
protocols such as http:// or ftp:// or even www. 

Follow up tests:
1) We tried entering huge character field into the input field.Tried entering
blank field into the input field.
2) Tested other famous browser with huge text field, however it does not accept
such huge fields dueto fixed character length.

Importance of bug:
1)Junk values can be input into the input field. Therefore any text can be
entered into the field.Large values may overflow the buffer.This being an
important feature of the program should be fixed.
