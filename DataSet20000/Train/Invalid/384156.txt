On gmail with chat enabled 100% CPU very frequent

I use Gmail constantly. If Y use the chat enabled version, I get freezes for 10, 30 seconds, or even a minute.
Firefox goes all gray and the CPU monitor goes all the way up to 100%, Then everything is back to normal , but It doesn't last , and the problem goes up again.

It all goes away if I chose to use gmail without chat, and comes back if I get the chat enabled version.

Having google talk open in a popup windows does not produced the problem.

The situation is new: no more than two weeks and I think it goes back to the last time Firefox auto-udpated.

Reproducible: Always

1.log onto gmail with chat enabled
2.open a mail
3.click on answer and start typing a few words : freeze
Actual Results:  
Firefox goes gray (but not always) and the cpu jumps to 100%
