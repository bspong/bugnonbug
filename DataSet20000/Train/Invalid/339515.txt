on 5/27/06 did updates on 4 or 5 of my extensions. when the update finished, i restarted firefox as stated. after starting firefox again, any web page that i go to get's zoomed, making pictures and fonts larger and distorted (as i viewing pixels due to its size). updates were for; CookieSafe, MediaPlayerConnectivity, and Tidy Browser. i know there was one or two more but i dont remember.
