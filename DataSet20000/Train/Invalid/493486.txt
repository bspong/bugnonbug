in this page we have a blast that work with Ajax technolgy I think,
Today I installed these add ones:
Gmail notifier,dictionary(English to Persian and Persian to English,Google preview)
after those when I click on edit blast link I saw this tag:<mj> a word </mj>
I tried it with IE and I don't have same problem.
