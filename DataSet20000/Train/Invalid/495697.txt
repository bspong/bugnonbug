adware window opens every ~10 clicks in firefox, but not with other browsers

I've used firefox for ~4 years, no problems before. for the last week, on clicking links I've used before, the links works as normal but a new window opens with an advert in it. All firefox popup options set to prevent popups. This does not happen with IE5, google chrome or safari.
The new window in windows task manager is associated with process "gesayic.exe", if this process is closed, the new window closes. 
The links which seem to cause to problem are just normal ones I use all the time. 
Tried deinstalling firefox and installing new download of version 3.0.10. The very first link I clicked on cause an advert window to appear.
PLEASE help, I love firefox but not with the adverts.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start firefox, click on links typical for me (BBC, ..., nothing special )
2.about 1 in 10 or 20 clicks opens an advert window.
3.if I close the advert window, click the back button in firefox and try again, the advert window opens again.
Actual Results:  
Ad window opens. (The item advertised looks fairly benign from companies I may have heard of)

Expected Results:  
followed the clicked link to destination but no ad window should open

I've gone through a support session with norton as I run norton 360. Their technician said that it is a firefox thread which is opened so I must contact you guys.
Bug listed as major as it is really spoiling firefox browsing, I am using Safari for now but please rescue me !!
