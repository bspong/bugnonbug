browser.tabs.forceHide: true doesn't work
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

If I set browser.tabs.forceHide to be true (either in user.js or via
about:config) and restart Firefox, the tab bar is hidden, and by looking in
about:config I can see that it's still true. But then if I type Ctrl-T (new tab)
the tab bar appears, and re-examining about:config shows that the setting has
flipped back to false.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See details.

Actual Results:  
Tab bar appears on Ctrl-T; forceHide gets reset to false.

Expected Results:  
Tab bar should stay hidden; forceHide should be unaffected.
