If firefox is fullscreen and I have several tabs open there is a tiny space above the tabs that does nothing when you click on it. If the tabs went all the way to the top of the window it would be easier to click on them.  Right now I often miss the tab because I click in the tiny space above the tab.

Reproducible: Always
