XHTML does not properly process CCDATA and angle bracket error.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

When I put a CCDATA section inside a <td> element in XHTML, I expected the contents of the CCDATA section to be treated as unparsed text and displayed as text.  Instead, nothing is displayed.

Also, I would expect a "4 < 5" to be flagged as an XML error.  Instead, both "4 lt; 5" and "4 < 5" are allowed.

I would expect that the XHTML would be required to pass as a valid XML document.  If I change the extension of the file to .xml, Firefox does treat it as XML and says it is invalid.  Why doesn't Firefox require XHTML to be valid XML?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Open attached document.
Actual Results:  
CCDATA text is not displayed.  '<' is not parsed as an error.



Expected Results:  
Firefox should display CCDATA contents as text (when the other XML violations are fixed).

Firefox should require XHTML documents to be valid XML.
