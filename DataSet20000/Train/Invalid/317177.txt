I used Google constantly when web searching -  when I click on a link, website, etc on the search page the color DOES NOT change --  I'm lost I cannot keep up with what sites I visited and which ones I have not.  It's very frustrating.  Everything stays the same.

I've gone to:  "Tool, Options - Fonts: Colors Links visited not visited" and everything is set correctly...............   HELP!!!  PLEASE........  I have Windows XP  and my husband has his entire side of the computer as well.  He has the same problem.  Thank you, thank you.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on any link - home page, any page, especially doing a Google search
2. The color does not change indicating that link has been hit / visited
3.




What more can be done.   Please, I need the color change so I know what I've visited!

Thankssssssssssssssssss
