user pref to disable middlemouse scrolling does not work

I make extensive use of the middle mouse button to paste in urls.  
On firebird the first click of the middle button brings up the scrolling 
symbol as in IE. Found this pref 
"user_pref("middlemouse.scrollbarPosition", false);" 
which seems like it should disable this behavior.  It does not have the affect
I'm looking for. 

Is this broken, or am I just using the wrong pref?

Thanks,


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.any middle click in firebird brings up the IE style scrolling
2.
3.



Expected Results:  
Allowed me to disable this behavior.
