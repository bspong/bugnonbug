print to file overwrites without prompting

(originally from the Red Hat Bugzilla, see URL above)

In firefox 3 in Rawhide, when you select "Print to File" as the printer and
specify the name of a file that already exists, it happily overwrites that file
without prompting for confirmation.  Mozilla used to ask for confirmation, as
does Seamonkey; I can't remember whether older versions of Firefox asked for
confirmation.
