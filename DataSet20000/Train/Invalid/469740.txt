When I come to a website like Google another tab opens and displays a 404 Not Found error.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1b2) Gecko/20081201 Firefox/3.1b2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1b2) Gecko/20081201 Firefox/3.1b2

When i go to Google or Mozilla FireFox opens a new tab with the url http://url.adtrgt.com/cpv.jsp?p=110380&aid=463&ip=203.212.150.118&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen-us.www.mozilla.com%2Fen-US%2Ffirefox%2F3.1b2%2Fwhatsnew%2F&selectedKeyword=ron&selectedListingId=7400262&default=http%3A%2F%2Fgallimp.com%2Fsoft_fail%3Fc%3Dmg_ron%26b%3D1.8%26affid%3D170802%26cuid%3Decaf4830c6b811ddb89000304890471a%26rid%3D591040. I don't think its something to do with the website because it doesn't happen on Internet Explorer or Netscape.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go on to Firefox and go to Google.com.au and search something.
2.A new tab will come up and go to the website.

Actual Results:  
Redirects to a search website I believe by the words in the url. 

Expected Results:  
Went to Google and searched without anything happening without my permisson
