Blue Screen of Deadth

Immediately after an automatic (complete) update from 2.0.0.2 to 2.0.0.3 on 2007-03-22 00:23:00 a blue screen of death came up.

Reportedly an I/O privilege error in the kerio firewall driver.

The (relatively newly setup) system has run about two weeks without trouble with firefox 2.0.0.2 and a couple of other modules transfering data over the internet. 

The crash repeated every time i started firefox, but then only after a few minutes up to an hour of surfing. It could be possible, that it occures only after firefox being started and then stopped one time and then started again.

I had not yet the nerves to try it out over and over for verification, because - you know - blue screens of death in windows xp may be much more deadly than under earlier versions of this os. I was glad enougth to find a backup of a 2.0.0.2 installation.

After switching back to the earlier version, the blue screens were gone.
At the moment, the system already runs again for six hours with starting/stopping firefox every few minutes dozen of times the evening without any trouble.

Thus, it looks like you have introduced a serious error into the code of the 2.0.0.3 version. The firewall is definitely not the cause of the problem: It is a "good old" kerio personal firewall, working for me and others now for - i thing - 5 years throughout windows 98, windows nt, windows 2000 and windows xp on a big range of hardware and every and all applications, including firefox as the preferred browser.

The sites i visited are free from complex things, namely "http://www.heise.de".
I use a few addons (noscript, refcontrol, showip).
All this is absolutely unrelated to the error, because these sites and modules are usable resp. working since ages without any trouble.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Update Firefox (en) from 2.0.0.2 to 2.0.0.3
2. use it under windows xp

Actual Results:  
Blue Screen of Death with reportedly an I/O privilege error in the firewall driver

Expected Results:  
well - neither a blue screen nor an I/O privilege error

circumventable by downgrading to 2.0.0.2
