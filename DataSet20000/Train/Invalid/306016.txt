Fails to follow link when page served as application/xhtml+xml

If you click on the "add new item" menu at
http://www.ph.unimelb.edu.au/~cwitte/test.xhtml and then select an item from the
menu, hte menu closes but it fails to follow the link. If the page is served as
html instead of application/xhtml+xml, see
http://www.ph.unimelb.edu.au/~cwitte/test.html, the problem disappears. The
xhtml and css both validate.
Curiously if you use the javascript debugger and put a breakpoint in the
function resetButton(), then the link gets followed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open http://www.ph.unimelb.edu.au/~cwitte/test.xhtml
2. click on "add new item"
3. select "document" from the menu
4. menu closes but link fails to get followed
5. open javascript debugger and set breakpoint in function resetButton()
6. click on "add new item"
7. select "document" from the menu
8. menu closes and link gets followed (nb. the file that is linked to doesn't
exist) 

Actual Results:  
Link fails to be follwed without the breakpoint set in the debugger

Expected Results:  
Followed the link.
