After you start firefox and start typing address to location bar, it freezes for a couple of seconds in the middle of typing. 

I supposse it is loading history/whatever data for the autocomplete. It is quite annoying, you are not able to enter the address util Firefox decides it is finished with loading of autocomplete data.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start firefox
2. start typing in location bar as soon as possible

Actual Results:  
freeze for couple of seconds in middle of the typing

Expected Results:  
let me type my address! :)
