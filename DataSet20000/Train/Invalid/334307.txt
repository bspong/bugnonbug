Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. deleted cache
2. Viewed in both firefox and I.E.
3. Openned page multiply times, had others open too

Actual Results:  
script doesnt function in firefox
script functions in IE

Expected Results:  
Firefox should read the script like it does my mouseover script...
