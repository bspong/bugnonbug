When opening up a new tab by double clicking or using the Ctrl-T shortcut Firefox fails to autofocus on the url so that a user can begin typing in an address. The cursor blinks in the address bar but it will not receive keystrokes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open up a new tab by either double clicking with the mouse or using Ctrl-T
2.Begin typing in a website i.e. www.google.com

Actual Results:  
The address bar does not display the characters that are typed. 

Expected Results:  
The address bar to display the characters that are typed.

This is happening with a clean install of Firefox 3.
