pageshow event does not fire when changing from one tab to another. works in FF 1.5

The code below is a stripped down paraphrase of code in an extension.

Under FF 1.5, the pageshow event fires whenever the user changes the viewed tab, whether by clicking on the tab's tab or by using Control PgUp/PgDn.

Under FF 2.0, the event does not appear to fire when the tab is changed.

One must wonder, then, the best way to find out whether the tab has changed or not.

Extension may be required. But this problem may happen on a normal page, too.

Tested on a Linux box, but there is reason to suppose that this bug is true on a Windows box, too. (The extension's use of the pageshow event does not work on a FF 2.0 on the Windows box.)

var thingee = {
    onPageShow              :   function(e)
    {
      alert("huh");
    }
    
    };

window.addEventListener("pageshow", function(e) { thingee.onPageShow(e); },    true);


Reproducible: Always
