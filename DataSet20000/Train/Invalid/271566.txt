If you're entering data in a form, and switch to another application (to do
copy/paste for example), when you come back to FF, the focus is no longer on the
form control you were editing (actually I can't determine where the focus goes).
This makes it impossible to use third-party tools that accelerate this process
(such as PasswordMinder for secured password storage,
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pwdmind/).


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Google home page. 
2. Start typing on the search box
3. Alt+Tab to another application
4. Alt+Tab back to FF
5. Try to continue typing. Focus is no longer on the search box.

Actual Results:  
Can't type in the form control that had the focus before.

Expected Results:  
Retain proper focus. 

This used to work in beta versions of FF. I only got this problem after
installing v1.
