There is no way to immediately start Advanced Search. Only after the user types some words in the basic mode can he use advanced queries. If he doesn't want to use any strings but only other constraints which I don't think is uncommon, there is no way to access Advanced Search directly. It is unfortunate and this use case should be handled better. 

In addition to that, the (+) button on the far right isn't noticeable enough and it's not clear that it is related to searching as it isn't associated with search field.
