Major Tab Browsing Problem.

Running firefox version 3.1b2.  RHEL 5, Linux ws-cm-17.jedcapital.com 2.6.18-8.el5 #1.

This worked fine in beta 1, I was prompted to update.  Updated firefox using firefox's built in update engine, and now I can't open ANY tabs.  Ctrl+T doesn't work, and going through the menu doesn't work either.  Ctrl+Click, and Middle click on link all fail.  Opening New windows does work though. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start firefox
2. open new tab.
3.
Actual Results:  
firefox acts like it's thinking then simple disregards the request and doesn't do anything.

Expected Results:  
a new tab to be opened.

Theme: Vista-Aero though I doubt it matters.
