SECURITY FLAWS MAJOR ISSUES!!!!!!!!!

Deleted cookies, and Password DO NOT get DELETED!!!

I recently installed SIW to run all my Computer History and CPU Performance. All the secret passwords stored in the MOZILLA do not get deleted. 
Mozilla: --> Under Tools , ---> Clear Private Data ---> Delete the Following ...
I checked everything there is to be deleted (Browsing History, Cache,Offline Website, password, cookies... all of them are checked). But when I ran SWI all the previous stored password on the Browser still shows up. 
Here is the example:
