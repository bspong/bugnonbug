I had an overloaded CPU malfunction this week ( 6/7th Dec 2010 ) which gave me heaps of trouble. My Task Manager showed the CPU running at 100% for periods far too long, when I opened FireFox. I tried all sorts of things to clear the problem but closing FireFox left me with CPU 50 – 55%, which slowed everything else down to almost stop. Using Safe Mode I was able to run SpyBotSD and discovered three entries in Documents and Settings which read something like this:

PlatinumAdvertiser/www.downloaditfree.com/avast..xyxy  etc etc…BOOKMARK

I concluded that Avast and FireFox were somehow connected and uninstalled the Avast application. But I was still stuck with slow PC functions. I got SpyBot up and running again and it rediscovered the same entries in Documents and Settings. SpyBot cannot “fix” this problem. I uninstalled FireFox with Revo Uninstaller which discovered/selected a whole raft of apparently infected files which I deleted as per instructions. There were something like 5000 items I deleted. My PC then started to behave properly with one exception. All my internet setting were lost and as I am no IT expert I had to resort to my ISP phoneline helper who finally discovered that the “DNS cache” was overloaded which I think in part, kept the CPU running at 100% !! A circular function of some sort I think. The DNS cache prevented my reconnecting to the net as well because the the cache function was preventing in the Windows connection “repair” function. My ISP helper got me to run a test in DOS mode which “flushed” the DNS cache ( as I understand it ). He also got the rest of my settings corrected and I am now back on line.

I hope that this is something your experts have already become aware of and can solve, as I really do like FireFox and ant to keep using it.
