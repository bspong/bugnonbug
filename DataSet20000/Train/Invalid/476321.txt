a) GOOGLE. This top search webpage, has literally solved our hands by automating the search box, by when you first write/type something, immediately appears the millions, thousands etc of results in the main window aside to the one you are typing plus the alternatine options that give you, and makes it easier to find what you are looking for or to continue. Now it's just a blank search box. In my safari, this works like a charm and worked also at the firefox 3.0.5 and all previous.
b) HOTMAIL.2 ISSUES // 1) Unfortunately with the beta 3.1, even if you have satellite line, you must have plenty of free time to navigate through your folders or to write a new e-mail. 2) Don't even think to attach a file! When you press the attach button in the main page of a new e-mail, you must ask  Merlin if the button "browse" will appear! If it appears (the chances are 1 to 10), the chances to open a window so to attach a file is 1 to 20! And of course this file firefox never upload it. Tried several times, even with 20kb files!
c) please check www.e-radio.gr . is the most popular website in greece with all the radiostations (fm + internet) located in greece. The same problem as firefox 3 in the beginning. Does not play those players. And please note that these are not only greek, is a system that is used worldwide of course

All the above I tried them with safari 3.2.1 and they work perfectly as they worked with all the previous versions of firefox
