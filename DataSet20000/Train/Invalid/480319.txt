When I have several tabs and one of these is a website created with frames, when I click on that tab, firefox starts to reload by self, the site dont have metatag refresh.

I have the problem (I think) The Skype addon 2.2.0.80, I have disabled it and the problems disappear.

This bug also cause a "error" when you open an image

2. Go to other tab (Website with NO frames)

Actual Results:  
Reload by it self. I dont request that reload and the website dont have a "auto-refres"

Expected Results:  
NOT autoreload

I have disabled Skype Version 2.2.0.80 and error disappear. I have posted this in http://www.mozilla-hispano.org/foro/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=3624&p=17324#p17324
