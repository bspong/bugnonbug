Start page can access chrome with javascript
This may be a bug with Ubuntu, in which case please close this bug. When Ubuntu loads Firefox 3.0.12, it starts at chrome://ubufox/content/startpage.html, which redirects to HOMEPAGE_ONLINE.

After redirected, type javascript:history.back(), or worse yet, type javascript:window.home() from any website, and the browser will navigate back into the chrome security context, which is improper behaviour. Combine this with a cross site scripting vulnerability and the attacker now has full security privileges.
