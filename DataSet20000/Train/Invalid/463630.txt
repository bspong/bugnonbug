Closing print preview with D,R gesture does not exit print preview, but it cannot be closed and normal menus and navigation cannot be recovered

After closing tab using mouse gesture while in print preview, print preview cannot be closed.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
  * Open one Firefox window with at least two tabs
  * Load different URLs in each tab
  * Select File->Print preview within first tab
    - Print preview appears within current window
  * Issue gesture D,R
    - Print preview disappears for current tab, and appears for next tab
  * Pressing Close does not return to normal view

Actual Results:  
When drawing mouse gesture, green mouse-trail does not appear (although it is configured to and does appear in normal browsing view).

There is no apparent way to close the print preview and get the menu bar and navigation bar back. Close button just does nothing.

Expected Results:  
Preferably:
 -- Mouse gesture D,R should close the print preview and not close the tab.

Alternatively:
 -- Mouse gesture D,R should close the tab and move print preview to the next tab (as it currently does), but Close button should still enable closing print preview and returning to normal browsing view.

Also, mouse gesture trail should appear in print-preview if configured to appear in normal view and mouse gestures are going to do something useful.

Haven't tried this with any other gesture extensions.
