Right click on link and open new window doesn't open link
When I right click on a link, and select Open Link in New Window, a new window opens, but with a blank page. My bookmarks toolbar is also missing, and the tabs appear below all the toolbars instead of above the address bar like my main window.

Firefox 6.0.2 (Been happening since the latest FF 5)
