Javascript-generated windows open with only three quarters of the width the window should have and those windows are not resizable.
The example website was tested without problems with 1.0.7 Debian GNU/Linux.
Same problem occurs on a variety of other sites, like kingdomofloathing.com (account required). The latter's windows normally are definitely resizable normally.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open site.
2. Click on one of the pictures
3. Let the window open.

Actual Results:  
The picture is cut from the left side at quite exactly three quarters, because the window cuts off there.

Expected Results:  
The picture should show all you can see on the thumbnail.
