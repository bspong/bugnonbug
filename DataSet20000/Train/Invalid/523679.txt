When selecting "All Bookmarks" folder options are disabled
Seen by Raymond while running Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.2b1) Gecko/20091019 Firefox/3.6b1 GTB6.

STR:
1. File | Organize Bookmarks
2. Select the All Bookmarks folder
3. Select Organize in the toolbar

Actual: The various options are disabled.
Expected: The various options would be enabled so I could add a new bookmark or folder from the top level.

Maybe since this is a top level folder this is by design but it would be good to know definitively.
