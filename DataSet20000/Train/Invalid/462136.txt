I have at least one tab. I open a new one either by CTRL+T or double-click in the tab area. The focus goes automatically the the adress bar (good). I type wharever URL there and it does not get opened in the new tab, but in the previous one!!

Then I can navigate back an forth by clicking in the navigation buttons and the actions are performed in the previous tab as well.
