Memory leak: closing gawker website tabs does not deallocate memory, add-ons may be involved

Firefox's memory use increases monotonically during browsing. I've had it up to 1.8GB with 3 tabs open.

I don't think this was a problem in RC1, but I only used RC1 for a day or two so I can't be sure.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Browser
2. Open every Gawker website: gawker.com, gizmodo.com, lifehacker.com, kotaku.com, jezebel.com, jalopnik.com, deadspin.com.
3. Weep as the pageouts begin; closing tabs does not save you.
Actual Results:  
For me doing it just now, memory use for firefox-bin increased from 14% to 42%, and dropped back down to 36% several minutes after closing the tabs. On net, browser memory use increased nearly a gigabyte.

Expected Results:  
Browser deallocates most of the 1.1 gigabytes it allocated to load those pages.

This is running on a Macbook Pro with OSX 10.6.6. I use noscript but I think I've allowed all the domains that gawker websItes use. I was also using a userstyle but I really doubt that's the problem (also this happens with regular browsing too but the Gawker sites are the worst).

I'm marking it critical because it makes the browser fairly unusable after a few hours, forcing the user to restart it regularly (or less savvy users to get very confused), and overall makes the browser considerably less competitive against Google Chrome.
