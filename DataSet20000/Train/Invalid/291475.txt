The font became bigger and bold on a page I was browsing. I viewed the same page
in internet explorer and the font looked normal(not bigger and bold). I viewed
the source html from the page in firefox and there were <tbody> tags on all
tables where the font was different. I viewed the source in IE and the <tbody>
tags weren't there. I did a google search about this, in firefox. The results
from the search came back big and bold. I view the source of the google search
page and <tbody> tags where added to all of the tables on that page. Did the
same google search in IE and the <tbody> tags were not there. I had 8 or 9 tabs
open in firefox at the time so I viewed various pages in each tab and the same
thing was happenning on all of them, tags were added and the font was bigger and
bold. I close firefox and started it again. I went to the same pages and the
tags were no longer being added and the font wasn't bigger and bold anymore.
