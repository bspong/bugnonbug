Child options become enabled/disabled when they shouldn't by right-clicking parent
Tools > Options > Tabbed Browsing

- In the "Load the following in new tabs" section:
     - Right-click on one of the checkbox options (Browser's homepage, URLs in the
       address bar or Searches from the search bar)
          - Expected outcome: Nothing
          - Actual outcome: If the child radio buttons are enabled, they become
            disabled even though the checkbox is checked. If they are disabled,
            they become enabled, even though the checkbox is unchecked
