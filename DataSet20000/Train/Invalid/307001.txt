There are a few issues that ocur when the 'Hide the tab bar' option is set in
Deer Park nightlies since 2005-09-02.

Missing status information:
1. Uncheck the 'Hide the tab bar when only one web site is open' option.
2. Close the browser and start it again.
3. Notice that the navigation buttons are greyed out even though a page is
loading (you can't press the stop button, but you can use the keyboard shortcut).
4. Also, the progress bar in the status bar isn't showing anything and the two
swirly icons that show progress in the menu bar and on the tab itself don't show up.
5. Open a new tab, move back to the first. The toolbar buttons are now correct.

Tab won't close:
1. Open a new tab so that you have two open.
2. Try to close the first tab with the middle mouse button, it fails.
3. Try with the popup menu, it also fails.

Reproducible: Always
