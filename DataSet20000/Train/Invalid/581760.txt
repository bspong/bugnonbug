I have already installed the Silverlight client for Facebook Application. I visited the "http://www.silverlight.net/content/samples/apps/facebookclient/sfcquickinstall.aspx" URL and it says that I have already installed that application.Since I wanted to reinstall that application I right click and select "Remove Application" option.Once I click it Firefox window gets stuck and after about a minute a message appeared below the address bar "Silverlight plug-in crashed" with two buttons "Reload" and "report bug" I was unable to reload or report the bug by clicking those buttons.
