I clicked on "TV listings" on the right. I got an error message telling me to download Flash Player 8. About:plugins reveals that I have Shockwave Flash 10.0 b218.

Scanorama (Folding Team Member) confirmed this with 10.  pal-moz has Flash 9 and says: "WFM with 9.0r47, but stop while loading flash around 90-98%."

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://sports.espn.go.com/espntv 
2. Click on TV listings.  You'll find it on the right, right under "ESPN/ABC
On-Air"
Actual Results:  
It says Flash Upgrade to Flash 8 is needed.

Expected Results:  
Website should display TV listings.
