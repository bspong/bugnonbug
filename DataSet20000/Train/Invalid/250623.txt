"Add Bookmark" dialog stays open after clicking "Ok"

Whenever I add a new bookmark (whether it be from a keycommand or the Bookmarks
menu), the bookmark dialog box opens. No big deal. However, after choosing where
I'd like the bookmark to reside and clicking "Ok", the box remains open.
Clicking "Ok" again merely adds duplicates of the bookmark to the defined
location. The only way to close the dialog is "Cancel" or the close widget.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to any site you desire.
2. Keycommand or Bookmarks > Bookmark This Page
3. Choose your bookmark destination.
4. Click "Ok".

Actual Results:  
The dialog box remains open.

Expected Results:  
The dialog should close after the "Ok" button is clicked.

This behavior manifested on a fresh install of Firefox 0.91 (fresh as in "I just
reinstalled Windows 2000"). I had been previously using Firefox 0.90
(pre-OS-formatting), where this behavior DID NOT occur. Those previous settings,
however, have been consistently upgraded and imported since about Moz 1.2.
