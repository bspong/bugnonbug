According to my Html Goodies book <COMMENT> not displayed by browser </COMMENT>
should work as an embedded programmer comment & be ignored by browser. This is
true with IE, but is not so with Firefox.

All my searches for <COMMENT> tag support come up empty. Has the HTML world
rendered this tag obsolete?

Put the following into a file: comment.html and you'll see the top comment
displayed.

<comment> A bad comment! </comment>
<!-- A functional comment -->

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Copy following into file comments.html:
<comment> A bad comment! </comment>
<!-- A functional comment -->
2. open file in browser, you'll see top line displayed
3.

Actual Results:  
 A bad comment!
