The textbox using firefox-3 on ubuntu appears as it does in the screenshot <http://launchpadlibrarian.net/19209463/bug.png>. Using opera in ubuntu produces a textbox about half as long as the screenshot. Using firefox-3 in windows xp produces a text box that is perfectly aligned with the top links and is about a third as long as the screenshot.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View http://www.baidu.com in both windows and linux versions of firefox
Actual Results:  
The text box is not aligned with the top navigation links in linux.  In windows, the same text box is aligned perfectly with the top navigation links.  

Expected Results:  
Windows and Linux versions of firefox should display the text box perfectly aligned with the top nav links.
