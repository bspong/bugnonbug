Performing keyword searches causes FF to hang [caused by XUL/Migemo]
Created attachment 372953
Sample taken during the hang

For the past month or so doing keyword searches in the FF address bar causes FF to beachball and hang hard, and the only way to break out of it is to force-quit the application.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a keyword search (google is a good example- navigate to google.com, right-click on the search field and create a keyword search. I use "?" as my google keyword trigger.)
2. Try typing a keyword search - using the above example, if I type "? this is a test keyword search in firefox" it eventually hangs the browser (see attached sample).
