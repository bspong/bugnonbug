Downloaded and installed Window Media Player Firefox plugin and restarted Firefox 3.5 as instructed. The site that prompted to install the Media Player Plugin still showed that the plugin was required. The plugin did not show under the Add-ons list. Closed 3.5 beta and opened 3.0 and the plugin shows there in the Add-ons list and the site that originally prompted for the missing plugin was seeing the plugin and is now working in 3.0. Uninstall and reinstall did not help.

Reproducible: Always
