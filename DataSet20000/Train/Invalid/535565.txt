Lets say I have a scollable table. The tbody takes up the whole height even when there are fewer rows, making the table look ugly. Giving exact heights in pixels does not help. IE displays the same properly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a scrollable table with fixed header, say height 500px.
2. Make it contain 2 or three rows of height say 25px

Actual Results:  
The row heights grows to fill the whole space

Expected Results:  
The row heights should be 25px - just like what it is in IE

The row heights should be 25px - just like what it is in IE
