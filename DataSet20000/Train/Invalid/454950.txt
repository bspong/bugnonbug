Description not always copied to Bookmark Properties UserForm, and is moved without user permission

Scenario 1: A bookmark exists, in a subfolder in the Bookmarks menu.
Actions: Select the URL from the saved bookmarks.
         Bookmark the current page in the main Bookmarks menu.
Results: The bookmark is saved to the main Bookmarks menu, but erased from the subfolder where it was at the beginning.
         The bookmark does not have the description, even though the source of the web page shows a "<meta name="description..." tag
What I Expected: Two bookmarks referring to the URL where I am, one in the subfolder, the other in the main Bookmarks menu. The latter must have the text of the Description in the right place in the Properties UserForm.

Scenario 2: Bookmark does NOT exist in saved Bookmarks
Action:     As for Scenario #1
Results:    Bookmark is created, and the Description appears as it should
What I expected: Same

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.



Using version 3.0.1 for Windows XP, SP2. No special settings that affect memory usage or other unusual options.

I would call this a minor issue, but the fact that bookmarks are erased in Scenario #1 makes this a more serious bug.
