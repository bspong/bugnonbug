Steps to reproduce:

Created some pinned tabs, upgraded to v.7, did regular browsing.


Actual results:

My three pinned tabs moved mysteriously to the left after a bit of regular browsing (see attachment), cutting off half of the first one and leaving a gap between the third pinned tab and the first regular tab. This can be fixed temporarily by modifying any of the pinned tabs in any way (creating, destroying, moving).


Expected results:

App tabs should appear normal, fully visible.
