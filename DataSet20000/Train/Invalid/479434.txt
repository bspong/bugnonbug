I like to clean out my cookies to get rid of crud from advertising sites and generally keep things nice.

However doing this requires I have to log back into facebook and reset other cookies that I didn't particular want to clear.

I suggest implementing a list of perma-cookies that allow for certain cookies to be kept by default (unless you tick the clear perma-cookies box in delete private info).



Why not simply use the white list that already exists, I hear you cry. Well that means a major inconvenience whenever I visit other sites that require cookies to use. I have to manually add these sites of the list or disable my preferences. A list of perma cookies would allow for this as it doesn't affect day to day cookie collecting

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get annoyed at loads of cookies
2. Clear cookies
3. Get annoyed at useful cookies being cleared
