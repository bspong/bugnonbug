mouse button click do not follow Mozilla standard
Firefox do not follow the, by Mozilla, defined standard on
mouse button handling.
Clicking on a link with middle mouse button should open the
link in a new window - NOT in a new tab.
Shift+left button klick on link should save link to a file - NOT
open in new window.

If some of you want to change the way mouse button clicks work,
then it should be a preference that user can set. Not the default
and not without a way to get, the for many people, normal behaviour.

The above two button clicks are the most common operations I do except
the normal left button click to follow a link. Please restore
thing to the way they worked before.
