NULL byte cause Firefox to serve a page for downloading under certain conditions
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; nl; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 Firefox/3.6.8

When a page contains a NULL byte, and some condition with Content-Type has met, Firefox opens up a download dialog.

I'm not sure about the conditions of Content-Type, but it seems that the following are causing this bug:
text/plain
any/thing
any/thing;charset=something

However, these are working as expected:
text/html
application/javascript
text/css
text/plain;charset=something

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a file containing a NULL byte with Content-Type text/plain
Actual Results:  
Firefox opens a Download dialog.

Expected Results:  
The page shows up.
