Excessive memory use causes lockup [Caused by Ghostery 2.5.2]

When reading the following, keep in mind that all these things were handled well in the latest Firefox 3.

When the memory usage hits around 3GB, Firefox stops responding. I usually have 20-30 tabs open and leave the application open for days (often weeks) at a time. When Firefox is started and pages have loaded, usage is 500-750MB. This slowly increases over time (while idling, no new pages are being loaded) until the 3GB ceiling is reached at which point Firefox freezes. For me, this seems to take less than 24 hours.

In Firefox 3, with the same set of pages, the "leak" didn't happen. 

Reproducible: Always




My main complaint is that something that didn't lead to a freeze or crash in FF3 now does in FF4.
