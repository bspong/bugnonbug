Adware.Navipromo.AO rootkit causes Firefox to hang and stop loading pages
Extremely common on Mozilla Italian forums, there's a virus going around that is installing with various software packages and causing Firefox to hang or stop loading pages.  Closing Firefox does not kill the process and users get a "Firefox is already running but not responding" message when they try to start again.  This only affects Firefox, Chrome is unaffected as is Explorer.

After extensive and detailed detective work: http://www.bitdefender.com/VIRUS-1000183-en--Adware.Navipromo.AO.html has been identified as the cause.
