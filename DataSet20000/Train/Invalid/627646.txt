I often use page with http basic authorization, it's address starts with letter "d". And when I'm trying to type different address which starts with the same letter instant preview tries to load page with authorization, authorization dialog is shown and my address typing is canceled. So I have to cancel authorization dialog and try to enter correct url again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Often use page with http basic authorization
2. Try to enter url starting with same letter as this often used page

Actual Results:  
Authorization dialog is showed and user can't continue typing url in location bar

Expected Results:  
Instant preview should ignore pages with authorization needed.
