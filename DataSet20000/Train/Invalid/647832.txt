Firefox 4 - Clicking on Images in Google Image Search Installs Virus
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

After installing Firefox 4, I am now experiencing a security issue that I did not experience with Firefox 3.

I search for images using Google Image Search and when I click on certain results, some sort of script attempts to install a malicious executable on my computer.
The script managed to successfully install a malicious executable in my Temp folder and was able to launch the executable which immediately attempted to access the Internet.
Here is the executable that was installed:

Actual Results:  
False security alert appeared and some sort of script installed a malicious executable on my computer and launched it.

Expected Results:  
The false security alert should not have been able to appear.
The script should not have been able to install a malicious executable on my computer.

I have the following Add-ons installed:
DownloadThemAll 2.0.1
DownloadHelper 4.8.6
Adblock Plus 1.3.5

This has occurred five times so far within the past few hours.
I was not trying to view the same image each time it occurred; I was trying to view five different images listed amongst the results returned by 3 different Google searches.

Each of the three searches was for images related to Korean music and television (if that's of any interest).

Only one time was the script able to install a malicious executable; the other four times, I quickly shut down Firefox to interrupt the installation.

Don't bother asking me for additional info.
I won't be checking up on this report.
