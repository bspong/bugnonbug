The combination used to switch tabs (alt+number) overlaps with numeric access
keys on web pages (for a breadcrumb navigation for example). I think this
behavior is due to a typo (the function in browser.js is called
ctrlNumberTabSelection, but it actually acts on the alt key).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.create several tabs
2.press alt+[1-8]


Actual Results:  
the tabs should change (alt+1 for the first, alt+2 for the second, and so on)

Expected Results:  
nothing
