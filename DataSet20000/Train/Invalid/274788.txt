misplaced text and combobox autoupdate does not work!
The rendering of the page is totallt incorrect.
Also when changing values of comboxboxes the page has to be refreshed and the
content of the comboboxes beneath them has to be updated which is not the case
when using firefox.

I got this error on Firefox 1.0 final edition.

Iguess the first bug should be a rendering issue and the second one a java
script issue.

regards.
