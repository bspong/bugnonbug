FireFox does not undo changes to RadioButton when user hits Back button

I have three forms in a page. The first form contain two radio buttons. Depending upon which radio button is selected, either form2 or form3 is displayed. All this logic is all implemented on the server-end so it involves posting a request every time the user changes his selection in form1.

Here is how I reproduce the bug:

1) form1: [x] [ ]           form2
2) form1: [ ] [x]           form3
3) Hit Back Button
4) form1: [ ] [x]           form2

I am expecting step 4 to read:

4) form1: [x] [ ]           form2

   It looks as if FireFox rolls back the state of the bottom form, but not the top one. This works properly under IE6.

Reproducible: Always
