When visiting the site, there is a high probability that Firefox will freeze! I
am not a pro, but it has to do with Java, which gets loaded at the time of the
freeze. This has happened to me on two different machines (both FF 0.10 and WinXP).

Firefox stays responsive to some extent (you can still change tabs), but
browsing does not work anymore.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open URI
