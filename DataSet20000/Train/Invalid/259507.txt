option for popup block to disable it for links I click myself

When I click a link on a page I expect a browser to do what I want. The default
pop-up behaviour with blocking a window I want to see is weird. IMHO, the
windows I open voluntary should not be blocked.

But anyway, I need at least an option to force such behaviour.
