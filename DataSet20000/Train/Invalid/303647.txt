Feedview: Localize the date/time format
At the moment Feedview formats date/times like so: "Thu, 04 Aug @ 21:49". I have
several problems with this: the "@" is excessively trendy and otherwise useless;
the day and month are needlessly abbrev.; the comma is quite extraneous and (bug
303444:) the year is absent.

Being an international standards-, unambiguity- and number-junkie, I'd like
"2005-08-04 21:49" (given that the local timezone is used anyway).

But for general consumption I suggest "Thursday 04 August 2005 at 21:49", or if
it's restricted to text that can be copied raw from an RSS 2.0 feed, "Thu 04 Aug
2005, 21:49". (I assume this isn't the case though, as copying dates wholesale
from various formats would be Netscape 8ishly inconsistent UI.)

(Actually, I'll be happy as long as the "@" dies.)
