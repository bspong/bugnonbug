The page up and page down keys on my PowerBook G4 do not have any effect in
Firefox. This applies to all web sites.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any web page (drupal.org is semi-randomly chosen).
2. Click in the HTML content area of the page.
3. Press page down (fn + down arrow on 17" PowerBook G4 keyboard).

Actual Results:  
Nothing.

Expected Results:  
Page scrolls downward.

Doesn't happen on Windows version of Firefox.

A very few web sites *do* scroll properly. Perhaps sites that don't have edit
fields? Or perhaps sites where I haven't clicked in the content area?
