proxy auto detect broken
The past few weeks, the "auto-detect proxy settings for this network" (config:network.proxy.type=4) option has been broken.

I have my home page set to http://www.google.com.au/ig?hl=en, which I must access via my work's authenticating HTTP proxy.

This used to cause Firefox to show a proxy authentication dialog box then go to the Google home page.  Now it just shows a busy cursor for about five seconds then shows a white (blank) page.

Changing to a different home page doesn't fix the problem.  Trying to go to a different address by typing it in the location bar or clicking on a bookmark doesn't work either.  This suggests that all proxied requests are failing.

Changing from "auto-detect proxy settings" to a manual configuration or automatic configuration with an explicit configuration script address makes everything work properly.

I'm guessing there is a regression in Firefox 1.5.0.2.
