In last Firefox 1.5 Beta 1 there was no problem with accessing "file://"
protocol, only  security.checkloaduri=false must be set in about:config.
Now in Beta 2 there is problem, of course security.checkloaduri=false.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
when you click on link with "file://" in URL, nothing happens!

Expected Results:  
when you click on link with "file://", browser must open selected URL.

This is a major problem, because local Intranet pages cannot be accessed!
