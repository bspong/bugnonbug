The problem with current implementation of personas with tabs on top is that only upper part uses the persona background, rest of the aero frame is the way it was earlier , which is of course not at all symmetric 
There are two ways to solve this ;

One is to use Chrome's way of implementation , that is reducing the width of the aero frames , which i think is not good as it doesn't make it look like any other windows application or rather just explorer

Other is to (IMO) restrict persona backgrounds to just toolbars like tab bar , nav bar etc and not to the aero frame while on tabs on top , and i don't know if this should be restricted to aero only or to all frames including basic and windows xp


This is ONLY a enhancement bug in my opinion 

Reproducible: Always
