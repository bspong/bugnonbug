I had four tabs open, FireFox had been running for more than 12 hours (mostly
idling with 2 tabs open... 2 other were recent opens.)
I was on the Eclipse.org web site, looking at the pages about the newest
features in mileston 7 (and then working back to M1) when I decided I wanted to
print.  I right clicked in the frame hoping to find a print frame option, but
when I did not, I clicked away from the pop-up menu and into the background
page, and I recieved the error:
  The instruction at "0x00000618" referenced memory at "0x00000618".  The memory
could not be "read".  ... [OK] [CANCEL]

Since I wasn't expecting the error, I am not sure of the EXACT steps to
reproduce it, but I did try to do so in Mozilla trunk Mozilla 1.7a Mozilla/5.0
(Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040212 (which I still had
installed from my previous bug submisssion.)  I tried to reproduce the problem
in Firefox and was not able to.
