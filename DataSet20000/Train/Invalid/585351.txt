When I come out of fullscreen mode the window border is visible at the bottom.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go into fullscreen mode
2. Exit fullscreen mode
Actual Results:  
The bottom border of the windows becomes visible.

Expected Results:  
The window should restore as it was before it entered fullscreen.

Only happens when the window was maximised before entering fullscreen.
Restoring then maximising the window hides the bottom border (as it should).
