Holding down control and turning the scroll wheel down enlarges text size, and
turning the wheel up makes it smaller. This is the reverse of Windows
convention. In other zoom-capable applications I know of, up means zoom in and
down zoom out.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Hold down control
2. Turn mouse the wheel up (away from yourself)

Actual Results:  
The text size becomes smaller.

Expected Results:  
Make the text larger.
