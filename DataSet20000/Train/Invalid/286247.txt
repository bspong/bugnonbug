FireFox 1.01 installed and works.  Uninstall and Install 1.02, Firefox will not start GUI.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050311 Firefox/1.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050311 Firefox/1.0+

Used the 3-12 release of FireFox 1.01 on both Linux and Windows with no problem.
 Have installed 1.02 under XP and it will not dsiplay Firefox app using either
the desktop shortcut or the menu entry.  If I look in Task Manager, there is an
item named firefox.exe running.  This is confirmed when I attempt to uninstall
and the message "Firefox already running".

1.02 release works on Ubuntu and Suse Linux.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.On Windoze XP, uninstall Firefox 1.01.
2.Delete the contents of directory in which it was installed
3.Install Firefox 1.02
4.Let the install app try to start it.
5.Try to start it from desktop icon.
6.No GUI but Task Manager says it is running

Actual Results:  
There is a firefox.exe entry in Task Manager but no Browser window ever shows.

Expected Results:  
GUI should open.  I do get two error messages when 1.01 runs but it does run.
