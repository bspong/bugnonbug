It started two or three weeks ago. After starting firefox evrything works fine then after a short period pages loading is blocked. Even if I restart it ten times in a row, it won't work again. I need to reopen it via the safe mode, then it works fine.
Every other browsers work all the time.
My antivirus is Nod32.
Thank you for the support.
