bookmarks button not in toolbar
Between beta 7 and beta 8 the bookmarks button disappeared from the toolbar. This button is shown in Win and Mac. I haven't found the bug that could explain whether this was intentional or not.

Steps:
1. Install Fx Beta (8 or higher) with a clean profile

Expected: Bookmarks button next to the home button

Actual: Bookmarks button not there.
