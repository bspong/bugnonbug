As soon as I open my firefox brower, MULTIPLE windows start opening automatically after the original opens.  Each contains "Entering yahooBuildToolbar"only.

Today there was an update for firefox browser which i allowed.  Ever since then I get this problem mentioned above untill I can deleted these windows before anymore will open, leaving only the original open window that I expect to receive.  Once I have stopped them from opening, I can use the browser without and further problems.

I hope you can help me out with this problem.  I hate to lose all of my bookmarks.  Maybe I will have to reinstall the browser???

Thanks....George Murray
