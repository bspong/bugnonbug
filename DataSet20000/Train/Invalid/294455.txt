When I have one browser open and several tabs, it doesn't warn me when I close
the window. I have "Tools/Options/Advanced/Warn when closing Multiple tabs open"
ON, but it still doesn't warn me. It only warns me when I have more than one
BROWSER WINDOW open and several tabs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox 1.0.4
2.Open multiple tabs
3.Click the "x" to close the window
4.NO warning
Actual Results:  
What was expected. Nothing. There was no warning.

Expected Results:  
It should have warned me when I closed the window with multiple tabs.
