Object Subrequest Overides User Input

May or may not be a security issue/bug but it tweaked my "it shouldn't be able to do that" Spidey-sense.

After watching part of a flash video (funny or die) I navigated away from the page via the address bar, only to be brought back to the previous page now displaying a new video.

This theoretically could allow for a situation where a user could have difficulty navigating away from a page that either sent repeated object subrequests or looks for onclose/onblur events and triggers such behaviour.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
Probable race condition between object subrequest and user input in address bar.
Actual Results:  
Returned to previous page displaying new video

Expected Results:  
Navigate away from the page, dropping any further data/instructions sent by previous site.
