Zoom changing when I'm not writing www

When I zoom a website with CTRL + MOUSEWHEEL It's saving the zoom size for the next time.
But if I enter to the site without www the zoom is back to normal
For example:
http://www.mozilla.org  - 120% Zoom and It saved for the next time.
http://mozilla.org - Recognized as a new website and zoom is default

Reproducible: Always
