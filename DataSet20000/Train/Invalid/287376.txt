(I want to make a Public Web Browser with Firefox)
I just install a Linux system-core (Debian Sarge). Add x-window-system-core and
mozilla-firefox packages.

I start X with Firefox and without window manager.

When I want to use a combo box, it doesn't drop down but I can select item with
keyboard (letter, up, down keys).Like combo box, Firefox's menu have a unstable
comportement.

When I run Firefox over a window manager, all these problems are not.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install a Linux system
2.Install x-window-system-core
3.Install mozilla-firefox
4.Make .xsession file in $home with 'mozilla-firefox'
5.Run startx
6.Go on a web page with combo box and test
7.Try Firefox's menu

Actual Results:  
1.Combo box runs (you can manually select item) but doesn't drop down
2.Menu item 'View' doesn't run


When Firefox is running over a window manager, problems don't occure.
