Closer is normally on just the currently active tab. Somehow - and I can reproduce it but not in any consistent manner - all tabs get a closer. It then takes adding a couple of new tabs (CNTL+T) to remove the [X] closers.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click tabs to right, 
2. Click first tab 
3. repeat until occurs

Actual Results:  
All tabs appear with a red or gray closer [X] in them

Expected Results:  
Only the currently active tab should have a red closer.
