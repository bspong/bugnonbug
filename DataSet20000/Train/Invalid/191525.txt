vi keybindings in caret browsing mode

Just a feature enhancement I'd really like; I like using vi keys [notably, hjkl,
and ctrl+{f,b,u,d}], and it'd be really great if they were available in caret
browsing mode

The only concern would be something like treading on the toes of other uses,
such as type-ahead find... but since it  isn't being used at the time unless I
hit "/" first, I think it'd be ok...

Thanks,
Gary
