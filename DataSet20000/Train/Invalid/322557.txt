we are trying to use links as follows:

file://///remoteMachine/someFolder/index.html

i can paste that into the location bar, and firefox will load the page fine. but, the following html doesn't allow me to naviagate to the page.

<a href="file://///remoteMachine/someFolder/index.html">Page</a><br />

the page is on another machine, shared over smb, and these links work fine in IE.

Reproducible: Always
