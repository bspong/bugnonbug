Firefox 4.0.1 Memory Leak
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1

I opened up 15 TABs, each page having high graphic content (pictures). I watch MemInfo display RAM Usage climb toward 3 GB, I immediately disable a few add-ons > Restart.
It obviously starts reloading all 15 TABs upon restart, same problem with RAM.

As I see it go past 2 GB, I quickly Restart in Safe mode > It restarts and starts reloading all 15 TABs and sure enough memory usage climbs and climbs in safe mode with all add-ons disabled until it crashes Firefos 4.01. See below for details about what else I did to replicate the problem and isolate it to Firefox 4.0.1 without add-ons.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. First I uninstalled Firefox 4.0.1 and removed all profiles, everything.
2. Then I installed Firefox 3.6.17. I watched it climb toward 2 GBs of RAM and I see it releasing memory back, it is handling all 15 TABs well, climbs up then releases RAM back. So definitely no problem there. 
3. Then I removed Firefox 3.6 and I installed Firefox 4.01, sure enough the problem was replicated on FF 4.0.1. I even used firefox.exe -profilemanager and used default profile and replicated the problem, Firefox 4.0.1 did not release memory back and continued to climb as more TABs were being added, Passed 2.6 GB out my 3 GB of RAM.

Actual Results:  
Memory Leak present with Firefox 4.0.1 but not with Firefox 3.6.17 on the same system.

Expected Results:  
No Memory Leak.

Only when the last open window is closed - does Firefox 4.0.1 release the memory back.
