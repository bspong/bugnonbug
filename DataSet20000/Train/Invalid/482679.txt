I'm now finding my latest release of firefox is being very sluggish on my pc. Have had 3.06 on xp sp2 pc, oldish- but now find a considerable lag since updating.
Have outlook, sage and firefox open

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open outlook
2.open sage
3.open firefox
Actual Results:  
Firefox takes 2 min to open (if at all), i've had to kill it manually in task manager. Please sort out memory footprint.

Expected Results:  
Speedier results
