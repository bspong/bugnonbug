There is an ad that appears on the right side of my Yahoo mail in box that keeps coming back over and over every time I touch any function. currently, this ad is a coffee ad by Tasters Choice. I contacted AT&T and they told me it is not there on their account, they put no advertising on the mail box, so it must be originating from Firefox. I find this utterly distasteful, annoying and unprofessional. Is this grossly annoying advertising the work of Firefox? If it is, I will stop using Firefox and, as much as I disdain it, I will use Explorer on the PC and Safari on the Mac. Please reply to my email address.
