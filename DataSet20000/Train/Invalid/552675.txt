When I opened FX this morning an extension/plug-in named AutocompletePro was listed in my addons as just added which was not on it when I closed FX last night.
It permits disabling, but the Uninstall button is inactivated.The bug is the inactivation of uninstall.

Reproducible: Didn't try




This seems to be an adware engine rather than more malicious for now. Mozilla with add-ons gives the user substantial control of the browser which competitors envy. If Mozilla allows an add-on developer to force use it is displaced as is the user. Inactivation of 'Uninstall' on add-ons should be unacceptable coding.
