imagine that I have on my page a tree:
click on treenode will show description on this node
dblclick on this node will expand it
but now I get description and expanding all at once. But I do not want this.

I have try to use 'detaild' property and get next picture:
when 'click' event: click.detail: 1
when 'dblclick' event: click.detail=1, click.detail=2, dblclick.detail=2
but any way I can not process 'dblclick' event handler without 'click' event handler fired
So I try to use this: function onclickhandler(event) { if (event.detail > 1) return; ... }

because of onclickhandler have fired twice code above does not work:
detail =1 and detail=2
when 'dblclick' event: click.detail=1, click.detail=2, dblclick.detail=2
FIRED NOT FIRED FIRED
But I need:
when 'dblclick' event: click.detail=1, click.detail=2, dblclick.detail=2
NOT FIRED NOT FIRED FIRED


I have read that if user do double clicking
push release push release
FF will dispatch next events
down->up->click->down->up->click->dblclick
detail=1 detail=2 detail=2

So I 'setTimeout' to look for second 'click' and try to prevent first click if second click occur
but finding the right delay time is tricky. it's up to the OS to define how fast or slow a double click can be

therefore FF must look for dellay and do not dispatch 'click' events when 'dblclick' event occur

if you lift to third floor you get event 'thirdfloor' and do not get 'secondfloor'!!
because you directly goes to third floor and pass over second one
When I doubleclick I must get 'dblclick' even and do not get 'click' event

When I am doubleclicking I can get mouseup, mousedown events and dblclick event
And I MUST not get 'click' events at all
