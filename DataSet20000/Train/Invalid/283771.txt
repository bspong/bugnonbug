Installer Directory Picker is Actually a File Picker

After running sh firefox-installer and clicking through to the install directory
picker, I try to select a directory.  However, this "directory" picker is
actually a file picker and only allows you to select files.  You can manually
edit the path name in the edit box to select the proper directory, but you
cannot choose it by clicking.
Also, after selecting a directory, the installer appends "firefox-installer" to
the end of it.  However, firefox is still installed in the proper directory.

Additionally, the default install directory displayed when you first open the
directory picker is the present working directory/firefox-installer.  It should
default to /usr/lib/firefox-1.0



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. sh firefox-installer
2. Forward -> Accept -> Change

Actual Results:  
Directory picker is displayed, but it is actually a file picker and you can't
choose directories.  Default directory is pwd/firefox-installer

Expected Results:  
Directory picker should be displayed instead of file picker.  Default directory
should be /usr/lib/firefox-1.0.
