When using the style="border: solid" attrubite in the <div> tag witth an image
larger then your current screen resolution (in my case an image width of 900 and
screen resolution of 800*600) the border is not full drawn. The border will be
drawen to the edge of the screen and then stop, if I increass my screen
resolotion to a higher setting then the image the boarder is compleatly drawn.
