Hi, I love the add on firebug unfortunately I am unable use in on my mac, I am unable to see the comments. Everything reads as little squares.
I also installed it on my windows computer and it works fine, but on my mac in firefox 2.0.0.3 it does not render correctly. I tried changing the font in the preferences but it does not help. I have also noticed that any website that is designed with the default font georgia renders the same way - a bunch of squares.
