Crystal Theme: The "Options -> Advanced" tree opens only after klicking twice onto the '+' symbols and the dialog pops out of reach.
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

When going into the "Options -> Advanced" field, and klicking onto one of 
the '+' signs to expand an item, I have to klick twice on it, to expand. I 
guess it should expand after the first klick, doesn't it?
And when there are much items expanded, there doesn't appear a scrollbar to 
reach the lower options. The dialog just pops out of reach.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install FireFox with the installer 
(http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/0.8/FirefoxSetup-
0.8.exe)
2. Start it and go to "Tools -> Options -> Advanced".
3. If there is a not allready expanded item, klick it. Else, decrease some 
first.
4. When you first klick on a '+' sign, nothing happens. When you klick a second 
time onto it, it expands. (FIRST Bug)
5. When all the items are decreased, the lower options disaperes from the 
window. The is NO scrolbar! (SECOND Bug)
Actual Results:  
-The options are expanding only after a second click.
and
-The options are disapearing from the window, as result of lacking space on the 
screen.

Expected Results:  
-The options should expand after the first klick
and
-There should apear a scrollbar when the Window-Content grows above the 
Windowsize.

I'm using the "Crystal" Theme. The Bug doesn't appear when using FireFox's 
default Theme.
