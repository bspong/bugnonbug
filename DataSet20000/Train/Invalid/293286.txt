Firefox can't handle with the backgroundcolor element proberly. It should be
independent of uppercase and lowercase letters, but it isn't.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new text file on your desktop
2. Copy the following code in it (without the ====)

========================
<HTML>
<BODY>

<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 align=center
style="border-collapse:collapse">
	<tr>
		<td onMouseOver='this.style.backgroundColor="green"'>
			move mouse over here
		</td>
		<td onMouseOver='this.style.backgroundcolor="green"'>
			now mouse your mouse over here
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

</BODY>
</HTML>
========================

3. Save the text file
4. Rename it as "something.htm"
5. Open it with firefox and do what the text in your browser window tells you to do.
Actual Results:  
first cell became green, second one didn't

Expected Results:  
both cells should become green if i move the mouse of it

I guess the bug is in the mozilla core, but i couldn't choose that in the
choosing box
