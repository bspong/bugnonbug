When I have made a purchase ie from swelluk.com and from other sites I purchase stuff from using my PayPal account, I order and pay for whichever items I want to buy and go through the payment procedure..get redirected to PayPal enter password go into PayPal and confirm the payment. I have found that with any site I have made a purchase from if I go back to PayPal after my account is still open to the wide world this is a majo=r security problem and is a cross browser problem. I have also reported this to Google.
