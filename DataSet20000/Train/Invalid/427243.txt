After Firefox updated itself to v.3.0, I found my Google toolbar gone, as well as Adblock add-on.

After Firefox updated itself to v.3.0, I found my Google toolbar gone, as well as Adblock add-on. Both of these are major enhancements to Firefox for me, I simply can't stand the Flash ads of fat, dancing chicks that Adblock blocks.
 When I go to Tools/Add-ons, they are listed as being installed, and when I go to uninstall them in that dialog, nothing happens. They are not available when I r/click the toolbar area. Firefox did not have a rollback option, so I reinstalled v.2.0, which is in basically the same scenario. This has not occurred on my other computers, so I'm guessing maybe my XP installation is fubar. Why don't I try to rollback XP? I think I will.
