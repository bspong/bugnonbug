addEventListener for 'DOMContentLoaded' to the id='appcontent' element is causing an error FF 4.0b3pre
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_4; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.375.99 Safari/533.4

This is a bit complicated to explain, but here it goes..

I contribute to GM, and this error applies for that extension as well, but I'm going to point you to the source code for my GM fork, Scriptish.

The summary is that this line always used to work, and now with the new nightly, FF 4.0b3pre, this line causes the following error (this line = http://github.com/erikvold/scriptish/blob/wtf/content/browser.js#L63 ):

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80570009 (NS_ERROR_XPC_BAD_CONVERT_JS) [nsIXPCComponents_Utils.lookupMethod]"  nsresult: "0x80570009 (NS_ERROR_XPC_BAD_CONVERT_JS)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://greasemonkey/content/utils.js :: GM_listen :: line 44"  data: no]

Also you'll notice there are lines below that falling line that look similar, well they still work fine, it's just the specific line that I'm point to that's failing, and I think it has something to do with the element being used.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. git clone https://erikvold@github.com/erikvold/scriptish.git
2. git checkout fd028dfe94bf3e23ad864c0c90275714bed58710
3. add this extension to a ff profile by creating a file in the profile's extension folder that points to your clone
4. boot up firefox (make sure that Scriptish is installed and enabled)
5. If scriptish is installed properly and it's enabled, then you will see the following error in the error console:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80570009 (NS_ERROR_XPC_BAD_CONVERT_JS) [nsIXPCComponents_Utils.lookupMethod]"  nsresult: "0x80570009 (NS_ERROR_XPC_BAD_CONVERT_JS)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://greasemonkey/content/utils.js :: GM_listen :: line 44"  data: no]
Actual Results:  
An error.

Expected Results:  
No error.

Oddly this commit seems to fix the bug: http://github.com/erikvold/scriptish/commit/5de28e356692b144c1e18e688de2fa6c869739d6
