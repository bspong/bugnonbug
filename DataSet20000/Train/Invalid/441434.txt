i type in a url into the address bar and press send but it does not do anything, it just stays at the same page. the only way i can access websites is through my bookmarks and links. i've also tried pressing the 'enter' key which usually works but in this case does not.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. stay on homepage, or go to a bookmark if you don't have a homepage
2. type in any URL into the address bar (any url will do)
3. press 'go' or press the enter key. 
Actual Results:  
nothing happens. it stays on the homepage

Expected Results:  
should go to the URL typed into the address bar
