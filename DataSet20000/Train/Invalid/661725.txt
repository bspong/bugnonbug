Using the -private flag to open Firefox in Private Browsing is not working correctly.

Trying causes 2 windows to spawn, only one with private browsing tab. And the window with the private browsing tab has non-private-browsing color

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Close Firefox
3. Open cmd
4. Navigate to Firefox location. (i.e. c:\program files (x86)\mozilla firefox\)
5. Enter : firefox.exe -private

Actual Results:  
Spawns 2 windows. One with private browsing tab, one with homepage.

Window with Private Browsing tab has orange menu.

Expected Results:  
Browser should open only 1 window, with Private Browsing tab and purple menu
