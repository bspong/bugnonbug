favicon from previous location persists until new page finishes loading

favicon from previous location is still showing

After bug 597673 landed, we stopped hiding the favicon while the tab is busy, but we don't update the favicon until the page finishes loading. 

When we fix this we should try to find a way to avoid clearing the icon for same-host location changes, or at least page refreshes/reloads.
