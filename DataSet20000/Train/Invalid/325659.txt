Bring back the search "search-engines"-sidebar of the mozilla-suite
Hey.

The more I have search-engines I will be able to search multiple search-engines for a string at the same.
I really liked the search-engines-sidebar of the mozilla-suite and I will be happy to see it again in Firefox.
Is this possible?

Thx in advance.
