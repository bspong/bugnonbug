Session manager failed to restore properly after a crash.

After a crash (Firefox has stopped working) I clicked on the 'restart Firefox' button and it did indeed restart but only restored the window that I was look at when it crashed.  The other window with (I think 5 tabs) did not restore, nor was the information available in the session manager in the tools menu.

This has happened before but does not happen very often.
