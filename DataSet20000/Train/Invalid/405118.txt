Javascript window.open does not obey "location=0", "menubar=0" or "status=0" directives

When a Javascript window.open directive includes "location=0", "menubar=0" and "status=0", the location bar, menu bar and status bar are still displayed in the new window, rather than being suppressed as they should be.

I have checked that the example page I indicate below behaves in the expected manner in other browsers (such as Opera and Konqueror). Interestingly, I have just noticed that in Firefox 2, the status bar is displayed in this case, even though it should not be, though with FF2, the location bar is correctly suppressed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.beermad.org.uk/jsdemo.html
2. Scroll down to the facilities section and click on the "legend" link.
3. New window opens, showing location bar, status bar and menu bar.
Actual Results:  
Menu bar, status bar and location bar are displayed.

Expected Results:  
Menu bar, status bar and location bar should not be displayed.

I have created the page quoted so as to isolate this from any other possible errors in a page. I actually see it every time on other sites.
