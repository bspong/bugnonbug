Firefox 0.9 now has toolbar icons in kindergarten style. Please revert to the
great looking Aqua styled toolbar icons of 0.8.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. See toolbar of Firefox 0.9



The themes manager still shows an Aqua styled button as preview for the "Firefox
(default)" theme. Why was this changed at all?
