When I was trying to make a Bugzilla account, Firebird crashed. It crashed when
I was trying to use autocomplete. Autocomplete didn't actually autocomplete
before the browser crashed. I was using the Phoenity theme, and had a Bugxula
window opened.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/createaccount.cgi
2.Try to make a new account, with something that will start autocomplete.
3.Click on what autocomplete shows, and keep on clicking.
4.It might crash now.
Actual Results:  
Talkback window opens, Firebird crashes.

Expected Results:  
Filled in the box with the autocomplete data, allowing me to finish making an
account.

Using Phoenity theme.
Using Bugxula enhancment.
