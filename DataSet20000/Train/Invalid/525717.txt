All bookmarks got deleted automatically after I updated to ver. 3.6 beta 1. When I try to import the bookmark backup, it says unable to process the backup file. This happens even when manually selecting the backup (JSON) file.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open bookmark manager.
2. Click on Import/Backup > Restore > Select any.

Actual Results:  
It says unable to process the backup file.

Expected Results:  
It should have restored the bookmark backup.
