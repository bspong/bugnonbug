Unable to close a tab after duplicating a tab using Fire Gestures (NS_ERROR_FAILURE - nslWebProgress.removeProgressListener)

I use a Firefox 3.5rc2 cairo-gtk2 compilation.

I once encountered a situation when I was not able to close a tab - in any way, that is by middle-clicking, pressing the close button, right-clicking or using a mouse gesture (via Fire Gestures extension).

When I tried to close a tab using a gesture, I see the following text in the status bar (I have no idea how to read the whole of it, I just print-screened and looked at the screenshot...):

Gesture failed: DR ([Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nslWebProgress.removeProgressListener]" nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"...

The end of the text was hidden so that I was unable to read it.

I'm not sure if it's Firefox bug or an extension one.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Fire Gestures.
2. Open any site.
3. Use a gesture "duplicate tab"
4. Try to close the first tab using a gesture "close tab" - usually down-right.
Actual Results:  
Tab won't close, it'll give an error beginning at:

Gesture failed: DR ([Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nslWebProgress.removeProgressListener]" nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"...

Expected Results:  
Tab should close normally.
