I wasn't on line at the time but McAfee started a full system scan about half way through the scan McAfee security gave me an alert saying it has found s security threat McAfee Quarantined Firefox 3.1 beta as being a security high
threat or a Unknown Trojan. so i tried to take Firefox out and as soon as i take Firefox 3.1 out of quarantine McAfee puts it right back in there. so i tried to download Firefox 3.1 again but the site would not let me. it said that Firefox was already installed on my computer. so i downloaded Firefox 3.0.4 it downloaded and installed it with no problems. I contacted McAfee they said they are looking in to it that i am not the only one this has happened to. and they told me to shred Firefox 3.1 as many times as my version will let me to get it off my computer. so that is what I did 10 times. then i went back to the Mozilla web site and downloaded it again about 5 hours ago. so far there has not been any problems.
