Merge any description annotations when replacing bookmarks
When we add description/note annotations (bug 318817) there will be a problem if the user has two separate bookmarks with descriptions, and changes the URI of one to the URI of the other. Probably what we can just cat the strings together (maybe with a newline separator?). It's difficult to say what the user expects in this case, and this way they at least won't lose any data.
