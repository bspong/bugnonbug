google notebook when running (on mac) causes select - for the purpose of just copying stuff from a web page, or, for the purpose of adding stuff from a web page to google notebook, to not work.  Ie, select works, then in a few seconds something seems to be saved (a progress bar appears in the status area), and the selection goes away.  

Related may be the fact that every time something on a web page is selected, a "note this" button appears near the selected material, but when I try to click on "note this", the above process happens.

On windows the notebook works perfectly for me in ff 3.0 pre.  

The question is I guess - where does the "note this" thing come from?  Maybe there is some interaction with something else I have running.  I guess I'll systematically uninstall various extensions and run the notebook until I figure it out?  not.

Google notebook I have come to rely on, but I guess I can't anymore.  Google Docs are flaky, ie, I was working on a spreadsheet and some network glitch happened and I had to change browsers and flail mightily to save my work.  Steve Balmer was right - Google things are "cute", but way not ready for prime time.
