If you click one of the entries listed in the table it will let you view the
source of that file below the little info listing table. Once you see some
source code move your mouse into the source code area and proceed to naivigatie
your way around, notice what happens as far as the formatting is concerned. It
renders fine in IE, but Firefox chokes on it for some reason. May be my code,
but I hope not. Hopefully this aides in fixing the bug, if one so exists. No big
deal really, just odd.
