Firefox will not allow another instance to start up
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.6) Gecko/20100625 Firefox/3.6.6 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Firefox will not allow another instance to start up, even when there is no profile conflict as reported in bug #462311.

I mostly experience this while using "portable" Firefox from portableapps.com, which I use for testing multiple browsers without having to install them all (and all their versions) simultaneously.

While running a standard install of Firefox 3.6 (for instance), I cannot launch the 4.0-beta as a portable app because the 3.6 version is detected as already-running.

Would it be possible to allow multiple Firefox instances if there is no profile conflict?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox x
2. Launch Firefox y (either "portable" or even just to load a different profile)
Actual Results:  
"Another instance is already running" message

Expected Results:  
Second copy of Firefox running under another profile
