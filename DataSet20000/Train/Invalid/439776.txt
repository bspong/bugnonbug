Sometimes when i enter gmail or any other google service the page is rendered incorrectly. Textbox are shown little, background color is black in some parts of the page, compose email in gmail is rendered incorrectly.

I only noticed these strange behavior in google services. All other webpages are ok.

I just installed firefox 3 and expected these bugs to go away, but they didn't
