Firefox will not load

Every time I click on the Firefox icon to log on, nothing happens. Initially I thought it might be my mouse so I tried clicking on all my desktop items to see if the problem was with my mouse but they all worked perfectly. It is only Firefox that will not load. I also tried right-clicking and then clicking on "open" same result, nothing. Please advise.
