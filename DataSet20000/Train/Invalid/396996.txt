How to fix firefox browser from displaying page not found after installing 2.0.0.7 update (Norton Internet Security Installed/ Not Installed).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Don't buy laptop with Norton Installed. At least uninstall it and go with something like Avast.
2. Double check updates before they are installed. 
3. Set firewall exceptions.
Actual Results:  
Norton Internet Security came default as installed on my laptop by bestbuy. It came with 2003 Norton Internet Security. I recently uninstalled this program but there were still footprints throughout the system. I did the update to Firefox 2.0.0.7 and the browser did not want to display the page. 

I research on Mozilla site and figured out there could be a firewall issue. I don't like windows firewall by default so that was not on. But the system kept saying that Norton Internet Security Firewall was installed and running. I finally had to use the removal tool for Norton 2003 to remove it completely off my system and firefox finally worked again.

If you have Norton installed just add an exception.
