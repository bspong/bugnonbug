I'm using the most recent release of Firefox.
Last night I was just browsing some normal sites I browse.  Next thing I know, Adobe Acrobat opens up, then I start getting viruses.  Windows Defender and Symantec caught a couple Trojans, but couldn't catch others.  The attacking file was in the temporary files of Firefox.  It was a malware which spammed fake anti-virus ads.  This was gotten from normal browsing without purposely downloading and installing anything.

Firefox needs to be set to require approval for all downloads.
