When I went tried to open the Javascript applet "handwriting imput" on the above website, it did not work. After trying to do that everything I tried to type in Firefox (including report page) was backwards (like xoferif for firefox)I exited out but Firefox would not reopen after that until I restarted my computer

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.yellowbridge.com/chinese/chinese-dictionary.php
2. click on the paintbrush icon
3. If it doesn't work, try typing something... if the bug is repeated, It should be backwards
4. If that happens, exit out of Firefox and try reopening it.
Actual Results:  
It did not work, and Firefox started typing backwards and then did not open until computer was restarted.

Expected Results:  
It should have opened the Javascript applet
