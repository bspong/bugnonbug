Opening two Web Consoles on the same URI causes errors

Proposed patch.

When two Web Consoles are open on two tabs with the same URI and one is closed, the second one throws errors when closed.

The proposed patch fixes this issue. I noticed this bug when fixing an issue that would cause the test "browser_webconsole_bug
_597103_deactivateHUDForContext_unfocused_window.js" for bug 597103 to fail when the browser home page was set to an unreachable URL. This patch fixes the bug in that test, which allows it to serve as a test case for this issue as well.
