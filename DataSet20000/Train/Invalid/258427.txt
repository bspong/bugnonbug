Permanent location bar has menu and can be disabled/hidden/removed (can be customized)
In experimenting with the new permananent URL bar, I found a number of problems.

1. The first time the context menu is displayed, it just has Customize. Second
time it has Customize, Bookmark Toolbar, and Navigation Toolbar.

I believe it shouldn't have any context menu, and certainly not customize.

2. If you uncheck navigation toolbar, it goes away, and there is no way to get
it back.

Not only that, now subsequent popups don't have a URL bar (completely defeating
the purpose of this fix) even though if you go to View-Toolbars, Navigation
Toolbars is checked.

The only way to get the URL bar in popups again is to uncheck Navgation Toolbar
and recheck it.
