When pc is first loading if i open firefox just a blank window loads.  I then
have to close the browser and re-open it.  If i get a link that is to open in a
_blank page the browser freezes.  I have tried all three of the link options to
open in new window, new tab, same tab and nothing works.  This also can cause my
linksys wireless B router to have to close wireless connection in which case i
have to reboot the router.  Also when this happens i have to use CTRL + ALT +
Delete to close down firefox.  Also most of my extensions have stopped working
for the most part.  Sometimes they load and sometimes they don't.  I have the
developers kit as well as foxy tunes and ip tracker.  These all worked fine in
1.06 but have stopped working in 1.07.  Please let me know if there is a fix for
this.  I have tried to uninstall and re install but nothing helped.
