Steps to reproduce:

http://JesusnJim.com/z/xhtml-css-uc-element-name-test-and-css-comment-test.xhtml
http://JesusnJim.com/z/xhtml-css-uc-element-name-test.xhtml
http://JesusnJim.com/z/xhtml-css-uc-element-name-test.xhtml

tried these tests with style comments and without.
for instance, 
<style type="text/css">
<!--
div {color:red;}
-->
</style>



Actual results:

style content is ignored.  commented out.  the html-style comments are treated like comments.



Expected results:

div content that says :"this should be red" should have been red.  style content should have been accepted.
