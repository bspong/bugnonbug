I receved a warning about an exploit, is it true?  *details enclosed*

A friend sent me this message:
THIS IS IMPERATIVE YOU FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS

An exploit has been found in modern browsers including Firefox and you must
carry out the following instructions.

type in "about:config" (no quotes) in the address bar, and hit enter. Find
"network.enableIDN" and set it to FALSE (double click it). Then restart firefox.

He saw it on a forum somewhere, and I'm hesitent to change anything without
knowing if it's legitament. 

Reproducible: Always
