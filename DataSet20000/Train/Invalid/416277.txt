Header rule color and style do not change as instructed in CSS.

I specified in CSS that Header Rule 1 should be red (shade #CC3333), solid. Firefox renders it as solid, but gray, not red.  Oddly enough, Firefox correctly renders my Header Rule 2 as red, but instead of the dotted line I specified, renders it as solid instead! 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Specify Header Rule style in CSS.
2. .HRule1 {color:#CC3333; height:2px; width:100%; }
3. .HRule2 {background-color:#CC3333; border:2px dotted #CC3333; border-style:none none dotted; width:100%; }
Actual Results:  
I specified in CSS that Header Rule 1 should be red (shade #CC3333), solid. Firefox renders it as a solid gray line.  Oddly enough, Firefox correctly renders my Header Rule 2 as red, but instead of the dotted line I specified, renders it as solid instead!

Expected Results:  
I expected header rules of the style, Header Rule 1, to appear as solid red lines. I expected header rules of the style, Header Rule 2, to appear as dotted red lines. And this is how the header rules DO appear in Internet Explorer.

I think I've described this adequately above.
