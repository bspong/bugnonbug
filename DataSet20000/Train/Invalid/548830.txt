If i have a image with id "all" then document.all is reported as a valid property, no such as a problem so far, except that this is not standard. But as you might know many javascript libraries use document.all to find out if it is IE browser so here is when the problem comes out causing the those libraries stop working properly.
And more over getting a image by document.image_id causes that every script that declares a image with the same name as a property report the image instead of the property.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Declare an image with id "all"
2.alert the value of document.all

This is a small page that show the problem

<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
<img id="all"/>
<img id="x"/>
</body>
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">	
	document.x = 10; //Not sure how many ppl use this but anyway is a potencial problem
	alert(document.all);
	alert(document.x);
</script>
</html>
Actual Results:  
The alert show HTMLImageElement

Expected Results:  
The alert should display "undefined"

I am using firebug 1.5.2 just in case that takes part.
