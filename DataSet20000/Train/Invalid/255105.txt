new links are not always opened in same browser

Using firefox-0.9.3-1.1.fc2.dag on Linux Fedora 2. Package is from here:

http://dag.wieers.com/packages/firefox/

I configured Firefox as the default browser in Gnome.

I modified /usr/bin/firefox so that new links are opened in new tabs instead of
new windows:

                if [ $RUNNING -eq 0 -a $REMOTE -ne 1 ]; then
                        MOZARGS="-remote openURL(\"$URL\",new-tab) $MOZARGS"
                        REMOTE=1
                else
                        MOZARGS="$MOZARGS $URL"
                fi;;

(i replaced new-window with new-tab)

The problem is, sometimes when i click on a URL in Evolution, the link is not
opened in the same browser instance. A new Firefox instance tries to run, and it
can't, because the Default profile is already in use by the existing instance.
I was expecting all new links to be opened in the same browser instance (either
in a new tab or a new window, depending on the settings).

I could not find anything that indicates when new links are opened in the same
browser instance and when a new instance is launched. It is apparently at random.

This problem never happens with mozilla-1.7.2 (or older); with Mozilla, all new
links are opened in the same browser instance (either new window or new tab,
depending on settings).
