Maybe I'm misled, but I'm used to a proxy exclusion list that lets you exclude
entire subnets, for example 10.*.  It appears that I have to enter each 10.
address in its entirety.  That in itself makes FF unusable.  Please consider
adding this enhancement.  I won't even demand internal wildcards--just trailing
ones will do.  Thanks in advance.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Tools - Options - Connection Settings
2. Add "10.* to the proxy exclusion list
3. Attempt to access an address in the 10. subnet.

Actual Results:  
evemtual proxy timeout

Expected Results:  
accepted the trailing wildcard
