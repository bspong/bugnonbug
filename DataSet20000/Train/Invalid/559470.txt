every 2 or 3 days flash player content on any page disappears and has the message "Requires Flash Player 10 to view. You can update at: http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer." I download the latest version for my 64bit win7 system and everything works fine for a few more days. then all flash content stops working again like it's uninstalling itself.
