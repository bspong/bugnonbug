I'm facing a strange bug in my homemade and 9 hours old 64 bits linux build. When I add a bookmark via CTRL + D, it is added at the bottom of my bookmark list.

After that, I closed firefox, and opened it a few minutes later. No more new bookmarks :(

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a website you don't have bookmarked before.
2. Bookmark it.
3. Close firefox
4. Wait about a minute or two.
5. Open again firefox and try to use the newly bookmarked site.
Actual Results:  
It had disappeared !

Expected Results:  
Erh... Having it again ?

Very recent bug. I should say that the regression could have been introduced in the last 24 hours.
