The awesome bar should not have a whitish gradient in the middle behind the site's actual icon as it looks out of place and not all sites use a square icon. This is more noticable on sites which are blue/green (certificate).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Look at the site icon background.
2. Go to https://www.paypal.com/ and loo at the icon.
Actual Results:  
Has gradient in background.

Expected Results:  
No background.

This may cause the user to think that sites with certificates has changed their icons.
