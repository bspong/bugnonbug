At closing Firefox, a box appears with option asking if I want Firefox to save my tabs for next time starting?  I click on the "Save and Quit" button, but at restarting Firefox, the tabs do not appear and the Yahoo web page shows up as a default.  This has only begun since loading the new upgrade 3.5.2 version of Firefox.  Because of this inconvenience, I have had to reinstall the prior version 3.0.13 until this is resolved.
