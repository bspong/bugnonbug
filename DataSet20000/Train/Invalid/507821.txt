Windows Live Mail opens as blank page on 2009-08-01-it has been perfectly fine for many months.. Inbox downloads to Thunderbird 2. Site opens in IE 8 directly or in Firefox using IE Tab, in Google Chrome 3 and in Opera 10. The failure occurs using WebMail Notifier, bookmark for the site and typing address into address bar. When the site is opened normally in firefox as an IE tab changing to a Firefox tab causes the display to become blank.

Reproducible: Always

1.Open Firefox 3.51

Of the browsers and mail clients I utilize Firefox 3.51 is the only application that cannot access the Live Mail site and get a normal display today while it worked perfectly throughout the life of Firefox 3.51 until now. I restarted Windows and reinstalled Firefox 3.51 to no avail.
