Complete system crash when attempting to open PDF (Adobe Reader 7.0.5)

Whenever I try to open a PDF file of any size from any location, my browser crashes, along with my entire system.  This can be reproduced only on one of my systems, but my friend has had the same problem.  No other extensions fix the problem.  When you go to a PDF file, the browser freezes, and you can go to other windows.  But if you try to exit (you cannot click on other tabs in Firefox), you get an illegal operation, and the entire system shuts down completely and restarts.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to an online PDF file
2. Click on the exit button when file does not work
3. Watch

Actual Results:  
My computer completely shuts down.

Expected Results:  
Opened the file inside the window, or downloaded it at least.

Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.1 is my version number... my other browsers work with PDFs... I cannot give a Talkback crash ID since Talkback does not activate during the crash for some reason.
