selectively enable/disable each arrow on dual-arrow back/forward dropmarker
If the Back/Forward dropmarker is changed to have two arrows instead of one per bug 422923, then it might make sense to selectively enable/disable each arrow depending on the availability of history in the two directions.

I think it would just require the code that sets the disabled state of that button to set two additional attributes indicating the disabled state for each direction along with a set of CSS rules that define the images for each combination of disabled states.

Of course, the Back and Forward buttons themselves already convey this information, but that doesn't mean further evidence wouldn't be useful.  Even the fraction of a second it takes to look from the control one wants to use to another control that identifies whether the first control is useful can be an unnecessary waste of time that detracts from one's experience.
