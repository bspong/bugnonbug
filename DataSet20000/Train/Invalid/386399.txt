History folder children often duplicated, resulting in bug-like behavior elsewhere
History folders in the sidebar are displayed with unique children only - duplicate children are filtered out in the view. However, during copy/paste transactions (which will be enabled by the fix for Bug 378558), the node's duplicate children aren't filtered out, and 'collapse duplicate' code shouldn't be put in the main copy/paste code.
