When I click on images the outline displays too to the edge and goes through images.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://zeldman.com/
2. Click on the A list apart, so you get the focus outline


Actual Results:  
The outline goes through the image, and to the far side of the screen

Expected Results:  
Display the outline only on the image marked.

I can only reproduce this with CSS backgorund images.
