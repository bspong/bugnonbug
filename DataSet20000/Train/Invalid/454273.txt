When searching for a particular topic/item my search results are displayed as expected.  However, on clicking the preferred option to browse my search is redirected to an alternative result page such as 'shadesearch.com' or 'uk.12finder.com'  It is most frustrating and as a new user of the Mac and firefox I am unsure what to do.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.type subject in search window.
2.select preferred site from search results
3.site displayed is not as expected. 
Actual Results:  
I was redirected to anything but the site I was expecting

Expected Results:  
The actual site I had wished to see

I have limited knowledge of the Mac (new user) and firefox.
