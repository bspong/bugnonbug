On loading the URL, Firefox 2.0 closes. I have tried disabling all extensions, javascript etc. and it is still reproducable. The URL to produce this is not unique; other instances have occured but this is the first URL to be isolated as a cause.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the URL.

Actual Results:  
Firefox closes and does not generate a crash report.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should *not* crash.

Other unknown URLs have caused the same problem. Problem is possibly also occuring on closing a single tab, but this is unconfirmed. Session may or may not restore.
