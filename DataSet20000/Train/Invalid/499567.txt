When you enter a text field with your mouse and move the mouse around (or type while the pointer is in the field) it flickers from the default pointer to the text pointer. Also when you hover over a link, the pointer flickers between the default windows pointer and the hand pointer (which indicates a link). It's very annoying and as near as I can remember, didn't happen in the 20090620 Nightly Build of Shiretoko. This behavior is also not seen in Chrome 3.x or IE 8.
