The Event object for keyup events is screwy. It doesn't have the correct
charCode property, for example.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Handle a keyup event
2. Output the event.charCode value

For example, load this into Firefox and press a key.

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<window id="main-window" onkeyup="foo(event)"
  xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
  xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul">
  <script>
  function foo(e) {
    alert(String.fromCharCode(e.charCode));
  }
  </script>
</window>


Actual Results:  
You often get an uppercase version if its a letter, but its often non-sensical
(to me, anyway).

Expected Results:  
Have the value of the key released.
