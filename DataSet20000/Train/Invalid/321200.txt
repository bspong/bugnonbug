All settings are ignored after firefox re-open, including visited addresses and customizable controls. All extensions settings are ignored too: tab mix plus extension doesn't open last session (appropriate checkbox to do this is checked). All-in-one Sidebar i always placed on the left-hand side instead of setting it to right-hand side. Sage is not showing feed's news list.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
First I've installed 1.0.7 firefox version, then upgraded to 1.5 ver. Installed Extensions:
DOM Inspector 1.8 - installed after first bug occurance
Talkback 1.5 - installed after first bug occurance
All-in-one gestures 0.17.4 - installed before first bug occurance
Tab Mix Plus 0.2.5.2 - installed before first bug occurance
Grab and Drag 0.9.6 - installed after first bug occurance
Google Web Accelerator 1.0.62.80 - installed after first bug occurance
Actual Results:  
Everything works OK until restart. Everything must be re-set to make it work properly, some extensions settings are not working. Bug is present even after I uninstalled some extensions.
