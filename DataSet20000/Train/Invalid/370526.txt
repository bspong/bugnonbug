adt.xpi has bad version of DOM Inspector
Not sure where this goes.

I went to install adt.xpi from:

ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/1.5.0.9/win32/xpi

Since we don't deliver the dev tools with the IBM Firefox.

The versions in the install.rdf in this package are wrong, so the DOM Inspector doesn't work.

The versions all have "pre" after them.
