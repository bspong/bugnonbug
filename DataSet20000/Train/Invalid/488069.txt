While typing in search terms with whitespace the search box the lookup list for the search box artifacts on the screen, and stays on top of all windows in all applications.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the browser
2. Type in search terms separated with spaces
Actual Results:  
Search box lookup list created an artifact on the screen. It will clear once FF is closed.

Expected Results:  
there should be no artifacts on the screen once the search has started.

I have a screen shot (13Kb) to show what the artifacting looks like.
