on an online game www.racewarkingdoms.com, everytime the enter button is hit to submit chat a command prompt comes up "you must wait for your first command to be processed or timeout in 9 seconds" this happens when nothing has been pressed before hand.  this didnt happen before firefox updated today (i had to reinstall the IE tab)but now it happens every time.  Is it me being thick and not installing the right IE tab or is this a problem?
