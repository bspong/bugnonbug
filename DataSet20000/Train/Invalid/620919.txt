After hearing about the new beta 8 release I clicked on "Check for updates" which tells me there are no updates available.
But when I click on the feedback button to report the issue it says I can't give feedback because I am no longer on the latest version of Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on "Check for updates"
Actual Results:  
Displays no updates available.

Expected Results:  
Shows beta 8 available.
