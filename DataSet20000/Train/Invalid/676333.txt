Steps to reproduce:

I found a script on the internet that hides addons from the addon page.

So I was messing around with a Firefox extension for fun, and while adding/removing the extension to test some stuff the thought came to me: "What if I were to use my extensions' unrestricted access to the DOM to 'hide' it from the about:addons page?".
Well, unfortunately it is possible. You would think there would be some sort of protection against this, right? I've only tested this in v5.0, but I'm sure it works in most (if not all) other versions.
But yeah. Any extension you make/download has the potential to make itself hidden from about:addons (which is what the average user uses to manage their addons) - and do sneaky stuff in the background. You can always check your extensions folder if you're feeling paranoid, though.
