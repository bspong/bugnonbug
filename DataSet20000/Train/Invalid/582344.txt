A single phone number will redact itself after page load completes.  The redaction is consistent across websites, TV News, Local news paper and twitter.

It only seems to affect standard web pages, it carries through in Gmail and shows without redacting.

I can see the information on the newspaper site page souce, copied here.

<p class="articleGraf">STOCKTON - Police are urging the victims of an online prostitution ring involving young girls to come forward and receive help.</p><p class="articleGraf">Christpoher Chessman, 22, of Stockton, was arrested this week in the city as part of a two-month investigation, said Officer Pete Smith, a police spokesman.</p><p class="articleGraf">Officers believe there may be several victims who have yet to be identified and are afraid to speak with police. They're asking those with information to call the Stockton Police Department Vice Unit at (209) 937-8422 and ask for Detective Wesley Grinder or to call police dispatch at (209) 937-9377.</p>	

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. reload web pages containing the string, three sites  http://twitter.com/Recordnet/status/19673735922   http://www.kcra.com/news/24407364/detail.html   http://www.recordnet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100727/A_NEWS/100729829
  

2.test in Gmail, it shows ok with no redaction
3.view page source, it presents ok with no redaction

4. tested on Chrome and IE8 & IE8/64 and the redaction does not occur.

5. When a new html page is crafted, the number redacts in a first section.

6. Both of two sections of page source from the newspaper and the tv station will show redaction in a newly created .htm file.  A combination of the two will also redact.
Actual Results:  
On web pages with html coding the number self redacts.

it is only affecting one machine at this time, probably an infection but may show there is a security hole.

Expected Results:  
Normal text showing the phone number

it is likeley a malware issue, but it may represent a security issue.  The odd thing is the NORMAL main police number (209) 937-9377 presents fine, it is just the number for vice (209) 937-8422  that redacts.
