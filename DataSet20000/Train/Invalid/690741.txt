Steps to reproduce:

1. have a window opened with tabs
2. tear a tab off to a new window
3. create a new tab in the newly created window (from the tear-off tab)
4. switch between the tabs in the new window (ctrl+pgup/pgdn)


Actual results:

2.1. in the newly created window there are no tabs
3.1 window has only 1 tab
4.1 you can actually switch between the 2 tabs, except one is not visible (content is there, but no address bar/buttons are visible; due to the fact that only one tab is visible in the tab bar)


Expected results:

2.1. in the newly created window there should be one tab
3.1 window should have 2 tabs
4.1 both tabs should have address bar/buttons for each page
