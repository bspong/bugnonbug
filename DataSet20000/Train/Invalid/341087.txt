In the History menu, there's an option called "Search in History..." with an assigned shortcut Ctrl-H.
When I click on the menu option, the history window is opened.
When I click Ctrl-H, the action depends on whether I have the "show bookmars & history" widget on my UI:
* If it's there, a strange small window with a edit box will open (Not the history window)
* If it's not on the UI, absolutely nothing happens.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on "Search in History..." in the history menu (result A)
2. Remove the "history" widget from the UI
3. Click Ctrl-H (result B)
4. Add the widget
5. Click Ctrl-H (result C)
Actual Results:  
Result A: The history window opens.
Result B: Nothing happens.
Result C: The small unfocused window appears

Expected Results:  
All three situations should have the same results which is showing a consistent sort of History widget / list / search
