Contradicts Bug 616014. Arguments for removing the close button are:

1. The close button is of little use and also annoying for people who decide to have the add-ons bar enabled at all times. They don't want to close that toolbar
2. The toolbar can already be closed by rightclicking any toolbar.
3. The close button is inconsistent with all the other regular toolbars
4. Since the add-ons toolbar looks like a Find in page toolbar, and the Close buttons are aligned while the Find in page bar is open, the close button draws attention when wanting to close the Find in page bar

More arguments for removing the Close button are welcome in the comments.
