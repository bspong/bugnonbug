Excessive memory usage in Safe Mode (FF v3.0.4)

I opened 6 tabs with different webpages and waited for them to all finish loading.  Left browser sitting for over an hour to let it just idle.  Opened the same webpages, in the same order, in Internet Explorer 6.0, and waited a similar amount of time.  Peak Memory Usage in FireFox is TWICE that of Internet Explorer, which is horrendous considering how old that browser is.  Also, idle (current) memory usage is almost 25% higher between the two.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the following URLs (in Safe Mode), one in each Tab, in this order:
http://www.myspace.com/
http://www.head-fi.org/
http://www.gmail.com/
http://www.discover.com/
http://www.capitalone.com/
https://www.bankofamerica.com/

2. Wait for all pages to finish loading, paying attention to active content (Java etc) to make sure those are done loading as well.

3. Do the same in any other browser (testing in this caase was done via Internet Explorer 6.0) -- notable difference is each webpage was loaded in a different WINDOW, as IE 6.x doesn't support Tabbed Browsing, however as stated the order in which the pages were opened was the same.

3.  View memory usage in Windows Task Manager or other similar application, noting difference(s) between the two browsers
Actual Results:  
Watch memory usage climb well above that of IE 6.x loading the same pages in same order

Expected Results:  
Memory usage should be much lower than this a browser as outdated and inefficient as IE 6.x
