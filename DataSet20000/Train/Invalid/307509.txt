Pages will not load in firefox will work in other web browsers
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.11) Gecko/20050728

When i start up firefox it does not bring me to home page.  When i type a
address in it doesnt search but says done.  I always end up at a blank page.  My
troubleshooting has led me to: reinstall with restart, delete all firefox and
interent files adn then reinstall with restart, and this preference change 

1.Type “about:config” into the address bar and hit return. Scroll down and look
for the following entries:

network.http.pipelining network.http.proxy.pipelining
network.http.pipelining.maxrequests

Normally the browser will make one request to a web page at a time. When you
enable pipelining it will make several at once, which really speeds up page loading.

2. Alter the entries as follows:

Set “network.http.pipelining” to “true”

Set “network.http.proxy.pipelining” to “true”

Set “network.http.pipelining.maxrequests” to some number like 30. This means it
will make 30 requests at once.

3. Lastly right-click anywhere and select New-> Integer. Name it
“nglayout.initialpaint.delay” and set its value to “0”. This value is the amount
of time the browser waits before it acts on information it receives.

This worked temporarily.  But now i have the same problem i checked to see if
the values had been reset but they remain the same.

help!
