firefox requests page in endless loop
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.2; WOW64; Trident/4.0)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1

I noticed a couple days ago that firefox (then 3.0.x) (now whats pasted in the build identifier) was getting really slow and gmail would not work at all. Internet explorer worked fine and firefox in ubuntu inside vmware worked just fine as well. I started looking in wireshark and noticed that in the broken firefox, everytime i requeseted a page (GET /) that the page was being requested in an endless loop. I tried this across multiple sites and got the same behaviour. Only after exiting the tab or closing firefox did the requests stop.

I uninstalled my firewall (comodo) and disabled my AV but have the same issues. I also made sure my machine was syncing time properly and it was. Since it spans multiple firefox installs, 3.0.x, 3.5, compplete uninstall/redownload/reinstall of 3.5, I think maybe its some file thats not removed by the installs or a bug I have just triggered in all version.
