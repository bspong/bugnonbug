Binary components of add-ons aren't loaded anymore since data-driven-compreg has been landed

Since the data-driven-compreg patches on bug 568691 have been landed, binary components shipped with add-ons aren't getting loaded anymore. Looks like that we don't register those components after the add-ons manager has registered the add-on itself.

I have seen that behavior while working on our MozMill crowd extension which is using the IPC-PIPE component from bug 68702. After building the binaries for 32bit and 64bit and putting those in the appropriate folders below the platform folder, they don't get registered during start-up.

I will attach a copy of the extension which should be extracted into the extensions folder of a profile.

I request blocking Beta 7 because it's really important for add-on authors to be able to use their binary components.
