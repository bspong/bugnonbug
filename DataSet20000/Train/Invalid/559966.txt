EV Cert vanishes if non-SSL resource accessed from page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_3; en-us) AppleWebKit/531.22.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.5 Safari/531.22.7

This only affects the more expensive EV certificates. This problem surfaced at some point in 3.5. The problem does not exist in 3.0.

Accessing a non-HTTPS image from with the HTTPS page causes the EV cert to become invalid regardless of whether the user accepts the "unencrypted information" popup.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Obtain an EV cert from Verisign
https://www.verisign.com/ssl/ssl-information-center/ev-ssl-certificate/index.html
2. Create a basic page with an image tag served via EV HTTPS
<html><img src="ssl_image.png"/></html>
3.With the page loaded and the green EV cert moniker in the URL bar, open the JavaScript console and execute the following:
document.getElementsByTagName('img')[0].src = "http://www.example.com/nonssl_image.png";
4. Not that the EV cert disappears from the URL bar


Expected Results:  
The EV cert should persist beyond the popup warning about requesting unencrypted information.

When clicking on the un-greened cert in the URL bar, the "More information" button shows the web site identity owner as "This web site does not supply ownership information.".
