Make the Secure Connection Failed window scrollable or adjustable when it is too large
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.2a1pre) Gecko/20110406 Firefox/4.2a1pre

When the Secure Connection Failed window warning message is very long that may even exceed the height of my screen resolution, I cannot view the entire warning message since the window is not scrollable and the window size is not adjustable. The bottom part of the message is always out of the screen.
When I try to drag the window upwards, it will snap back to the top with the titlebar always visible. I can only click the close button to continue browsing.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
It should be a general case. But here is the site when I first encounter this problem:
1. Install https-everywhere-0.9.9.development.4 . Make sure the rule "WordPress" is enabled so as to get a long warning message.
2. Visit http://hangtime.blogs.nba.com/2011/04/06/gasol-still-fighting-soft-label/?ls=iref:nbahpt1 (or click the URL above)
3. Wait until a warning window appears. (It does as of 2011-04-07 02:00 UTC+8)
4. Reload a few times if no warning appears.
Actual Results:  
A very long warning window pops out. I cannot view the entire message since the window height exceed my screen resolution.

Expected Results:  
A scrollable or size-adjustable window should pop out.
