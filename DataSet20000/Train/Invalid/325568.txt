I'm using FireFox 1.5 v. FR, and when I open my Preferences window, on the "Navigation par onglets" tab (means "Tabbed browsing" in english) there is a red text (maybe XML ?) which appears at the bottom : <tab label="&prefPanel.links;"/>
And this text stays there, even if I click on another tab. After, on some tabs, the bottom of their content is clipped by this text.
Here is a screenshot : http://cjoint.com/?ccm6JiaKTU
And on another tab : http://cjoint.com/?ccm0iNfTzT
It's maybe because of an addon ?

1. Click on Outils, Options, Navigation par onglets
