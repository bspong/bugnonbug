I started up Firefox and found all my bookmarks and tool bar shortcuts gone.

I am running a Mac Pro, with dual 3.0 xeon duo core processors.  OS 10.4.1.. When I went to start up Firefox this evening, I found all the bookmarks gone and the toolbar shortcuts gone.  This is the first time I can remember a browser ever doing this.
