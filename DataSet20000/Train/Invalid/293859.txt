Aborting installer prevents existing FF from restarting
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; fr-FR; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

When upgrading to FF 1.0.4 through the upgrade process in FF 1.0.3, I finally
decided to go the clean way, as recommended in Release Notes, and uninstall FF
1.0.3 first to install FF 1.0.4 in the same directory, but fresh.

So I cancelled the installation and tried to reopen my existing FF to download
the installer in the regular way.  Upon startup, FF displayed a message box
stating it could not open due to an incomplete installation that had to finish.
 Evidently, cancelling the installation did not reset some dont-start flag
somewhere.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open FF in a non-latest version
2. Make it search for upgrades
3. Download the FF (presumably 1.0.4) upgrade
4. Close FF in the background once the individual installer is launched
4. Maybe you'll need to get a few steps in the installation (say, License and
directory choice)
5. Cancel the installation process
6. Try to launch FF again
Actual Results:  
FF refuses to launch due to an "incomplete installation that has to finish."

Expected Results:  
FF should launch properly, the new installation not having been performed, and
the existing FF being untouched.
