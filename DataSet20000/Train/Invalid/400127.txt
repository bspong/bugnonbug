That is a screenshot of the problem, which does reoccur on a new profile.  What happens is, when entering a word into the webster search tool bar, in this case "nebbish" it loads webster.com but with the error of  "!#+#! No entries found. Invalid input" as if I had entered !#+#! as the word to be searched for.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Select the Webster search tool
2.Type in a word to be searched
3.Push the enter key
