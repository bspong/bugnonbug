Upgrading to Firefox 3.0.5 wiped out bookmarks and ability to make new ones
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5

When I opened Firefox to do some work it upgraded itself to v 3.0.5.  The file containing bookmarks was deleted in the upgrade.  I am unable to create new bookmarks.  Also (should this be a separate report?), while I have set the option for Firefox to open to my homepage, the new version does not, I have to manually click on the homepage icon on the toolbar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Starting Firefox
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Firefox opens to a blank window and there are no bookmarks.  Pressing Ctrl-D to create bookmarks does nothing.  Using the menu to try to create a bookmark does nothing.

Expected Results:  
I expected to be able to use my carefully stored research links and be able to create new bookmarks, but I am unable to do so.

Yeah, I know I probably should have backed up the bookmarks file...

There goes 5 months of research.  Oh, well, I still have my notes...
