Firefox v1.5 Proxy bug causes display menu to stretch very wide
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

I have windows XP Pro,  Roadrunner High speed cable with router, Firefox v1.5
I have this problem on more than one computer.   I have tried 20 or so different IP Addresses
I am trying to use different anomonous proxies while I surf to cut down on popups and webjunk.
I do not like websites telling me my computer specs and browser info.

I got Firefox > Tools > options > General tab-Connection settings > Manual proxy configutation
Then I type in an IP and the port number.   Some IP's i have tried are :
204.146.30.20    : 80
81.169.167.128  : 3128
69.147.26.150    : 553
68.87.72.164      : 553
12.193.208.172  : 80


I close browser and reopen it.
No matter what site I go to, it streches horizontally so wide, you can not see what is on the screen.
I get part of an error message at the bottom of the window.

<HTML>[]<Head>>[]<title>error: the requested url could not be retrieved............

I can surf/access any site. After I arrive at the site the screen is normal for a few seconds then it stretches out by itself and the error message appears. If I change tabs the problem disappears for a short while but always returns.
Firefox is the only browser affected. Firefox's display is normal if I go back to using a direct connection.   (Tools > options > General tab-Connection settings > Direct connection to the internet.)

Try it for yourself.  This bug makes using proxies useless.
I need help.
How can I fix this.
