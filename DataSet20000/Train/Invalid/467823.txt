I have a log in form that uses a POST method to submit user and password.  After the form is submitted, the url in the history shows the form fields and data on the url (get method).

I have other log in forms that do not show this symptom. I've compared the source of the two and can not see any difference that would cause this.

The forms are intranet applications but if you'd like I can send you the html so it can be replicated on your server.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.fill out form
2. submit form
3.pull down url history 
Actual Results:  
http://zzz.example.com/cgi-bin/admin/login.pl?username=yyyy;passwd=xxxx;Login= Log In 

Shows in the history but the login.pl used POST method in the form

Expected Results:  
http://zzz.example.com/cgi-bin/admin/login.pl

I did not want to post actual url information but will supply it to someone working on the bug.

I listed this as a major bug since log in and password information as shown in clear text in the history and web logs.
