Not sure of the exact terminology, so i appologise if this is a dupe. 

Certain sites (mediawiki sites and bugzilla are the only ones i've found sofar) cause a tab to not be displayed if the penultimate tab is closed: the beigue blank screen is displayed instead.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.close all tabs bar one
2.visit a media wiki site, such as wikipedia... also works for me on this site (ie, bugzilla)
3.press ctrl + tab to open another tab
4.ensure that the mediawiki/bugzilla tab is on the left, and the new one on the right.
4.make sure that the new tab has focus. doesnt matter wether a site is displayed in the new tab or not.
5. close the new tab whilst it has focus.
Actual Results:  
tab bar dissapears (as it should when only one tab is open)

beigue blank-screen is displayed -- title bar reads 'mozilla firefox'

Expected Results:  
tab bar dissapears

wikipedia page/bugzilla page should be displayed

workaround/recovery:

1. press ctrl+t to open a new tab.
2. not that the original tab now reappears.
3. focus the original tab
4. close the other tab whilst the mediawiki/bugzilla page has focus
