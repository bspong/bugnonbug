Firefox 2 linux hangs using flash player v9, works with v7
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

To mention that this happened also with this site:

The problem is Firefox 2 stops responding and it also DISABLES the keyboard. When I tried to kill it with the graphical System Monitor it did not die. So I shut the system down using the mouse, but it got stuck and did not succeed to finish the shutdown process. So I reseted it, and it did not boot several times, till I performed an Integrity Check (which also got stuck once). First time this happened I thought I have a problem with my disk or so, but the second time when it happened with another site, I just went back to Firefox 1.5: I cannot risk.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox 2 on FC2, on a PC.
2. Enter the site:

Actual Results:  
Browser stops responding and cannot be killed. Keyboard stops responding. The GNOME continues to work. When shutting down the system it doesn't succeed to properly shutdown. After resetting the PC, and booting the Linux, it does not succeed to finish the booting process.

Expected Results:  
It should never stop responding, but rather announce if it encountered a problem.
