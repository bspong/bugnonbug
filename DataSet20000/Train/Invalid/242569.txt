The browser hangs when I try to visit a non-existant domain.

When I enter a url like the one above and hit enter, the browser hangs. I still
get screen repainting, but I am unable to hit the stop button. When I click on a
button, the title bar changes to include Not Responding and I have to kill the
browser. This happens every time on both M8 and the most recent nightly. I do
not have this problem at home where there is no proxy. The proxy settings are
autoconfigured from a URL. 

Ideally, the stop button would be available to cancel this action.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. enter http://www.mktst.com in location bar
2. hit enter

(It appears you need to have a proxy configured. This may be specific to the
firewall we run.

Actual Results:  
The browser hangs

Expected Results:  
Not hang, or, if the problem exists on the proxy, the stop button should be
available.

The autoconfig script is available on demand, but I do not want it made publicly
available.
