For screen resolution below 1024x768, search results are displayed in a minimal box. I think it's better to add a vertical scroll bar for the entire search panel, and not only for the result box. You can test it with the pdf I submitted as url. See the screenshot:

I see this problem also with Firefox 2.0.0.12

Reproducible: Always
