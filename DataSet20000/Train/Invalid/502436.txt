Prior to Firefox 3.5 alt+left arrow / alt+right arrow was used to work as shortcut keys for back/forward navigation on the web page. This is no longer working with 3.5.

The problem is severve, since this shortkeys were used by Logitech mouse owners for back/fwd navigation. (The offical Logitech support suggest also using these shortcuts http://logitech-en-amr.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/logitech_en_amr.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_sid=eOnBQxzh&p_lva=1857&p_li=&p_faqid=2178&p_created=1108680828)

Please fix it.

Thanks
