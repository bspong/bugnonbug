When opening a group of bookmarks, adblock does not work (I do not know if this
is a fault of adblock or Firebird). When reloading one of the pages, adblock
does work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a group of bookmarks
2. Look if the advertisements are still there
3. Press reload for a page and the ads disappear
