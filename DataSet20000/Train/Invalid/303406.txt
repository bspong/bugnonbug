How ya doin?

When using RTL direction unicode characters in the LTR direction, the characters
get scrambled with other surrounding characters. Actually this problem also
exists in IE, but I don't feel like going to their site to report it.

Here, make this page and save it as .html,

<html>
<head></head>
<body>
    &#1603;, 12ab
</body>
</html>

Notice, how the unicode character is before 12ab, but when you display it in the
browser you get this type of output:

12,&#1603;ab

Which is really strange.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.It's in the details.

Actual Results:  
The characters were scrambled with surrounding characters.

Expected Results:  
Simply not scrambled the characters.
