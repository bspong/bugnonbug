Changing themes removes forward/back keys and turns off scroll bars.

As soon as I change themes in Firebird and restart the browser, I lose the
forward and back keys in the navigation toolbar and my scrollbars disappear
(thankG for mousewheels).  

I have repeated this error, ad naseum, with different users, from scratch, etc.

Turning off the toolbar and rebuilding it doesn't help, as those keys are not
among the choices.  

I have tried downloading different themes (or not, as the case may me), tried
playing with different extensions, etc. - it appears to be theme change related.
 Returning to the default theme doesn't help.

On another machine I have, the key choice list for building toolbars is all
monkeyed up - one key (like the "Bookmarks" key) has 15+ icons, most repeated
(but not the right one) under the single title.  I haven't dared move the blob
into place.  Don't know how related that one is.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  mozillafirebird.exe -p
2.  create new user profile
3.  download any of the themes available through the menus.
4.  restart browser

Actual Results:  
My browser becomes annoying to use, as I have to right click to move back
through my history and I can't see scroll bars (left/right and up/down).

Expected Results:  
Maintained its visage.

Vanilla XP Home installation, nothing funny.
