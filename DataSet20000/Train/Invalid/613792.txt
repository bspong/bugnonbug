i have two suggestions

sometimes i get soo many tabs that its hard to keep sifting them

allow me to right click on the tabs and get a vertical list up of what tabs i have in this window, then allow me to sort them according to topic with the parent at the left (if firefox monitors which tabs come from which tab this can be done automatically - maybe even show a tree) then every topic i have can have a new row of tabs or a row of tabs moved to another window.

saving more tabs:
also when closing window it asks me if i am sure if i want to close all the tabs, have a third option, that is close firefox saving the tabs and the windows. and bring them all back when user runs again. the only way to do this right now is to have firefox crash or something.
