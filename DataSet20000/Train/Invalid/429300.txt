When i installed the beta version it found the AiRoboform and stated that it this was cnot compatable 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.loaded new version of the beta version
2.Firefox found AiRobotForm and ask if i would like to find any version compatable.  I select Yes 
3.Message then displayed stating it could find version compatable 
Actual Results:  
Not sure if this would mean some backward coding to allow AiRoboForm to work. As this is used as part of my testing enviroment.

Expected Results:  
To add the AiRoboForm icon to browser icon options menu bar.

To give the user an option to open a previous version of firefox. And to inform Mozila of the incompatability issue.
