[regression 4.0] Optionally save session when closing more tabs (removed in 4?)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

I don't usually want to save my open tabs, but sometimes i don't want to loose what I was browsing.

In firefox 3 i loved that when I closed more than a tab it didn't ask me "you're going to close X tabs. Confirm?" but it asked me "do you want to save this session? Y/N/remember"

Now why was this function removed? Is it only a preference or it was completely removed?


It's uncomfortable to go "preferences -> general -> startup -> restore session" and then "preferences -> general -> startup -> show favourite" every time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open >= 2 tabs with some website
2. Click close firefox
3.
Actual Results:  
Firefox ask confirmation to close (and loose) those tabs.

Expected Results:  
Firefox asks whether you want to save session or close anyways (and loose) those tabs.
