Private Browsing doesn't restore tabs.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:8.0a2) Gecko/20110822 Firefox/8.0a2
Build ID: 20110822042002

Steps to reproduce:

After opening a few tabs normally, I opened private browsing. After using private browsing, I closed the browser, and then re-opened it.


Actual results:

All tabs from my previous browsing were gone, as if I opened a new page.


Expected results:

All tabs should have been restored instead.
