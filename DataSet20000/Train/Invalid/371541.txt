If I have two browser windows open and I make a Google search in the first one and click one of the results the result opens in a new tab in this first window (I have set Google preferences so that it will open results in a new window and the Firefox settings so that new window is actually opened as a new tab). Then I change to seconds browser window and make Google search also in that. But when I click one of the search results in the second window the page will be opened in the tab in the first window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open two browser windows
2. go to google.com in the first window
3. set Firefox preferences so that new windows are actually opened as new tabs
4. set Google preferences so that the results are opened in new window
5. make a search in the first browser window and open one of links
6. change to the second browser window
7. make a search in the second browser window and open one of links
Actual Results:  
the link clicked in second window will be loaded in the tab of the first window

Expected Results:  
a new tab will be opened in the second window
