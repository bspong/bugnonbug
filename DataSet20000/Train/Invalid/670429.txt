Yahoo mail crash Mozilla while Tor is enabled.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.18) Gecko/20110614 Firefox/3.6.18
Build ID: 20110614230723

Steps to reproduce:

Logged into my Yahoo mail and tried to sent email. Torbutton was on. Mozilla crashed like 100 times. I have this problem earlier but I delete Yahoo State Plug-in and everything was alright for a while but now I have same issues.

This is my crash report: https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/bp-88306beb-8d78-4fab-ae03-8c8c32110709

I'm not good at this so I need help. I don't know how to fix it.


Actual results:

Mozilla crashes every time and emails are never sent.


Expected results:

Mozilla shouldn't crash and emails should be sent.
