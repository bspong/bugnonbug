Personas footer fits from left to right instead right to left (like Personas header is doing well)

Create a Personas footer with an image on the right side, the image doesn't appear when the Firefox window is smaller than the footer size is.

So it seems that Personas fits the footer from left to right instead right to left

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. make a Personas footer 3.000 px wide with an image on the right side
2. place the footer
3. the right image on the footer don't appear because Personas footer fits from left to right instead from right to left
