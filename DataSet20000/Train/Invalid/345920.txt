if min tab width is too small (60 px, for example) there are problems with the focus box
if min tab width is too small (60 px, for example) there are problems with the focus box

to reproduce:

1)  set your min tab width pref to 60 px
2)  open lots of tab (so you get overflow)
3)  click on a tab and click on the label to set focus (a blue focus ring on mac)

first screen shot, how it looks at 100 px (I'm glad we changed it!)
second screen shot, how it looks at 60 px

thanks to marcia for spotting this.
