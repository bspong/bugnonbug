I got an email and included in the email was a reference to (www.zepti.com).
I clicked on it, and got a message that Mozilla did not know how to open it becasue it did not support TTP. I was scared of this. I do nlt know what TTP is, but it seemed to be just a reference to a web site. Is it that the Http wasn't included or that the parentheses are around it or is TTP a sinister thing.
