http load speeds (internet explorer is pwning firefox this needs to be fixed)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: firefox

i was using firefox on linux and i noticed webpages loaded much faster then 
they do on my window firefox (on the same computer/connection) so i was 
tweaking my network settings on windows and nothing was working.. then i went 
to a few pages in internet explorer and it loaded them insanely quicker than 
firefox... what could be causing this? (its rather disturbing having to use 
internet explorer)

Reproducible: Always
