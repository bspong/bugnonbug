I signed up for a webinar, downloaded the software to get into the webinar, then clicked to enter the webinar.  When I tried to enter the webinar, I was asked what software I wanted to use.  I picked the software I just downloaded, but I guess I should not have picked the software download that ended in exe.

Now Firefox is remembering my choice, because I clicked a box telling it to do that.  The only way I can get into the Webinar now is to use IE.  I have cleared my cache and don't know what else to do.

Error Message:

Firefox can't find the file at tc5://?password=&room=rs5f641bec3e76&username=&other=67.19.5.34&br=0&rt=Sam^Clark's^Webinar^Room&rl=.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I click on the link to the webinar in my Email.
2.I click on the sentence to enter the webinar.
3.I get the error message I posted above.
Actual Results:  
Already explained above.

Expected Results:  
I get the error message.

Opened the Webinar.  I just need to clear whatever Firefox saved and I don't know how to do that.
