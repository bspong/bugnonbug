DOCTYPE declaration should be leading over extension

The extension of a document should not be leading over the DOCTYPE declaration. This means that is should be possible to create an XHTML document in a file that has the extension .html (or .html).

When the XHTML references other namespaces, like svg, it must be interpreted as XHTML and not HTML (4.x?), because this functionality is otherwise lost.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an XHTML containing SVG (see attachment)
2. Open this with the extension .xhtml
3. Verify that is renders correctly
4. Change the extensiotn to .html
5. Reopen and notice that all namespaces are ignored, while the DOCTYPE is still XHTML!

Actual Results:  
ignored SVG

Expected Results:  
document rendering according to the DOCTYPE
