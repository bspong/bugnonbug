I lost use of the upper and lower scroll buttons (while viewing Google news) after I installed the add-on FoxyTunes. When I uninstalled FoxyTunes the scrolling function returned.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

Not much to add to the summary. 

I tested Firefox and IE7 on the same screen and with the same web sites loaded. IE7 worked and Firefox did not .... until I uninstalled the FoxyTunes add-on.

I could use the scroll bar itself to raise /lower the page - but not the scroll buttons.

I can live without FoxyTunes - but I did like it - and I'd like it back please. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Install FoxyTunes
2.  Experience the error in use of the vertical scroll buttons.
3.  Unisntall Foxytunes and get the scroll functions back.

Actual Results:  
No FixyTunes; scrolling OK

Expected Results:  
FoxyTunes should NOT affect the vertical scrolling function.
