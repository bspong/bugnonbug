Can't use Firefox. You removed the link for "View - Page Info
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040910

I frequently use the "View - Page Info" link in Mozilla. I just started using
Firefox and see that you have removed it. WHY? Please put it back. It was one of
the many features that made Mozilla a much better browser. For now it is back to
Mozilla because I absolutely need this feature in my browser.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on the "View" menu in Firefox 1.0. It is not there.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Nothing. Cannot view the page info.

Expected Results:  
I wanted the link to "Page info" so I can view the page info.

This is NOT a request for a new feature. It is a request for a feature to be
RESTORED.
