Since I loaded 3.0 and 3.01 I can't launch Firefox from within Thunderbird by link. Yes my default browser is Firefox. It hangs Firefox and I have to kill the process before I can launch it manually.
Workaround: Launch Firefox before clicking link in Thunderbird.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have email with hyperlink
2. click hyperlink
3.Firefox does not open



Should have opened Firefox
