I have a HTML page with a textbox that has an "onChange" javascript specified. When I open this page and type something into the textbox, Firefox crashes. This does not happen with other versions of Firefox/IE/Netscape. This also does not happen if I launch Firefox from Unix, just Windows 2000/

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Firefox crash.

Expected Results:  
Call the javascript specified.
