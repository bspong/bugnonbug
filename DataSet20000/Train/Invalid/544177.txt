Clearing recent history corrupts the live bookmark favicons of pages already visited with those of current opened tabs. This continues to take hold (aka favicons change based on continued browsing) until the user revisits the affected pages in the live bookmark.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Requirements: Multiple tabs open. Live Bookmark exists.

Step 1: In a new tab, view any page on a live bookmark. Ex. Use the BBC live bookmark that comes with Firefox.
Step 2: Leave other tabs open. Clear all history.
Step 3: Open up live bookmark. Favicons for pages that had been visited prior to clearing history changes to those of open tabs (including those prior to clearing)
Actual Results:  
Favicons in the Live Bookmark for pages that have been loaded change to those of pages that were open in various tabs.

Expected Results:  
Favicons in the Live Bookmark should be cleared or remain the correct ones.
