I make a wordpress plugin (share and follow) that has many users reporting to me that the window.sidebar.addPanel(title, url,"") element of the bookmarking has stopped funcitoning properly in Firefox. 

I've tested this substantially and re-checked the code that was working only 2 weeks ago and have found the same problem as them. Please see the link and click on the "star" bookmark button under the post. 

What happens when you click on it is that it tries to bookmark the physical content of the HREF='' and not the javascript response that should take up that space.  

i.e.  actual code on page for location
javascript:window.bookMark('http%3A%2F%2Fshare-and-follow.com%2Fwordpress-plugin%2F2010%2F10%2Fversion-1-50-now-out-cdn-extra-icon-sets-more-social-networks-massive-change-in-code-its-halloween%2F',%20'Version+1.50+now+out.+CDN%2C+extra+icon+sets%2C+more+social+networks%2C+massive+change+in+code%E2%80%A6+it%E2%80%99s+Halloween%21',%20BrowserDetect.browser);

bookMark() runs this code 
 window.sidebar.addPanel(thetitle, theurl,"");

BrowserDetect.browser() just reports back what browser such as Firefox

Wanted response in the location when clicking the button is

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. goto URL
2. click "star"  bookmark button under post
3. Look at location in the browser popup much for bookmarking
Actual Results:

I have had reports from 3 users of my plugin so far.  I cannot say what version of firefox they use.  This will effect every website/page that has javascript browser bookmarking for firefox
