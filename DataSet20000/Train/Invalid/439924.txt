xml-stylesheet href location doesn't support more than 3 backward steps in the relative path (backward step here meaning "..\" components in the path).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create valid xml file and stylesheet
2. create a directory structure where the stylesheet is at the bottom of hierarchy and the xml file is in a path eg a/b/c/d/g/style.xslt
3. open the xml file in firefox
Actual Results:  
Stylesheet is not found

Expected Results:  
Stylesheet would have been found and used in rendering the page

Tested only with xml and xslt stylesheets and using file:// protocol.
