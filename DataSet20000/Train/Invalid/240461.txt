when i tries to enter any chinese language site, my firefox would just close
unexpectedly. it should load at least with unidentified character or soemthing,
but it just refuse to open any site with foreign character.

however, it only works by user root to view this site using firefox. other user
would have this same problem.

shows empty. however, same entry for bookmark by user root, it display properly
the chinese character
