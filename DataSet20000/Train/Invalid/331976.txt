INSTALLING FIREFOX HAS ERADICATED MY EBAY TOOLBAR 
After installing Firefox and selecting the eBay site, the eBay Toolbar had been eradicated. Reinstalling the eBay toolbar has no effect. If I cannot use this essential tool when browsing the eBay site, then I will have to uninstall Firefox permanently.
Please tell me how I can restore my eBay toolbar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In desktop - click on eBay icon
2. System window pops up - "Do you want Firefox to access the internet?"
3. eBay site appears minus the eBay toolbar.
4. Return to Desktop - reinstall eBay toolbar.
5) repeat 1-4 with same effect.

Actual Results:  
No sign of eBay Toolbar, which seems to be suppressed by Firefox

Expected Results:  
I expect Firefox not to suppress an essential eBay toolbar

The Firefox toolbar should appear in addition to already installed Toolbars, not to suppress them
