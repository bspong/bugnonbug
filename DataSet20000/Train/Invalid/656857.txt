Clicking a tab used to switch to that tab on mouse-UP.
A couple of updates ago this changed to mouse-DOWN.

This breaks all functions where you need to drag a tab within the context of another tab.

Very disturbing, since i have several extensions that need this to work.

An example:
In speed dial ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/speed-dial/ ),
when you are at the page with the dials you  drag tabs to dials to populate them.
Now that function is impossible to use, since the page you are about to drop the tab disappears the instance you grab the tab to drag it.

Please return the this function to its previous working order.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Grab a tab to drag it to the current page
2. Se your current page disappear before you can do anything.
3. Smash something.
