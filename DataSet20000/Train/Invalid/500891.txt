"multipart/x-replace-mixed" Streams do not render any but the last piece

The "multipart/x-replace-method" Internet media type is supposed to be used for HTTP push communication. Each time the client receives a boundary and corresponding piece of the stream, it is supposed to clear what it has rendered already and render the next piece.

I believe this used to work in Firefox, at least I see several example pages on the web claiming it works, but it would seem to be broken in Firefox 3/3.5b4. Firefox waits for the whole stream to be downloaded, and then displays the last piece.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the URL above
Actual Results:  
Firefox waits for the whole stream to be completely downloaded. During the download, nothing is rendered in the browser. Once it is completed, the last piece of the multipart stream is displayed

Expected Results:  
Each piece should be displayed as it is downloaded
