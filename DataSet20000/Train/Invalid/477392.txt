This web page causes Firefox (on Mac) consistently to hang or crash:

Sorry about the google link.  If I click it, it'll probably hang the browser before I can finish this bug report, although you may have to try to play the video to get it to hang.

This is just after the most recent update to 3.0.6, so maybe something got broken?  

BTW, this happens with a clean "new session".

Reproducible: Always
