Cookie Setting Resets Each Time I Restart FireFox

Everytime I turn on firefox I need to go into Tools --> Options and Check the "Accept Cookies from Sites" checkbox because it resets when I shut down firefox (or restart after an update/extension add on, etc.) 

It stays on for the session, just doesn't remember it for the next time.

I understand that this could be an isolated incident limited to my computer, but still worth reporting.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a site requiring Cookie (Gmail)
2. Keep getting message that my cookie acceptance setting is off
3. Go into preference and set it as on
4. Rinse and repeat on each retry



I had a lot of the FireBug and FireBug related extensions (such as FireCookie). I thought maybe firecookie was causing the problem, so I disabled it, but still its happening.
