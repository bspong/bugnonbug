while typing any letters into the location bar, pressing "Enter" cannot turn the tab to the pages.
However, press the "Go" button can make that.

I found this may due to the conflict with the dev edition Extension of Tab Mix Plus 0.3.0.60728. But Tab Mix Plus 0.3.0.60728 works well on Bon Echo 20060731, just after the autouptate, the problem came in.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. useing Tab Mix Plus 0.3.0.60728
2. update to Bon Echo 20060801
3. type anything in the location bar, then press Enter.

Actual Results:  
cannot turn to any pages.

Expected Results:  
Bon Echo will work with the Tab Mix Plus extension.
