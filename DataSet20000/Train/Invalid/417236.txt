In Firefox (3.0b3) the address bar dropdown is not cleared even after clearing the Private data (with Browsing History checkbox checked). Started happening right after 3.0b3 was installed


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on Tools
2. Click on "Clear Private Data"
3. Click on "Clear Private Data now" with the "Browsing History" checkbox checked
4. Check the Address bar. The sites visited recently are still shown in there
Actual Results:  
The address bar drop down still shows the recently visited sites

Expected Results:  
The address bar should not show any sites visited since History should have been cleared

The address bar should not show the recently visited sites
