Ensure browser.tabs.autoHide preference exists before asking for boolean value
Created attachment 382601
patch (check pref type first)

Suppose the browser.tabs.autoHide preference doesn't exist (because a corporate consumer is updating their Firefox base).

In BrowserStartup(), prepareForStartup() didn't catch the exception.  delayedStartup() never executes, and gSessionHistoryObserver is never added.

The result is this assertion on shutdown:
###!!! ASSERTION: Oops! You're asking for a weak reference to an object that doesn't support that.: 'factoryPtr', file c:/svn/ff_1.0_FF3.5/fx-debug/xpcom/build/nsWeakReference.cpp, line 109
