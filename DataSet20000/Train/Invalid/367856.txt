Blank window is restored when session resuming is enabled and crash recovery is disabled.

I can restore last windows/tabs when I shut down Firefox normally. 
But when I disable crash recovery feature (bug 364972) and I met crash,
no tabs are restored.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.make session resuming enabled
  (In main tab on the preferences panel, select "Show my windows and tabs from last time")
2.make crash recovery disabled (set pref "sessionstore.resume_from_crash" to false)
  (on trunk builds dynamic changing seems not to work. maybe regression from bug 340895. I don't tested on trunk builds)
3.do something to crash Firefox
4.restart Firefox
Actual Results:  
restores one window with only blank tab

Expected Results:  
restore last saved session. should be something but not blank tab.
