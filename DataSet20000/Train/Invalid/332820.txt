I have noted this about a year ago (http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.php/msg/3ed75b70242ccf56)

1. When the CSS file size is getting more than about 35k, the contents get scrambled and getting overwritten by some random contents from other files. This eventually makes the CSS rules doesn't get applied.

2. This also happend when I tried recently the prototype.js. JavaScript console throws error stating "illegal character" on random line for every reload. When looking the line number throw the JavaScript console, I could see scrambled texts and some random contents overwritten there.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Here is a sample result on one run:

Error: illegal character
Source File: http://localhost/foo/js/lib/prototype.js
Line: 1205, Column: 12
Source Code:
      this.e

On clicking that (Note the garbage texts and overwritten/randomly inserted text from (memory) file:
