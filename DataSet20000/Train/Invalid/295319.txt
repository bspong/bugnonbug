Firefox is really bad at detecting whether it is the default browser
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050524 Firefox/1.0.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050524 Firefox/1.0.3

After uninstalling and re-installing firefox, the internet icon on my start menu
stopped working. Firefox still believed it was the default browser so I tried to
convince it otherwise.
I remove the filetype association for html and htm files. I removed the open
command on http and https protocols.
Firefox still believes that it is the default browser.


Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:

Actual Results:  
If firefox is not the default handler for htm, html, http, https at least then
it should know that it is not the default browser.

Alternativly provide a button in the options to set firefox as the default
browser regardless of whether firefox thinks it is or not.
