code change needed in CookieViewer.js in Netscape 8.1.2 as window.opener does not always refer to the same window

It seems that there are a few occurrences of the window.opener property in the CookieViewer.js file.  Unfortunately by using that property you can't always guarantee that it's referring to the same window.  For example if you use an extension that allows you to open the cookie viewer from the statusbar then the window.opener property will cause numerous errors to occur.  Since the cookie viewer is not opened from the pref window the window.opener property is now referring to a completely different window which prevents the code from accessing the required properties and methods.  I would like to suggest a code change for all scripts that use the window.opener property.  There are at least 2 scripts that I have found that reference the window.opener property with multiple occurrences in each.

chrome://browser/content/cookieviewer/CookieViewer.js
chrome://browser/content/balloonhelp/balloonhelp.js

The window.opener property is also referenced in the onload event in the CookieViewer.xul file.

onload="window.opener.top.initPanel(window.location.href, window);"

It would be of great help to extension developers if you could change all occurrences of window.opener since it does not always refer to the same window.  Simply call the getMostRecentWindow() method and then use an if statement to determine if the options window is opened.

function getWin() {
return Components.classes["@mozilla.org/appshell/window-mediator;1"].
getService(Components.interfaces.nsIWindowMediator).
getMostRecentWindow('Browser:Options');
}

onload="var win = getWin(); if (win) win.top.initPanel(window.location.href, window);"

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
To reproduce the errors simply open the cookie viewer from the main browser window instead of the pref window.
Actual Results:  
Errors will appear in JS Console and you will not be able to close the window by clicking on OK.
