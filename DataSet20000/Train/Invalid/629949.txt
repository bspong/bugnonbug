Hi,

I noticed that in the latest nightlies the session restore failed to work after minefield restart but it was with out an obvious pattern, but with the latest build the situation became weird !! its never restore my tabs unless i go to Menu > History > Restore Previous Session  after minefield run !!! only the pinned tabs and one tab with my home page loaded at first!!!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.close minefield
2.start minefield
3.
Actual Results:  
only the pinned tabs and only one tab with my home page loaded 

Expected Results:  
my previous opened tabs to be loaded
