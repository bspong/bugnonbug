Can't manage search engines if default folder gets empty

We all know that search plugins for Firefox can be put either under /%Install Path%/searchplugins/ or under /%Profile%/searchplugins/, and we also know that in Firefox 2.0 there is going to be a very comvenient "Search Engine Manager" (it can not yet do automatic sorting for the search plugins, though).

I used to keep my search plugins under my /%Install Path%/searchplugins, but recently I found that it would be better to keep them under the profile folders, in order to bring them along to in upgrading Firefox. So I moved all of my old search plugins to my profile, and even cleared the new search plugins installed by 2.0 RC 1, to prevent duplication of the same search plugins. But after I have done that, Firefox 2.0 won't be able to detect any search plugins in anywhere! And an alert would come out before the Search Engine Manager (see attachment); then when Search Engine Manager comes out eventually, we can't control it, either.

I think the Search Engine Manager should ignore the installation folder if it's empty there, and detect on to the profile folder.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clear all search plugins under /%Firefox Installation%/searchplugins/ (you can make backups first)
2. Launch or restart Firefox
3. Click "Manage search engines..." in the dropdown menu of the search plugins
4. See the failure alert and press "Done"
5. Find that the dialog is empty, and you can't use it

Actual Results:  
4. See the failure alert and press "Done"
5. Find that the dialog is empty, and you can't use i

Expected Results:  
Search plugins under /%Profile%/searchplugins/ should be loaded instead in the Search Engine Manager.
