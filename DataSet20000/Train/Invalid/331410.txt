CTRL+ and CRTL- resize non-monospace font, but not monospace one. I have "Courier New" set as my default monospace font in preferences, but I allow those settings to be overriden of course.

I noticed the problem while developing a Web application. The relevant part of my CSS looks as follows:

div {
  ...
  font-family: Courier, monospace;
  ...
}

That caused that font to resize in "jumps" -- not smoothly, as other fonts. To have the font resized I have to press CTRL+ or CTRL- multiple times. While I was dooing that the other fonts were being resized.

I finally fixed it by changing my CSS into:

div {
  ...
  font-family: Courier New, monospace;
  ...
}

("Courier" --> "Courier New")

Is it a bug or does Courier differ from Courier New and have only couple fixed sizes available? If it's a bug that might be a problem for many Websites using Courier only.

Thanks!
