This toolbar just inputs ads into my facebook. It's totally spam. It gives me gay spam and i'm totally not gay. I've looked at his install and it's completely spam. It just gives me facebook ads and installs Trojans with the install. so fucked up. Why am i not protected from this?

1. install extension
2. web pages hang on page load because they are injecting html on each page load.
