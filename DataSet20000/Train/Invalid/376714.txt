My Toshiba Satellite U205-S5034 laptop features a biometric fingerprint scanner and uses Protector Suite QL to manage it. 

In earlier version of Firefox (pre-2.0), I was able to use my biometric scanner to log into websites, etc. Now, I get an error that the browser does not support the feature. I've searched for plug-ins, but only plug-ins for pre-2.0 exist (to my knowledge). I would like to see integration with biometric (fingerprint) scanners and their respective software in future updates. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter log-in info on any site.
2. Swipe finger to register log-in info with Protector Suite.
3. Click "register."
4. Error message indicating browser does not support the feature. 


Expected Results:  
Firefox has always been fully functional with Protector Suite QL in the past versions. 2.0 lost this functionality completely.
