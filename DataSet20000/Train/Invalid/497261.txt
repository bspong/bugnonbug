JavaScript Error When Trying to Load MooTools Core Compressed Version
User-Agent:       Opera/9.80 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X; U; en) Presto/2.2.15 Version/10.00
Build Identifier: 3.5b99

When the page loads, it requests the most recent version of MooTools Core, downloaded from MooTools.net less than a month ago. I am using the following code to call the script:

<script src="http://http.cdnlayer.com/out3rnet/beacon_resources/js/moo.core.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

I am getting the following error:

Error: cannot access optimized closure
Source File: http://http.cdnlayer.com/out3rnet/beacon_resources/js/moo.core.js
Line: 1

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a page containing script reference: http://http.cdnlayer.com/out3rnet/beacon_resources/js/moo.core.js
2. JavaScript Must be Enabled
Actual Results:  
JavaScript Console Error (Developer Toolbar)
Error: cannot access optimized closure
Source File: http://http.cdnlayer.com/out3rnet/beacon_resources/js/moo.core.js
Line: 1

Expected Results:  
The JavaScript should have loaded normally.

The file is compressed with the widely used YUI compressor. I downloaded it from MooTools.net and did not modify it.
