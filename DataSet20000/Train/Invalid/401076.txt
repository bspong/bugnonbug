places/utils.js included twice in browser.xul
On mac, macBrowserOverlay.xul has placesOverlay.xul in it which is overlayed on browser.xul which also has placesOverlay.xul in it.

This causes the following error:

Error: redeclaration of const LOAD_IN_SIDEBAR_ANNO
Source File: chrome://browser/content/places/utils.js
Line: 51

Presumably it could cause some other complications too.
