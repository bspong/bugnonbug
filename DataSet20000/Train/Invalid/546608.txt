Used multiple anchors in a Wikibook ("Na'vi"). If that anchor is called "adposition", then links to it do not work. Entering the URL manually does not work either. There is no blank space in the anchor name. Opera has no problem, nor does IE. Reproducible on other wikis, not just Wikibooks. See [[Talk:Na'vi/Glossary]] for s.o. who knows more than me who says things look good in the code produced by Wikibooks. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add {{anchor|adposition}} to a page (apparently any page) at Wikibooks, Wikipedia, or Wiktionary (at least).
2. Add [[#adposition]] elsewhere on the page, or with proper URL, on another page.
3. Click on link, or append #adposition to end of URL and hit 'enter'. 
Actual Results:  
The link blinks and changes color to the color associated with visited links.

Expected Results:  
That, plus navigation to the anchor.

Check the URL provided and search for "adposition" for problem links; the problem has been bypassed in the current Wikibook. 

If I remove, add, or change a letter in the anchor word, the link works. I've tried removing each letter in turn, added a letter to beginning or end, and changed 1st or last letter, and each time the link worked, though it did not when I added a space at beginning or end. 

Another editor found the same problem with his copy of FF.
