Hi 
This problem has been happening for the month of Aug 2010 till now. During this month, I downloaded the latest Real Player, Adobe. I have since deleted these programs but the problem still occurs. I have tried to paste some print screens of what happens when I try to close the pop up messages, but I am unable to paste.

 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I open my Firefox and start web searching. Then I also open a folder or open window explorer to find a folder.   
2.A pop up message comes out which says Search Settings v1.2.3
Please wait which Windows configures Search v1.2.3. So, I click cancel. 
3.A pop up message comes out and says 
The feature you are trying to use is on a network resourse that is unavailable.Click OK to try again or enter an alternate path to a folder containing the installation package "SearchSettings.msi" in the box below.
Use source: C:\Users\Mic\AppData\Local\Temp\{20D6798D-FAEB-4CB7-A8AD-1866B91AB107}\
I click cancel again.
4.Another pop up message appears and says
Error 1706.No valid source could  be found for Product Search v1.2.3. The Window insatller cannot continue.
I click "OK" or "X"
5.The Firefox shuts down by itself.  
Actual Results:  
This happens all the time. Only opening word doc. does not seem to affect the firefox to shut down.

Expected Results:  
Please tell me how to solve this bug.
