We build our company website in Adobe GoLive; recently had a customer complain
that our site was difficult to read due to overlapping text and/or graphics. 
After some research, it was determined that he was using Firefox (our site was
built to be used on Internet Explorer).  We are hoping that there is a patch to
help fix the problem, as we are aware that more and more people are using
Firefox and cannot build a 2nd website.
