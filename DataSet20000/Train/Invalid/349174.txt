As much as I loathe windows, this doesn't seem like the correct behaviour.

In my very basic html page I have a link to a windows share that looks like this file://///myhost/myshare/mypath/ which doesn't work when clicked. However, if I right click the link, select Copy Link Location and paste it into the location bar then the link works fine.

Note that the URL points to a directory and a list of files should be displayed if the link works.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto a web page with a link to a windows share on the page.
2. Click the link, nothing happens.
3. Copy the URL to the location bar and the link works.

Actual Results:  
As described

Expected Results:  
Yeah, it's Windows.
