[RFE] Firebug should be included in Firefox, or perhaps Gecko
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

I find it a little surprising that Firebug has not been absorbed by Mozilla in some way. I see FF4 has the web console, but it's just not the same.

The reason it surprises me is that Chrome and Safari (by way of webkit) and Opera include firebug-like tools by default. Furthermore, firebug was the first of this type of tool and continues to edge the others to varying degrees.

One final note: this is obviously up to the Firefox devs, but it's possible this bug would be more appropriately logged against the engine (Gecko) as opposed to the product (Firefox), as Chrome and Safari's chosen rendering engine (WebKit) is what provides them with their similar tool.

Reproducible: Always
