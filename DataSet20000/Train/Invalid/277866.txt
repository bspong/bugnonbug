extension to view using IE, when necessary
At my office, I could definitely get everyone on board to use Firefox 1.0, given
its user-ability and security.  However, a number of our clients require us to
use specified websites to send and receive documents.  And of course, these
sites only support IE or Netscape.  If you could make an extension, like the one
for Mozilla Suite, that allows one to easily open the same page in IE, then that
would resolve the issue.

Please think of the long-term benefit of this as well.  The more businesses that
start using Firefox, the better chance it has to reach the mainstream as well.
