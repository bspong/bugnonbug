3.5.5 substitues www.*.com when entering a local host/site

When entering a local host name on the intranet, 3.5.5 is improperly adding prefix and suffix information which takes me to a public web site "http://www.tophat.com/tops/" , so that I can't get results of my nightly builds.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type in http://tophat/tops   hit return  (or use a bookmark)
2.3.5.5 takes you to http://www.tophat.com/tops/  a public web site...
3. I'm hosed


Expected Results:  
I want to go to the site specified, and looking in Tools/Options there's no way to stop insertion of prefix or suffix information on a web address

Since I can't get to a web site I need to look at several times a day, 3.5.5 has crippled me.   I guess it's back to IE...
