Many links no longer work and Firefox remains resident after closing or fails to start.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

1. Many links, particularly links from e-mail, fail to open, or Firefox loads but does not open a window.
2. Exiting Firefox closes the window, but Firefox remains resident and I have to kill the process in taskmanager. The Firefox browser window will not open with the app resident.

These problems have started shortly after updating to Vista SP2. I also have ZoneAlarm Browser security.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on link in Thunderbird, on Gmail account page, or on a secure web page.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Nothing! Or, the browser loads into memory but does not open a window...

Expected Results:  
Open the desired web page, loading and opening the browser when it is not loaded.

I may be the only fool with this problem, but my anti-virus has not flagged anything yet!
