When a YouTube video is embedded in a page using YouTubes Embed code, trying to switch to a different tab by clicking on it does not work. This only happens while the video is playing. It does not effect keyboard shortcuts to change tabs, only directly clicking on them. If a tab has been clicked on while the video is playing, and then the video is paused, the tab come to focus. Any animated GIF images also seem to "pause" while the YouTube video is playing, and then resume while the video is paused. I have created a new profile to confirm no Add-ons are causing this. Thank you ahead of time for any help.
