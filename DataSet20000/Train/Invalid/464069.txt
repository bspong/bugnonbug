Sometime this weekend, this error started occurring. FF3 now gives a error msg: 
"FF prevented this page from automatically reloading." Pressing 'allow' repeats the error msg.  The error console, from only one iteration, is included below:

Actual Results:  
This only started happening today.  Have never seen this error popup from FF before.


There appears to be no actual problem, just some kind of a parsing problem that produces the error warning.  I hope this isn't some kind of an IE-only "feature" that only produces a problem with FF.

Keep up the good work!  (A non-IE user since before MS first produced IE)
