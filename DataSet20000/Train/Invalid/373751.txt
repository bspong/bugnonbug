Live bookmark middle click opens in tabs
Before the patch for bug 253698 was entered, middle-clicking a live bookmark would have opened the primary site of that live bookmark. This allowed for easy access to the site in general if many of the items were interesting.

After the patch was landed, middle-clicking on a live bookmark tries to open all of the articles in tabs, which although is consistent with regular folders, loses some functionality that was available before. 

The "Open All in Tabs" option can stay for the case where one really wants to open all live bookmarks but still allow fast access to the commonly used opening of the primary site.
