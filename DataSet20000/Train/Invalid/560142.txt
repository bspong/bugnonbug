Firebug opens on its own, with "Break on Error JSON.parse"
Then page is frozen, no links, can't scroll.
This has happened inconsistently but repeatedly

Refreshing Firefox doesn't clear up the problem.
Tab has to be deleted; then sometimes problem keeps reaapearing at new tabs as well.
This is very, very, very Frustrating!!! to say the least.




Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Connect to URL
2.Keep opening tabs with the 2 URLs
3.When Firebug pops up, deselect view Firebug, then try links and scrollbar
Actual Results:  
Firebug pops up eventually, and freezes browser, no links or scroll.

Expected Results:  
Not triggered Firebug for 'errors' that freeze browser.
