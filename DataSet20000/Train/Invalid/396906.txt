In the menu item above I always set the option to "Browser Homepage" so that Google opens up when I open a new tab. Every time a new version of a plugin or update to Firefox installs, this option reverts to "blank page" and I have to reset it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set above option to "Browser Homepage"
2.Wait for browser or plugin update to be issued and installed
3.See that the above option is now reset to the default.
Actual Results:  
The above option is now reset to the default

Expected Results:  
The above option should remain as I set it (Browser Homepage)

I've noticed it happening with these updates:
Firefox
Cooliris
Noscript
Adblock Plus.
Other plugins on my Firefox (which also may cause the bug but I haven't noticed):
Canadian English Dictionary
Tabbed Browser Preferences
Talkback
Adblock Filterset.G Updater.
I have the default theme.
