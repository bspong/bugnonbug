When I try to view the shortcut properties for the desktop shortcut created by the installer, explorer.exe crashes. I haven't tried reinstalling Minefield to see if it happens with the new shortcut, but the shortcut created by selecting the executable works fine.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run the installer. (Standard Setup, Windows XP Media Center edition)
2. Right-click on the desktop shortcut.
3. Select properties and see if it crashes.
Actual Results:  
When I installed minefield and right click on the desktop shortcut, it crashed.

Expected Results:  
It should have shown the properties page for the shortcut.

None. Though there is always the chance that its just something peculiar about this computer.
