The page displays correctly, however the links Register Online, Download
Application, See Maps, and 2004 Results do nothing.  Can't go to the linked
page.  Same for the dropdowns in About Us, Contact Us, and Home.  Other links on
the left side work fine.  I just installed Firefox 1.0+.  I also installed the
latest Mozilla and the same thing happens.  IE in XP service pack 3 works fine.

Actual Results:  
Nothing
