event.explicitOriginalTarget not populated consistently for onBlur event

I have a sample HTML document that recreates this.  I will attach it to the issue.

It is a simple page with three Fields, each using the same Javascript function for it's onBlur event handler:

function doOnBlur(event) {
    console.log("event.target.id=%s", event.target.id);
    console.log("event.explicitOriginalTarget.id=%s", event.explicitOriginalTarget.id);
}

So, all it does is log to the console (whose output I can view using firebug).

From my understanding, for the onBlur event, event.target is the field _losing_ focus, and event.explicitOriginalTarget is the field receiving focus (what is populated in IE as document.activeElement).

If I click into field1 and tab into field2, I get what is expected in the log:

event.target.id=fieldOne
event.explicitOriginalTarget.id=fieldTwo

If I click into field1 and click into field2, I get something different:

event.target.id=fieldOne
event.explicitOriginalTarget.id=fieldOne

If I click itno field1, enter some data and tab into field2, I get 

event.target.id=fieldOne
event.explicitOriginalTarget.id=fieldOne

In these last two examples, field2 is receiving focus.

This inconsistency makes it very hard to write a onBlur event handler.  For what I need to do, I need to know

1) what field is losing focus
2) what field is gaining focus

I don't care how I get it (event.explicitOriginalTarget or document.activeElement), but FF should be able to provide this information consistently.
