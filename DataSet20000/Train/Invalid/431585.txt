I've encountered this kind of problem many time but couldn't (or didn't try to) reproduce it. Now I have a 100% reliable case.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.alistapart.com/articles/settingtypeontheweb
2. Click on a link, e.g. one that says "lesson plan"
3. Navigate back (important: use the keyboard's shortcut Alt+left arrow)
Actual Results:  
Can't scroll the page with the keyboard anymore.

Expected Results:  
Being able to scroll as usually.

Navigating with a mouse doesn't trigger this problem.
