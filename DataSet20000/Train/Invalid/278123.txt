ctrl-enter std key binding for urlbar seems a design bug
To open an new tab the std prefix is the ctrl-key (ctrl-t, ctrl-click). But to
open a new tab from urlbar the prefix is the alt-key (alt-enter). This conficts
also with the std key binding of Mozilla Browser (I'm using 1.7.3) where the
prefix is the ctrl-key (ctrl-enter).

If there is no possibility (or no lobby) to change the std key binding of the
ctrl-enter key to "open new tab from urlbar", I stronly request a configuration
switch placed at about:config, switching alt-(shift-)enter with
ctrl-(shift-)enter (and vice versa).

Thanks for taking such a chance seriously into account.
