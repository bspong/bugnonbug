After private browsing, windows not treated properly when exiting.

When exiting private browsing with multiple windows open, original window is restored, but also blank popup windows show up.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Open firefox, Start private browsing.
1. Open up more than one window of firefox during private browsing (popups is where I noticed it, but it also does the same thing if you detach a tab).
2. Stop private browsing while external windows are open.
3. You get the main browser window backup, but multiple blank popup windows also show up and you can not start private browsing again.

Actual Results:  
Multiple popups show up and private browsing broken afterwards.

Expected Results:  
Restore the main window the way it was.
