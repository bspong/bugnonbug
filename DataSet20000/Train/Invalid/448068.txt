a:hover applies to all anchors instead of just to links...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.create an anchor (<a name="blah">Blah</a>)
2.add css (<style type="text/css">a:hover {color:red;}</style>)
3.render
Actual Results:  
the anchor turns red when you hover over it

Expected Results:  
the anchor should not change

dunno if this is a CSS issue or a Firefox issue...(I tried looking at the CSS documentation, but when I didn't find any mention of this effect in reference materials I just didn't have the time to slog through the really deep stuff and hoped since this effect doesn't show up in IE [blech] that it might be a bug)

despite the wonders of standards compliance, I'd suggest that we strongly consider (if CSS would say that this is correct behavior) modifying this so that anchors aren't included because it makes use of anchors and hover effects on links problematic (besides being completely counter intuitive).
