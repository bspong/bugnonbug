When browsing the title bar of the browser window will not update from the previous page to the current page title. This also happens between tabs, for example, I open a tab with title 'title 1' and then switch tab to another page which I know has a different title but the title displayed in the browser title bar is still 'title 1'. This doesn't happen all the time and if I click on the browser window title bar it updates.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a few tabs with different pages in
2.switch from one to the other
3.
Actual Results:  
Sometimes the title of the first tab you open will be displayed in the browser window title bar even for all the other tabs.

Expected Results:  
The title should be updated to reflect the selected tab.
