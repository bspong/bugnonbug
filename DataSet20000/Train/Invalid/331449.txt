Acrobat plugin process never ends

Once a pdf document has been opened within the browser the AcroRd32.exe process is not killed even after exiting Firefox.

If you continue and open the browser again and open again pdf:s, it happens eventually that everything becomes unresponsive, and you have to exit Firefox.

It looks like the only way out is to manually kill the AcroRd32.exe process with all its child processes.
Normally you would expect the AcroRd32.exe process to be killed when it is no longer needed by Firefox, at least it must never run after exiting Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a page where you have a link to a PDF document
2.Use the PDFs normally
3. Close the document
Open the the process monitor in Windows. You will find AcroRd32.exe running.
Exit Firefox. AcroRd32 is still running


Actual Results:  
AcroRd32.exe is running even after exiting Firefox

Expected Results:  
The AcroRd32.exe should be stopped at least when Firefox is closed

It looks like that eventually that we have some kind of conflicts which may hang Firefox - trying over and over again to open an already busy process.
I have seen many bugs with similar complaints, which just might be resolved by addressing this bug.

I am using my own build from the trunk, Visual C++ 2005 Express.
