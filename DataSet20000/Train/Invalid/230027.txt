The link provided as an example might not always be online since its the
testserver I run on my own computer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a html page with a div that contains ='newsb'
2. In an external style sheet create a class like this one:
.newsb:first-letter {
	font: 180%;
	float: left;
}
3. Link to the stylesheet so it gets applied to the html page.

Actual Results:  
While IE 6.0 Renders the page properly Mozilla Firebird will totally ignore the
pseudo class, it renders the first letter of the newsb class as it renders the
rest of the text.

Expected Results:  
It should have made the first letter in the <div class='newsb'> </div> 180%
bigger then the default font size of that class, or it's parents class if the
newsb class doesn't have font-size defined.
