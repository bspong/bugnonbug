Refresh favicons stored as data URIs in pre-populated bookmarks (with platform specific icons)
[Note, cross posting to Firefox::Theme and Websites::www.mozilla.com since the
icons need to both ship with Firefox and be served up by our web servers]

The favicon for all localizations of the Getting Started page
(http://en-us.www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/central/) should be a help icon,
instead of a red dinosaur head.  Many users will not know that this is our
logo, or even that Firefox is made by Mozilla, so the current icon is at best
confusing, an at worst slightly derogatory to novice users who could
potentially view at as an analogy to their ability to adapt to new
technologies.

Ideally we would also be able to use a different style of icon on each
platform.  I can provide new favicons for XP, Vista, Linux and OS X.

There are currently 6 favicons cached in Firefox, here is what I think we
should use:

-Getting Started = help icon
-Get Bookmark Add-ons = extension icon
-Help and Tutorials = help icon
-Customize Firefox = extension icon
-Get Involved = mozilla logo (same)
-About Us = mozilla logo (same)


Talking to reed, philor and fligtar on irc, they indicated that we need to:

1) update the cached favicons in bookmarks.html, which also needs to be
latel10n since this file is localized
http://mxr.mozilla.org/firefox/source/browser/locales/en-US/profile/bookmarks.html?raw=1

This will involve preprocessing the file to get the correct icons on each
platform.

2) find a way to serve the correct icon to each platform after the user clicks
on the bookmark and the favicon gets updated.  This could be achieved by:
       a) use javascript to check the OS and set the correct favicon
       b) setup netscaler cache rules to return a certain image based on the
user agent
