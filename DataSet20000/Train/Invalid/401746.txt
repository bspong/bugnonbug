Sidebar absent for short pages causes middle-alignment to shift with dynamic content.

In Firefox (or opera, or safari too) the sidebar is absent when the page contents are little. If page is center-aligned (which makes a good appearance), and some dynamic content is added and removed, then the middle alignment shifts to left when dynamic content is added, and to the right when dynamic content is removed.

It causes ugly jitter. IE handles this by having a greyed-out sidebar when the page isn't long enough.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any site with center-alignment and having dynamic content (like a tall image).
2. I can build one example if you don't find one.


Expected Results:  
Well it's a suggested feature. Software isn't doing anything wrong.
