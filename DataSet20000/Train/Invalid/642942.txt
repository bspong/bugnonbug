I noticed that when I click the add ons sub menu in the Tools menu, The add on manager always freezes or is unresponsive. 

It was never like that before but I thought I would file this bug just in case others are having this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click the Tools menu and then choose Add Ons
2. Click on any Add ons option menu.
3. From there, it shouldn't let you click anything and becomes unresponsive
   causing firefox to crash.
Actual Results:  
The firefox add ons manager becomes unresponsive and causes the browser to freeze.

Expected Results:  
I should be able to manage my add ons anytime I want with no problems.
