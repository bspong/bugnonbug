Fast Dial gives javascript error; breaks places.sqlite
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1b4) Gecko/20090423 Firefox/3.5b4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Firefox/3.5b4

Fast Dial constantly gives me javascript error now that I've switched to the 3.5b4  I've tried to reload and even redownload the 3.0 version of firefox but still get the javascript error.  If I tell it to stop script, it gives me a blank page... if I say continue, it takes a few times of saying continue then it will go to the fast dial bookmark page but with bogus bookmarks that seem to go on forever.  Please help me get back my older Firefox w/fast dial.  My memory's not the best and the Fast Dial with paste email is like a God send to me.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start up Firefox w/fast dial.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
I just explained it up above.  (Sadness)(Disappointment)

Expected Results:  
When I start firefox I used to get my fast dial right away and would begin surfing my bookmarks right away.  (Happiness)

I can't imagine that I'm the only one with this problem.  Am I?
