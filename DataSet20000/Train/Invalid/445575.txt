Accessing form name in global scope fails in standards mode (triggered by DOCTYPE)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.16) Gecko/20080702 Firefox/2.0.0.16
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.16) Gecko/20080702 Firefox/2.0.0.16

The page referenced, containing a valid DOCTYPE record, validates as HTML 4.01 Strict and the JavaScript on this page functions as expected in IE but not in FireFox.  The link in the page goes to a page using the exact same code but without a valid DOCTYPE and it does work in FireFox.  I tried this second page with a valid (per w3c.org validator) HTML 4.01 Transitional DOCTYPE and this causes the JavaScript to fail in FireFox (the DOCTYPE appearing in the functioning page is not really valid).
