"Remove my Firefox personal data and customizations" removes more than what a user might expect to be deleted

When a user decides to uninstall a Firefox 3.0 installation they are given the option to "Remove my Firefox personal data and customizations". That option deletes more than Firefox 3.0 data, it deletes the \Mozilla\ folder in \Application Data\ which might contain Firefox 2.0 Profiles and SeaMonkey Profiles. I understand that the mere existence of a Profile in Firefox is a closely guarded secret and that the mere "home-user" doesn't need to be aware of having a Profile, and that the consideration of users who might want to have multiple versions of Firefox installed isn't a major concern of the development team, but what about users who might want to have both SeaMonkey and Firefox 3.0 installed at the same time? That preference says nothing about SeaMonkey data being wiped out in the process of uninstalling Firefox 3.0.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Uninstall Firefox 3.0pre. 
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
The \Mozilla\ folder deleted along with the \Firefox\ folder and the SeaMonkey Profiles folder.

Expected Results:  
Delete only the "data and customizations" directly associated with the program being uninstalled.


At this point that preference should be removed completely from the uninstaller dialog window.
