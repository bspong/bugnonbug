I have seen that Opera has invented a such called Turbo Mode ( i don't use opera ) but i think firefox implant this great option ,i have some times that are not working i don't know why without this stupid option even i have a fast internet,and many people will be very happy with this option,look on google,at forms and etc. Hope you will consider to implant this.
