failure in tab completion matches code
From irc:

<Mook_sb> oh, random stuff: http://hg.mozilla.org/users/ddahl_mozilla.com/heads-up-display/file/86da36043d1d/toolkit/components/console/hudservice/HUDService.jsm#l2239 was intermittently failing for me last night
<ddahl|away> Mook_sb: arrghh
<ddahl|away> Mook_sb: do you have the exact error?
<Mook_sb> by which I mean "wrapping that loop with a try { /* existing stuff */ } catch (e) { throw e; } fixes things"
<Mook_sb> which makes no bloody sense
<Mook_sb> sorry, not at the moment
<ddahl|away> Mook_sb: that is wacky
<Mook_sb> I think it's timing-related and on a property enum
