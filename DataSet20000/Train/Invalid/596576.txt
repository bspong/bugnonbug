hyperlinks shown in addressbar unusable on small windows or screens
Created attachment 475489
screenshot showing the problem

I just noticed the new behaviour of the awesomebar. It now shows the
target of hyperlinks instead of the usual and old location, the statusbar.
This is totally unusable on small screens or small windows.
I am attaching a screenshot of my FF4pre window when I discovered it...

Furthermore, I originally thought FF was buggy since my statusbar was never
updated when I hovered over links. I think the statusbar is too well implemented
in users' mind to change it like that, w/o a _major_ impact on users.

I strongly recommend reverting to the original statusbar behaviour.
