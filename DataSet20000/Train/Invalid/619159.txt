XPI files do not install if they contain PNG files created using certain applications
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.2.11) Gecko/20101012 Firefox/3.6.11 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When installing XPI files that contain PNG files created using certain applications (Paint Shop Pro 8.10 was used for the non-working sample, Axialis IconWorkshop 6.52 was used for the working one), Firefox will show the installation dialog, but will delete the XPI file immediately after you confirmed its installation. The addon will not be installed, nor will the addon manager pop-up.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the two samples (the only thing they do is showing up in your addons manager).
2. Copy the first one into your profile's extension folder.
3. Restart Firefox and confirm the installation.
4. Copy the second one into your profile's extension folder.
5. Restart Firefox and confirm the installation.
Actual Results:  
not-working.xpi will simply be deleted.
working.xpi will be installed.

Expected Results:  
Both should be installed.

If you unzip the non-working XPI to the folder of the working one and restart Firefox, the extension's icon will still show up, so it's not because the PNG file is just invalid. Firefox also installs addons with an invalid icon path, so there must be a reason why it does not like this PNG file.
This bug does not only exist for the given PNG file but all PNG files I tested.
