Visited pages show in Subscriptions view
Steps to reproduce:
- Open Places, open Subscriptions
- With at least two subscriptions present, first click one on the bottom. You'll see the pages not only open in tabs, but the feed expands also in the Places window.
- Then middle-click one on top. Suddenly the expanded items on the bottom disappear and they go on appearing on top.

Expected behaviour: should not expand in Places if the items are already opened in tabs. And certainly not in the wrong direction.

I'll attach a screenshot to illustrate what I mean.
