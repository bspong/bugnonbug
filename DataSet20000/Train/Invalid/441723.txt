I have no solid instruction on how to do this, since it seem to only happen on FF crashed or terminated abnormally. It happen to websites which store cookies to keep me logged in all the time.

After crash and I restore the pages back up, all saved log-ins seem to be gone, and that I have to log in to websites all over again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to websites that autometicly log-in you when you open it again another day.
2. Crash the FF, possibly by terminate the process.
3. Reopen the website
Actual Results:  
The website get logged off, even though it should have keep you logged in still.

Expected Results:  
The logged in data remain after crash.
