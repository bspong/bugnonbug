The margin-top property of an inner div is applied to the parent div if the child div is the first child of its parent. The bug doesn't show if the inner div is not the first child.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the included test case
2. Watch the white space above the message on a green background - it's the margin-top of the parent div (it should be 0).
3. Add a line of text (anything but a whitespace will do) just before the buggy div.
4. Watch the red space appearing above the message - the margin of the container div returns to 0 (as it should)
Actual Results:  
The margin-top of the parent div is set to the same margin-top as the child div

Expected Results:  
The margin-top of the parent div should be 0
