After viewing flash-video full-screen and returning to windowed, the video persists unexpectedly beneath new page imagery.

After viewing flash-video full-screen and returning to windowed mode, the video persists unexpectedly beneath new page imagery once other parts of the site are accessed.  Had a remote friend test it in FF and also on Safari with the same results.  Potentially Flash as well as Firefox bugs. Will explore Adobe's bugs soon to cover all the bases.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.click on "animation" at the site.
2.play either video for any length of time
3.Enter full screen from the control in the video window
4: Exit Full Screen by hitting ESC (doesn't matter if you stop video or not)
5: click on "home" or "bio" buttons.
Actual Results:  
data for those pages shows up, but video persists behind them.
This fails consistently in Firefox and MS Internet Explorer 8, but works predictably in Opera (the only three I tested locally).

Expected Results:  
Video should no longer be visible when switching to these other "pages".
(the behaviour achieved when testing in-application and on, at least, the Opera browser)

- I use the classic Windows theme recommended with Autodesk Maya.
- I use a dual-monitor setup with an nVidia Quadro FX FX3000.
- This already filed bug was the closest in flavor to my own problem:

  ( Will pursue it from the flash side, as well, just to be sure)

big, fat PS: thanks for your time and efforts!
