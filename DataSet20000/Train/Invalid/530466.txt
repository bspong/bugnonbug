hyperlinks broken in left side of div link-list

The links don't work on the left side of the link-list div.  The exact same coding works correctly on the right.  The page above is W3C HTML and W3C CSS  validated.  The links work in Opera and in IE.  The page has been tested on both Linux (CentOS, Ubuntu) and Windows.  I put the stylesheet on the same page so you can see the link-list coding if you "view source".

The appearance of the links is correct.  However, when clicked, nothing happens.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to http://www.alwanza.com/bells/firefox_bug.html
2.Click on any of the links on the upper left side of the page (inside the border)
3.Notice that the links do not function.
Actual Results:  
Although the links have the appearance of links (and the coding is correct), clicking on them does NOTHING - like clicking on regular text.

Expected Results:  
Links should work.  Proof is that exact same coding works on the right side.

This bug has existed for years.  This is not the first report I've made, but searching the database, I was unable to find my previous reports.
