This is a placeholder for the bug http://code.google.com/p/mozilla-keychain/issues/detail?id=27

If Firefox Sync is used, it breaks a very important extension for OS X users: Apple Keychain Services integration. Despite announcement that Keychain integration would be part of Firefox 3.6, even Firefox 4.0 still uses it's own custom password solution. Thankfully there is a great author who created a plug in to do exactly this (does the guy already have a statue?).

However, he is short on time, and I strongly recommend that you give him a hand creating a fix. He's already done a lot of work, as reported on the above URL.

Reproducible: Didn't try




Note: I have not tried Firefox sync yet; I am not willing to test minor features like Firefox sync and break the real important stuff, like OS X keychain integration (sorry).
