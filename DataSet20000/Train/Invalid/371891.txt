computer crashes and reboots when opening firefox 2
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20070219 Firefox/2.0.0.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20070219 Firefox/2.0.0.2

Sometimes when I click the Firefox icon on the quicklaunch bar the computer reboots unexpectedly and without warning. 

This only happened when clicking that icon.

It happened 4 times on two machies (at home and at work) with similar configuration: 

Windows XP SP2, ZoneAlarm basic firewall (running), Active Virus Shield (inactive), Taskbar Shuffle2 (running, a probable suspect, http://www.freewebs.com/nerdcave/taskbarshuffle.htm), Firefox 2.0.0.1 or 2.0.0.2

I made sure it wasn't a virus by scanning My Computer with up-to-date Active Virus Shield (freeware version of Kaspersky from AOL) and checking the path to the application from the shortcut in question.

I had the 2.0.0.1 version when I experienced the problem the first 3 times and then I updated to 2.0.0.2 and the problem repeated just now.

I can't think of anything else relevant.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Could not replicate my steps exactly.
1. Usualy Zonealarm firewall is running, TakbarShuffle2, Internet Explorer 6, Dreamweaver 8, Outlook Express
2. When i click on the firefox shortcut in the quicklauch, the computer immediately reboots
3.
Actual Results:  
The computer crashes and begins to reboot.
Then it asks me to check drive C for inconsistencies.
After the drive check, no disk errors are reported.

Of course, all my unsaved work is lost...
