URL bar history-based completion feature not functioning
With previous versions, when I typed "goo" I would begin to see suggestions for google URLs from my history.  On recent trunk builds, no such suggestions occur.  The URL bar recieves my typed text, but does not display a list of possible completions.  Using the arrow keys to move up and down does not help.  Pressing the down-arrow on the far right hand side of the location text-box (just next to the padlock icon) does not seem to respond or do anything.
