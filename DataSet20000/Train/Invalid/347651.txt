pages do not load properly, missing boxes, link images and information
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/ ... was setup file 1.5.0.6

I am currently running Firefox 1.0.4. In June I tried to run 1.5.0.4 and it failed to load the two pages referenced correctly.  Today again I tried to upgrade and loaded and installed 1.5.0.6.  Once more eBay and my credit union pages did not run properly so I uninstalled the newer Firefox and went back to the older verision that does work for these pages.  I would like to move up to the newer FireFox because some of the other problem I have have probably been fixed but I can't get past these to big problems for me.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install new version of FireFox
2.go to https://ibmsecu.org ... or
3.http://www.ebay.com

Actual Results:  
the pages only partially load

Expected Results:  
complete page loading

I'll be more than happy to help but don't know what info to send you at the moment.
