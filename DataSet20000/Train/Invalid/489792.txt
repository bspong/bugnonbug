Hi folks, I'm having a hard time with firefox. It just updated and I'm suddenly having problems where my comp shuts down due to CPU overheating. I have diagnostic programs that help monitor and maintain (infact, these are the programs shuting the comp off to protect it). I'm watching my CPU temp, and when I start firefox, it suddenly starts increasing uncontrolably. I disabled all of my add-ons (no change). The problem seems to be with streaming video when played on firefox. The temp increases but stabilizes watching video on other browsers. watching video on firefox (right now), CPU keeps getting hotter.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.watch streaming video on multiple tabs.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
my computer shuts down due to CPU overheating.

Expected Results:  
not overheating my CPU
