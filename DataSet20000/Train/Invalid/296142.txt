I use a USB Flash Drive when I travel.  On May 27, I loaded the latest Firefox
Portable to my Flash Drive and then imported my bookmarks (and username/password
files.  They disappeared almost immediately.  I went back and imported an
earlier saved file of bookmarks, but when I reached my travel destination there
were no bookmarks.

Another poster mentioned the problem of random assignment of Drive Letter may be
the problem.  

This was serious for me, because I traveled all over Asia for a month using the
previous version with no problems.  The latest problem kept me from checking my
email for a week.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Get a USB Flash drive device and load it with bookmarks 
2.Take device to another computer and try to find the bookmarks
3.

Actual Results:  
The bookmarks are simply gone.

Expected Results:  
Saved my bookmarks/usernames & passwords

The odd thing is when I logged onto to one of my websites, the flash drive
supplied the username and password the first time, even tho the bookmark section
contained none of my bookmarks.  After that, I was unable to get the drive to
supply user names or passwords.
