Hi,

As you can see i put a image with this report, taken from the website www.mozille.com/firefox.
My problem is FireFox doesn't show some images on every website.
I also asked on friends and on forums but no one has this problem.
Here also another hyperlink to a image http://members.home.nl/c.core/home.JPG , taken from the website www.home.nl
It are not the websites that are the problem but I am the problem, but how to fix it.
