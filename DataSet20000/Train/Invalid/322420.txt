I have tried the umpteen suggestions to modidy about:config to disable frwd/back movement in history when a webpage is scrolled using the mousewheel. I am simply unable to disable it. Its highly irritating that the webpage suddenly changes when you just scroll. 
I use a logitech optical usb scroll mouse connected to the USB port through KVM. This irritation is making me switch to more infamous browsers.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open google.com
2. click on news.
3. Scroll up and down and webpage is suddenly the google.com

Actual Results:  
Moves back and forth in history

Expected Results:  
Should only scroll within the current page
