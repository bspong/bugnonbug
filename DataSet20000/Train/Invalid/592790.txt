caption buttons on a not focused window with a Persona are transparent to the desktop
If I focus FX window caption buttons appear on the Persona correctly (and this is cool), but as soon as I focus another window they become dark grey, almost black. 

Other Win7 windows show transparent caption buttons instead when the window is not focused.
