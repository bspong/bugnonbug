Extend Firefox window size when opening sidebar
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10

I would like to keep Firefox' web page display at the same with, even when
opening the sidebar.

Currently it works like this:

Before              After
+-------+         +--+----+
|       |         |  |    |
+-------+         +--+----+

What I would like is this:

Before               After
+----------+         +--+----------+
|          |         |  |          |
+----------+         +--+----------+

In plain english: 

- When opening sidebar, extend window with (leftwards) with sidebar's width.
- When closing sidebar, reduce window width (rightwards) width sidebar's width.
