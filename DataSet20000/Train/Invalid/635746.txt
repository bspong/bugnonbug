Firefox opens THREE tabs in new window (linked from Arachnophilia web editor)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13

I'm still getting a problem with THREE tabs opened in a new Firefox window using web editor Arachnophilia (4.0, Build 5310) in FF 3.6.13.  I now realize this is a very different issue than the two-windows problem that has apparently been resolved.  I've had it since first loading FF almost a year ago, right on up to present updates.

I don't believe the problem to be a quirk in Arachnophilia because none of the other major browsers open additional tabs AND the two first tabs opened in FF are both Mozilla pages:

Tab 1:  http://www.files.com/   - comes up as a normal page.
Tab 2:  http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/   - comes up as Firefox download page.
Tab 3:  My local page page being tested ("previewed" by Arachnophilia)   - only THIS tab should open.

Nor can I find the URL specs for these tabs stored anywhere that I can see. 
They're definitely not my "home" page - I just go to a blank screen.

ABOUT FF:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13
All plug-ins & extensions are valid and current.

This new bug is NOT A DUPLICATE.  (When I first reported this problem, I mistakenly thought it was the same two-window bug, but obviously not.)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure Arachnophilia 4.0 to load Firefox as a preview browser.
2. Open a working HTML page with Arachnophilia 4.0.
3. Press the PREVIEW button to preview the page - should open in a new tab or window.
Actual Results:  
Firefox opens a new window with three tabs:
- Tab 1 is an ad page:  http://www.files.com/
- Tab 2 is the FF download page:  http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/
  Previously, this spec had firefox.exe file included, and it failed ("404")
- Tab 3 is my local page page being previewed by Arachnophilia.
  Only THIS tab should open.


Expected Results:  
Only one new tab should open - either in a new window or in an existing window, but only ONE.

On-going problem which does not show up in other browsers.
But since FF is my default browser and browser of choice, it is an irritant.
