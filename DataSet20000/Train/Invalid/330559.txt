Firefox will crash Mac OS X on certain websites
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/417.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/417.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

I tried to view a link off of Netscape.com, and Firefox tries to load the page, but instead of loading I simply get the "swirly colored wheel" loading cursor for several minutes, and when I try to force quit or use other applications, Mac OS Tiger freezes as well,  forcing me to hold the power button down for five seconds to restart my computer. Similar symptoms happen on other websites as well, such as trying to view some profiles on facebook.com

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View the website above
2. Swirly cursor should come up and Tiger will loose all functionality until you restart
3.

Actual Results:  
Both the browser and the opperating system crashed

Expected Results:  
Loaded the website
