Steps to reproduce:

no idea what happened, tabs in aurora used to have that smooth "chrome like" animation when moving them, now it's back to the old behavior, any idea why the feature was removed? I got browser.tabs.animate set to true, must not be the right setting for it... I mean either there's another string or the feature, as said, for some reason, is gone, thanks ;)
