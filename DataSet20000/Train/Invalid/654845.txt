I was testing switching development channels, and as I switched from Aurora to Beta, there was a problem. When I clicked on the "Apply and Update" button, the update did not start.

After closing the about window and opening it again, it said it was checking for updates IIRC (but it might have said that there were no updates; I can't remember). However, nothing happened.

After closing the window and waiting for about half-an-hour, I opened it again and it checked for updates and the download began.

Just now, I have tried to change back to Aurora, and the expected behaviour occurred, where the download began as soon as I clicked on the Apply and Update button.

Reproducible: Didn't try
