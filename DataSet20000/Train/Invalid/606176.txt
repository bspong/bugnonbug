undo close tab (by mouse wheel) impossible when clicking on "list all tabs" key

   When five or more tabs are opened, there's nearly no place to use 
option "undo close tab" by clicking with mouse wheel. 
I mean that there is too little space to easily click on 
the toolbar with tabs. 
   With previous versions of FF, it was possible use "undo close tab" 
by clicking with mouse wheel also on "List all tabs button".
It was very convenient, because there was no need to look for a place 
between tabs to click on.
   What is more important, clicking with mouse wheel is much faster than 
choosing that option from the menu.
