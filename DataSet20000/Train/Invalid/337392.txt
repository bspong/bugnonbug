[RFE] No clues given to verify a certificate
When accessing the above URL I'm granted with a dialog saying that the certificates does not match the server (it matches www.google.com).
That dialog box has two buttons accept and verify the certificate.
If I click on the verify button, I'm presented with a dialog boxe and some text and some values. However I have no clue on the meaning of all these numbers and strings.

It would be nice to add a link titled "How to verify a certificate", that would point on some documentation explaining what these values are, what should be tested in order to see if one can trust the certificate.
