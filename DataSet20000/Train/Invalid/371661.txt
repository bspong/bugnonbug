Firefox 2.0.0.2 crashed on shutdown
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20070219 Firefox/2.0.0.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20070219 Firefox/2.0.0.2

When I exit Firefox 2.0.0.2 it will crash sometimes.  It has happened when I have two windows open with between 43 to 57 tabs divided between each window.  The odd thing about the crash is that the windows are closed and then half a minute later the Talkback screen comes up saying Firefox crashed after it appears to be shutdown along with the Windows crash report system.  The first time it happened, I was restarting after updating a new extension.  The second time it happened I was shutting down Firefox to shutdown the computer for the night.  The third time it happened I had just added "Super DragAndGo 0.2.6.2" from its unofficial website at 'http://mozilla.code65536.com/'.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have two windows with over 40 tabs open between them and memory usage of 320,000 k or better in Task Manager.
2. Go to "File" and select "Exit".
3. Wait about thirty seconds for Talkback and Windows crash manager to pop up.


Expected Results:  
When exiting Firefox, Talkback and Windows crash manager shouldn't pop-up.  Firefox should just close down without crashing or restart without crashing.

I placed a list of all my extensions just in case one or more of them might be part of the problem though I have never had such problems before the 2.0.0.2.
