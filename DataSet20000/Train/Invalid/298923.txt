Firefox loves to freeze and become un responsive, it seems the longer you use
it, the more likely this will happen.  It does not matter what extensions I
have, it does this over time anyway.  Flashgot downloads seem to speed up the
freeze timeframe, but that of course may be due just to more transactions in
shorter time, not flashgot per se.  The other thing that hastens the problem
along is opening more windows.

Reproducible: Always

worse or no better with 1.05
