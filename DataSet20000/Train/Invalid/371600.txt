automatical update Firefox on Laptop Sony PCG-FX101 Windows ME 490.3000
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20070219 Firefox/2.0.0.2

I use a small homenetwork built on a desktop Sony Vaio VGC-V2M running Windows XP SP2 Home Edition and a Laptop Sony PCG-FX101 running Windows ME 490.3000 with the most recent version Firefox on both systems.

Starting Firefox at 24.02.2007 on the desktop I got your update message and restartet Firefox as demanded. At the Desktop nothing special happened but today I got the same update message as yesterday!

After doing the Desktop I startet Firefox on the Laptop (Windows ME) and got some warnings and failure messages from Antivir Guard (software Avira Antivir Personal Edition Classic) and Spybot SD Resident. Antivir Guard messaged that a change at some Registry Key was refused. I could not catch the error message from Spybot SD Resident. Afterwards running Spybot scanner found the following problem:

"DoubleClick
     Verfolgender Cookie 'Firefox.default'
     Firefox.icefault): doubleclck.net/(id)"


Does that message mean I got some viruses on my systems?
