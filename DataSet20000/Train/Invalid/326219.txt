Certain sites render whole Firefox UI blurred

I noticed that when viewing certain sites the whole FF window becomes blurred. It happens regardless of tabbed browsing, reproducible always on my Win2K machine.
I have tested with a new profile and no extensions installed; all settings default except the proxy.

I noticed that firefox is less blurred if I reduce (un-maximize) the window. 

It is really bad for the eyes to look at the blurred window. I will attach some screenshots.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open http://blackhole.sk or https://mail.schimara.net
2. open http://google.com
3. compare the view

Actual Results:  
- blackhole.sk and schimara.net are blurred
- google is OK

Expected Results:  
no sites should blur the UI!

I have a feeling I saw something similar on Linux (Fedora 3, 2.6.x kernel), FF 1.5.0 but I don't have access to that machine for the moment.
