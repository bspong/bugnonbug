Prefix "www" not automatically removed for sites that do not load with the prefix appended

some sites do not load with the prefix "www." ahead of the domain name. Rather
than removing the www. prefix and attempting to load the site again, Firefox
simply displays a "server not found" error.  However, when the prefix is removed
manually the site loads without a problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to http://kamiki.net
2.change to http://www.kamiki.net and reload the site
3.
Actual Results:  
"server not found" error

Expected Results:  
when it could not find the site with the "www." prefix added, it should have
automatically tried to reload the site without the prefix or vice versa.

This bug affects every verson of Firefox I have used on Windows. I have not used
the Macintosh or Linux version enough to know if the bug exists there or not.
