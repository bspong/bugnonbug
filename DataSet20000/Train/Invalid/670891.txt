Change the version number, it is not awesome
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:8.0a1) Gecko/20110711 Firefox/8.0a1
Build ID: 20110711030829

Steps to reproduce:

Help -> About Mozilla Firefox


Actual results:

, I dislike  to use Firefox 8, I have used for years versions < 4, and with satisfaction. 
It is not awesome and  historically   meaningless.


Expected results:

If you would release a major version any 6 weeks, at least use the version number adopted  by Seamonkey:
Firefox 5 -> Firefox 4.1
Firefox 6 -> Firefox 4.2
Firefox 7 > Firefox 4.3
Firefox 8 -> Firefox 4.4
