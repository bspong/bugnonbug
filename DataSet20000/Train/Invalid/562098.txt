Possible incorrect expired certificate notice for gmail.com or google.com
Forwarding a report (sent using the form for reporting trademark infringement) that seems to say there's an incorrect expired certificate notice for gmail.com or google.com, though I can't really tell if that's what whoever sent this was trying to tell us. No need to keep me in the loop, I'm just passing this on in case it's something that should be acted on. I can't answer any questions and there's no record of who sent it.
