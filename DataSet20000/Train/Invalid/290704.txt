[Win32]Command line option -ispf is broken in installers on nightly builds since rebranding for Deer Park.

I am not 100% sure on which build this started happening, but I think it started
happening on the 20050415 build.

I have a script setup to update my nightlies, both Aviary and Trunk, in a simple
operation, instead of repeating a multitude of commands.  Script has worked fine
for quite awhile now, but recently (I believe after 0415 build) it started
leaving behind traces of running, specifically a new shortcut on the desktop (I
didn't check in other places).  I specify the -ispf installer flag in my script,
so no shortcuts at all should be made anytime during the install process.  I am
not sure what happened prior to the 0415 build, but it appears to have broken
the installer.  For reference, the following is out of the source from lxr:

-ispf: Ignore the [Program FolderX] sections that show\n the Start Menu shortcut
folder at the end of installation.\n

I will attach a copy of the script momentarily.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Run the script (or make one then run it) that updates your nightly install
using the -ispf flag
2. Wait for the script to finish
3. Observe the creation of a desktop shortcut, when no shortcut should have been
made.

Actual Results:

A desktop shortcut (and possible others) is created contrary to the switches
used when running the installer.  This causes me to do extra cleanup, which
wasn't previously necessary.

Expected Results:

The installer switch works as normal and prevents the creation of shortcuts on
the desktop, in the quicklaunch, and in the start menu.
