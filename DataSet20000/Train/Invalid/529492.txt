It loads fine, same with facebook, but for some reason, some of the icons, like D: or :D, don't get loaded. When I tried to look at the video at the above link, it took forever to load and the video ended up not loading up at all. Java error? Mozilla error? Weird enough, it worked fine yesterday. 

Reproducible: Sometimes




The Google chrome theme.
