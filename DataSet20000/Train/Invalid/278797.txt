This is very strange and seems to be related to some extensions I've been trying
to uninstall recently (install of uninstalling, Firefox crashes on relaunching
meaning that the extensions are stuck in the "This extension will be uninstalled
after you relaunch" state).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on a bookmark toolbar group or dropdown menu
Actual Results:  
The menu/dropdown flickers rapidly and makes things unselectable.

Expected Results:  
The menu should have displayed normally.

Interestly, before this behavior happened, I had a crash that was preceded by
weird empty gray dropdowns... I wonder if something got corrupted in the process.
