Stuck on launch, shows old Restore Session Window each time.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_6; en-us) AppleWebKit/533.20.25 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0.4 Safari/533.20.27
Build Identifier: Firefox 4 Release Candidate 1

Each time I launch Firefox 4 I'm greeted with the same Restore Session Tab. It's been happening for slightly over a month or so now, around the time when Firefox 4 Beta 8-10 came out.

Now that I've moved to Release Candidate 1, it also shows that page "Thanks For Downloading Firefox 4" each time I launch, the one that should only show up the first time you launch Firefox.

Also, any settings saved are forgotten once I re-start Firefox. History remains, but the Restore Session Feature and my Preferences are re-set to what they were before.

I've tried changing "When Firefox Starts:" to "Show a Blank Page" from "Show my Windows and Tabs from last time" but it doesn't seem to work.

I'm not sure how exactly to reproduce, since all I can really remember doing was upgrading from a previous Firefox 4 Beta Build to the next one, and then the Restore Session Window just got frozen there ever since.

Only have 3 Addons enabled, DivX Web Player 2.1, Shockwave Flash 10.1, Silverlight Plug-In 4.0.5 all of which I've had for a while now.

The workaround I'm using right now is to simply Bookmark any Tabs I've had open before closing Firefox. Unfortunately doesn't help if my Computer gets a Kernel Panic or just freezes, or (in the rare case) if Firefox crashes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Upgrade from a previous Firefox 4 Beta Build to a newer one.
2. Launch Firefox 4.
3.
Actual Results:  
Shows two Tabs: Restore Session with the old session, and Thanks for Downloading Firefox, or Welcome to Firefox, can't remember exactly now.

Expected Results:  
Should have launched a Tab with Restore Session but previous session, not an older session which it seems to be stuck on.

Using Default Theme, haven't used any other since Firefox 3, before Firefox 4 Beta began. Using an iMac from late 2006, no  special components, Built to Order but factory components.
