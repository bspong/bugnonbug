Make Subscriptions Work Better
- add a post-date annotation for every entry in a feed folder
- set the expiry of this any any other related annotations to no more than the lifetime of the item (i.e. before the next livemark refresh) - prevents the annotation table from bloating
- implement a sortingAnnotation property on nsINavHistoryQueryOptions, and add a SORT_BY_ANNOTATION_DESCENDING/ASCENDING to the set of sortingMode options, that can sort the result set based on annotation content. 
- finish the attached prototype patch, which implements a special tree view for subscriptions so that unread items can be displayed etc.
