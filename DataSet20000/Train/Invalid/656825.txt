Warning about closing multiple tabs if only one tab is open [caused by Memory Meter]

If I have precisely two Firefox windows open, where one has multiple tabs and the other has only one tab, and I close the window with only one tab, it warns me about closing a window with multiple tabs. This happens regardless of however many other tabs may have been open or closed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox with one window (call it window A).
2. Open a new window (window B).
3. Open a new tab in window A.
4. Close window B.

Actual Results:  
Window B (which, you remember, only has one tab) disappears, and window A warns me that I am closing multiple tabs.

Expected Results:  
Simply closed window B.

Sometimes the warning appears twice: I'm not entirely sure what causes this, but it might happen if you open the new tab in window B and then close window A (instead of vice versa).
