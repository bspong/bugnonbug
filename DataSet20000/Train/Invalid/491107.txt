Download of open office starts and proceeds normally for about 1 minute at about 325kB/sec.  At this time, the computer freezes but the disk activity light is on and not blinking.  The system is totally frozen and can only be restarted using the reset button.  I have tried to download to different logical drives with no change in behavior.  The system is lightly loaded and I should have more than sufficient resources both disk and memory.  Never had the problem before the latest update.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Navigate to www.openoffice.org
2.start download of open office
3.
Actual Results:  
after about 1 minute, the system freezes


At the time of the crash, Windows task manager reports 11% CPU and 239,864KB of memory used.  Task manager also shows about 710,000 KB memory free.
