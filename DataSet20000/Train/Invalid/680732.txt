Firefox sucks!
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/535.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/13.0.782.112 Safari/535.1

Steps to reproduce:

Used Firefox faithfully for years.  Firefox was good and I loved it.


Actual results:

Mozilla Leadership started smoking dope?  I don't know, but now they are issuing updates on an absurd calendar schedule rather than a feature/bugfix schedule and breaking plugins and generally making Firefox suck.  Now I go to try to contact Mozilla and the contact page tells me I must be running the latest version of Firefox to even make contact.  WTF????


Expected results:

Firefox should have continued to rule.  Somebody has their head of up their ass.
