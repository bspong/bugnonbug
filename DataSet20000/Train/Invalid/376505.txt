Current CVS source cannot be built on Linux

As of April 3, 2007, did a source update from CVS and attempted to compile firefox.  Build fails with errors in:
../../dist/include/xpcom/nsTHashtable.h
./../include/nsScriptSecurityManager.h
nsBindingManager.cpp
nsCSSFrameConstructor.cpp
nsCSSRendering.cpp
nsChromeRegistry.cpp
nsCommandParams.cpp
nsContentList.cpp
nsDisplayList.cpp
nsDocument.cpp
nsFrameManager.cpp
nsHTMLDocument.cpp
nsLayoutUtils.cpp
nsScriptNameSpaceManager.cpp
nsViewManager.cpp
nsXULDocument.cpp
txKeyFunctionCall.cpp

Attachments will follow.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. cd mozilla; make -f client.mk checkout MOZ_CO_PROJECT=browser
2. make clean distclean
3. sh 1SETDBG.sh  # run configure
4. make -i > Compile.lst 2>&1
Actual Results:  
Many errors.  Summary will be attached.

Expected Results:  
It *should* have compiled.


Two things would be *really* nice:
1) Modules aren't checked into CVS and available for distribution unless they *will* compile and build under Linux.
2) The developers would release a *standard* build configuration for Linux.
(The "oh we aren't going to bother to support option xyzzy" doesn't cut it when you have 20+ options).  Failing to have a "known to compile" configuration does not allow people who would *like* to help with Linux product quality determine whether (a) the mozilla development process is a disaster; (b) the CVS failed for some reason; or (c) their "private" configuration is problematic.  At least if a "recommended" standard configuration were distributed it might allow people to separate (a) from (b) & (c).)

If one had a "standard" configuration then users could automate this process and run two compiles -- one standard, and then if that works a private configuration.  I know there is a problem with the library state under Linux but it isn't *that* hard to say the "standard" configuration requires libraries X, Y & Z.
