Uninstalling Firefox on Windows XP disturbs IE
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: 1.0

I had Firefox 1.0 installed and later uninstalled it. After uninstalling 
Firefox, IE is disturbed. The IE icon that appears in the address bar of IE (at 
the beginning of the URL) does not appear anymore.

Later, I installed Firefox and this resumes the explorer icon to appear in IE's 
address bar.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox.
2. Use IE and see that the explorer icon appears in the address bar at the 
beginning of the URL.
3. Uninstall Firefox.
4. Use IE and see that the explorer icon disappears in the address bar at the 
beginning of the URL

Actual Results:  
The explorer icon does not appear in the address bar. Some unrecognized icon 
appears.

Expected Results:  
IE should be untouched with Firefox installation and uninstallation.
