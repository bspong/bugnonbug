Error when opening any new tab / loading content into existing tab [caused by IE Tab 2]

Error: p.onSecurityChange is not a function
Source File: chrome://browser/content/tabbrowser.xml
Line: 875
This is what appears in the error log.
code :
if (securityUI)
 p.onSecurityChange(webProgress, null, securityUI.state);

Also happening with other parts of the same xml file p.onStatusChange / p.onStateChange as well.

Also happening with IETab+ with a similar error
 p.onStatusChange which did appear in the tabbrowser as well sometimes.
It is almost as if p is undefined or not the class / object it is supposed to be.
// ietab code
IeTab.prototype.hookCode = function(orgFunc, orgCode, myCode) {
   try{ if (eval(orgFunc).toString() == eval(orgFunc + "=" + eval(orgFunc).toString().replace(orgCode, myCode))) throw orgFunc; }
   catch(e){ /*Components.utils.reportError("Failed to hook function: "+orgFunc);*/ }
I removed the comment brackets to try and fix it, still does the error.
It seems to be any thing that changes the state, status or security of the tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load a page
2.Load a new page or Load a new tab

Actual Results:  
Error shows up in error log.


Addons loaded: IETab+, Forecast Fox, Web Developer Toolbar, Personas: Dolphin theme and many other addons. I tried in safe mode which killed all but the persona theme, even when switching to the default theme it still does it.
Window 7 32-bit and 64-bit variant showing the same issue..
