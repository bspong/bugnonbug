I am using asp.net and vb.net in my aspx web page.

the relevant piece of code which works perfectly with internet Explorer is:

output_string = "http:\\train-it.co.uk\commentsearch.aspx?newsearch=" & 
commentchoice.text

response.redirect(output_string)

Firefox converts a typical URL to:

http://www.train-it.co.uk/%5C%5Ctrain-it.co.uk%5Ccommentsearch.aspx?newsearch=crystal

It then obviously cannot find the URL



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to first URL 
2.enter a search term such as 'access' 
3.click on the 'Search' button

Actual Results:  
Get a resource cannot be found error because URL has been corrupted

Expected Results:  
opened the http://train-it.co.uk/commentsearch.aspx page

Try it in Internet Explorer ... works perfectly!!!

First spotted on my son's PC, he is a fan of Firefox.

just downloaded and tried it on one of my PC's you will have to convince me to
become a fan!
