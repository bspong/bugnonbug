When running Zone Alarm (latest version, FREE/PRO), Firefox would work for a while but after surfing a while, it lose connectivity to the internet. MSN, Internet Explorer, Songbird, Outlook etc.. will still work. But Firefox will give me the error telling me there is no internet connection. Sometimes I can restart the browser but it will still have connectivity probles. Othertimes it will tell me that Firefox is already running and that I must end the process. If this happens I cannot close the firefox.exe process from task manager / command prompt, and I have to reset the computer. It will then take exceptionally long for Vista to shutdown.

After uninstalling ZoneAlarm, and switching to other firewalls (e.g. comodo) this problem disappears and firefox works perfectly.

Verdict -- incompatibility between Firefox and Zone Alarm

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have latest version of Zonealarm running (PRO/FREE)
2. Firefox
3. Surf arond for a while -- sites like engadget, google, gizmodo, etc..

Actual Results:  
Lost internet connectivity in Firefox only
Wasn't able to kill firefox.exe process
forced to Restart to get internet


Expected Results:  
Firefox should have functioned well as normal :) and closed when I told it to via task manager /command prompt

problem seems to be in a incompatibility with ZoneAlarm, switching to another firewall fixes problem
