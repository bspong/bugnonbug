Ubuntu 8.04 LTS with Gnome. I have 4 monitors. 1 screen (900x1440) is defined as a separate X-window (with 4 desktops) from the other three screens (3840x1028) also defined as 4 desktops.

If Firefox is running on any of the 3840x1028 desktops, it can not be started on any of the 900x1440 desktops. You get the "Firefox is all ready running, but is not responding.  To open a new window, you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart your system." You can start as many additional windows on the 3840x1028 desktops as you want without the error message.

If you start Firefox on the 900x1440 first, then the situation is reversed. no sessions can be started on the larger desktop, and you can start as many as you want on the smaller desktop.

Apparently Firefox's "profile lock" does not take into consideration the fact that the program can be run from the same logon session from two different x-windows....

I need to be able to run firefox from both x-windows, as the smaller desktop screen is used to monitor remote processes that create HTML status messages, at the same time that the larger desktop is used as a normal work station.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Using a multiport display card, define a monitor to each of the ports.  
2. In X-windows define the screens to be SEPARATE x-windows. (You will probably have to reboot your computer to do this.)
3. Start firefox on one monitor and look at anything.
4. Try to start firefox on the other monitor. You will receive the "Firefox is already running, but is not responding" error message.

Actual Results:  
you can start as many session on whatever monitor you first used, but cannot start any sessions on the other monitor..

Expected Results:  
I should be able to use Firefox at the same time on either set of monitors without difficulty.

It should not care that two different X-servers are being used as a single large desktop,
