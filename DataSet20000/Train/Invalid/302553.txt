Enabled "Cookie Warning" Option on Pref Bar Does Not Stick Window-to-Window or Session-to-Sesson

I use the latest versions of FireFox on both my W98 and Linux FC3 machines.  I
also have the Preferences Bar installed on each.  On the Preferances Bar, I
usually have Cookies disabled and Cookie Warning enabled.  It is the latter that
does not hold.

With FireFox open, the Pref Bar showing, and Cookie Warning enabled, if I then
open a new window, the Cookie Warning box will be unchecked in the new window. 
The Cookie Warning box, if enabled, only holds true for the window that is open
and not any subsequent new windows.  If I were to close FireFox then reopen it,
the Cookie Warning box will similarly be disabled.

I have tried various settings under Tools > Options but none or combination
thereof seem to have an effect on retaining Cookie Warning once set.

This problem does not exist with Mozilla, where I also have the Preferences Bar
installed and Cookie Warning enabled.  There, the option holds true for any new
window opened or whenever Moz is reinvoked.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open FireFox.
2.Enable Preferences Bar
3.Enable Cookie Warning
4.Open new window -OR- close FireFox and reinvoke FireFox.

Actual Results:  
Cookie Warning will be disabled.

Expected Results:  
Retain the Cookie Warning enabled setting.
