I do banking by internet on a Swedish bank web site.
On the payment web page there is a gadget to click.
This gadget opens a little calendar, where i by clicking on a date
select the payment date, and the text field is filled with the date I select.
THis has always been working ok with Firefox, but since the last
update of MacOSX the applet does not open the calendar.
I have checked with Safari, and the gadget works ok in Safari browser.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. You can not, as you have to kave codes to log in to the bank web site
2. This is for your info....
