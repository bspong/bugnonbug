The toolbar bookmarks dropdown, which by default is next to the home button(i truly hate the new placement,btw.) is visible in 'customize UI' mode, but once i switch it back to the normal mode it disappears.

Could this have anything to do with the additional observation that the linux theme looks a whole lot differently from the windows variant ?

this is a clean install(removed .mozilla too) from todays nightly on fedora rawhide, no firefox installed via package manager
