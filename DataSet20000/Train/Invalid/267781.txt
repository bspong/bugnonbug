New Dropdown for Quicksearch Box is extremely ugly, big and waste of space. And breaks apple UI consistency.
In the recent RC2, the Themeing of the search-dropdown-box ("google" etc) has
been  changed to look somewhat aqua-ish. 

Problem 1: Dropdown-Boxes in OSX do not look this way (see the aqua widgets for
the select element in safari). They have a coloured handle (including the
triangle) and a black label on whitish background (never an icon, though). For
examples see:

Problem 2: The old (pre RC2) widget (simple triangle) was an already existing
solution. It is used in the finder, in iTunes, in Apple Mail and it is still
used in Thunderbird. It is always used to specify a search context - so why
should it not be used in this place?

Problem 3: It is ugly. By its extreme bevel the dropdown handle sets itself atop
all other UI-Elements although it is just a search-modifier, not an important
action button. Please safe us from eye-cancer and return to the old style. It
looks just beatiful in the location bar. 

Problem 4: It is unnecessary. If we want to enlarge the clickable area or to
direct the user to this nice firefox feature (we don't need to, almost every OSX
program has such a box), we can use a shaded background wich is cut of to the
right by a straight vertical edge and fills up to the left. It could have the
same color as the tabs.

I'd really like to mark this bug as blocker, but I know there's a lot of work
already so we should do it when there is spare time.
