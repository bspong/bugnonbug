Connecting to mail.yahoo.com two possibilities:

1) After cleaning cookies and cache, I get the login page, but after entering
   username and password, I get the error below.

2) without cleaning cookies and cache, I immediately get the error page:

Redirect Loop

      

      
      
      

      
        
        

          

Firefox has detected that the server is redirecting the request for this address in a way that will never complete.

        


        
        

The browser has stopped trying to retrieve the requested item. The site is redirecting the request in a way that will never complete.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Connect to mail.yahoo.com (with a 'dirty cache' and cookies not deleted

or

1. Connect to mail.yahoo.com, enter the username and password
2. Click continue/
Actual Results:  
Error page complaining about redirection

Expected Results:  
My mail account!

I've tried:

1) Firefox 3.0.3,
2) Firefox 3.0.4,
3) Firefox 2.0.0.18

All trying to clean up cookies/cache etc. Also tried with the user agent
switcher on and off. I finally resorted to capturing the HTTP flow, and 
noticed:

1) I ask connection with mail.yahoo.com, and see the 
   GET /ym/login HTTP/1.1 going out (with all the browser info)

2) yahoo then answers with a 302 error:
   HTTP/1.1 302 Moved
   with a new location:
   http://f133.mail.yahoo.com/ym/login
   and even a hint in html: 
   The document has moved <A HREF="http://f133.mail.yahoo.com/ym/login">here

3) BUT, firefox insists on ignoring that address:
   GET /ym/login HTTP/1.1
   (there is no new DNS request to resolve the new address, and the IP is the
   same, so evidently the page served is the same).

I've attached the captured data from wireshark (I still have ethereal),
starting the transaction at the moment 'enter' is pressed after entering
mail.yahoo.com in FF. The first capture seen is the DNS lookup of the
mail.yahoo.com domain. (There may be a couple of 'pings' in between, nothing
to do with this problem.
