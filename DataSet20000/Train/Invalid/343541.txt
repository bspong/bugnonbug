I want to disable the backspace key for "navigation back 1 in History"
I opened about:config and changed the value browser.backspace_action
to 2.
also setting this:
pref("browser.backspace_action","2") in user.js does not help.
and 
pref("browser.backspace_action",2) in user.js does not help.

I open a search in google page and go forward one page : works
hit 'Backspace' key takes me back one page in history (should not do).
