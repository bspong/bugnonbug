quite useful, but...

whenever i tap the icon in the systray to restore firefox, the icon immediately next to it also restores. this has happened with thunderbird and utorrent, both of which 'minimize to tray', but not using bosskey. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. minimize firefox
2. minimize thunderbird
3. restore firefox... t'bird comes up with ff
Actual Results:  
works every time

Expected Results:  
allow t'bird to stay minimized.
