Firefox hang w/google toolbar v3.0.20070525L with multiple popup windows
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.10) Gecko/20071126 Ubuntu/7.10 (gutsy) Firefox/2.0.0.10
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.10) Gecko/20071126 Ubuntu/7.10 (gutsy) Firefox/2.0.0.8

I found a bug with the Linux version of Firefox and Googles toolbar v3.0.20070525L, which does not exist in the Windows version of Firefox and Googles toolbar v3.0.20070525W.  In this particular case, the result of the problem is that Firefox hangs, consuming 100% of the system resources and must be killed.

The problem occurs when you view a members picture while viewing their profile on the website "www.daddyhunt.com". The problem is fairly easily recreated, and I have verified that by disabling the google toolbar (and restarting ff) that the problem no longer happens and by re-enabling the add-on (and restarting ff), the problem reappears.  Again, this doesn't happen with the same version of Firefox on Windows with the same version of Googles toolbar (for windows).

I initially posted this on the Google toolbar site and it was suggested that this be posted here.

Environment:
- Fresh install of Ubuntu 7.10 (all updates since the distributions release have been applied),
- FF v2.0.0.8 (pre-installed on ubuntu)
- Ubuntu running within VMware Workstation 6.0.2 (irrelevant to the problem, but w/VMware allows for easier replication of the problem)
