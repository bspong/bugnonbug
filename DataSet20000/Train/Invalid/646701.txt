With 6 or more tabs open, the last tab overlaps the Windows dialogue box minimize-maximize-close buttons.  If I click the "X" to close the last tab, Firefox closes instead.

2.  Observe that the last tab overlays the minimize-maximize-close buttons
3.  Attempt to close the last tab by clicking that tab's "X"
Actual Results:  
Firefox closes

Expected Results:  
Firefox should not close, only the tab that was attempted to close
