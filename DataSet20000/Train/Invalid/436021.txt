ignoring image width and heigth if image cannot be loaded

When image (file) declared in <img src=""> cannot be loaded (for any reason - i.e. 404 for example), Firefox ignores width and height (either specified by <img widht=""> and <img heigth=""> or by <img style="width: ; heighth:">). It does not display image (or rather its placeholder, as image cannot be loaded) or reserves spaces with exact dimensions, page developer set. In place of that it only displays placeholder / reseres spaces enough to display <img alt=""> text with current font. This sometimes leads to a complete disorder or even chaos on page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. place any <img> on any webpage,
2. set its src="" to non-existing file,
3. set its width and heigth (either directly by <img width=""> or by CSS),
4. see the results
Actual Results:  
Firefox reacted as described above - it reserved space / displayed placeholder for non-existing image file with incorrect width and height. Exactly specified width and heigth was ignored.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should respect width and height set for image by page developer in all situations - even in those, when proper image cannot be loaded.

Since this bug is related to parsing HTML, I think it will show up in any version of Firefox run under any OS.
