Audio in Firefox causes things such as Flash video to "studder."

While watching ossmixer (from the commercial version of OSS), I can watch
Firefox allocate and deallocate a sound device every time a single sound is
played. This is why I think it is causing the studdering. This doesn't happen in
Windows. 

My first thought is that this is caused by a workaround done a long time ago
because Linux lacked support for virtual sound channels. For example, older
soundcards such as the SoundBlaster PCI 128 could only do one thing at a
time--i.e., xmms would be playing mp3s and no other application could use sound. 

Could this be the case? 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a Flash Game/Animation
2. Do something that causes a sound to play
3. Watch in horror as you miss the shot because firefox studdered. 

Actual Results:  
I was really mad because I missed the shot.

Expected Results:  
I should have made the shot!

Though I wasn't being very serious in the 2 fields above, this is an annoyance
and I think it should be fixed.
