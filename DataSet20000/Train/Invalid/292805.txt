when open firefox only top half the screen shows the website
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.3 (ax)

I just downloaded Firefox v1.7.7 and added various extensions and add-ons and
now when I open the browesr page to either the firefox 1.7.7 homepage or any
other website only the top 1/3 of the screen shows a website then there is a
horizontal line going across the screen and the rest of the screen is white.

The top of the screen that shows the website also has a scroll bar to scroll
down but the area you can see is so small it doesn't even help.

I tried to uninstall some of the extensions with the extension uninstaller under
the Tools menu and it says I need to install the Extension Uninstaller API and
when I click to install it I get the following message:  "Script Error" and
it doesn't install and I can't uninstall anything.

I also tried uninstalling Firefox 1.7.7 alltogether from my computer and then I
tried to re-install it and all webpages still open the same way.

Please help !


Sincerely,

Dan Garfinkel
