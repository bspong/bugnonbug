Last night I ran the Microsoft beta release of "Anti Spyware".  It showed a
single item of "Browser Hijack"  I deleted this item right away.  This morning
when logging on to Firefox, the default page to Firefox worked just find.  What
did not work was any attempt at a Google.com search -- no connection at all!!  I
re-installed Firefox release 1.0.4 and PRESTO, now the Google search engine
works just fine. Was the problem due to the MS Anti-spyware search??  If
Microsoft - those wonderful folks -- are responsible for disabling Google, this
is outrageous!!  I can't believe that any component of Mozilla/Firefox would be
recognized as a Browser Hijack Attempt.  I love Firefox for better security,
better features, and only use Internet Explorer when FORCED to due so.  Please
advise if anyone else has seen this.  Thank You,  Terrell Scott
