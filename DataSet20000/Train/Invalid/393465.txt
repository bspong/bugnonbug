on startup of firefox, blueOrganizer install takes over

On trying to start up firefox (2.004 and, after new installation, 2.006), BlueOrganizer Setup Wizard takes over and does not allow me to cancel it. As a result, Firexox has become impossible to use for me as long as I do not give in and allow BlueOrganizer to set itself up. I find this most annoying and unacceptable!

Only way to exit firefox is by force quit!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just click firefox application to open
2.
3.



clicking cancel should have caused BlueOrganizer to back off!!!!
