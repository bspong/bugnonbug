Hi, I have a minor bug that is pissing me off.

It is between 2 addons the first being "quicknote" Link: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/46 and the second being a *style* for an addon called "stylish" link to style: http://userstyles.org/styles/5158

Basically the problem is effecting "quicknote" by not changing the background color, text color and various other settings for "quicknote" I would really appreciate it if someone took the time and solved this little bug. Please E-mail me if you have anything done cnjctr@gmail.com

Peace.

Reproducible: Always
