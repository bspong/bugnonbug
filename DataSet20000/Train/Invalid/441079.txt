The cut, copy, paste and delete options aren't present when right clicking inside text input fields to display the context menu. This first began with version 3.0; v2.0.0.14 had these options in the context menu. I don't know if these items were puposely removed in FF3 or if this is a bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Locate a webpage with a text or textarea form input field.
2. With the cursor of the text field, click the right mouse button to display the context menu.
Actual Results:  
No cut, copy, paste or delete items listed in the context menu.

Expected Results:  
Cut, copy, paste and delete should display in text field's context menu.
