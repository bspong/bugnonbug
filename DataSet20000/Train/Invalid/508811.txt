Viewing the pages of www.firstunitarian.net with Firefox 3.5.2, we see double words, like shadows. This did not happen with the previous Firefox browser version that we used (2.something). Nor does it happen with Microsoft IE or Safari browsers. I am the webmaster for this site. Other people have reported this problem to me. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Using Firefox 3.5.2, go to www.firstunitarian.net. You will see the problem.
2. Using IE or Safari, go to www.firstunitarian.net. You will see intact pages.
3.
Actual Results:  
You see double wording on every page on the site with 3.5.2. You see the pages as they should be with IE and Safari.

Expected Results:  
It should have produced the same view of the pages as the older version of Firefox or as IE and Safari.

Others who use 3.5.2 are experiencing the same problem.
