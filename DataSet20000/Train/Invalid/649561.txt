When the tabs fill the whole title bar and start decreasing in size, closing one tab does not make the others expand in order to fill in the blank space, until I move my mouse. This does not occur when I close the rightmost/leftmost tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a few new tabs so that they fill the title bar
2. Close one of the tabs (not the rightmost tab - that works correctly)
3. Move the mouse cursor
Actual Results:  
The tabs did not expand in order to fill the blank space that was left by the closed tab - until I moved my mouse.

Expected Results:  
The tabs should have immediately expanded in order to fill the blank space.
