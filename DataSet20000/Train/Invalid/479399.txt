Firefox 3 on Windows with the "old generation" Java plugin crashes when reloading a page with any Java applet accessed from a Javascript body.onload handler using Liveconnect.

The problem does not happen with the "new generation" Java plugin. It also does not happen with Firefox running on Linux. Internet Explorer is also not affected by this. 

The crash happens when obtaining a reference to the Applet object from a Javascript body.onload handler using document.appletname, getElementById() or document.applets[], while reloading the page. Firefox crashes in xul.dll, probably because of a race condition.

The applet at the test URL is just a stub that does not do anything. The problem happens with any applet.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. disable the "new generation" Java plugin in Control Panel/Java/Advanced, or just use Java 1.5
2. try quickly reloading the test page a dozen times
3.
Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes.

Expected Results:  
No crash.

Using default theme. No extensions. Crashes with both Java 1.5 and 1.6.
