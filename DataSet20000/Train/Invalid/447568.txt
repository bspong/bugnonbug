At irregular times, immediately after causing Firefox to take an action (via a link in gmail, or clicking 'never for this site' after entering HTTP authentication), the entire computer will lock up / hang, requiring a manual powercycle of the computer.

Unfortunately, about:crashes does not have any information, so I'm unable to provide any kind of traces.  This behavior never occured with Firefox 2.x, as I had uptimes of weeks.  Since starting with Firefox 3.x, I inevitably get a lock up in Firefox in under a week of using it.

The above listed triggers (clicking on a link in gmail, and clicking 'never for this site' after http authentication) are merely the last few that I can recall.  Now that I have a bug filed I will be more diligent about remembering exactly what it was that caused the lockup.
