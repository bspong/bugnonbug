The Save As dialog is too small for my liking after clicking the "Browse for other folders" dropdown arrow under linux.  I attempt to resize the common dialog window for a better view of my files, but window preferences are not saved.  A recurring cosmetic annoyance.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Right click on something
2.Choose the "Save ___ As.." option
3.Get a small window
4.Resize window to liking
5.Exit/save/etc...
Actual Results:  
The window's height and width preferences are not saved

Expected Results:  
The height and width preferences should be saved, or configurable by the user.

Using default theme, gnome desktop and Ubuntu/edgy.
