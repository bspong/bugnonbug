tabbed browser extension does not work with new pinstripe theme
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.4) Gecko/20030624 Netscape/7.1 (ax)
Build Identifier: 

When using one of the Mac OS X Firebird build from current-trunk for the past
few weeks the tabbed browser extension will no longer function correctly. 
Instead of the tabs looking like they should in the new pinstripe theme, the
first tab will be all the way to the left but the tab itself will be a different
style then usual, all new tabs will start appearing from the right hand side of
the tab bar instead of the left side where they should.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get Mac OS X Firebird from current-trunk.
2. Get tabbed browser extension and install it.
3. Start up Firebird with tabbed browser extension active.

Actual Results:  
The tab bar no longer works as it should with the tabbed browser extension in place.

Expected Results:  
The tab bar in Firebird should work using pinstripe and the tabbed browser
extension together just as it used to work before pinstripe was used.
