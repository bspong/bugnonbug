Address bar dropdown menu does not update by last site visited

The address bar records the last 20 or so sites visited, but does not actually
update by the last one visited when you use mouse click navigation in the
address bar dropdown menu.

For example, if you go to foo.com every day, but occasionally visit new sites,
eventually foo.com gets pushed off the bottom and you have to reenter the entire
address periodically.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a website by entering the address in the address bar.
2. Enter a couple other addresses in the address bar. Visit the first one by
clicking the name. 
3. View the dropdown menu of the address bar and observe the location of the
first address listed. It is on the bottom, rather than the top.

Actual Results:  
Actual results are what engendered the "Steps to Reproduce" report.

Expected Results:  
The software should move the most recent site visited to the top of the drop
down menu. This is primarily a convenience factor; it is much easier to find the
dozen or so zites the user visits daily, rather than hunt through the menu and
eventually have to retype the address.
