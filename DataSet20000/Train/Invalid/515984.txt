I'd like to see the ability to view differently.  Right now it's ind of a mess.
Maybe use the top item in the list to select the view method.

Right now it appears to be random.

I'm not sure what the view manu should look like, but a few ideas come to mind.

1. reverse chronological
2. By website and hierarchal
[VIEW}
......[VIEW by website]
......[VIEW reverse chronological order]

Say AMHD.com
...........URL 1
...........URL 2
Google.com
...........URL 1
..........URL 2
Pages with downloads (duplicated)
          URL 1
          URL 2
