When browsing many sites, which I couldn't really classify, but have noticed to
be mainly forums, port 80 is blocked on the computer until restart. All other
ports work, the said sites do not cause any problems with explorer and are
generally perfectly good and legitimate sites such as www.graphics.ru. After the
occurance of the but the reinstall of network card drivers, physical reconnect
fails to repair a complete blocakade of data transfer at port 80 (all internet
sites report as not responding on both IE and Firefox, exemli gratia) and any
attempt to establish any kind of socket on that port fails, all that is repaired
after a restart of the system.
