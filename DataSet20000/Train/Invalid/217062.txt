On my website at http://tenser.no-ip.com/ on the left frame when you highlight a
link that has a submenu such as codecs the &nbsp is shown instead of converting
it to xml. Also, effects arent displayed but that doesnt really matter =).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Select a submenu with &nbsp used for a space

Actual Results:  
&nbsp is displayed

Expected Results:  
had a space instead of the command
