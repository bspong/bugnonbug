When I played with new feature in Vista - 3D switching windows, after a few times Firefox was suddenly minimized and it couldn't be maximized again to the default size. After clicking a minimized window in bottom panel, it didn't do anything. I tried it more times and it did the same bug again.. I had to close the minimized windows and start Firefox again. The window appeared but in some small size - it certainly wasn't default size.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start Firefox in Vista x86 32-bit
2. start some another applications
3. switch these windows in 3D switching mode few times (eg. 10 times)
