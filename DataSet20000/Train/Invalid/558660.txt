Will not connect to employee website

I use this function regularly, and until the latest update, (Apr 10) this worked fine. Now the pop-up window opens, but it either times out, does nothing, or returns 
"Connection Interrupted
The connection to the server was reset while the page was loading.
The network link was interrupted while negotiating a connection. Please try again."

It acts like a very slow internet connection, yet everything else connects fine, and there is no problem using IE. Almost like the code is being blocked or will not execute. Pop-ups are allowed, and Adblock Plus is disabled.
This is the personal travel planning function of my employer's website (American Airlines, https://www.jetnet.aa.com), and is password protected. 


Thanks
