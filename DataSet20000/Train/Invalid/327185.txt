Local XML files transformed to XHTML using XSL/XSLT are not rendered correctly.

When you open a locally stored XML file in FireFox with an associated XSL file to transform the XML to XHTML, the HTML tags do not affect the appearance of the output (not as they should at least).  The DOM appears to be correct (using the dom inspector) but things are just not displayed properly.  This is especially evident with what I was doing; making HTML tables.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an XML and associate XSL file which transforms the XML into some sort of table format.
2. Make media-type="application/xhtml+xml" 
3. Open the XML file in Firefox.


Actual Results:  
The table is not displayed at all, only the text is displayed.
The HTML tags have no effect on any of the formatting.


Expected Results:  
The xhtml output of the transformation should be rendered as html.

It should be noted that when you save the page as an HTML file the page is saved as it should have been displayed.  Opening this HTML file shows the transformation as it should have been displayed.
