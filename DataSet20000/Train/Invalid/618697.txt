Search engine button doesn't change when a searchplugin is detected
Build id: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0b8pre) Gecko/20101212 Firefox/4.0b8pre

The searchplugin is detected since I see the opportunity to add it to the searchbar in the menu, but the icon doesn't show the usual (Firefox 3.x) "glow". I tried to search BugZilla to find if that's a wanted feature but I didn't find anything useful.
