While testing cookie settings, I discovered that disabling cookies can be circumvented by extensions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the Live PageRank Extension < https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2007 >, change the max version if need be, and install it.
1. Disable cookies by going to Tools>Options>Privacy and unchecking "Accept cookies from sites".
2. Erase all cookies by hitting "Show Cookies" and clicking on "Remove All Cookies".
3. Close out of the options window, visit any webpage, for example < http://mozilla.com >, and then check the cookie list in Tools>Options>Privacy>Show Cookies...
Actual Results:  
There will be two cookies in the list, one from google.com, the other from toolbarqueries.google.com.

Expected Results:  
There should be no cookies in the list because Cookies should be disabled.
