I changed a page theme iditarodairforce.com/Comments (Comments)to a new picture. I can view all other themes on the web site but not the new one. IE7 can see the new one.

Reproducible: Always

2. select Comments
3.background theme (eric rohn.jpg) not viewable
Actual Results:  
Yhe background theme is not there so the text is almost unreadable.

I use Front Page 3 to manage the site
