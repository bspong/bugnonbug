Every user of Firefox and Arovaxshield seems to have the same problem. Firefox is rewriting blocked cookies by Arovax in the Profile file of Firefox. This happens when "enable Firefox tracking cookies shield" is activated. This problem may be a serious one for a beginner  or for anyone not really interested in computers. He'll end up with lot of useless junk that will slow down the computer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Arovax
2. minimaze it in the systray
3. open and run Firefox

Actual Results:  
After a few days   any cleaner used will report  no cookies but thre all will be in the Profile file

Expected Results:  
The cookies should not have been rewritten

Of course there is a simple solution th this problem: "disabling"enable Firefox tracking cookies shield". 


But it does not satisfy me because  we don't know what else the software may be doing and that the  average user does not know. So it may be  a serious problem.

In one word Firefox should stop rewriting those blocked cookies.
