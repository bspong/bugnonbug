After downloading Firefox 3 using Ubuntu's Add/Remove command, the title bar had disappeared. I have removed and reloaded it several times but no change. This is very inconvenient as I cannot view anything else but Firefox when it is onscreen.
I have had to shift to the Galeon browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on Firefox icon
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
No title bar

Expected Results:  
Title bar should have been present

I noticed someone had brought this up on Launchpad but could not understand their suggestions for a fix
