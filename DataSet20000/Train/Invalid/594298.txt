link in navigation bar wont update when I go to different page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b5) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b5) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b5

after going to first site eg http://www.google.com and than going to other site (by clicking link in page, or link from bookmarks - NOT by typying adress directly in navigation bar) keeps the old site "http://www.google.com" in adres bar, even when the other page is fully loaded

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
update the link in navigation bar with correct link
