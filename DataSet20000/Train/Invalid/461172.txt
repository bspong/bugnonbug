When you launch firefox 3.1 b1 (portable version) for the first time there is 2 tabs displayed (one for telling thanks you for testing, one for the default web site). When you launch firefox 3.1 b1 for the second time there is one tab but it isn't necessary to have on the screen the designation and the icon of the tab, only the web page. In firefox 3.0.3, if you have only one web site you don't have on the screen the "tab" (with the icon and designationà, you only have the web page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch Firefox 3.1 b1 with only one web page.

Actual Results:  
It shows the icon and the designation of the web site on the tab.

Expected Results:  
It has to show only the web site, not the tab (like in firefox 3.0.3)
