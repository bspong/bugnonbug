SSLExplorer 1.16 menus don't work in FF2.0.0.1 but did work in FF2.0 and FF1.5

Firefox 2.0 worked great. Firefox upgraded to 2.0.0.1 and now sslexplorer 1.6 menus after logging in does not work (only tested WinXP). I've checked this several times on several installations (using WinXP). I've tested with FF2.0 and then allowed the upgrade to FF2.0.0.1 and then sslexplorer menus don't work. Perhaps there is stricter JavaScript checking in the update as the error console has a message cannot convert value to interger.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install SSLExplorer 1.6
2.Install FireFox 2.0.0.1
3.Run SSLExplorer Client through FF and login
4.Menus in SSLExplorer no longer working
Actual Results:  



Expected Results:  
This should work as is did in FF2.0, i.e. the menus should have worked

FF2.0 supported SSLExplorer 1.16

FF2.0.0.1 broke this function supported in 2.0

I had to uninstall FF2.0.0.1 and install FF2.0 with no updates or FF1.5.0.9 with updates
