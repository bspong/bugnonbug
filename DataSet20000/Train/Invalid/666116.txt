Yes this is a troll.  But a whole version number for a bugfix is ridiculous.  Update to a larger number is refused.  If FF gets too far ahead of itself I'll be making a switch.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Update to 5.0?  I hadn't even heard anything about... 
2. bugfixes?!
3. >:|

Actual Results:  
Disappointment

Expected Results:  
Increased market share via catching up with IE and Chrome in version number

Notice that Chrome doesn't even play up its version number to non-developers?  That's because chrome is just chrome.  Real people don't care about numbers after your product name.
