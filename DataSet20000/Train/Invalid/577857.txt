This has happened with random flash video since firefox added plugin manager (all versions 3.6 and 4 beta 1)

Once i click on the video to start playing it, i cant do anything (even CTRL+ALT+SUPP) and in few seconds, i got an awful blue screen saying that my computer were in an endless loop, and that there may be a problem with my graphic card driver.  I dont think its a driver problem because i use this driver for 1 year and i havent got other problem like this.

This happens with several videos, but not all videos. If I open it with another web browser, there is no problem to watch it, but each time i try with firefox, i got a blue screen.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Find a flash video with this bug (i watch something like 10-20 videos a day, and i got this problem everyday)

Actual Results:  
blue screen

Expected Results:

i think the problem come from plugin manager, cause this has happened since plugin manager was added to firefox.
