network.autodial-helper.enabled gets set back to TRUE when installing
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

The very existence of this flag is frustrating. I can't understand why anyone would want every typo in a URL to cause a dial-up dialog to start. It is even more frustrating that every time I upgrade Firefox, I have to go manually re-edit the all.js file to set it back to "false."

Manual edits in the .js files should be preserved. Failing that, eliminate this flag.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Correct Firefox 1.0* behaviour by editing all.js to set flag to false
2. Install Firefox 1.5

Actual Results:  
network.autodial-helper.enabled is true

Expected Results:  
network.autodial-helper.enabled is false
