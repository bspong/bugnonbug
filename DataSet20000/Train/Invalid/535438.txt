Memory seems to leak very quickly and cause firefox to consume all my processor power

I have a 4gb, Intel Duo laptop.  
I like using firefox - or did
For some reason - after a short period of time my computer starts to "freeze" .... when inspecting the task manager I see that firefox is consuming most of my available memory. 
Even now - with just this tab open I can see that the memory allocated is 188,999k ...... too much . 
The issue has become so bad and regular that I am now switching most of my usage to Chrome. 
When the my computer starts becomes unusable - I shit down Firefox.  It take a little time to "garbage" collect, but when it does my computer becomes usable again. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Leave firefox running
2. Watch memory consumption go up - and not down (even If I close all tabs)
3. Close firefox - open chrome


Expected Results:  
I would expect firefox to consume only the heap space it needs

Sony Viao - I have a 4gb, Intel Duo laptop. Running Vista

This needs to be fixed - if its happening to me, its happening to many - and causing them to switch

If you wish to monitor my PC you are welcome to run some debugging/monitoring process on it
