In the "Add Bookmark" dialog box, the simple view does not show all the folders
that are contained in a user's profile. Expanding, using the arrow, shows a tree
view which correctly lists all bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to Bookmarks and select "Add Bookmark"
2. Select drop down arrow and notice missing folders
3. Select expand arrow and notice correct tree view

Actual Results:  
Simple bookmark view does not show all the folders in my bookmarks. Expanding
the view using the appropriate 'arrow' command button reveals a tree view that
DOES list the bookmarks completely.

Expected Results:  
The simple view dropdown should have shown all bookmark folders
