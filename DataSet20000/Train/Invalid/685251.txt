Firefox update cause black screen and Nvidia error
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:6.0.2) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.2
Build ID: 20110902133214

Steps to reproduce:

Did do nothing: Firefox is set to auto update. Nothing happens and then suddenly no signal to my monitor.


Actual results:

Happend twice now: with update to FF 6.0.1 and just now with update to FF 6.0.2. Suddenly a black screen, no signal anymore to my monitor. Signal comes back, there is an error about the OpenGL driver from Nvdia: it has stopped working. But no message from FF. But when I start FF again, there is the screen that says that FF has been updated. Somehow the FF update causes this.


Expected results:

I should have seen a pop up from FF saying that the latest update has been installed and that FF must be restarted.
