As far as I can tell, plusmn is a legitimate entity, but the XML parser
complains about it. Among other things, it causes the Sage extension to
completely fail on the RSS feed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:



Expected Results:  
&plusmn; should be rendered as a plus-or-minus character.

Obviously, the URL I gave will only show the problem for the next couple of
days, or at least until the next time there's an article that mentions something
like "DVD±R" drives.
