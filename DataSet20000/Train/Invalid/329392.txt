Typing "http" as the url takes you to microsoft.com rather than http.com . Was this done intentionally? This is not what it does in mozilla or opera. The same thing happens if you accidentally type "http//somelongstring" (note that there is no ':' after the "http"). 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. type "http" in the url bar and hit enter


Actual Results:  
goes to microsoft.com

Expected Results:  
should go to http.com
