Cursor always appears as if browser in designMode when page clicked
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

The problem first appeared with Firefox 1.5 (second to last update). After I had been doing some designMode programming, the cursor would always appear on a page when clicked, as if the whole page was in designMode. Restarting Firefox or the computer did not solve the problem.  Disabling all add-ons did not solve the problem. I figured it must have been my fault for doing something seriously wrong with Javascript, but then it happened independently on another computer also running Firefox 1.5 (second to last update). Looked forward to upgrading to 2.0 assuming the problem was common (it did, after all, happen to me independently on two different machines), but I still have the edit cursor on ever page I click on. It wouldn't be so annoying were it not for the fact that I like to scroll up and down the screen using the 'Page Up' and 'Page Down' keys, but these no longer work the same way, since they move the edit cursor.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use firefox for a long time with sites that use rich text editors
2. ...
3. ...shit

Actual Results:  
The edit cursor always appears when I run firefox and click on a page. I can put it anywhere, just like the whole document has design mode switched on, but I cannot edit the document.

Expected Results:  
Turn the freaking edit cursor off.  

I tried entering 'document.designMode = false' in the javascript console, but it's not set to on in javascript - the problem must lie deeper.

Although I now have my add-ons disabled as a test, I was running:
