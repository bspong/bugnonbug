I updated to 1.0.6 today, rebooted. Now it will not open any URL.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)
Build Identifier: 1.0.6

I enter the URL address into the Address line. Mozilla flashes the address and 
then says 'Done'. It does not open the address. I have tried several and all 
react this way.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Mozilla
2. Enter a URL Address and hit 'enter'
3.

Actual Results:  
Nothing

Expected Results:  
Opened the web page at the requested URL

MS Explorer works fine. That is how I am able to file this bug report.
