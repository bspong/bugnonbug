Bug 404084 requested ''Rename "Organize Bookmarks" menu item`` and it was renamed to "Show All bookmarks".  Except that several functions under that heading don't logically fit under a title of "Show All Bookmarks".



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install FF3b2 on a new machine and start it up
2. Admire oversized icons
3. Go hunting for where to import bookmarks
4. Find something in File > Import, but it doesn't import HTML files
5. Come to the incorrect conclusion you can't import HTML bookmarks
Actual Results:  
After finding File > Import, everyday users give up on importing bookmarks into Firefox.  Users that know better keep looking and eventually find an import feature under the Bookmark menu item called "Show All Bookmarks..."

Expected Results:  
Importing bookmarks.html is something that should be easy and obvious to do, so either File > Import should allow .html importing, or consideration should be given to rename "Show All Bookmarks."

Firefox 1.5 : Manage Bookmarks
Firefox 2.0 : Organize Bookmarks
Firefox 3.0b: Show All Bookmarks 

Maybe "Places and bookmark manager" instead?
