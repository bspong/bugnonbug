Very poor video perfomance during streaming of video through flash. Video shutters dramaticly - sometimes can't be watched. This effect isn't present in Internet Explorer. Sometimes shuttering stops when leaving fullscreen mode of firefox. Happens almost every time and it is present since i think beta5.
