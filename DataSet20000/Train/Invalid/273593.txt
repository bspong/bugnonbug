File -> Close should NOT close all browsers

I've found that the behavior between the close button (the "X" on Windows
machines) and the File -> Close menu option is not the same and this is very
annoying. If you simply click on the "X" it closes only that browser. However,
if you go to File -> Close, it closes all instances of Firefox. Either there
should be a separate menu option for "Close All Windows" or it simply should
behave like IE since a recent Firefox migrator like myself will become
frustrated very fast when you spend all day at work with 10-20 browser windows
open to accidentally close them all without any dialog unless one of them has
tabs open.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open two or three Firefox instances that do not have tabs open under them.
2. Go to File -> Close
3. Curse many times because you have to go and open all those windows back up.

Actual Results:  
All windows are closed.

Expected Results:  
Close only the current window.
