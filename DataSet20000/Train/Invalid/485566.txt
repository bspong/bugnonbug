Must I use Google?  They gave an ugly pop up to update and it will not go away!  I must turn off computer and start again.

Who us can I use instead of Google?

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
i.e.  Jobs.com - look at job description and ugly Google pop up and will not move off screen and will not let me look at job description.

Expected Results:  
Same

Don't want Google with ugly pop up.  Who else can I use??
