DAP doesn't work with Firefox 3.0.8

Whenever a download comes up, because of being on dial up, I have to use Download Accelerator Plus to keep broken downloads. But the download add-on does not want to work with this version of Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download DAP Free
2.Have Firefox 3.0.8
3.Find a large download you know will break
Actual Results:  
When you perform the tasks above it doesn't matter what the download is,DAP does not start up to keep your broken or unfinished downloads to continue on at a later date.

Expected Results:  
DAP comes up as soon as you download something, and if the download breaks it continues on straight from the site you were just at

DAP worked with all of the other Firefox versions, I don't understand why it doesn't work with this one. Is there a missing file?
