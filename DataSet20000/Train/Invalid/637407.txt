Howdy,

This was a feature for a while and then it has disappeared.

I place the mouse pointer into the tabs "bar" at the top of my browser window and use the mouse wheel to move forwards/backwards in the bar. Each tab moved to this way "lights up" but the content of the url which the tab represents does not appear.

Earlier versions of Firefox (Minefield) had this feature but it seems to have disappeared.

The feature was VERY useful to me since I load large numbers of tabs.
