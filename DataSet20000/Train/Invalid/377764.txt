text cursor on all webpages

Text cursor is present on all webpages as if my ffox was a readonly text editor.
It is good for selecting text without mouse usage, bot sometimes disturbs me.
e.g.: cursor keys do not scroll the page immediately as I press any of them,
but only when cursor would go off the screen, and then the viewport follows the cursor.
Browsers always scrolled the content immediately as I pressed a cursor key.
I would appreciate if I could switch between the old and the new scrolling style.
A good choice would be for it to depend on the state of Scroll lock switch.
-> See how MS Excel scrolls content by cursor keys when Scroll lock is turned on and off.
Thanks!
