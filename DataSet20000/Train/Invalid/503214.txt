Basic authentication user/pass saved by server url
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11

If different parts of a server under the same root host are protected by basic authentication requiring a different user be entered the browser is serving up the password for the other session.  I.e.

http://www.example.com/protectedA
The above directory requires a user of role A

http://www.example.com/protectedA
The above directory requires a user of role B

In firefox 3.0.11 you are able to enter a different user for the different root directories, but in 3.5 it will serve up the same user and you will get a 403.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a servlet that requires a certain role
2.Create another servlet that requires a different role on the same server.
3.Log into the one servlet and then try to log into the other.
Actual Results:  
403 exception.

Expected Results:  
Request authentication.
