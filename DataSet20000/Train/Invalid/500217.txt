Search fails on Yahoo Toolbar or internal search box
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090615 Firefox/3.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When I do a search with the Yahoo toolbar or the built in search it blows up and the page goes to "file:///C:/DOCUME~1/jcline/LOCALS~1/Temp/search" on the web page bar and the browser shows this on the page "["lexington herald leader",["lexington herald leader newspaper","lexington herald leader classifieds","lexington herald leader obituaries","lexington herald leader sports","lexington herald leader ky","lexington herald leader online","lexington herald leader kentucky","lexington herald leader jobs","lexington herald leader archives","lexington herald leader obits"],[],[]]"
Also at this point the Download Dialog box pops with a search.part listed

ANy search after this will bomb and I have to restart the browser.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to Yahoo Toolbar, type in bar and search, 
2.Scroll down mid way on the auto fill option on suggested selections
3.Select on of the highlighted suggestions


Expected Results:  
Should go to page and be able to select but it sometimes does not work

I think there is an incompatible filter with all the rds that yahoo does for research and development
