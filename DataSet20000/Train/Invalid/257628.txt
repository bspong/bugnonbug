DOM Inspector: Problems with "File/Inspect a Window"

DOM Inspector:

If I select a window (or tab) with "File/Inspect a Window", the address bar of
the DOM Inspector shows a chrome-reference to the browser cache instead of the
real URL.

And if this chrome-URL is shown the function "Search/Select Element By Click"
does not work anymore. I have to re-open the DOM Inspector, to be able to select
elements by clicking into the Firefox window, aigain.

Reproducible: Always
