Have searched bugzilla for this and did not find it. It this is a Dupe, I'm sorry. I would guess this has been reported many times, but I don't see it. If you go to http://search.yahoo.com/dir the "Yahoo Search" logo does not display. If you click the other links on that page like "Images" or "Local" the logo is also missing. The only page the works is "Web" because it has a different logo setup. I am using nightly Minefield but so I thought it might be a trunk issue, but I tested it on 3.0 Beta 2 with the same result. So, I decided to try it on 2.0.0.12 and STILL got the same result! The page works fine on IE 6.0

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://search.yahoo.com/dir
2.Logo is missing.

Actual Results:  
Logo Was Missing.

Expected Results:  
Logo Should Be There.
