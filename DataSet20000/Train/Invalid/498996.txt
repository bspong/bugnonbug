If I try to watch a streamed programme on BBCi player the programme stops after a few minutes and spinning disk icon appears, the wireless connection is then lost and I have to reboot. Have upgraded to Firefox 3.0.11 and FlashPlayer 10 but problem persisits. This does not happen if BBCi Player watched in IE7 only in Firefox

Reproducible: Always

1.connect to www.bbc.co.uk, click iplayer link
2.click tp play a programme
3.watch (and wait for symptoms to appear)
Actual Results:  
Programme starts to play, after about 2 minutes pauses as if streaming, does not restart and wireless broadband link lost (only lost when doing this)PC has to be rebootred to re-establish wireless connection.

Expected Results:  
should have played streamed programme without interuption

This problem does not happen if BBCi player watched in IE7. Wireless connection stable unless watching iplayer in Firefox.
