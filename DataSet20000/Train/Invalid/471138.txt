I get both my old homepage and your updated mozilla page because there is no way I can delete cookies apparently. It seems that the two new pages are saved no matter what I do so I get my home page PLUS your thank you for updating mozilla. I cleaned my system over and over with several programs but it still pulls up both pages, something that never happened before. It's quite annoying to get your welcome page when I don't necessarily need to see that tons of times a day. I just want to get my homepage. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. there is NO way to reduce or help
2. cookies deleted or otherwise does NOT delete the two pages
3.
Actual Results:  
not sure- first time encountered

Expected Results:  
nothing!

just kept my own homepage, not two pages at once. Deleted cookies, history, everything - still brings up two pages, yours and my home page, every single time.
