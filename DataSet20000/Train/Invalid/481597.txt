While I was editing a Wikipedia article I wanted to copy and paste some text. I highlighted the text I wanted to copy and paste from the article, but when I right-clicked it to get the Copy and Paste functions I had to wait quite a while for the thing to popup (like 4 or 5 seconds from when I clicked). 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_2000s_recession
2. Click "edit this page"
3. Highlight some text in the text box
4. Right-click the highlighted text
Actual Results:  
Appearance of contextual menu is slow

Expected Results:  
Context menu should show up immediately
