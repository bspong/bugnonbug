"Print" in context (right-click) menu
Careless user attempt to purge laptop-spooled print file because Properties miss-set resulted in delete of ALL queued prints (one-week work) because context menu for right-click outside of column for "Document name" results in deleting ALL documents rather than the document on which the cursor is positioned.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Pause or disconnect printer
2.print two documents, so two entries exist on printer queue
3. Right mouse click, click Purge, (will result in loss of all documents)

Actual Results:  
A week's worth of queued documents were lost - not easy to quantify as some were news articles with possible copyright lawsuit ramifications.
