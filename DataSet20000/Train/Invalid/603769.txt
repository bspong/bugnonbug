Your latest Firefox is so slow (Version 3.6.10) - including loading of pages, I now use "Google Chrome Browser" with excellent results and without the FireFox issues and bugs.  In addition - my mouse movements freeze-up when using your browser.  Firefox is constantly crashing.

In addition, I am tired of this message: "Firefox is already running but is not responding.  To open a new window, you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart your system."  I don't get such error messages with Google Chrome.

And by the way, I sending this message from “Google Chrome” web browser – do to the fact that I temporary cannot use FireFox.  FireFox worked great when it was first originally released years ago – but now it is pledged with on-going never-ending bugs. Please fix the on-going bugs.
