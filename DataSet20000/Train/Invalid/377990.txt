Copy from Windows Notepad (or Firefox) won't Paste into new Firefox window opened after Copy

If you copy text and then open a new browser window, the text won't paste anywhere in the new window. It will paste into a new tab.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Copy text from either Notepad or from Firefox (or pretty much anything else).
2) Open new Firefox browser window (not new tab). Can open either from File menu in Firefox itself or through Windows Start -> Programs -> Firefox, or with a Windows Fast Launch icon.
3) Attempt to paste into either the URL window or the (Google) search window. This will fail. Paste will work if it's a new tab rather than a new window.
Actual Results:  
Text failed to paste into a new window, but pastes into a new tab.

Expected Results:  
Text should paste into browser window with a new window the same as with a new tab.

This problem occurs even when some keys still work properly rather than opening the Search box. Paste will work in a new window if you clear the cache before attempting to paste. Accompanying problem is inability to use HOME or END or left/right arrow keys. These keys do nothing until cache is cleared.

No themes were installed. I do have the latest plugins installed for AlternaTIFF (TIFF graphic viewer), Flash, Shockwave, and UnPlug. Also Quick Time 7.1.0.210. No other plugins.

I don't know if this problem has occurred on a fresh install with no changes to "factory" settings and no plugins installed. 

My apologies if this is a duplicate. I know there are several related cut/paste/search bugs, but I hadn't seen the "New Window" vs. "New Tab" issue mentioned yet.

I'm listing this as a major bug, because it's a longstanding problem with a basic function that's used all the time.
