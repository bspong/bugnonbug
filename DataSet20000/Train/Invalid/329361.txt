If you are watching items on eBay, the dropdown Action lists in the "Items I'm Watching" section no longer seem to work. The Action area consists of a "Bid Now" or "Buy It Now" button and a dropdown menu icon. Selecting the dropdown menu icon should bring up a list of appropriate actions. Looking at the source, this appears to be done using Javascript. Please note, the same problem  applies to all other dropdown Action menus in other sections of the My eBay page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. login to eBay
2. Go to My eBay
3. Hit the dropdown Action menus for an item you are watching

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens

Expected Results:  
A list of possible actions should appear

Applies to all dropdown Action menus in all sections of the My eBay page.
