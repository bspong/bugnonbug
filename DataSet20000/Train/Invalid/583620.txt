Can't close tabs with certain pages.

With certain web pages I am no longer able to close the tab. The page will load fine and render properly but clicking on the X in the tab or right clicking and selecting close do not work. I am able to load a different page in the same tab, but I will not be able to close the new page either. 
While some tabs are unable to close others pointing at different sites will still function correctly.

I have tested this in safe mode and I get the same results. This issue started about 10 days to 2 weeks ago.

While some tabs are unable to close 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  ./firefox -safe-mode &
2.  Load at least 2 tabs one pointing to a page that causes this problem. 
3.  Click on the X in the tab to close it. 
4. Right click on the tab and select 'Close Tab' 
Actual Results:  
Tab does not close

Expected Results:  
Tab to close

I am running Minefield from a tar ball with updates enabled. But I also have firefox-3.6.4-2.fc14.x86_64 installed via the vendors packaging system and it does not have the same problems. When I first downloded the Minefield tar ball it worked fine as well. But one of the updates in the last 10 days to 2 weeks started this problem.

I would guess that about 15% of pages experience this issue. Another page where I have the same problem is here.
