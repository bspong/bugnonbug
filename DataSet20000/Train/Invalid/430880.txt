Update open search UI on OS X and Windows
To clean up the appearance of open search discovery on windows and OS X, we have decided to place small plus above the drop down arrow, instead of the current blue smudge.  We want this glyph to only be noticeable for people who know to look for it.  We do not want to capture the user's attention because we believe doing so is a needless distraction, given that it is very unlikely that the user will take an action from the visual cue.
