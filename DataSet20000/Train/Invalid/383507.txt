Crashes Mac OS X, requiring power cycling PowerMac, Mac OS X 10.4.9

Opening some web pages intermittantly crashes my PowerMac, dual G5, Mac OS X 10.4.9 (Tiger).

Apple has lots of crash dumps and bug reports from me on this.

Always crashes while in Firefox 2.0.0.4. Last crash was while adding my Gmail.com
account to my Google page.

Mac OS X comes up with the 'grayed out screen of death', telling me to power
cycle my machine. When I reboot, my Mac lets me report the crash to Apple.

You should be able to get the crash dump from Apple.

It happens about once a day to me.

Seems to possibly happen more often when I open up web pages in Tabs, but I'm
not yet sure about that.


Reproducible: Sometimes

1.I just keep using Firefox as my default browser.
