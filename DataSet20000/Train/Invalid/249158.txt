There is no icon that I can find that will let me print directly from the page
rather than pull down the file menu and selecting print.  I'd also like to do it
by selecting the right mouse button to get a pop-up list with print on it.IE has
this feature.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bring up browser
2. Notice that there is no print icon
3. Right mouse click, notice that there is no print option on the list.

Actual Results:  
Nothing

Expected Results:  
Had a print icon on a toolbar and a print as an action on the popup
