On my wife's Windows XP Laptop Firefox was giving error message that something serious has happened and Firefox must close; then shutting down. I uninstalled and reinstalled newest version 2 days ago. Since then, it keeps putting up a window about Google Toolbar and asking for me to OK its tracking and choosing enabling or disabling - tracking, I think. It comes up every few minutes, even tho' I unchecked tracking and checked "disable." I finally had to uninstall it again and I'm trying Opera. I much prefer Foxfire, but it won't stop blocking my wife's system. Apparently, it only accepts its preferred answers and keeps asking until it gets it??  Thanks

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Startup Foxfire. Period.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Window appears thanking me for selecting Google Toolbar from Foxfire and asks me to select Foxfire as default browser (which I do) and I think the second check box asks to allow tracking, which, for privacy reasons, I uncheck. Then, at the bottom of the box it has a selection of disable or enable keeping track of where I go. (Since I had to uninstall foxfire, I'm answering from memory.) It's apparently the standard window you get when you install Foxfire now. I then click on finish and the window closes, only to return in a minute or two and start the process all over again. And you can't just X-out the whole window.

Expected Results:  
The software should graciously accept my declination of its offer to keep track of everything I do.
