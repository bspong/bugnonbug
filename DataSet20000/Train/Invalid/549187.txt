Latest Minefield breaks the open tab on middle click feature on.

This all worked fine till i updated to 20100226

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Middle click on a link.
Actual Results:  
Selection box surrounds the link rather then opening it into a new tab.

Expected Results:  
New tab should've opened.

This is on a Logitech Cordless Mouse.
Logitech does not provide drivers for this mouse under windows vista or 7, so there are no button modifiers available.

The middle button works fine to bring up the scroll cursor, its just opening links in new tabs thats not working.
