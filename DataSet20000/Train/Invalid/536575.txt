"Transferring data from localhost" never stops showing

The problem is somehow vague and (I think) might be related to sql-server-browser process...

Basically when requesting a page on the localhost (apache+php+mysql), the "Transferring data from localhost" never stops showing and the page load is never accomplished completely.

It even did it to me on page somehow static (using some php but not accessing the db)

Behaviour differs with other browsers. Requesting the same pages under IE works perfectly.

I was using XAMPP, so I tried WAMP but was having the same problem, so I cleaned the registry and made an install of Apache/php/mysql myself, but the problem persists. Maybe I need to try it again on a clean os install...


Here are other pages dealing with similar problem:

I am also using a 3g stick to connect to the net, and it creates and extra LAN connection, I dont know if this important or not...

That's it... never had the problem before when developing, I don't really understand what's happening...

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.install XAMPP, WAMP or Apache/php/sql and FF
2.copy a web app into the web app folder
3.try to access it from firefox with http://localhost/webappname
Actual Results:  
the page starts loading and some elements are being displayed but the "data transfer from localhost" never ends...

Expected Results:  
A fully, correctly loaded page
