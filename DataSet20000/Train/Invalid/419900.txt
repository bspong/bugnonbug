When I am running a windowblinds theme if you click on any of the menus at the top, the pop out menu becomes the width of the whole screen and empty, with some up and down scroll bars on. Not sure if this is a specific theme or all of them, but their is definately a issue there.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load skin studio and open a theme
2. click apply window blind theme in the file menu
3. click on any menu at the top and they are all blank and huge!
Actual Results:  
Menus are width of screen, contain nothing, and have up and down scroll arrows on

Expected Results:  
shown the items in the menu
