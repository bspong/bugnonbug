Visiting http://mediamatters.org/items/200512080005 causes Firefox to crash.  This occurs even when in safe mode with all plugins disabled.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Enter http://mediamatters.org/items/200512080005
2.  Hit return

Actual Results:  
The page begins to load, then the browser abruptly exits.

Expected Results:  
The page is displayed.

At first I figured this was probably a problem with a video player plugin.  So I disabled all the plugin associations (asking Firefox to use external players instead), but this did not help.  So I tried Safe Mode (with the plugins disabled) and that didn't work either.
