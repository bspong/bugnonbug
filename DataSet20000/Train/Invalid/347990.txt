Loss of history after using the new pref
Steps to reproduce:

- Start a branch build with 300 days of history and a large history.dat file
- in Tools > Options uncheck "Remember visited pages for the last 600 days"
- Go to a site
- Restart Firefox
- Check the same option again and change it to 300 days again (necessary because it has changed to 9 days)
- Visit a site
- In the sidebar you'll see this as the only visited page in months
- Close Firefox
- Watch your history.dat file

Result: it has changed from 3,56 MB to 2,31 KB.
