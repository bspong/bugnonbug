Make the back/forward dropmarker have up and down arrows
I made a suggestion on da.firefox and beltzner suggested I file it: it wasn't clear to me when the new back/forward buttons landed that the dropmarker menu went both forward and backward. This was even more confusing because it's next to the forward button, and I was thinking "where's the back menu?".

My little suggestion was that the dropmarker have both up and down arrows, to make it clear that you can navigate in either direction.

Yes, this is not "standard" UI... you'd probably want to make the menu drop "sideways" and have your current history position next to the mouse horizontally, instead of dropping down.
