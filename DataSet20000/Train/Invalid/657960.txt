Hovered link URLs should be displayed in the Add-on Bar if visible

Firefox 4.0 has opted to follow the pack by hiding the status bar by default and showing hovered link URLs in a popup in one of the lower corners. This is fine, but when the status bar, now called the "Add-on bar" is shown, there is a vast quantity of wasted space at the left side, which could be used to show hovered link URLs in, as it did in Firefox 3.6-.

The whole objective of removing the status bar was to reduce the browser's UI footprint, was it not? When it's showing anyway, using this wasted space will reduce its UI footprint further.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Add-on Bar
2. Move the mouse over a link.

Actual Results:  
A URL popup is shown just above the Add-on Bar.

Expected Results:  
The URL should be displayed inside the Add-on Bar.
