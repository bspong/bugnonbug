I came across this site, and noticed Firefox spontaneously unmaximizes the main
browser window.

I read the Mozilla Web Developer FAQ and from what I can tell, that page is
loading in Quirks mode, but that's still no reason for it to have any bearing on
whether or not Firefox is maximized.

I see nothing in that source that would cause such behavior to occur.

Just thought I'd let you know before you released 1.0 Final.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. View the page.

Actual Results:  
The browser window unmaximized itself.

Expected Results:  
Stayed maximized.
