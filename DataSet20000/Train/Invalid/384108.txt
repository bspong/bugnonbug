Clicking a link in RSSBandit opens FF with the wrong URL
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9a6pre) Gecko/20070610 Minefield/3.0a6pre

I use a feed reader called RSS Bandit on Windows (http://www.rssbandit.org/).  When viewing Microsoft Knowledgebase RSS feeds, when I click on a link in the feed then Firefox (the default browser) has an incorrect query.  It's hard to explain, so I'll attach a test case.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open test case in Minefield
2. Click on the link
3. Note the incorrect query part
Actual Results:  
Query part is incorrect, even though it's correct in the source of the test case.

Minefield goes to http://support.microsoft.com/kb#3694530316919147932, but the actual link is http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;938134&sd=rss&spid=3198


Expected Results:  
Parse link correctly?

This problem does not occur in FF 2.0.0.4; I believe it started happening around a month ago, but I'm not positive.
