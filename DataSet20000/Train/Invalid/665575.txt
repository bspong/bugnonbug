GCLI startup/shutdown functions might be un-necessary
Questions:

- Does it still make sense to have startup/shutdown functions?
  (The idea from bespin was that things could be dynamically pluggable),
  however
  - this is more of a top level thing, so pluggability isn't the same
  - we might be able to do this with Domains anyway
  - it makes things harder without a concrete usecase

  In summary - we probably don't need startup/shutdown functions.

- There is initialization that needs to take place in the correct order
  How should we arrange for that to happen?
