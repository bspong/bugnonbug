"The proxy server is refusing connections & problem loading page", This is what comes on the screen when I try to open Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla 5.0

I can't use my Firefox browser at all. It won't even load the page. I was hoping to get a fix for this. I access my email and spam filter through my mozilla and I can't extract the emails because the page won't open. I did recently try to download updates for Firefox and Thunderbird and shortly after that we couldn't open the Firefox at all. Im' having to use Internet Explorer to do everything and I hate it. Please help...I'm desperate!

Reproducible: Always

1.Click on Firefox icon
2.It goes to what would be the Firefox page. The Firefox icon is in the corner on the blue bar
3.It is blank with a box in the middle of the page that says"The proxy server is refusing connections.



Expected Results:  
The browser should open the page and allow me to access the internet and when I want to deliver and delete emails through my spamfilter
