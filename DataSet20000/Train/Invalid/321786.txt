firefox locked up, had to create new profile, lost my bookmarks because of this

the summary really says it all.. Firefox locked up on a site, which was the first time it happened. It was causing other things to lock up when trying to go to them. I closed firefox, and then tried to reopen. the 'default' profile was 'active' and so couldn't use it, so had to create a new one. Now that I've done it, I cannot access the previous bookmarks on the profile.
When going into the program files\mozilla firefox\......... I cannot find anything about profiles or bookmarks there to try and find them. What do I do?

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. find a page that just continues 'searching' without the results coming up.
2. close firefox
3. try opening again




annoyed that I lost all my saved bookmarks. I would love to know how to get them back if possible... or reload the initial 'default' profile.
