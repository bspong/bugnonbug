Plugins such as Flash player appear above page elements as raised by js/dhtml

When raising a page element via DHTML or javascript, it sometimes appears "below" a plug-in.  This is especially annoying using sites such as facebook which make extensive use of flash-based ads and dynamic pop-ups (such as the facebook notifications) via js/dhtml.  I've seen this with yahoo email once or twice, too - any site with plug-ins.  

The fix would be to have page elements appear "above" plug-in elements.  


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit a page with dhtml/js "pop-ups" (not pop-up windows, but page elements which appear when triggering them.)  
2.See pop-up element appear underneath flash or other plug-in element, rendering the pop-up page element unuseable.  



Expected Results:  
It seems that it would be more user-friendly to have triggered page elements appear above plug-in elements.
