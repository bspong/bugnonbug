Certain RSS feed titles using special characters show up improperly

There are certain RSS feeds (one in particular is http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/atom.xml) that cause Firefox to display some of the titles improperly. This seems to occur when the title contains characters such as an ampersand, single quote, double quote, etc... For example, there was a recent title called "Great black & white, New York at night, & more" and it showed up in the RSS live bookmark as "Great black &amp; white, New York at night, &amp; more". I also see things like &quot; in titles that use quotes.

These HTML encodings should be auto converted to the appropriate character in the RSS live bookmark when it is displayed in Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add an RSS feed as a live bookmark (you can use the following, where I've seen the issue occur: http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/atom.xml)
2. Look for a title within the feed that has &amp; or &quot;

Actual Results:  
Instead of seeing the actual character (i.e. &, ", '), I see the HTML encoding instead.

Expected Results:  
I expect that these special characters are AUTO converted to the correct character in the title that is displayed within Firefox instead of the HTML encoded version.

PLEASE FIX THIS! :-)
