1. Too hard to move bookmarks around. It used to be simple but now is a disaster and so confusing that I now put bookmarks into apple folders and click on them! What a mess!
2. Old way of bookmark going to bottom of list was good. New system of forcing into unsorted bookmark file is a mess.
3. You guys have to fix this on your own into a simpler system like it used to be. There is no way in a bug list I can explain it all. Just use it... it is bumbling mess!
