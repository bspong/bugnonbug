If the image is on a file server "//fileserver/foldername/image.jpg"  the <img src="//fileserver/foldername/image.jpg"> does not work and displays a broken image. This feature works in IE and Netscape.

I have noticed some web sites where the images do not show in Fire Fox, I believe this is most likely the reason why. I will add comments to this when I find some public examples.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.create a image tag <img scr="\\fileserver\folder\filename.jpg">
2.view it in IE, then in Fire Fox.
3.Scream and swear!

Actual Results:  
Blood pressure rises!

Expected Results:  
viewable image.

display image in html.
