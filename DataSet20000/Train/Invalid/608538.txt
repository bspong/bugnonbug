Set app tabs as home pages

Because many users have app tabs open frequently, I think they should be able to be set as homepages. For example, in the options menu, one should be able to set "apptab:http://www.google.com|apptab:http://mail.google.com|http://reader.google.com"

Gmail and Google would be opened in app tabs, and Reader would be opened in a regular tab. Also, if a user has app tabs open and clicks "Use Current Pages" in the options menu, it will be given the app tab identifier.

I think this would bring more usability to app tabs, so they don't have to be set every session.

Reproducible: Always
