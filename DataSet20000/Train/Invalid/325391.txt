Possible memory leak with extended browsing - maybe MySpace?

Over an extended browing session (several hours) I am getting consistent error messages combined with heavt memory usage. The error message I get is "The procedure entry point ?Alloc@nsMemory@@SAPAXI@Z could not be located in the dynamic link library xpcom.dll" along with a current memory usage of 89K and climbing. 

I can't say if there was a specific event that caused the problem. I was browsing MySpace.com when the error started popping up on almost every page view. I've only got two tabs open but I *have* been listening to streaming audio via the Flash players on MySpace URLs over the last two hours.

Just seems that opening and closing tabs over an extended period of time, paging back and forth, and utilizing various streaming technologies has caused a leak somewhere. 

Closing Firefox and reopening gets me back to square one with low memory usage.
