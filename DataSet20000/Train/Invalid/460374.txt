All certificates show not trusted - get error code (MITM in-the-wild)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1b1) Gecko/20081007 Firefox/3.1b1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1b1) Gecko/20081007 Firefox/3.1b1

ALL web pages I have to sign in to (or sometimes just visit) say this and I have to manually add the certificate by:
1. Clicking on the blue wording at the bottom
2. clicking on the add exception button
3. click get certificate
4. confirm the certificate

Once I do this, it does not pop back up for that specific page, but it is quite annoying! I am using the firefox 3.1, but it did this with 3.0 and before. I am using wireless internet (over an unsecured wireless network - basically bumming). I am also using Windows XP and I formatted my hard drive last night because I got a bug. So it's like I'm using a brand new computer.
It did this for facebook, myspace, hotmail, my college's network, and more.



secure.wikimedia.org uses an invalid security certificate.

The certificate is not trusted because it is self signed.

(Error code: sec_error_ca_cert_invalid)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Logging in to a website that I haven't visited previously (ever)
2. It doesn't happen again for that specific web site after I confirm exception
3.
Actual Results:  
It gives me a page load error, and says Secure Connection Failed. I have to confirm certificate exception

Doesn't happen again for that specific website I added an exception to.

Expected Results:  
The page shouldn't pop up EVERY time I visit a new page to log in to. It should go straight to the log in page!

I don't think the version has anything to do with it. I've used 3.1 beta and before and get the same results. I have also formatted my hard drive, so my computer is like new. I downloaded Mozilla like new. I am not using any themes.
