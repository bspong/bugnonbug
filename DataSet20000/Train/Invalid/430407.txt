Flash embed is not recognized as expected

I read a website with a simple flash embed. Firefox does not recognize it as expected. Instead, it prompted me to install a new plugin. I click and try to install as Firefox suggested (thou I already had Flash installed). After a short while of checking, Firefox told me that it is an "Unknown external application (application/octet-stream)" 

The HTML might not be standard, but it is common. I've seen it a lots of time in Firefox. The HTML below is the code of the flash embed.

<!-- html example begin -->
<div class="sideitem">
	<center>
 <embed src="http://fongyou.mysinablog.com/resserver.php?resource=1101298-mikuclock.swf" width="180" height="135"> </embed>
</center>

</div>	  
<!-- html example end -->

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the URL I sent you.
2. Check it out.
Actual Results:
