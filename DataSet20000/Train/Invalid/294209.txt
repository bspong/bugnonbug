User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

    Firefox has a serious dent when it comes to loading webpages! Firefox needs
to load webpages much more organized. By organized I mean that it should load
data(navigation bars and ads) at the margin that it is supposed to be in. 

   For example, if I load www.timesofindia.com, the navigation bars and ads
adjusts atleast 5X before it is completly settled. This doesn't happen in IE. 

   This bug plays a Vital role for efficiency. Since the webpages are constantly
loading and readjusting no one can click the links because by the time you do,
it moves somewhere else. 
    Although sites like yahoo.com load corectly, there are countless others that
don't www.timesofindia.com and sites with lots of navigations bars and side ads

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. goto www.timesfoindia.com
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
The texts and links move constantly before settling down

Expected Results:  
All the frames, navigation bars and side ads load at the properspot (like in IE)

Only some websites load this way ( i can't think of more websites right now but
will update them soon) but you can try www.newgrounds.com but it's the most
appropiate site
