VMWare Infrastructure is a software that allows the user to remotely connect to virtual machines (http://www.vmware.com).

Having installed it, the logon credentials next to the Login Name and Password fields do not seem to be recognized.  The toolbar is not displayed the first time either.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install VMWare Server.  
2. Go to the logon which is commonly https://<computer name>:8333/ui/# or 
   http://<computer name>:8222/ui/#
3.Update user name and password to logon.

These are usually the OS logon credentials on the hosting <computer name>.  In my case I use the Administrator logon.
Actual Results:  
Password manager does not prompt to remember password.  Password is not automatically retrieved upon subsequent logons.

Expected Results:  
Password manager prompts for password as other websites.
