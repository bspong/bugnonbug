text shadow implementation on firebug menus screenshot

why does setting up a lightweight theme, affect the text shadowing to the Firebug menu items?  

see screenshot

Repro:
1) install firebug 1.4.5
2) apply any lightweight personas
3) Open firebug
4) Verify menu item has the text-shadow implementation from lightweight themes
5) Verify setting theme back to default, will restore the menu items to non-shadowed.

Expected:
- text-shadow implementation shouldnt affect firebug's menu text
