  If you have too many entries on the download toolbar (the bar on the bottom of
the Firebird chrome that shows you your download history) then you can loose
your right-side scroll bar and even the right side of web pages.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download a few dozen files.
2.At some point, when the individual items cannot be compressed any more, the
browser will start "pushing" the entries out to te right.
3.when this happens, you will no longer be able to view the page scroll bar or
the rightmost side of web pages, making navigation difficult.

Actual Results:  
  This happened to me after a few weeks of downloding files and not clearing the
downloads toolbar at the bottom of the browser window.

Expected Results:  
When the bar fills up and each entry there cannot be compressed any further, the
browser should either:

  1) Start deleting entries from the left side of the toolbar (oldest entries).
  2) Give a warning that the toolbar is full and allow the user to manually
keep/remove entries from the toolbar
