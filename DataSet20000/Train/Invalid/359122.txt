In previous versions of Firefox, clicking the 'home' button in the toolbar returned you to the homepage, whilst holding down shift or ctrl at the same time opened it in a new window or new tab, respectively.

In v2.0, a new preference was added: 'open the home page' (which I have set to 'into current tab').  With this setting, clicking and shift-clicking work as before, however ctrl-clicking no longer works.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Ctrl-click on the 'home' button in the toolbar (with home page set to open in current tab).
Actual Results:  
Opens in current tab (preference overrides use of ctrl key)

Expected Results:  
Opens in new tab (use of ctrl key overrides preference)
