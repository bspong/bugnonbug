Typing alphabet number combination in address bar goes to seemingly random sites

If in the address bar I type an alphabet followed by space followed by a number, the browser goes to seemingly random websites.

For example, if I type a 22
it takes me to http://www.opto22.com/
If I type b 20202
it takes me to http://www.partminer.com/pagedetail/5741/35

Why does this happen? Is it supposed to work like this? 

I am NOT using a proxy server. I have direct connection to the web.

Also I am thinking of some way to tweak this so that typing b <number> goes to my local bugzilla site and shows me bug number <number>
