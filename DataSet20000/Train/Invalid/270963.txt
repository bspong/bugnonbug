In the above URL the two small scores (triplets and duplets) display but the
larger ones (Albinoni and Bach) do not. I get messages saying the scores did not
load correctly, try again, but reloading gives the same problem again.

Int Explorer shows all the scores correctly.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the URL. (If you haven't got the Scorch plug-in, get, install, re-start
and load URL again)
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Problem as described.

Expected Results:  
Show all scores.
