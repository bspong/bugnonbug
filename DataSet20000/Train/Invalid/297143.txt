Possible security flaw in handling of code...

Story: I started running IIS and wanted to put up a web page, but I'm a 'n00b'
as they say. I made a bunch of errors, mostly in putting ending tags (IE I put
"<title> fdshesjfhesjkdsf" WITHOUT the "</title>" ending tag). Well, I could
still view the page perfectly, but people using IE could not. I eventually fixed
the problem, but it occured to me: if it's running bad code, isn't that a
security flaw? Maybe I'm wrong, but if the code is bad, shouldn't it display an
error, instead of a fine site. 

P.S. Although I fixed the error on my site, I've deleted the '</title>' tag
intentionally, to reproduce the error, just for you guys.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Access the site via Mozilla. It works! (read the source code!)
2. Access the site via IE. (And read source code)

Actual Results:  
The page displayed in Mozilla fine. But in Internet Explorer, it didn't display
at all. But you could read the source code in IE still.

Note: Others got this error as well when viewing my site.

Expected Results:  
I'm not an expert but I ASSUME that if the site has bad code, the browser should
give an error message instead of automagically displaying the site.
