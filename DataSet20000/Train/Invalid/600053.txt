I get this when i try to connect to my router, removing the certificate from the certificate store does not change the problem, the only way to fix so far is uninstall firefox and install again with a clean profile, just removing the profile does not solve the problem.  It happens on both my laptop and desktop as well as my work PC:

An error occurred during a connection to 192.168.1.10:10443.

You have received an invalid certificate.  Please contact the server administrator or email correspondent and give them the following information:

Your certificate contains the same serial number as another certificate issued by the certificate authority.  Please get a new certificate containing a unique serial number.
