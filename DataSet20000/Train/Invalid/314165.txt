Just tried the 1.5 branch, and found that autocomplete is totally broken. I can no longer navigate the autocomplete dropdown using keyboard. Autocomplete becomes totally unusable for me, hence severity=major. It happens to any autocomplete, including urlbar and html textbox.

Unlike bug 300762 or bug 314133, mouse works. Trying out the test case in bug 311676 gives another result. Dupe me please!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto urlbar.
2. Type "s", and note that "http://slashdot.org/" is the first entry.
3. Type "down arrow".
4. Type "down arrow".
Actual Results:  
After step 3, urlbar shows "slashdot.org/" and focus is at urlbar.
Step 4 flickers the autocomplete dropdown w/o changing anything.

Expected Results:  
After step 3, urlbar shows "slashdot.org/" and focus is at the 1st item of autocomplete dropdown.
After step 4, focus is at 2nd item of autocomplete dropdown, while urlbar shows the respective content.

Running Ubuntu Breezy. Reproducible in Oct 3 branch build (the earliest 1.5 branch build I can find). Also tried Oct 12, 20, 28 nightlies and rc1 test builds.
