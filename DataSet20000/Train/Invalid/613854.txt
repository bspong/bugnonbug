I was trying to access a site called minyanville when firefox stopped working and gave the above error message.  Now the only site that I access often that works is https://www.cbcfcu.org/home/home and all pages related to that site.  This is a home computer and as far as I know I do not have a proxy server.  I am not a very computer literate person.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Try accessing any site except https://www.cbcfcu.org/home/home
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
I got the following message:

The proxy server is refusing connections

      

      
      
      

      
        
        

          

Firefox is configured to use a proxy server that is refusing connections.

        
        


    *   Check the proxy settings to make sure that they are correct.

    *   Contact your network administrator to make sure the proxy server is
          working.




        
        
      


      
      

Expected Results:  
The browser should have provided access to the desired site.

Chrome and internet explorer appear to work good.  I tried reinstalling Firefox and that didn't work.
