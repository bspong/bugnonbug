Often, when a new point release, especially a new beta, pre, etc. release comes out, extensions are automatically disabled, or new extensions can't be installed until they are upgraded to the latest point release of Firefox.

This forces to the user to choose between the latest release of the browser, or not being able to use extensions.

It would be very useful to have a UI way to let the user override the maxVersion setting in the extension.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Upgrade the browser to a recent build.
2. Notice how extensions are disabled automatically.
Actual Results:  
Extensions are disabled with no possibility for the user to tell the browser to keep the extensions anyway.

Expected Results:  
The extension installer should ask if the (seemingly) incompatible extensions should be installed anyway.
