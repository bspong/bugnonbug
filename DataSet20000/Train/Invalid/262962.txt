 Hi,

 We tried to use Mozilla Firefox for our website. Our website is  released 
based on mod_rewrite technology.
 
 when we came to our site we can see REQUEST_URI - /index.php? 
 instead of /index/ 
 also, when we tried to visit to site by link /index/somelnk/ 
 Firefox give us message that /index/somelnk not found...

 P.S. It works for all browsers, except Firefox
