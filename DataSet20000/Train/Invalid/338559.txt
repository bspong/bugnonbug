An image file called ad.gif is not always displayed. For example in the Google image search result page for ad.gif, click on any image labeled ad.gif, and then on the back button. The image has been replaced by white space!

When testing locally I find that when an HTML refers to an image called ad.gif (or ad.png) in the SAME directory (<IMG SRC="ad.gif">), the image appears okay. If it is ANOTHER directory (<IMG SRC=images/ad.gif">), it is replaced by white space.

Thinking it might be connected with the ad blocker, I tested this with a clean profile.

1. http://images.google.com/images?q=ad.gif&hl=en&btnG=Search+Images
2. click on any image called "ad.gif" (or "AD.gif")

Actual Results:  
ad.gif displays as white space
