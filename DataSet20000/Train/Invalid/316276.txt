When you middleclick a tab and hold your click it will close the tab after a random time. It should only close it after you release the mouse button.

As it's a random time, this gives problems. When you close a tab by middleclicking, it might register two middleclicks and also close the next tab.

Might be related: holding middleclick button on a normal webpage makes the autoscroll image jump around the webpage, like it's sending the middleclick button event again.

I tested this on WinXP with touchpad, and the same box with a logitech optical mouse.
Also tested on Win98 box with normal mouse and a second WinXP box with another mouse.
It all gives the same problems (1.5rc2 is affected, 1.0.7 not).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move mouse to tab
2. Press middle mouse button, but don't release it

Actual Results:  
After a random time, the tab closes.

Expected Results:  
It should only close on releasing the middle mouse button, preferably when the mouse is still hovering the tab.
