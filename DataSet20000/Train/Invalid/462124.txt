In Firefox 3.1b2pre I am unable to drag any images from inside the browser window to the desktop, or any other folder to save them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a page containing images.
2. Click and hold the mouse button down and move it outside the window.
3. Nothing happens, there is not even an indication that the image is being moved.
