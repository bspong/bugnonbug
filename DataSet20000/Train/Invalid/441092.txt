With FF3, the tab bar _always_ smooth scrolls. This is regardless of the settings of the general.smoothscroll and toolkit.scrollbox.smoothscroll settings (I have both disabled -- but, why are there two?)

It annoys me; I can't scroll through them quickly or by an amount that I want, they take time to "stop", the typical processor usage issues (I prefer it go to other apps), I can't pause for a quarter second and see where I am, tabs scroll to a different place than where I expect them to stop...

I'd say FF3 tabbar really needs to respect smoothscroll settings.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open more than a screenfull of tabs
2.scroll
