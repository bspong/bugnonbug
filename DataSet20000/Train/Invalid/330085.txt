forward and back button crash analysis
we need some tools and work to analyze forward and back button crashes out of the talkback data.  this bug replaces an old problem in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=56086 but it appears other problems still exist looking at quick searching of talkback comment data.

firefox 1.5 shows 200+ crashes with the comment "back button"

and 5 for "forward button"

any continuing work on bfcache or cache optimization, or history navigation in general would benefit from reports that keep an eye on crashes with these kinds of comments.   

It would be good to sort and categorize the stack traces by signature to providde a better grouping than time of crashed base sorting.

lets file dependancy bug on anything that turns up out of analysis of the current data in talkback
