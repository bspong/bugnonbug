Whenever I attempt to open a pdf using Adobe 7 Professional, I get an error
message that says,"Adobe Acrobat has encountered a problem and must close now."
It give the option to "debug," "send a report" or to close. It doesn't matter
which button you choose, it will freeze the computer and I have to reboot. When
I use Internet Explorer, the Adobe pdf open and close fine with no error
message. Please have someone work on this issue. Seems several others are having
the same difficulty.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox web browser
2. Surf the web unti you find a site with a pdf that you need to open
3. When attempt to open pdf, screen and mouse fail to respond to input          
   instructions
4. Computer freezes.

Actual Results:  
Redundant info.

Expected Results:  
1. Allowed pdf to be opened, read, saved and then close to return to web surfing.

This seems to have occurred after updating from Adobe Reader 6 to 7. When I
updated my system and went to Adobe 7 Professional, there has been no change in
the results.
