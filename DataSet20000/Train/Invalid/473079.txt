You don't have access to write to the installation directory
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Media Center PC 5.0; .NET CLR 3.0.04506)

When trying to install Firefox 3.0.5 I got a dialog box that said, “You don't have access to write to the installation directory” “Click Okay to write to a different directory.” 

Yet when I try to create a different folder I get the same message. 

I am the only owner/user on this laptop.
