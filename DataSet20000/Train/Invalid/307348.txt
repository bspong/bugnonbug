I press OK and after alert disappears nothing happens. The browser doesn't 
work. Never had any difficulty with 1.0.4. I have tried uninstalling and re-
installing and also changing profile but the problem persists.

Reproducible: Always

1.Click on Mozilla Firefox Icon

Actual Results:  
Browser tried to open said start up page could not be found and to check 
address (it is correct)

Expected Results:  
It should have found the start page for mozilla or google or whatever and 
opened it up. It occurs both with the default theme and with a new profile.
