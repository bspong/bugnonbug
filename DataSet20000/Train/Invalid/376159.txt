pop up windows cause a leak of some sort with browser.js and bookmarmenu.js
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3

Note: anycracks.com contains pornographic images and it should be considered by you carefully whether or not you believe this perhaps minor issue is worth going to that site to see the pornographic ads there just to fix it.

Popup's from anycracks.com produce a leak according to my leak plugin.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to anycracks.com

2. Click on one of the listed programs that supposedly has a crack or serial for it.

3. Wait for the leak plugin to pop up a window and notify you of a leak. One of them deal with a "browser.js". I forgot the other name of the other js file it told me about.
Actual Results:  
A leak occurs and is associated with two java script files.

Expected Results:  
For no leak to occur.

So much for being sure I'd report no more bugs. You may need the leak plugin on firefox's addons section to see what I'm talking about unless you are using something more advanced or different that I don't know about.

Seeya guys.
