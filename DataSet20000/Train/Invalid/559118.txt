If I happen to be streaming a radio station or watching a video online and then try to use a VOIP program like GTalk or Skype, everything stops working.  Media won't play (even things on YouTube), the VOIP stops working, and often the browser stop working, telling me it's "already open."  I have to reintall all programs.  This has happened four times on two computers. 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Stream a radio station (e.g. KUHF listen online)
2. Log into a secure site, or make a VOIP phone call
3. Or, recieve a phone call
4. Freeze!  Crash!  
5. Reload skype, uninstall and reinstall firefox.
6. restart computer
7. things usually ok again. 
Actual Results:  
things are ok for a few days.  I try to keep these taskts seperate, but it's not always possible, or too inconvienent to remember.

Expected Results:  
Been able to multi task.

It seems to also be linked to updating to the latest version of Firefox.

At first, it seemed to happen for no reason, but when it kept happening during my afternoons when I use Skype, and then again during a GTalk conversation, all times I had been listening to the radio and then paused/turned it off for the phone call, but at that moment, the VOIP programs stopped working.
