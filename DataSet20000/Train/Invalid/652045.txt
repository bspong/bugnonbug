Aurora download file broken, no file found when executing "firefox"

I have downloaded and redownloaded the aurora bzip. When executing the file firefox in terminal it tells me firefox-bin is not found, when it's right there in front of me.

Occurs in Ubuntu 10.10 installed, Linux Mint 10 Live CD and Linux Mint installed. So it seems either its a bug in all of Ubuntu (which Mint is made from) or simply a problem with the downloadable bzip of Aurora. I can't see that it's a problem with Ubuntu. I've never encountered this before.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download Aurora
2.Untar it
3.In terminal, execute ./firefox
4. See that firefox-bin is not found but is there
Actual Results:  
Firefox-bin is missing according to the terminal, but it's there.

Expected Results:  
Aurora executes
