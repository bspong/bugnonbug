When I open up more than 10 tabs at a time the browser seems to use about 150,000 mb of ram. And also the browser will stop rendering for about 2-5 seconds and then  return to rendering.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Find site with many pictures
2.open up each picture with a diffrent tab
3.Stop when you have opened about 10-20 windows.



Expected Results:  
Used less system memory. Also it should not become unresponsive for 2-5 seconds
