With firefox 3.5.6 specific yahoo pages are not rendered correctly
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091201 Firefox/3.5.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I updated to FF 3.5.6 recently
My home page is news.yahoo.com
Within the last 48 hours this page and all subordinate page are not rendered right. The first 4 or 5 lines of the page are missing. Firebug identifies errors.

I just noticed today that there is a new (to me anyway) link to "Update to IE8" in the top block of the news.yahoo.com page. When you go to other pages such as the finance news, FF renders everything fine.

Problem is annoyin because there's no easy way out of the new.yahoo.com page stack.
 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load news.yahoo.com with 3.5.6 and top of page is missing
Using another maching with older version of Firefox, everything is OK
2.
3.
