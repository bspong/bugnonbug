A problem with CSS. The links show up white on my site even when I label the codes with a class.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2

Technically that is what's supposed to happen.  But I classified the links so
that the links I have in my toolbar are white (I labeled them CLASS="1") and the
links on the bottom of my site are teal (I didn't label them).  
 Firefox might not differantiate between classes in Cascading Stylesheets either
that or Firefox automatically labels the codes if it have not found a label. 
(Sorry for using the word label so much) 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Refresh.
2.Tried a different page.
3.Went offline then online then refreshed

Actual Results:  
Nothing have changed.

Expected Results:  
The links on my site supposed to be teal.     

I didn't encounter this problem when I was using IE.
