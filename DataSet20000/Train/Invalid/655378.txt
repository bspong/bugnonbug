Channel Switcher

I have been testing the new Channel Switcher between Aurora and Beta.
Every time I switch back and forth between the 2, it looks as though it is downloading and update.
Another FF tester said he thought it should only do that on the first switch.
This is doing it every time.
Is this actually downloading an update or is it just loading the other build?
If it's loading, then JMO the wording should be changed.
If this isn't a bug, my apologies. New to this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Help, About Aurora
2. Click Change, choose Beta
3. Says downloading
4. Then click Apply and Update.
You are now on Beta.
You can repeat the steps above and it always says Downloading.


Expected Results:  
I would expect to see Downloading an Update on the first switch back and forth, but not on every subsequent switch during the same session.
The wording should maybe be Loading.
