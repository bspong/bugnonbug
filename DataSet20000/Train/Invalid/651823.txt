When I click in a web page, Firefox puts always the cursor in that position, even if that position isn't editable.
This provokes that doesn't work correctly the Home and End keys. Instead to go to the beginning or end of document, it goes to the beginning or end of phrase of the cursor position.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any web page with text.
2. Click in a middle of paragraph.
3. Press Home or End key.
Actual Results:  
It goes to the beginning or end of phrase of the cursor position.

Expected Results:  
It goes to the beginning or end of web page.
