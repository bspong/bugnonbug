With Nightly builds dated after Feb 22, when I do Tools Options it does not come up.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0+

Tools options with earlier versions will let you set the options.
With the latest version, it comes up with a little box at the top with

General Privacy Content Tabs Downloads Advanced.

Just those words no buttons or tabs. 

If the screen is larger than 800x600, you can also see OK and Cancel buttons
in the lower right hand side (with 800 x 600 it is off the screen).

You can press Enter or click ok if you can see it to continue.

Going back to the 22nd version that I have, it works fine, or going to the
released version, but the nighly builds still show the same problem. Even tried
completely removing Firefox, and same results.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Tools
2. Options
3.

Actual Results:  
Get what should be the tab buttons at top, and OK/Cancel, but no window to update
any of the options.

Expected Results:  
To have the Options screen show up with all the options.

I've download a number of nightly builds to see if it has been fixed, but still
get the same results.
