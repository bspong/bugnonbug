Everytime when I close the last window of Firefox the Vista Crash reported states that firefox has encountered an error and should be closed.

As a side effect, sometimes the opened tabs aren't saved and won't be reopened on the next startup.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close the last firefox window
2. See the crash reporter come up.
Actual Results:  
The Windows Vista Crash Reporter comes up and states that Firefox has encountered an error and has to be stopped.

Expected Results:  
Close normally without crashing.

Sometimes the opened tabs aren't saved either, I guess this is a side effect of the vista error reporter terminating the process before the saving of the tabs is finished.
