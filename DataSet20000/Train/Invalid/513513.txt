Firefox Upgrade causes Extensions to be disabled, while after re-installing the extension/addon, it works fine.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2

Bad example:  When upgrading to firefox 3.5.2 it listed several addons as not compatiable with the new version.  After the upgrade each of those extensions were disabled.  Removing and then re-installing of the extensions in Firefox 3.5.2 allowed them to work as normal.

Good example:  The extensions are not marked as not compatible.

Other notes:  What kind of criteria does the update checker use to identify an addon or extension as not being compatible with the new version?  I mention this so I can determine if the issue is with my custom addon and not a bug.

I post here to cover all bases. Knowing the criteria will help me know where to start looking.

Reproducible: Always
