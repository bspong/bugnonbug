*** NOT A BUG ***  I have a question.

When I checked [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=blocking2:9] at 11:00 AM EST, there were still 48 blocking bugs for Beta 9.  Now, at 7:00 PM EST, there are only SEVEN listed.

Have 41 bugs actually been fixed in an eight hour time period, or are these bugs not being fixed for Beta 9?  There still isn't anything listed under "?quicksearch=blocking2:10".

Also, explain to me why Minefield is currently in the 4.0 Beta 9 state, but bug 607539 is still listed under "?quicksearch=blocking2:8".

Reproducible: Always
