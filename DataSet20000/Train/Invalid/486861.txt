URL History Cannot Be Cleared By Any Means

     I am using Firefox 3.0.8 for Windows XP.  I cannot clear the URL history from the URL bar by any means.  I have tried the following:
1)Uncheck "Keep my history for (X) number of days".
2)Check "Keep my history of (X) number of days" and set value to zero.
3)Set the Options so that Private Data is cleared each time Firefox is closed.
4)Manually select "Clear Private Data" from the Tools menu.
5)Go to Control Panel in Windows XP.  Clear all browsing history.
   None of the above works.  The problem began with Firefox 3.
    

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Browse
2.Set Firefox to clear Private Data upon closing and not to keep any history at all. 
3. Manually clear Private Data.
4. Close and re-open Firefox.
5. Left click on down arrow to view URL history in URL bar.

Actual Results:  
URL history not cleared.

Expected Results:  
URL history should be cleared.

The offending URL history seems to be a combination of sites I recently visited and sites that I have bookmarked.
