Firefox does not work with firewall clients such as Zone Alarm
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050225 Firefox/1.0.1

Zone Alarm prevents java applets, animated ads, additional popups, embedded
flash and misc applications from being launched.  Despite running it and
entering in Firefox as a new program to recognize, it does not work.  Please advise.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch Zone Alarm
2.Go to a site with animated banners or java/flash based ads such as ESPN.com or
AL4A.com
3.Using Internet Explorer, you get just the basic HTML script (main images and
links) and white spaces in place of ads, as well as supressing those scrolling
java ads.  This does not occur on Firefox.

Actual Results:  
Additional crap from advertisers stored in my cache, popups, etc.

Expected Results:  
Block them.
