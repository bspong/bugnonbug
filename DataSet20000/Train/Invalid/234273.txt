Toolbars shake as you go from site to site (experienced with Phoenix Neo skin)

As you go from site to site, the toolbars shake together as you switch sites.

I think the problem has to do with the icon for the loading animation. The shift
occurs only when a site is loading. When the loading stops (As does the
animation), the toolbars return to normal.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open FireFox (After installation)
2. Surf the web
Actual Results:  
Toolbars shift (probably as a result of different scaling for the icons in the
skin).

Expected Results:  
Toolbars should have remained still.
