I dunno what you hippies use all that google money for, but im sure it involes sticking your cocks in each other's asses.  you guys have a long way to go to beat internet explorer.

fix the damn keyboard problems, why does the caret not show in edit boxes? why does apostrophe bring up the search box?  how come copy and paste doesn't always work?  

these are the basics of the browser.  some ppl actually use browsers for real work not just browsing gay porn.
