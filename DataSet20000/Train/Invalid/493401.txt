Hi,
This is a complete flash site.
So in the flash I have addressed the links this way:
.\support.html
For instance...
This hyperlink will open "support.html" from the current path/location...
This .swf flash will work in all browsers but in FireFox...
In FireFox it redirects to an invalid URL...
Please open www.us-vpn.org and from contact support page, click the hyperlink and see for yourself.
Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open www.us-vpn.org.
2. Open Support page.
3. There a link named "For technical support please click here" Click on it both in FireFox and InternetExplorer...
FireFox won't open the correct URL, but IE and all other browsers do...
Actual Results:  
It redirects to an invalid URL

Expected Results:  
Redirect to correct URL !!!

That's it...
