The circular page loading progress graph on tabs, which was extremely clear and easy to understand, is now missing. 

There is now a thin dim line under the tab icon that is very difficult to see. Hopefully this is a bug and not a design change. The circular page loading graph on tabs was perfect for understanding load progress.
