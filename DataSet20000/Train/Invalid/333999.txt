In my cookie preferences I have decided to allow sites to set cookies and only originating sites. In my exceptions I have blocked all cookies that match *doubleclick* pattern. 

When I visit www.cbc.ca I get a cookie from doubleclick. (Yes, they may use IFrame or redirect trick or whatever). But my understanding of cookie exceptions   it seems is wrong. I though that if I said "Block *doubleclick*", it meant block the damn cookie from *doubleclick* no matter how it attempts to get on my computer, even if I visit www.doubleclick.com from address bar, their cookies should still be blocked, because of my exceptions setting.

If my understanding of this is wrong, then you should really provide the users with the ability to do what I want to do, and rename the misleading "Exceptions" feature to something more appropriate.

Reproducible: Always
