I was running Firefox 1.5.0.5 on my PC when after a browsing session (without upgrades prompted from Mozilla), I suddenly noticed that it was getting slower, the Firefox version ("about" tab) was back to 1.5.0.1, with the "check for updates" tab greyed...
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060124 Firefox/1.5.0.1

So I ended up with version 1.5.0.1 and it doesn't allow me to 'check for updates'. It also says that it has never been updated, but I'm sure it did 3 or 4 times, up to version 1.5.0.5 and then dropped back without notice.

This looks more like a vulnerability than a real bug, it looks like something disabled a couple features in my latest firefox browser.
I always browse as simple user, never as administrator, if that sets the rights. It happenend on a Fedora Core 3 system running kernel 2.6.12

A somewhat disappointed user.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start from 1.5.0.5
2.wait until you hit something that turns it back to 1.5.0.1 (don't know, saw it after several days).
3.and voilà, your 'check for updates' is disabled.
