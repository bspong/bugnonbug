installer fails to continue if Firefox is no longer running and complains that it's running
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6
Build Identifier: Firefox/1.0.7

If Firefox isn't running, it reports that Firefox is running, still running, and
is unable to quit it.
If Firefox is running, it terminates Firefox after you accept the prompt to quit
it, then complains that it's unable to quit it.

In both cases, the installer stops running.  At the point where it says it's
giving up, it says that the installer will quit, but it doesn't actually exit. 
Using the Close button (Red X) works, however.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
case 1:
1. Close Firefox.
2. Run the installer.
3. It complains that Firefox is still running.  Click ok to terminate Firefox.
4. It complains that Firefox is still running and the installer will quit.

case 2:
1. Start Firefox.
2. Run the installer.
3. It complains that Firefox is still running.  Click ok to terminate Firefox.
4. It complains that Firefox is still running and the installer will quit.

Actual Results:  
The installer complains that Firefox is still running, and then that it's still
running.

Expected Results:  
It should've kept running.
