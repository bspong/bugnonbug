new tabs open next to current tab, rather than at end of line

When new tabs are opened, rather than going to the end (far right) of the list as before, they now open just to the right of the current tab.  This may not even be a "problem," but just a different choice imposed on us by the new version, but having an option would be nice.  This has only occurred since I downloaded the latest version of FireFox last week.  Not a serious problem, but annoying. 


Reproducible: Always
