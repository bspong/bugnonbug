 I am not a dummy but I am also not literate in all of this process. You are
making it way to hard for the average person to report a problem. It makes using
this browser not worth the trouble.  Again my apologies but I am not sure about
which component to mark as I cannot understand your "description" of any of
them! Thank you for your time. Rita Bartlett
