Since downloading latest release, saved home page defaults to a blank page on reopen of Firefox, have tried everything I can think of, including removal and reinstallation, safe mode.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set home page
2.  Close Firefox
3. Open Firefox, home page is defaulted to blank page.
