Can no longer download from some sites, for example, www.delldock.com (for that matter, all of the dell support downloads appear to have the same issue).  If you click on the download button and select the appropriate info it requests, the download will not start.  The spinner will rotate for a brief moment and then nothing happens.  I then have to open IE and go to the same url and download it that way.

Reproducible: Always

1.Go to the following url

2.click download
3.nothing happens

Actual Results:

this is not just an issue with dell.
I have experienced this issue with other sites, such as adobe, as well
