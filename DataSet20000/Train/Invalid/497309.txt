No XSL transformation is applied to the file at the url above. However, if the file (and http://richardlight.org.uk/freddy.xsl) are put in a local folder and opened, freddy.xml is translated.

If the local file has extension html instead of xml it is also not translated by freddy.xsl.

So location of the file and extension of the file influence whether the file is translated or not.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download http://richardlight.org.uk/freddy.xsl and http://richardlight.org.uk/freddy.xml
2. Open local freddy.xml
3. Copy freddy.xml to freddy.html
4. Compare rendering of freddy.xml and freddy.html
Actual Results:  
Files do not render in the same way.

Expected Results:  
Files render in the same way.
