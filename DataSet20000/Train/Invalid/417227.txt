Hello,

I downloaded the FF3b3 and stupidly overwrote my FF2 App in the Apps directory. This resulted in the removal of the close button on the tabs. Not a massive issue and probably just my stupidity. 

However, on FF2, when I installed the Tab Mix Plus addon, it corrected the issue. Issue is still persistent on FF3

Reproducible: Always
