If an href like the following is displayed in firefox:

file://///10.13.0.1/share/dir/

Clicking on it does nothing, however pasting the url into the navigation bar and hitting the enter key causes it to display the directory listing in the browser. Is there a resons clicking on the link cannot result in the same behaviour?

Reproducible: Always
