Java app does not work, then Firefox stays in memory
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.6) Gecko/20100625 Firefox/3.6.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.6) Gecko/20100625 Firefox/3.6.6

I click on the button to display the image of a check but there is no response.  When I try to leave Firefox by clicking the x in the upper right, the window closes but task manager shows Firefox task still running.  I cannot restart Firefox unless I kill it with task manager.

Similar problem on webmail.spamcop.net when I click on button to reply or send a new message.

In both cases, some other buttons are fully functional.  Bug occurs in v3.6.x with JRE v20

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Sign on to PNC and view my transactions
2. Click on the button to view a copy of the check
3. Gotcha!
Actual Results:  
The check image does not appear.  I must use task manager to stop Firefox.

Expected Results:  
I should see the check (it works in IE8)
