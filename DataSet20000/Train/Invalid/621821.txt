Sometimes, with "When I open a link in a new tab, switch to it immediately" NOT checked, ctrl-left-clicking a link opens the new tab and changes focus. If ctrl-left-clicking in the right-most open tab, I'm switched to the newly open tab despite the setting saying not to. If on any other open tab, the new tab is opened and I'm switched to the tab one to the right of the current tab.

I've toggled the "When I open a link in a new tab, switch to it immediately" and in the other setting (On), it seems to work as expected. Then turning it back off causes the behavior to go back to the above.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Four tabs open. 
2. Ctrl-left-click on a link in the second tab from the left.

Actual Results:  
Focus moves from tab two to tab three and the new tab is opened between that tab (three) and tab four.

Expected Results:  
New tab should open between tabs two and three and focus should remain on tab two.

I have only seen this one this one machine so it may be very version/OS/hardware specific. This is my only 64-bit Windows machine, so I really don't know.
