open URL event causes new window to open instead of new tab if Mac toolbar is hidden

Clicking the oval button on the right side of the Firefox window title bar causes all of the toolbars to be hidden.  This is a standard feature of many applications under Mac OS X.

If Firefox is configured to open new tabs instead of new windows, an open URL event will cause a new tab to open instead of a new window to show the web page.  For an example of an open URL event, run Terminal.app and at the shell prompt enter the command "open http://www.google.com/".

If the toolbars are hidden when an open URL even occurs, the "new tab" preference is ingored and a new window will open to hold the web page instead.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
To demonstrate incorrect behavior:
1. In Firefox Preferences, on the "Tabs" panel, be sure a checkmark appears beside the item "Open new windows in a new tab instead".
2. Click oval button at top-right corner of the window to hide the toolbars.
3. In Terminal.app, enter this command at a shell prompt: open http://www.google.com/
4. Watch Firefox open the web page in a new window.  It should open in a new tab instead.
