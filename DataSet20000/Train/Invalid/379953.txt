I have a ajax/javascript tools which works fine on Opera, IE and Safari but breaks with Firefox. The problem comes from the fact that there is some kind of limitation in the length of a string. In any case alert(response.getElementsByTagName('contents')[0].firstChild.data) clearly show that the data has been cut (the variable string is not complete, but is only a substring of what I have passed by xml).

Reproducible: Always
