Before the current build, I was using Tab Mix Plus. When many tabs were opened, the tabs shrunk in width until only the page icon (or downloading throbber, if the page was still downloading) was visible. I'd like the option to allow tabs to get that small in the current build, as the default minimum tab width is far too wide for my preference.

Reproducible: Always
