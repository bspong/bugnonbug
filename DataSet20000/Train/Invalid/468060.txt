3. Some where along the way it must be causing something to happen that is causing the windows opened to stop rendering properly. That is they become transparent or the information is distorted. Some parts are rendered
properly, some parts are not rendered at all and other parts are just mixed up. Open any where from 0 to 18 windows at some sites and just save 0 to 30 links at each site.

4. When the problem occurs, the rendering issue can be avoided by stopping mozilla 1.7.13 or Firefox 2.0.0.11. The result of this action usually allows the remaining browser to correctly render the open windows and
thing then proceed normally. The same is true if both browser are stopped. On rare occasions both browsers to be stopped to get the problem to go away.

Actual Results:  
Browser windows are not rendered properly

Expected Results:  
Browser windows to be rendered properly
