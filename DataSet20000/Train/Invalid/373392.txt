I am the chief architect and developer for americart (www.americart.com) we offer a shopping cart service that is used by 8000 on line web stores, I get several complaints a month from shoppers who cannot complete their transaction or add items to the cart while using Firefox.  Is there someone who can help me find and fix what it is that FireFox doesn't like about our code?  The link provided will add an item to the shopping cart, (if it works) then the issue lies when the shopper enters their shipping info and credit card # (if you test it use 4111 1111 1111 1111 as your cc number) the submit button just hangs and the form never get submitted to our server.  Please help!  BTW I have not been able to duplicate this using my firefox browser.
