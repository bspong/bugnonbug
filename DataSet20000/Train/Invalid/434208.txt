When using google reader, the user can type “v” to view the selected news item in a new window.  After exactly 20 views in this manner, Firefox begins to block popups despite google.com being on the whitelist.  Clicking on a link, which automatically opens it in a new window, still works.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0. Add google.com to your popup whitelist.
1. Go to http://google.com/reader
2. Open 21 feed items (or the same feed item 21 times) using the “v” keyboard shortcut.

Actual Results:  
On the 21st time, and every subsequent time, firefox will block the popup.

Expected Results:  
Google.com is on my whitelist, firefox should not block the popup.

My crackpot theory is that there is some safeguard against excepted sites after 20 “unrequested” popups, they become block, and keypresses just need to be recognized as a “request”.  But I could be totally off.
