I am trying to get phoenity theme running on firefox on mac.
The problem is that there seems a huge skrewup in the way scrollbars are
rendered...both the main widow scrollbar as well as frame scroll bars and also
aption list scrollbar like the ones on this newbug page for... say componnent field.
I am attacing a screenshot of the problem.(btw in the themes list it says
phoenity but not 100% sure if thats the theme installed.. it might be one of the
derivatives of phoenity... but most probably it *is* phoenity)

Also on a related note.... I am not able to install all the themes.. can anybody
tell me how to fix that?

Also... a non-reproducible behaviour... after a while even the main toolbar
buttons will vanish in the newly created windows... I mean the old windows will
keep their toolbar buttons but new windows wont have any image on the toolbar
buttons (though the buttons seem to be there cause when I hover mouse over that
part of window i see the rising up buttons.. but still no images)
