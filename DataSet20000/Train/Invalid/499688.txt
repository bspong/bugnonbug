What about to add a option in a next 3 version so we can download beta from ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/ like i`m using let's say 3.0.11 and it's on ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/3.0.12-candidates so that firefox can download it or at last warn it's a beta version there,a option like "Check for beta versions" so we don't have to look all the time on ftp.
