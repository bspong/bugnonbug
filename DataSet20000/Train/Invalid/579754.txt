Firefox 3.6.6 too slow
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de; rv:1.9.2.6) Gecko/20100628 Ubuntu/10.04 (lucid) Firefox/3.6.6

I am using Firefox since many years and I like it. Since a few weeks it becomes more and more a pain waiting for FF to display pages. This happens on nearly every page. For example ot takes about 5-10 seconds between resolving the address and trying to connect. Name resolution works fine and fast on my machine. 
I have a fast DSL line and Chrome displays the same page very much faster. 
I even set up a new profile in FF and used this without any improvement.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just go to the URL and wait
2.
3.


Expected Results:  
I would expect the same spped as some time ago.

This problem may not necessarily be a bug but it is that annoying, that for the first time I downloaded another browser, Chrome did the job in normal speed.
