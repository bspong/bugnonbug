Up and Down arrow keys act identical to Left and Right arrow keys
Seen on Deer Park 1.1a 

-Go to Options (Prefs) dialog
-Use the Up and Down arrow keys to change Main Menu selection
Also:
-Go to Options | Privacy (or any category that has multiple tabs in the content)
-Tab into the content
-Use the Up and Down arrow keys to change Tab selection

tested results: The Up arrow key behaves same as the Left arrow key; it selects
the next Category/Tab to the left.  The Down arrow key behaves the same as the
Right arrow key; it selects the next Category/Tab to the right.

Expected results: I'm not sure if the above behavior is intended or a residual
effect from this winters rework of the Options dialog.  I'm also no expert on
keyboard/accessibilty functionality.  But it seems to me the Up/Down arrow keys
should either do nothing or behave the same as Tab/shift+Tab when focus is on
the Main category menu or on content Tabs in the Options dialog.
