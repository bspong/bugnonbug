Floated div floats to left of parent container instead of under it
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

A float now floats to the left of its parent container in Firefox 3.5.1. In previous versions, the float exits out of the parent container and appears under it (compare with Firefox 3 and IE7).

However, Google Chrome displays the same way that Firefox 3.5.1 does. So, was this a bug in IE/FF3 or is it a bug in FF3.5.1/Google Chrome?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Put a div inside a parent div, and float it left.
2. Put in some text and styling as a visual aide.
3. Compare the result on various browsers (FF3, FF3.5.1, IE, Chrome, etc...)
Actual Results:  
Firefox 3.5.1 puts the floated div to the left of the parent container.

Expected Results:  
Floated div appears under the parent container. I am not sure what the standard result should be, but this is a change from the way FF3 rendered.
