Hi, I observed something related to usage of Firefox memory on windows, explained detailed scenario below

1. Open firefox, browse something which you like
2. Open Taskmanager [Ctrl+shift+Esc]
3. Check the memory that was used by firefox app under Task Manager=>Processes tab
4. Try to minimize the Firefox app, observe the memory utilization in the task manager against firefox.exe.
5. observed that nothing was changed, it was same as it is when it maximized state.. 

Try to see the same behavior  with other browsers (iexplore and Chrome), you can see lot of memory optimization when the app in minimized state.. 

and I have observed the this behavour with other non microsoft applications [ex: open office], they are doing good when those apps got minimized.. I don't why we missed this?

Note: if I browsed only one URL in my FF, it's fine. I never bother about memory usage. but generally my FF always 20-30 urls opened any movement, so it eats 300-500 MB of my RAM every movement. I feel it's a bit heavy. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox, browse something which you like
2. Open Taskmanager [Ctrl+shift+Esc]
3. Check the memory that was used by firefox app under Task Manager=>Processes tab
4. Try to minimize the Firefox app, observe the memory utilization in the task manager against firefox.exe.
5. observed that nothing was changed, it was same as it is when it maximized state.. 
Actual Results:  
usage memory retained same in TaskManager 

Expected Results:  
it should reduce the memory usage when compared to maximize time like how other browsers (IE,Chrome) working.

mentioned in the details section itself.
