Flashing Cursor appearing throughout websites
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:6.0.2) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.2
Build ID: 20110902133214

Steps to reproduce:

Left click anywhere that is not a button, form field, or image link on any webpage.


Actual results:

Blinking cursor appears at location if on text, at nearest left line end if blank, or to either side of image if image is not a link. May also cause the missing of a form field as cursor can appear a half line above or below actual entry field.


Expected results:

Nothing should occur, as there is no interactivity for a simple single left click on these elements.
