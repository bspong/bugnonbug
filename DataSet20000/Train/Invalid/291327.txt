Graphics and text formatting are off.  Sometimes appear under or over other objects.

If you visit any of the above pages with Internet Explorer, the pages display
properly.  Visiting them with Firefox, you'll see that the pages are displayed
with the formatting a bit off.

For example, on http://www.accuweather.com, the words "Canada | UK & Ireland |
World" appear below the "National Overview" graphic.  With IE, they are spaced
properly and you see the complete word(s).

On http://home.netscape.com, the scrolling items just under the "Breaking" news
appear too high.  The scrolling items themselves sometimes overwrite the number
selection in the lower right corner.  Again, with IE, the spacing is correct.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.accuweather.com or http://home.netscape.com
Actual Results:  
Images are displayed a few pixels off and therefore are hidden or partially hide
other items on the same page.

Expected Results:  
Spacing should be correct.
