It looks as the change from the className attribute in an JS function has no effect to the button which is calling the function with onclick(). In other browsers this coding works perfect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.press the button from the code.

Actual Results:  
nothing

Expected Results:  
the align of the text(button) should be right
