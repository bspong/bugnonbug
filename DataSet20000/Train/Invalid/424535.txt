input colors are taken from system and usercss is ignored

Before (Firefox 2.0) it was possible to use Stylish and custom stylesheet which was changing that behaviour but on Firefox 3 all inputs usercsses are ignored.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set a dark theme on KDE (or possibly GNOME) with input elements set on black
2. Run Firefox/Minefield 3.0
3. Go to any site with forms
Actual Results:  
In Minefield 3.0b5 and probably all other betas colors for inputs (textarea, input, submit buttons etc.) are taken from system's settings. If someone (like me) have a dark theme, they are black (and web standard is that they should be white or similar). It's confusing because some webdesigners are setting dark colors on those elements. 

Expected Results:  
1) Inputs should be using default colours no matter what are the system's settings OR/AND
2) UserCSS on inputs should be working again

Included picture of Bugzilla's form as a good example how does it look. KDE 3.5.8, custom colours, Crystal theme, Minefield 3.0b5 trunk 03/22/08.
