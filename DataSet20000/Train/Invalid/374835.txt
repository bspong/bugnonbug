In the path of images is the "/" substituted by "%5c" and the images cannot be retrieved.

If i right click on the images (in that case smilies) and I get the link of the images, then the path includes "%5c" instead of "/". See the following example:

http://hforce.hf.funpic.de/homepage/smile%5Csmile_dj.gif

When I go the the page mentionend above with the IE 7, the link is like the following:

http://hforce.hf.funpic.de/homepage/smile/smile_dj.gif

and everything works, so the problem should be firefox and not the page itself.

As far as I can remember, the problem wasn't there in version 1.5. (But I am not sure about that)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://hforce.hf.funpic.de
2. Go to "Gästebuch"
3. Select an image and right click
4. Select "properties"
5. See the path with "%5C"
Actual Results:  
No Image and a path with "5C" at the end, like ".../smile%5Csmile_dj.gif"

Expected Results:  
Image and a path with "/" at the end, like ".../smile/smile_dj.gif"
