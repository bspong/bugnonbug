I used DreamWeaver mx 2004 to make this website for my school. I created a
pop-up menu navigation bar in fireworks and exported into DW to use in my
website's template. The popup menus do not work with firefox mac or pc. The
menus work in safari (mac) and ie (pc and mac). Please help. I want our students
to use Firefox on all our computers in the district.
