"Organize" button and "Showing" dropdown missing on the bottom of the search results in places popup
Steps to reproduce:
1. Click Places and type a search term
2. When the search results are shown you decide that you obviously don't know the right search term, so you want to open the history list in the popup or in the Places window
3. But both the "Showing" dropdown and the "Organize" button are not present on the bottom.
