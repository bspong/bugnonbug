Inline elements with margins don't wrap properly around floats

By elements with margins, I mean such things as Blockquotes and Lists, each of which have a left margin. If these elements were inline and made to wrap around a floating block, the margins would get ignored -- effectively, they would render no differently than any other plain text -- the margins (and bullets, in the case of Lists) would get overlapped by the floating block.

Reproducible: Always
