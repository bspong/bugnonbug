"Server Not Found" after update to build 2.0.0.9
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; Media Center PC 4.0; InfoPath.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30)
Build Identifier: 2.0.0.9

After automatic or manual update to build 2.0.0.9 Firefox does not access the web. A "Server Not Found" window appears. This has happened on 3 machines several times. I have to do a System Restore back to 11/4, the closest working date. At this point the build still shows as 2.0.0.9 but I am able to get to the web. Eventualy another Auto Update wants to install. If I let it, the same problem occurs. On all three machines. I am using the COMODO Fire Wall Pro and that is about the only thing I have'nt checked to see if, for some reason, it is blocking Firefox. When it happens again, and it will, I will look at this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.When the next auto update shows up just let it install
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
When Firefox restarts the "Server Not Found" window pops up

Expected Results:  
Opened my web home page.

Can work around by shutting of the Auto Update but that doesn't solve the actual problem.
