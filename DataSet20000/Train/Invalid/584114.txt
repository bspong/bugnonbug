If you open the settings window of firefox to configure homepage and stuff like that, that window isn'T resizable. 
Seems like under linux it works fine but under Windows it does not.
The only thing you can do under Windows is maximizing the complete settings window which is good but not as usefull as resizing the settings window.


Tested also on an empty fresh profile. It is no issue, just bad coded. :P

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open settings window
2. Try resizing it by drap&drop on one side, which isn't possible
3.
Actual Results:  
Nothing, that's the point
