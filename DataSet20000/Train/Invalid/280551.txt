Firefox not supporting W3C's CSS1 recommendations for formatting

I use percentages to define the sizes of fonts and table widths, as recommended
by the W3C to be compatible with increased font sizes in browser windows (for
those who require larger font-sizes to read web pages).

However, Firefox is not supporting this.  Such definitions in my styles seem to
be ignored.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  View above web-page in Firefox
2.  View above web-page in IE
3.  Look at page source styles.

Actual Results:  
same problem, even with current builds and nightlies

Expected Results:  
certain fonts should be smaller than the surrounding fonts.
Tables columns should be equal.
