I downloaded the latest trunk build today and now I am no longer able to reorder tabs. Dragging them works but I can't drop them anywhere, they just pop back to the original position.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open several tabs
2. Click one of the tabs and drag
3. Move the dragged tab into a new position on the tab bar
3. Release
Actual Results:  
Tag reverts to it's original location (and no insertion point marker is displayed)

Expected Results:  
Tabs are reordered with the dragged tab in a new position
