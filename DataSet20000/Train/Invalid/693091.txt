RE 	Firefox 7 (v7.0.1) and Thunderbird 7 (v7.0.1)

Running on iMac (Model MC309LL/A) with OS X Lion (updated to 10.7.1)

I am very disappointed in Mozilla's lack of updates to Firefox 7 and Thunderbird 7 compatible with Mac's OS X Lion.

Firefox 7 will NOT:

- Access QuickTime plug-in (QuickTimePlugin.plugin), even though it is located in the system's Internet Plugins Library; attempts to add from the file fail because Firefox cannot 'see' the plugins in that Library folder (although it has access to several others such as ShockWave.

- Even though updated to 7.0.1, the default theme has not been applied to Firefox's Appearance (and there is no way to manually accomplish such, as far as I have been able determine, even after examining your help topics on the subject).

Thunderbird 7 will NOT:

- Open .eml documents.

Please advise when you plan to fix these issues.
