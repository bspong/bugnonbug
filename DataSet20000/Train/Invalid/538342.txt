Firefox verifies but can't verify https://startssl.com/logon.ssl
When trying to load this page (to log in), firefox pauses for a while, then displays an error page indicating:

"Secure Connection Failed
An error occurred during a connection to www.startssl.com.
    *   The page you are trying to view can not be shown because the authenticity of the received data could not be verified.
..."

The only button action available is to try again.

If you try to manually add an exception via the preferences, after entering the URL and [Get Certificate], firefox displays:

"Valid Certificate
This site provides a valid, verified identification.  There is no need to add an exception."

- Tested with a completely new profile
- Tested with a new profile with a personal certificate installed for identity
- Tried removing startcom certs to no avail. Firefox is unable to ignore built in obj. certs that you've requested to be deleted.

I understand that StartCom transitioned to a new root CA.  They're both listed.  I've also re-installed ca-certificates package and verified there weren't any left over old certs.

openssl client verifies the certificate correctly.
