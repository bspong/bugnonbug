When opening multiple JPEG images (served over an apache server), there seems to be a substantial memory leak, with the Firefox consuming all available memory.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Store large JPEG images (2MB+) in a public directory servable by an apache server
2. Open the directory containing the images using the browser
3. View multible images through the browser

Actual Results:  
View 'Memory Usage' and 'VM Size' on the Windows Task Manager and notice the memory usage increasing until all available memory is used up.

Expected Results:  
There should be no memory leak.

I use the latest build of Deer Park browser (Deer Park build 1.6a1)
