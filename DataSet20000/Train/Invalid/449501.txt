ARIA role: alert does not always cause the added node to be spoken by the user's assistive technology.

Under JAWS 9, if the text content of an alert is greater than a certain length, the alert will not be spoken when it is added.

Please see the attached example.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the attached example while running Firefox 3 and JAWS 9.
2. Click on "Show the alert that works". Notice that the alert text is read out.
3. Click on "Show the alert that fails". Notice that the alert text is not read out.
Actual Results:  
The alert is only read in the first case, but nothing is spoken for the second case.

Expected Results:  
Both alerts should be spoken.
