There is a dropdown list where you can set the minimum font-size. Unfortunately there are only a few entries you can select from and you can not enter your own values.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Dropdown minimum font-size list.


Actual Results:  
List contains a few entries but you can not define your own ones.

Expected Results:  
The box should be user-editable so that you can type your own values in.
Or: The list should contain more entries. The very big ones could be removed, but 4,5,6,7,8 should be in there.

The reason for this enhancement request is, that the minimum font-size is often used to make webpages with small font-sizes more readable. In the dropdown-list the maximum minimum font-size is 9 but 9 is quite big in my opinion. I don't want to make the fonts really big, but I want to make fonts with font-size:4px readable.

Additional in the dialog there is no infomation which unit the minimum-font-size has. Is it pt or px?
