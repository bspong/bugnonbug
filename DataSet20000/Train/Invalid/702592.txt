Tables display wrong if you insert elements into a row element, hide the row, insert it into the table and then make the row visible

Steps to reproduce:

Tried to insert elements into a table using jQuery with the following code:
tr.append(tickBoxTd).
            append(dateTd).
            append("<td>"+source+"</td>").
            append(nameDiv).
            append(briefCaseTd).
            append(tagsDiv).
            append(billTd).
            append(actionsTd).hide();
var body = $("#file-list");
        body.prepend(tr);



Actual results:

It looked like all the elements were being placed into one td tag


Expected results:

Beautiful output. See screenshot. Left is Firefox 7.0.1 running on Ubuntu, right is Chromium 14.0.835.202 running the same code next to it. Please note that I fixed this by first inserting the row into the table, and then the td tags.
