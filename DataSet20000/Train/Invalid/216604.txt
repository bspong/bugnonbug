Unable to open file type other than html
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5b) Gecko/20030817 Mozilla Firebird/0.6.1+

In the nightly Firebird build (XFT/GTK2) for 20030818, one cannot open a file
other than an html file type, from the main File menu. Attempting to open the
dropdown box for file type (in the open file dialog), results in nothing
happening. The dropdown box does not... well... "dropdown". There is no way to
change the desired file type.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click File -> Open File...
2. Click down arrow on "Files of type" dropdown box


Actual Results:  
Nothing happened. The dropdown box did not open at all.

Expected Results:  
The dropdown box should have opened and displayed a list of various file types
available for selection.
