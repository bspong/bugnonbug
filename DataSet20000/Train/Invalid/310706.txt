Firefox won't load any pages; www.google.com could not be found, etc.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows 98; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla 1.0.7

I cannot get any pages or sites loading, using Firefox. I have used Firefox and 
IE for months without this problem. All of a sudden, a few hours ago, Firefox 
would not work at all. I uninstalled, reinstalled; I removed the profile 
information; deleted the Mozilla directory from Windows - still no joy. IE is 
working for me. I just downloaded Opera (because one site I visit won't load 
properly for me using IE - the URL is http://forums.vugames.com/forum.jspa?
forumID=160 - it loads, but I cannot actually reply to any topic as the text 
area fails to give me a cursor. It was fine with Firefox), and THAT doesn't 
work either.
I have Zone Alarm switched off. I haven't changed any settings. I use Symantec 
anti-virus - there has been an update for that today, but could that have 
changed something? I use Ad=Aware - full scan, no problems found.
I very much want to see this solved. It seems many other people have suddenly 
experienced this today...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click onto firefox.exe.
2. Watch as the browser fails utterly to open any page at all.
3.

Actual Results:  
All sites, any sites, failed to open.

Expected Results:  
I expected, for instance, google to open when I typed in www.google.com Even 
typing in the actual numerical address of google failed to get the page up, so 
I don't think it can be DNS cache.
