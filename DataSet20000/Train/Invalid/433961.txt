BBC news website experiences random timeouts

Bear with me, this is my first ever bug report.  Since upgrading to Firefox 3.0 beta 5, I have experienced random timeouts with the BBC news website.  No other sites appear to be affected, but I do not browse a large range of sites.  I might launch firefox (as the only open application), successfully browse the front page (news.bbc.co.uk) and perhaps a few other articles within this site, perhaps many.  However, eventually the site will hang and any attempt to access any other page within the site will timeout.  While the pages are timing out I can still surf other sites without any issues.  

Attempting to stop and reload the timing out page (by clicking on the stop button and then refresh button) has no effect.  When the page does eventually time out I can successfully click on 'Retry' and the page loads without issue, but I must wait for it to time out first.  While the pages are timing out I can still ping news.bbc.co.uk and get good results (~35ms), so I don't believe it is my internet connection or provider.  I have no extensions installed and have tried with a brand new profile.  I have also verified that this issue still exists for me in a recent developer build (minefield).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Surf news.bbc.co.uk and articles within
2.Eventually the site times out and nothing within the site will work
3.
Actual Results:  
Any opened tab after the timeouts begin will timeout.  Retrying after the timeout finishes is successful.

Expected Results:  
Load the page quickly (usual response time is < 5 sec).  Timeouts take 1-2 minutes?
