Bug submission system WAY too cumbersome

I registered on Bugzilla today to report a general inability to save pages or images using standard dialogs and/or contextual menus and decided it was too much of a hassle.

Firefox 2 is seriously buggy and submitting bugs through Bugzilla is more trouble than it's worth.

I'm a user, not a debug engineer.
