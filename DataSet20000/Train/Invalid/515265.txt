[Taskfox] Make arrow keys + tab work for secondary pages
When browsing search results from Taskfox, you can't currently use the right arrow key or tab to enter the secondary (detail) page. Currently, the only way to get to it is by using the mouse.

We should add the right/left arrow keys + tab/shift-tab for back/forward navigation.
