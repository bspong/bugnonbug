While using Firefox, sometimes all networking in Firefox quits working. For example, I can't load any pages, can't check for updates for add-ons, anything that requires the network.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Browse around for a long time, try loading more than one tab at once.
Actual Results:  
No networking available in Firefox and must restart to restore functionality.

Expected Results:  
Continued functioning normally.

Could be a problem in our networking libs.
