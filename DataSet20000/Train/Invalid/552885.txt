i get email digests from the google groups i am subscribed to (espeically Android related). so this digest contains 2 sections 1) listing "Topic Summary" 2) actual topics
so i used to select only few from the summary and click the built-in links for those topics from "Topic Summary".
When i upgraded to Firefox/3.6 the links don't seem to work.

I am not able to navigate to actual topics using the links from "topic summary" section.

I have also seen this problem with another mailing list: bangalore-bikers.googlegroups.com
