Firefox does not close all browser windows when it exits.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.375.55 Safari/533.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla.org downloaded Firefox 3.6.3

Using windows 7 Home on an HP DV7 laptop.  If I open a URL in a window (not a tab) the window does not show on the screen.  1when I close the browser the window that did not show on the screen stays open because firefox will not restart since it is already running in the window that you cannot see or close.  The only way to restart firefox is to turn the computer off at which point it hangs up the computer untill you force a shutdown and restart at which point firefox will want to restore the other session.  It is best to say NO to a restart.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Ask Firefox to open a URL in a new window or just try to get an address in Yahoo from yahoo's contact list to send a message.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
The new window does not show up on the screen but Firefox behaves as if it has completed the task.  In the case of the yahoo contact list it does not show up on the screen.

Expected Results:  
You can continue working with the main window on the screen but if you close that session firefox will close it but will not restart because another session that it does not show on the screen or as an icon at the bottom, is still running.

The software should ideally show the new window on the screen.  Previous versions did that.  Love Firefox but I am temporarily moving to Chrome just so I can get to my yahoo address list.
