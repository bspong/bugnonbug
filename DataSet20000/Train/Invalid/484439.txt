Is it safe to turn off private browsing while in autostart mode?
This came up in a few bugs, and it seems that this needs to be guarded against. IMHO it shouldn't be possible to turn off pb while in autostart mode as the user has made an explicit choice to have it always on.

However, if it should be possible (which it is now) this must be guarded against, details of some minor bugs encountered to follow.
