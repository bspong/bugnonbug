FTP site names being resolved
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10.1

In the 1.0 release of Firefox, a change was made to resolve the names of FTP
sites. For example the following URL:
ftp://customer:xilinx@ftp.xilinx.com/upload/

When Firefox opens is after the dialog box:
ftp://ftp.xilinx.com/upload/

The problem with this is that it is hard to cut and paste FTP locations to other
people, as firefox automatically resolves this. I could not find any option to
turn this off

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a webpage with the following URL:
ftp://customer:xilinx@ftp.xilinx.com/upload/
2. Then click on "YES" when the dialog box pops up.
3. Reproduce the problem.

Actual Results:  
It converts it to ftp://ftp.xilinx.com/upload/

Expected Results:  
It should have maintained the name.

ftp://customer:xilinx@ftp.xilinx.com/upload/
