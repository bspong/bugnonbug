empty/invisible items shown on right-click context menu

If I right-click somewhere on a page, I get a context menu with empty or
invisible entries.
I counted from 4 to 14 empty entries. 14 is quite annoying, because some useful
visible items may be located off-screen due to this bug.

Some hints:
The number of invisible entries varies.
The invisibles are one after each other, no other visible items in between.
The position seems to be always the same depending where you right-click.
When right-clicking above text, the invisibles are always between "Select All"
and the spacer above "View Page Source"
When right-clicking in enter-text-field, the invisibles are always between
"Select All" and "Flashblock Options".
When right-clicking on a link, the invisibles are always between "Allow Flash
from this site" and the spacer above "Properties".


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Just right-click anywhere on the page and on any page.

Actual Results:  
The context menu holds emtpty/invisible items.

Expected Results:  
Display a context menu without empty/invisible items.
