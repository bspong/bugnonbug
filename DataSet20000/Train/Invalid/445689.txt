When I try to access my D-link router DIR-655 I type in http://192.168.0.1
And My Dlink Router Page comes up Ok But when I put in the correct info USERNAME and PASSWORD in it gives me this window with this error message.

"The network connection seems to be down. Press 'Ok' to try again."

When I try again, this message repeats. Using Internet Explorer Is the only way I can log in to my page.
