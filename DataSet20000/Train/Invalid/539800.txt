Particular pages make Firefox freeze momentarily (Often multiple times) during loading.

Some pages (eg. eBay, Encyclopedia Dramatica, other wikis) make Firefox freeze for about 1 - 3 second durations at inconsistent intervals during loading. Very few pages are affected, and only pages using Wiki software, with the occasional exception (Wikipedia doesn't have the issue, though it did when I first noticed the problem, though it seemed to resolve. Encyclopedia Dramatica though, does have the problem and persists.) There is also the exception of eBay, that has the issue, despite (to the best of my knowledge) not using wiki software. Wikis such as the Assassin's Creed wiki used to have the issue, but no longer do. 

Encyclopedia Dramatica and eBay are the only persistently problematical sites that I currently know of. ED seems to only freeze when transferring data from "ytimg.com". eBay doesn't seem to have a pattern to it. 

When it freezes, it freezes the whole browser window, not just the tab. If I click the window (I'm using Windows 7) it whites-out and says it's not responding, though it's normally a too small timeframe for me to be able to get this to happen.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Go to Encyclopedia Dramatica (Can be offensive content)
2) Load a page. Front page works fine.



Actual Results:  
The page will load, though it will freeze multiple times during loading.


Expected Results:  
The page loads normally, smoothly and without freezing the browser momentarily.

I'm using Firefox 3.5.7, with the following addons:
