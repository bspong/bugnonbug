Event 1517 in Windows XP Application log after running Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

After installing Firefox 1.0 on 3 different computers I get this error in the
Application log any time I shut down or restart after running Firefox. If I
don't run Firefox during the session I don't get the error. All machines are
WinXP Service Pack 2. Two are domain members and the other is a standalone.  No
services are running as a local user account.  I am logging in as a user with
full administrative privileges.  I never got this error before installing
Firefox and I tested it several times to verify that it was connected with
running Firefox before I reported it. It may be minor but it makes me wonder if
it could be connected with other problems or if it might indicate that some
handles are not being released.  Even if it is harmless it would be nice to fix
it so it doesn't clutter the event log.

Event Category: None
Event ID: 1517
Date: 11/16/2004
Time: 9:55:25 AM
User: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
Computer: [computer name]
Description:
Windows saved user [domain]\[username] registry while an application or service
was still using the registry during log off. The memory used by the user's
registry has not been freed. The registry will be unloaded when it is no longer
in use.

This is often caused by services running as a user account, try configuring the
services to run in either the LocalService or NetworkService account.
