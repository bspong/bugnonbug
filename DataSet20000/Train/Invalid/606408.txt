Hangs with 100% CPU, rapid memory leak after completing large file downloading (eg. ISO, DMG)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/8.0.552.11 Safari/534.10
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.11) Gecko/20101012 Firefox/3.6.11

The problem generally occurs when downloading large files, such as an ISO image. The download progress reaches completion (or close to it), then the browser stops responding. The CPU utilisation for the Firefox process is at 100%. Memory footprint climbs very rapidly from roughly 250 MB to about 1600 MB, and remains at that level. Only way to control the situation is by killing the process tree for Firefox. The downloaded file is unusable and incomplete.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit an ISO download link such as the Ubuntu URL given earlier.
2. Allow Firefox download manager to download the file.
3. Close download manager.
4. Wait for the download to complete in the background while surfing the web. 
Actual Results:  
Worked correctly this time.

Expected Results:  
The browser should stop responding and exhibit the symptoms described earlier.

Also worth noting that Firefox had about 20 tabs open across two application windows, over a period of several days. That is, Firefox was continually running without closing the application. Some of the tabs had flash video content (such as TED talks, etc).
