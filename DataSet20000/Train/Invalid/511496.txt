border-image and float not working correctly together

I have two <div>s.  One is a float within the other.  The inside float is placed at the outer edge and is not moved inside the border.  Also, if I try to place the two divs outside of each other, they overlap each other instead of both being displayed.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.CSS3 code for the two <divs>

.note-small-curl {
	margin: 20px 20px;
	padding: 20px;
	border-width: 27px;
	-moz-border-image: url('images/note-small-curl.png') 31 round round;
	width: 100px;
	height: 100px;
	float: left;
	clear: both;
	position: static;
	top: 40px;
	left: 100px;
}

.pinned-lined-paper {
	background-image: url(images/notepapermargin.gif), url(images/notepaper.gif);
	background-repeat: repeat-y, repeat;
	background-position: 75px 0%, 0% 0%; 
	margin: 0px 20px;
	padding: 0px 100px;
	border-width: 31px;
	border-top-width: 51px;
	text-indent: 50px;
	-moz-border-image: url('images/pinned-lined-paper.png') 51 31 31 31 round round;
}

2.  Here is the HTML code

Example 1:

<div class="note-small-curl">
Residents
</div>

<div class="pinned-lined-paper">


<h1>This is our header</h1>
If the first keyword is 'stretch', the top, middsdsdfle and bottom images are further scaled to be as wide as the element's padding box. The height is not changed any further. 	blah blah
<br /><br />
</p>
</div>

Example 2:

<div class="pinned-lined-paper">

<div class="note-small-curl">
Residents
</div>
<h1>This is our header</h1>
If the first keyword is 'stretch', the top, middsdsdfle and bottom images are further scaled to be as wide as the element's padding box. The height is not changed any further. 	blah blah
<br /><br />
</p>
</div>

3. Load into the browser.
Actual Results:  
The two border <div>s overlap each other.  The border indents are not being respected in relation to floats.

Expected Results:  
In the first example, I would expect to see a <div> that clearly looks like a piece of paper.  Next to it, I would expect to see a piece of paper that looks like it has pins on all four corners.
