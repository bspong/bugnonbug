When trying to upload a file to photobucket, firefox crashes, It allows you to log in and select the files you've already uploaded no problem however, when you try to upload a new file from the page and you click on choose file, It opens another window where you would choose the file you want to upload and after 3 seconds of the new window being open firefox crashes. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Photobucket.com
2. Enter User name & password and click login
3. When logged in on fist page click Choose Files
4. Screen comes up to choose files and in 3 seconds firefox shuts down
Actual Results:  
Firefox shuts down without any errors or messages. 
Upon start-up again asks if i want to resume last session or start new session.
 

Expected Results:  
At the #4 step firefox should NOT shut down. You should be able to choose the file you want, after you choose the file you click OPEN and on Photobucket.com file should show a percentage of the file being uploaded. 

I have used Photobucket.com with firefox for the past 8+ months without any problems. I don't know why this problem as started.
