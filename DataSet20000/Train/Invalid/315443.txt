I lunched firefox from shell,but got no strange  problem.
I have to reemove ./mozilla and reboot to avoid the problem(I haven't found any other ways)
I hope that I was clear...I' don't write programs and I can't understand code ,but I will be happy to help you.
Maybe it's a security problem....I don't know the site and I don't know what i do
