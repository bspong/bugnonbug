It's useful to print page numbers at the bottom of the pages.
Please provide an option to do so.
This makes it easier to keep the printed pages in order and to separate multiple print jobs (without wasting paper for cover pages).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to a page.
2. Select File/Print
Actual Results:  
No page numbers are printed and no option is presented to provide page numbers.

Expected Results:  
An option on the print dialog should appear to provide control over the footer & header, including page numbers.

Thanks for the great browser!  Let's make it even better!
