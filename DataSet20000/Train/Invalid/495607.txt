On http://mrdoob.com/projects/chromeexperiments/ball_pool the text in the big ball rotates nicely in Firefox 3.5 Beta 4. However, it does not in the latest trunk build of Shiretoko, nor the latest Minefield.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://mrdoob.com/projects/chromeexperiments/ball_pool
2. Throw the big ball around.
3. Does the text rotate in the latest versions of Firefox?
Actual Results:  
The text isn't rotating at all.

Expected Results:  
The text is rotating along the "rolling" of the ball.
