bookmarks "disappear" when starting Firefox with elevated access in Vista
Firefox 3.0.5 de-DE
Vista Business SP1

- Install Firefox 3.0.5 de-DE on Vista Business SP1 as an admin user
- Set Firefox as your default browser
- Drag some bookmarks to the bookmarks menu below the "Mozilla Firefox" folder
- Log out of admin account and log into a non-admin user
- Start Firefox and save some different bookmarks to the same place below the "Mozilla Firefox" folder in the Bookmarks menu
- Install the pdfforge toolbar from http://pdfforge.mybrowserbar.com
- Get prompted during install that you need admin access, enter the pw for the admin user
- Complete the toolbar install
- See Firefox start as the last action of the toolbar installer after you click "finish" in the installer
- Click the Bookmarks menu and see the bookmarks you saved under the "mozilla firefox" folder are not there
- Restart Firefox and see that the bookmarks have returned.

What appears to be happening is since the installer is starting Firefox while it is running at Admin level Firefox is using the profile for that Admin user and you see the bookmarks for that admin user rather than for the non-admin user as you would expect.

I'm not sure if this is a Vista bug, Firefox bug, or just unexpected behavior.  Filing as an fyi in case you want to do anything about it, and in case someone else runs into a problem with bookmarks missing or bookmarks disappearing in Vista and is trying to figure out what's going on.
