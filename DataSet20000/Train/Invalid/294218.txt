problem with pop-up windows script
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.3

The pop-up window is missing title.
The image of the window is kept in the memory forever. Example, I'll upload new
html file. I'll close my browser. Reopen browser and go o the web, open the
window. The old html file is still visible. This looks like leaking memory, the
block holding old html window is not disposed. so, there is memory block still
accessible and active after few minutes?

Reproducible: Always
