After installing Speed Dial, it failed to work when I tried to synchronize  a laptop with a PC

Under Bookmarks there is an option to select a Speed Dial # (1-9) to the site that is up, but no option for retrieving any of the selections associated with the numbers.  Also the key commands (ctrl i, for instance) toggles between the full window for Firefox and the window with the bookmarks on the left, instead of bringing up the bookmark and number (1-9) window.  

Reproducible: Always
