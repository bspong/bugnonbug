"Server busy" pop-under message on start-up with localhost on WAMP server
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Previous session of Firefox includes a http://localhost/ page (e.g. http://localhost/phpmyadmin/) on Windows Vista with WAMP 2.0 server running.

When Firefox is shut down and restarted (with WAMP server running), it seems to hang, unable to display any pages. 

To continue, Firefox has to be minimised and then brought back to full-screen to display the "pop-under" message box: (title:) 'Server busy' (Message:) 'This action cannot be completed because the "[title of last opened page] - Mozilla Firefox" program is not responding. Choose "Switch To" and correct the problem.'

When you choose "Switch To" Firefox proceeds to display the pages and runs as normal.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run WAMP 2.0 server
2. Start Firefox
3. Open e.g. http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
4. Close Firefox (with session saved option)
5. Open Firefox (appears to hang)
6. Minimise Firefox
7. Restore Firefox or Maximise Firefox
8. Click "Switch To" on the message box


Expected Results:  
No pop-under message. Pop-up or no message at all (best)
