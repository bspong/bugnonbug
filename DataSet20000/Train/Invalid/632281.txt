Starting with Firefox 4.0b7, opening a popup panel with openPopup() in the main window has no effect if another window has the focus.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install the attached extension bugpopup.xpi
2. verify you see a message "Hi, I'm a popup" blinking every second at the bottom right of the window
3. open a window, for instance the Firefox preferences
4. verify the message does not appear anymore
Actual Results:  
The popup only shows if the window holding the popup has the focus or no window Firefox window is focused. In particular, the popup does not show if another Firefox window is focused.

Expected Results:  
The popup should be opened regardless of the focused window, as it was up to Firefox 4.0b6
