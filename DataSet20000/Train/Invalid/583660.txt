Clearing history doesn't clear location auto-completion

Even after going to Tools->Clear Recent History, and clearing Everything, visited locations can still be determined by using the browser's location auto-completion feature. 

The only way to clear this data that I've discovered is to delete the Firefox profile directory.

So far as I'm aware, this bug is present in all versions of Firefox on all platforms. The version I tested with though is Firefox 3.6.8 running on Windows Vista.





Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clear browser history.
2. Optionally close and reopen the browser (doesn't matter).
3. Enter the first letter or two of a previously visited URL in the browser's location text field.
Actual Results:  
Previously visited URLs are retained by the browser's location auto-completion feature even after clearing history.

Expected Results:  
All history data stored in the profile directory should be cleared, including location auto-completion data.
