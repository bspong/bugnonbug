FYI, I also raised feedback to the web site for evangelism purposes.

Whenever the above URL is accessed the request never returns and the browser doesn't time out either. Returns immediately using IE (spit!) and other pages from this site work fine in FireFox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Access given URL
2. Wait

Actual Results:  
Absolutely nothing - browser just waits.

Expected Results:  
Works perfectly in IE, every time. Other pages from this site work perfectly too in FireFox.

Doing nothing weird or untoward.
