When accessing directly a personal page, for example: http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#/pages/Haier/68476763398?ref=s
Once initiated the process starts.
changes to:
http://www.facebook.com/pages/Haier/68476763398?ref=s
changes to:
http://www.facebook.com/Haieramerica?ref=s

Once this process is completed the website goes to a done status and does not come up.

I have tried this to business and personal pages from many on my list and the same occurs every time.  

I am one of the IT Administrators for Haier America and one of our users reported the issues, in this case for our own company's Face book profile and the result in the investigations came to be a Firefox specific issue.  Internet explorer for example in this respect pulls up the link successfully.

Please advise and assist if possible.  
Thank you for all of your hard work to make Firefox our browser of choice.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.In web address location point to: http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#/pages/Haier/68476763398?ref=s
3. Status goes to done and does not come up.
Actual Results:  
Status goes to done and does not come up.


Expected Results:  
To hit the website I requested.

Have provided insight to the issue and created a log file of the occurrence with an option to send this to Mozilla if the result was a Firefox software problem as it has turned out to be in this case.

Given the popularity of Face book with it's 500 million users, I would say this is a serious issue and people will point to alternative browsers for use in this respect.  This issue could potentially cause harm to personal computers everywhere as people who use Firefox neglect to ever turn on another browser and the alternative in the majority is IE.  IE as we both know is horrible and a serious security risk to giving the user spy ware and other potential hazardous code.
