URL bar introduces NUMEROUS vulnerabilities.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/534.24 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/11.0.696.25 Safari/534.24
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.16) Gecko/20110323 Ubuntu/9.10 (karmic) Firefox/3.6.16 

I first read about it here: http://consumerist.com/2011/06/how-hackers-stole-200000-citi-accounts-by-exploiting-basic-browser-vulnerability.html

Then I got to thinking, what else can someone do with the URL bar?
* Run JavaScript.
* Browse local file directories.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type `javascript:alert(document.cookie);' into the URL bar.
2. Type `file:///etc/passwd' into the URL bar.

Actual Results:  
1. My personal information was displayed.
2. The system password file was displayed.

Expected Results:  
1. Not have allowed this.
2. See above.

Chrome is ridding the world of this evil, why can't Firefox?
