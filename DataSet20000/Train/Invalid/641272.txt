There's been many reports floating around concerning the Flash Plug-in version 10.2 crashing Firefox, and in some cases whole systems.  Most of them concern playing video (especially Youtube), and how it handles sending that video out.

I'll have to check which card version, but I do know some old ATI/AMD cards are crashing the entire system.  On NVidia cards (espeically my GeForce 9800GT) it's not clearing out the graphics context, leaving a screenshot that is visible on black backgrounds or in black windows when you move it around screen (it's there in the shadows... shine a black light on it! :D ).

This may be worth gathering all the similar bugs together, even though the bug fully is on Adobe's shoulders.  Maybe adjusting Firefox's "You should update Flash" notice is worth while.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View any Youtube video.
2. Don crash helmet.
