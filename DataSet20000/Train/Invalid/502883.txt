After several uses, the search dropdown box (that provides hints for search terms) stays stuck down.  Occasionally it has even remained when FF itself is minimized.  This is especially the case when I switch to VMWare Fusion.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use search box several times
2. Possibly use hints - it's unclear exactly what triggers the behaviour
3.
Actual Results:  
search box hint window is stuck, showing no hints, but Clear search history remains.  If I click on dropdown arrow button, a second window appears with actual recent searches; this second window behaves normally, in that it can be removed by clicking on dropdown arrow button again.

Expected Results:  
The blank search history window should not appear nor remain stuck whatsoever.
