Steps to reproduce:

1) Install a persona called blue flow -- I like it because it has a max contrast with the white arrows (??)

2) look for the button "List of all tabs"




Actual results:

the button "List of all tabs" disappears (no visual clue) except when the mouse is over it.


Expected results:

the button "List of all tabs" is displayed on the right upper corner.
