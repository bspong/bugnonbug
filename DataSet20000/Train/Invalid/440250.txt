iGetter extension causes crash [@ kernel32.dll@0x49207] on start-up
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404 Firefox/2.0.0.14
Build Identifier: Firefox/3.0

I believe I have narrowed down an issue causing FF3 to fail upon start-up resulting in "Mozilla Crash Reporter" every time you attempt to start FF3.

I have been over and over this issue in the support forum but I can get nothing more than a copy/paste response that even a bot could make more applicable to my problem. I have tried everything and then some, all the way down to running Vista in Safe Mode to try to resolve the problem, however nothing worked. The only thing I found odd was that this issue occurs on some Vista boxes, but not all. Therefore, even in safe mode, there must be something unique to my box (Vista Home Premium 32-bit). I have another box running Vista Ultimate 32-bit that I use strictly for media center. I downloaded and installed FF3 with no issues on it. So, what's the difference? Patched DLL files to customize the look of Vista and use 3rd party Visual Styles. All my patched files are as follows:

authui.dll
browseui.dll
ieframe.dll
imageres.dll
shell32.dll
shsvcs.dll
themeui.dll
uxtheme.dll (this file is commonly patched to customize XP as well)

I am assuming that since FF3 boasts a "Platform-Native Look & Feel", it must be attempting to access one or more of these patched files, causing the crash. This also explains why FF2* works.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Patch specific DLL files per http://www.winmatrix.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=16977
2. Attempt to run FF3
Actual Results:  
When FF3 is launched, it crashes immediately and displays "Mozilla Crash Reporter".

Expected Results:  
FF3 should run as normal.

If this is in fact the problem, seems to me it should have been discovered in beta testing. More importantly, it is rather counter-productive, seeing as how if Windows users liked Vista or XP right out of the box, they'd be using Internet Explorer and not Firefox in the first place.
