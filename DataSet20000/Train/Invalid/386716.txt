If you visit the URL under IE it will play the embedded video but under FF it complains you need a plugin. It turns out that if you click on the down-arrow in the bottom-right of the video it'll play in Windows Media Player just fine (which proves I've got the codecs to play the video). Modifying the embed-tag to explictly ask for the "video/x-ms-wmv" mime type also works around the problem but then you lose compatibility for other video types, other players, other platforms, etc.

I am expecting FireFox to play "video/x-msvideo" mime-types in Windows Media Player out-of-the-box as IE does.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Hit the aforementioned URL
2. Embedded video should play
Actual Results:  
Video won't play, FF asks users to install a plugin

Expected Results:  
Video should play with vanilla FF installation
