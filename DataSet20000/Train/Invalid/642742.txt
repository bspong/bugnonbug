when removing a post from one's own wall, all FF4 posts are removed. re-posting once again brigs the remaining posts back to the wall. in IE9, when all the posts are removed from own wall, they are also removed from friends walls (and are re-appeared when user re-posts to own wall).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Make several posts to of badges to wall.
2) From wall, select "remove post" in the post options X.
3) Refresh the page.
Actual Results:  
All posts are removed from wall, not only the one that was selected.
 --> Go back to FF4 badges page and post a new badge to wall. -> The remaining badges are posted back on the wall with the new one. see attached video.
NOTE: when posting and removing the posts in IE9, all the post disappear and re-appear on friend's walls as well.

Expected Results:  
Only the removed badges should be removed from wall.
