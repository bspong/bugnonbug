tables displayed incorrectly?
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3

at least that is what I think it is, this is a very popular url for me and
probably lots of other people, but there is a marked difference in the way that
IE and Firefox display it, Firefox seems to create an extra column in which some
of the the left hand tables are shifted right. It is a very complex page so I
found it difficult to decode.
I have noticed this from v0.90 to 1.0.
One other gripe, is that I liked the 'middle-click'='open link in new tab' but
it is missing in v1.0, is it making a comeback?
