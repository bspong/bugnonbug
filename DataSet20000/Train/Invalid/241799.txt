the quicktime plug-in wont load, every time i try to play a movie online it asks me to get the plug-in. Have tried reinstalling both firefox and quicktime, all the dll files are in the firefox plug-in directory.

Every page with quicktime movies wont play in firefox. TrueCrime has a movie in
the PC section of their site that wont play, I am unable to download this movie
and play it off of my computer because they don't offer a url for the movie.
Other websites do it also but i'm usually able to just download the movie and
play it from the computer. Tried reinstalling both firefox and quicktime. All
DLL plug-in files seem to be in the firefox plug-in directory

to download the movie to my computer or use MIE to watch the movie
