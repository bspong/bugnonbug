Changing window size misplaces App Tabs and produces "ghost" App Tabs [caused by Tab Utilities]

I have two App Tabs. When I switch Firefox from maximized state to windowed state the 2 App Tabs are correctly redrawn beneath the Minefied Button, but there are also two "ghost" tabs at the old position. I I maximize again, the App Tabs are also not redrawn correctly and now "ghost" tabs stay over the Minefield button.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have two App Tabs and at least one normal tab on a maximzed Firefox 4b13pre
2. change Firefox window size
3. maximize Firefox window again
Actual Results:  
additional wrongly positioned "ghost" app tabs

Expected Results:  
Only the two correctly positioned App Tabs visible

This happens with all nightlies since 4b13pre
