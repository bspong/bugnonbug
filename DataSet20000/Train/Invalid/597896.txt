Link hover in location bar should not appear while scrolling page
If you leave your cursor on the page and then scroll around (e.g., by using the arrow keys, mouse scroll wheel or trackpad), link targets appear in the location bar if the cursor happens to fall over some.

Link targets should not be shown in the location bar while you're scrolling the page.
