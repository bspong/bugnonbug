tools > clear private data > ask me before... option is misleading
The option labelled "Ask me before clearing private data" is potentially misleading, and might cause a user to believe that if they were to click the [Clear Private Data Now] button they'd get a confirmation dialog.

The option actually means "when a user selects "clear private data" from the tools menu, pop up this dialog so that they can select what aspects of private data to clear".

Suggested replacements:
 - Show this dialog before clearing private data 
 - Always use the settings from Options (inverts checkbox meaning)
 - Remember these settings and don't ask me again (inverts checkbox meaning)
