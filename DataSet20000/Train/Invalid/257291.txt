Javascript error displayed in text windows
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040626 Firefox/0.9.1

The page delivers a Javascript time zone converter.  Enter your location and the
GMT text window should display the UTC time.  It displays a partly garbled text
string instead.  This is most likely due to the Javascript getting the local
system time string wrong (top text box).

It works in IE6 and Opera7 and even Netscape 4.7, but breaks in Firefox 0.9.1
and Netscape 7.1 (therefore a Mozilla bug?)  The page is bad HTML but it renders
in all browsers, and fixing the HTML does not fix the Javascript error

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.load URL
2. (enter location)
3.

Actual Results:  
1. local system time is incorrect, 2. results in garbled text string in GMT text
box.

Expected Results:  
local system time string should be displayed properly, and GMT calcuation should
give correct answer
