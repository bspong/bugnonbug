favicon size in tabs expand and contract intermittently, sometimes when clicking within a page or another tab. The favicon is 16x16 but firefox seems to try to expand it to 32x32 then gives up and reverts back to 16x16.

Ihave only seen this happen with the site listed

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.loadpage mentioned
2.load other pages
3.navigate from page to page
4.wait 7 seconds and keep an eye on the limesurvey favicon
Actual Results:  
the limesurvey favicon expands within the (fixed) space allowed on the tab and then reverts back to the correct size

Expected Results:  
Favicon should have stayed the same size

no other problems noted
