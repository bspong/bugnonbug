I have this code <v:imagedata src="./gif/image001.jpg" o:title="poster2"/> in my
page. I can load the graphic file using firefox in local PC. However, I can't
load the graphic file in this web server (www.ybam.org.my/cbs05). I try this
with other web browsers and they are working fine.

Reproducible: Always
