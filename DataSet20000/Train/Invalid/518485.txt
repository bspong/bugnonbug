when trying to load page, system stalls and will sit with the circle moving, then I will get problem loading page, and am unable to refresh my page.  I keep getting problem loading page.  This is on any/all pages that I try to load.  This did not happen prior to updating to the 3.5....not liking this...  I even try using my bookmarks, and still get the same result.  
Firefox can't find the server at myaccount.verizonwireless.com.       


    *   Check the address for typing errors such as
          ww.example.com instead of
          www.example.com

    *   If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
          connection.

    *   If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure
          that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.
