Working and non working example

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10_4_11; de-de) AppleWebKit/533.19.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.1.3 Safari/533.19.4

Steps to reproduce:

My page I am working on has a navigation with 7 menues and about hundred menue items in them in total. With onclick a menue of the seven is displayed and remains so. That is what I want and ok. In the navigation is a 8th item: a simple link. This link first shall close opened menues and after that call the wanted page in the main frame (iframe). So I didnt use a simple HTML link but a javascript function to do it.


Actual results:

The javascript function didnt work.


Expected results:

The function should have closed open menues and than open the given page in the main frame.

I isolated the problem and found that Firefox's Javascript has a problem with base target=x. My function worked when base target is not set and didnt when it is set. In Safari 4 it works without a problem. Please see attached file.
