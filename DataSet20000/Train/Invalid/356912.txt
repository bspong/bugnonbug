Flash plugin is not compliant with theme settings.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Change gnome desktop theme to Large Print High Contrast Inverse theme.
2. Change firefox appearance settings in top menu Edit->Preferences->Content->Colors, check the checkbox "Back ground: Use system colors", uncheck the checkbox "Alow pages to choose their own colors, instead of my selection above". Save the changes and close the preference dialog.
3. Load a page which contains flashes, say www.adobe.com.

Expected result:
The flash should be compliant with the system theme settings.

Actual result:
The flash will not follow the system theme settings.
