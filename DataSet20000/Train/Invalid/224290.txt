Firebird 0.7 doesn't set HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031026 Firebird/0.7

HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE is often used for multi-language sites.

This seems to be hard-coded to english only in Firebird (and Camino).

In MacOS X, the list of languages returned in the HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE should be
taken from what's already set up in the International control panel under MacOS
X system preferences.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just check what a CGI-script returns for the HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE env variable.

Actual Results:  
English only

Expected Results:  
It should output a list of what languages the user understands, and want sites
to return webpages in that language.

This can be taken from the MacOS X language settings (set in the International
system preferences panel).

The list should be weighted so that the preferred language get a higher weight
than the other languages.

There doesn't seem to be a workaround. Which means many sites will only provide
an english version of the site to firebird/camino users on MacOS X.
