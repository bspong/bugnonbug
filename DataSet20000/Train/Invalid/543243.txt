Advertisement tabs keep opening by themselves.  I have tried running McAfee, Malwarebytes, and Spybot, but none can seem to find any kind of problem.  When it is not tabs opening by themselves, Google searches are opening pages entirely unrelated to the link I click on.  Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox to no avail.  This is very frustrating as I attend school online.

Reproducible: Always
