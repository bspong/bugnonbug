I've recently noticed that javascript filter has a bug.
When you have a javascript variable defined in the HTML code like that:
var query = "query";
and the query is equal to:
</script><script>alert(document.title);</script>
For firefox javascript parser, </script> is a valid escape javascript string as " is.
So after closing the string by using </script>, firefox interprets next chars as HTML entities.
See steps to reproduce.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Example of javascript code in a php page: var query = '<? echo addslashes($_GET["query"]); ?>';
2. if my request is page.php?query=</script><script>alert(document.title);</script>
3. It will print the title of the current HTML document into a javascript alert because ' is eqal to </script> for valid escape javascript string.


Expected Results:  
</script> is not a valid escape character into a javascript string defined.
