I set the preference "select new tabs opened from links" to unchecked.  I have "new tabs in most recent windows" checked.  I click link with left mouse button and it opens in a new tab, but that tab opens.  If I click the link with the middle button, it opens in a new tab, but the new tab does not open.  I would expect both buttons to behave the same with these settings.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1."new tabs in most recent windows" checked
2."select new tabs opened from links" unchecked
3.click link with left mouse button

Actual Results:  
opens in a new tab, but that tab also opens and the original tab is no longer in view

Expected Results:  
opens in a new tab, but the new tab does not open for viewing, but original tab remains in view.
