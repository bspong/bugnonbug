This is a message  I receive most often.
"Foxfire can't establish a connection to the server at view.atdmt.com.
Though the site seems valid, the browser was unable to establish a connection." Can you tell me why I keep receiving the above message? This occurs for other sites also. 

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
I don't know what you are talking about, "reproducing" the problem. I don't produce or reproduce anything the message just comes up too frequently and prevents me from receiving some of my messages or inquiries.


How do I know? I am contacting you for information and possible help in preventing this problem.I expect Foxfire to be able to establish connection with this and other sites when my computer calls for them. Do not tell me "the browser was unable to establish a connection. Many times the message "connection failed" shows up behind behind what I am trying to connect to however it does go ahead and connect. I don't understand this either!
