STR:

1. Go to places library
2. Go to a feed (I used the standard Headlines feed)
3. Tag a web page in that feed, by click on it and then entering a tag in the bottom panel
4. Notice the bookmark now appears in "Unsorted Bookmarks" (or for those using an old profile "Unfiled Bookmarks", it appears also in the "Recently Tagged" and "Recently Bookmarked" items.
5. Visit the page
6. The star in the Awesomebar is not lit-up even though it it clearly a bookmark
