In Fx3.7a4/Linux (tested just here), items in toolbars whose place have been customized or habe been added or removed are reset in _new windows_ (and not at restart like in bug 319196).

At restart, in the first window, items are right at the chosen place.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open MozillaDeveloperPreview/3.7a4. Firefox is opened, and the first window is great, all is where it was customized for.
2. Open a new Firefox window.
Actual Results:  
The layout of the new window is reset.

Expected Results:  
The layout of all the new windows should be the same than the first one, with items in toolbars like the user have defined them.

If you close all windows and restart Firefox, no problem, the first window is right.
