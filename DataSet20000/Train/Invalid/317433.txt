Keyboard navigation keys are not working.

The keyboard navigation keys (i.e., Page Up, Page Down, Home, End) do not work in the Fx 1.5 rc's, including rc3 unless the focus is manually transferred to the page first by clicking the mouse button (for example).  This was an issue in Fx 1.x (1.04 I think) that was later fixed.  This now needs to be looked at again in Fx 1.5.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open the Mozilla home page
2.  Hit any of the four keyboard naviagation keys (Page Up, Page Down, Home, or End)
3.  Keys do not work!



Expected Results:  
Naviagation keys should work by default without having to manually set the page focus every time.  I use these keys all the time to quickly navigate web pages.
