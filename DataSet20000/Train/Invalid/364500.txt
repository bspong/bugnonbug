Toolbar Menus not opening properly.

After installing Firefox 2.0 today, I first noticed that the submenus in the bookmarks toolbar menu would not open, regardless of clicking or hovering.  I reinstalled 2.0 and created a new profile, but the problem is still happening.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open Firefox.
2.  Click on any Toolbar menu item (i.e. Bookmarks)
3.  The item is selected, but no menu drops down.
4.  Move mouse to where menu should be, and it appears.
5.  In Bookmarks menu (once it has appeared), submenu from folders open with hover at first.
6.  Hover over several, and come back to the first folder that opened.
7.  The menu will not open on a second (or subsequent) hover.  This happens for all submenus in Bookmarks.

Actual Results:  
I cannot consistently toolbar menus without hovering to where they should appear to make them appear.  In the Bookmarks menu specifically, the submenus only open on first hover/click, but not again.

Expected Results:  
If I click the toolbar menu item, the menu should appear right away.  In the bookmarks menu specifically, hovering over folders should automatically open submenus every time.

Firefox never crashed, nor have I had any errors.  The bookmarks themselves exist, because I can see them in the Bookmark Manager and can open them from there.  It appears to be a problem with the menus opening.

I do not have any other Mozilla software installed.
