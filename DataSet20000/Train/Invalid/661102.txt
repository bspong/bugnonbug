Charset from content-type meta tag ignored [Caused by invalid/missing attribute]

Displaying the attached file from my local file system (a file: URI), I usually get the wrong encoding: FF tries to interpret the latin1 content as utf8, rendering any non-ascii characters as a question mark in a black diamond.

Last time I investigated, it suddenly started rendering correctly. Now it's back to bad. I have no clue what made it work last time around.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Save attached file to disk
2. Open that file locally in FF


Actual Results:  
First line displays the missing glyph symbol instead of the ä


Expected Results:  
Both lines should look alike


Workaround is selecting the charset manually.

I would guess this is a regression in FF4. My start page is a local html document using latin1, and at some point it started breaking. I guess it was after switching from FF3 to FF4, but I'm not totally sure.
