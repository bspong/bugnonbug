Including the word "home" as part of the url results in the error ... Unable to determine IP address from host name for home

In the tools->options dialog box, if I define firbird's home page to be my
companies intranet homepage such as home or http://home/ Then the page cant be
found. I get the old "Unable to determine IP address from host name for home". 
I have to use http://intranet.globespanvirata.com/ to get it to work.
The isnt a problem with the Internet Explorer browser. I dont want to use
Internet Explorer but I need FireBird to support this address. 

You see inconvenience is that the software we write has hyperlinks and web
addresses embedded in the comments and we can open up design documents as we
look at our source code. The legacy code is full of links using the word home as
part of the address to the document. Firebird cant open these documents which is
a real drag. Please correct this.

Thanks
