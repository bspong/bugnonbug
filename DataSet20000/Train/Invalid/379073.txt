Interaction issues with Joomla administrator.

Joomla Administrator is not recognizing text entered into the HTML fields and is not sending mass mails through the system. It began with the new build 2.0.0.3, but was working fine before.

The problem is happening in both the MASS Mail (standard installation) and YANC (Yet Another Newsletter Component, custom install).

It is also happening on both Macs and PCs, we had three people experiencing the same issue, while on the phoe working through it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into a standard Joomla install with Firefox 2.0.0.3
2. Try to send a newsletter with Mass Mail.
3. Mass Mail will tell you to fill in the form (even though it is filled in...)
Actual Results:  
The Mass Mail system will not send or work. YANC will accept the text, but not send it out (it sends blank email templates, not recognizing the text entered.

It will not save any text entered, either. It completely ignores text there.

Expected Results:  
Normally, there is no problem entering and saving text in Joomla. in fact, Firefox has been a godsend as far as working with Joomla on the Mac.

If you do not have an install available to you, I can offer you a test site to play with... ;-)

We are not using a special theme, all three of us updated firefox this week, and never had these problems before (although Safari for the Mac DOES have these same issues).

hundreds of thousands of people use Joomla, and this bug brings some actions n Joomla to a stand still. VERY frightening.
