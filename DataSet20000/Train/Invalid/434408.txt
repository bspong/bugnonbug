extreme memory caching causes the browser to hung
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30)
Build Identifier: Firefox 3 RC1

At first,  firefox opens using 63708KB memory with two tabs.
Then uses 66752KB with two tabs plus one new blank tab.
Then uses 120972KB with three tabs. The page contains lots of link but the whole web page is not more than 100KB.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open firefox.
2. open new tab.
3. open a page with many (non-broken) links.
Actual Results:  
The browser hungs everytime it opens a new page. It loads extreme amount of memory.

Expected Results:  
Open the page as usual. The links I opened have been opened with version 3 beta 5 and version 2.14 and I dont get any problem browsing.

I am using the default browser theme. I'm using XP SP2. Though I'm using a tweaked file system to support other XP themes, I am using the Luna which doesn't seem to have any problem.
