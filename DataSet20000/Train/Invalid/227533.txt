Using OS X 10.3 (all available updates installed) and Firebird 0.7.1 (first
install on this machine) I installed the NewsMonster extension (latest build).
Installer reported a java error. I restarted Firebird nd could not use any
button on the Navigation toolbar and the URL box remains blank for all pages I
go to.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install NewsMonster extension
2.Restart Firebird
3.

Actual Results:  
"Java not found or unaccessible. Please install java." was the gist of the error
message. Java console had a string of messages but they are erased after
disabling the NewsMonster extension and restarting FireBird. The problem does
not seem to affect the rest of the system or other browsers.

Expected Results:  
N/A. Delighted with Firebird browser thus far. I am not addicted to Newmonster
and will continue to use FireBird regardless.  Bravo.

Bluemonkey theme. Matches my SmarterMail webmail very nicely
Still able to use all other toolbars. 
NewsMonster does not function at all of course. 

Installed extensions:
Needlesearch
Grippies
Advanced search sidebar

No Plugins installed

NO issues after disabling the extension and restarting the browser
