In the beginning the crashes seemed random. But it's now isolated to happen when browsing www.aftonbladet.se . More specific when clicking on any link with an "E24" symbol in front of it (link to another site) computer will instantly reboot without any warning (not happening every time but maybe 1 out of 3 times, and is reproducible). 

Example of such a link from "view source":
<h2 class="abS50">
<a href="http://www.e24.se/branscher/konsumentvaror/artikel_551513.e24" >Nu höjs ölpriset</a>
</h2>

No problems what so ever using IE7 or FF2. Problems started with FF3 RC1 and is still a problem in final FF3.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.aftonbladet.se
2. Click on a link with "E24"-symbol next to it (to the left).
3.
Actual Results:  
Computer reboots hard.

Expected Results:  
Opened the link in a new tab.

Using adblock plus plugin. No other special browser settings.
Some "special" system setup: I use Vista 32bit with 4gb of ram (only 3 is showing up). I have two ATI video cards in surround view configuration (motherboard radeon 3200 + radeon 3470 PCI-E) on a 780G motherboard.

I use the latest drivers and no other crashes or problems in any other programs have been noticed. I have tested my RAM for errors - they are 100% fine.
