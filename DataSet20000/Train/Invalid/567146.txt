Opening Gmail inbox page in standard view (secure) and/or opening any email message or link causes Firefox to lag in gmail and all other tabs, ultimately resulting in 100% CPU usage.  Scrolling on pages in all tabs also halts in spots while the browser "catches up."  Switching between tabs also lags.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Sign into Gmail via https://www.gmail.com
2.  Open inbox page
3.  Scroll inbox
4.  open any email message
5.  click links (ie. 'delete', 'forward')
6.  click mouse into 'reply' box, begin typing
7.  switch tabs
8.  scroll page
Actual Results:  
1.  Login page loaded normally
2.  Inbox page loads
3.  Scrolling halts
4.  Message link response slow, message opens slowly
5.  Link response lags
6.  Text response lags; typing halts mid-word
7.  Slow tab switch
8.  Scrolling halts

Expected Results:  
1.  Login page loads normally
2.  Inbox page loads
3.  Scrolling smooth
4.  Message link quick, instantaneous; message opens quickly
5.  No response lag
6.  No text response lag; typing normail without halts
7.  Switch tabs at click
8.  Smooth scrolling
