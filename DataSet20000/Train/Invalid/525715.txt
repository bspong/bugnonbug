I do not use a theme.  I have a Mid 2007 iMac with 4 GB of RAM and the dual core processor.  Firefox has had occasional trouble on this computer in the past (eight or nine months ago) but has been far more stable on this computer then it ever was on Wierdoze (Windows), until now.  This build is the worst upgrade for Firefox I have ever been associated with.
