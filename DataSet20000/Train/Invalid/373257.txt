A large gray area appears on the bottom of my browser, taking up about 1/5th of the viewable screen (or reducing the viewable portion of webpages by 20%. To the left of this gray area are 2 small red arrows, both pointing up. I cannot click the arrows or the gray area - it just takes up space.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Mozilla firefox
2. The gray area appears every time
Actual Results:  
the gray area appeared along with the 2 small red arrows

Expected Results:  
the gray area should not appear, but rather the viewable portion of the webpage.
