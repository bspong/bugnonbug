Firefox only downloads and display the first 8kb of data from the html on the
server.

The file has 16.0 KB (16,486 bytes).

IE shows it perfectly.

I get this problem on all files Firefox downloads from this server (including
other htmls)

This dimensions.ath.cx server is a ultima online emulator server, and it does
not report anything about the browser accessing it.

3. check site, more than half is missing.
