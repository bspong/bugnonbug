When Firefox launches, it appears the buttons aren't being constructed from image sprites properly.

Taken at face value, it just looks like i've got way too many buttons, but I think it's just that the buttons aren't being sized properly and the image sprites aren't being positioned.  Maybe a missing or invalid stylesheet?

This occurs regardless of whether or not I remove the existing com.mozilla.firefox.plist prefs file.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download firefox beta
2. Add to applications folder
3. Launch firefox
Actual Results:  
As described above

Expected Results:  
HUD buttons and address bar, toolbars, etc, should be rendered as usual.
