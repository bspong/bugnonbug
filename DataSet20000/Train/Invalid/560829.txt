Highlighter jumping out of target during inspection (reticle)
When inspector is active and highlighting dynamically, mousemoves inside the panel are causing a region outside of the panel to be highlighted.

I'm using document.elementFromPoint(event.clientX, event.clientY) to get the node to highlight, and the values in the console appear to verify that I have the correct coordinates, so there's something extra fishy here.

Need more time to debug this.

Note that this bug relies on the code in patches from bug 547453.
