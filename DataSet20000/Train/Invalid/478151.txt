I have just undergone the 300th upgrade for Firefox. When will they stop tinkering with something that USED to work well. Now I get almost weekly  interruption of word on both computers so that FireFox can load, abort , load abort, tell me of an update and then update when I least expect it.

When will computer Geeks figure out that owner bought their computers to do work and Can not be at the Mecy of computer software companies to hawk their trial versions on the consuming public. 

How many hours have you wasted while your computer mysterious goes into the GRAY mode while some software update is being downloaded in the background and you have type the "a" for the three hundreeth time and it's just waiting there?

Computer software companies need to be made more accountable of consumers time.
