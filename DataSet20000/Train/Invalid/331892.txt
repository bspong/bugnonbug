Live bookmark "Latest news" for Italian Firefox 1.5.X chrashes the site pointing to
In the Italian localization of Firefox we changed the english (BBC) Live bookmark "Latest news" to point to an Italian resource. We used a redirect in our site (http://www.mozillaitalia.org/fxfeed.xml ) that point to http://www.euronews.net/rss/euronews_it.xml

We chose that solution to avoid any undesired link change by the content provider, but we underestimate the growth of Firefox and now all the contacts generated by the live bookmarks crashes Apache in our shared hosting, generating  a major outage of all our web resources (http://www.mozillaitalia.org and http://forum.mozillaitalia.org ).

So we need that the link change ASAP in the default profile of new versions of Italian (it) Firefox 1.5.X, pointing directly to http://www.euronews.net/rss/euronews_it.xml or to a redirect managed by mozilla.org or mozilla-europe.org. 

I will create the patch for the bookmarks file after you indicate me what should I do...

Thank you
