Google.com / Firefox homepage and from Google search bar: localizes to German (google.de)

I believe this bug has been reported, however, it was labeled as fixed.  It is not.

After clearing "private data" the localization for Google search bar / Firefox Start Page / Google.com is still localizing to Google.de.  Not until you manually go to Google.com and click "Google in English," does the browser reset to US/English.  I am located in NJ on a Verizon IP - no use of proxy - Windows Vista 64-bit Home Premium.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clear Private Data (also reproduced when using 3rd party cleaners, ie: CCleaner)
2. Reopen Firefox. Start page is now in German.
3. Run search from either start page or search bar - results are in German.
Actual Results:  
Google.de in German

Expected Results:  
Google.com in English/US
