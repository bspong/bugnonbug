as in the summary. uninstall flash plug-in will solve the crash problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.install firefox2.0.0.9
2.install flash plug-in at adobe(latest version 9.0.47)
3.open a page containing flash movie
Actual Results:  
firefox crashes, windows98se pops up a dialog box saying the application should be closed.

Expected Results:  
it should open the page containing flash.

The workaround: install a previous version of flash. Specifically, version 9.0.28 is OK with firefox, all after that will cause crash. Also version 9.0.28 will be installed to firefox's "plugins" folder, while version after that will be installed to window98se system folder. It maybe relevant. Thank Noah at #firefox for giving the link to previous version.
