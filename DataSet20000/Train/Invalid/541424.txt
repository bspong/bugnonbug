If you go to the CNET news site it displays a popup in the lower right corner asking you to either sign in or join their network. You only get this once per browser session. I click on "no thanks" but since I don't save cookies for that web site if it sets one its lost.

I'm using Firefox 3.6 under Vista and have block pop-up enabled. I have three web sites listed as exceptions (pandora, expedia, and travelocity). The exceptions list works as expected.

To be fair Opera 10.10 and Chrome 4.0.249.78 beta don't block popups on http://news.cnet.com/ either.

 

Reproducible: Always
