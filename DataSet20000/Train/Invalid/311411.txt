Norton Personal Firewall keeps requesting what  to do when I move to each  web page

Norton Personal Firewall(2003)has become annoying and I end up disabling it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Before my homepage opens I have to permit the Firewall to let the program open
2.Each new website requires same procedure
3.Each new web page similarly.



Expected Results:  
It should not be requesting what to do so often
