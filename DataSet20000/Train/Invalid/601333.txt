When I visit the getfirebug link I automatically get an add-on failure notification by the small add-on icon on the left hand side of the address bar. The notification reads
"The add-on could not be downloaded because of a connection failure on addons.mozilla.org"
I tried it with firefox3.6 and it works. Also the same problem occurs even if you click the "Get firebug for firefox" link 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to firebug
2.Installing it using "Get firebug for firefox" link
3.or simply going on that website
Actual Results:  
The add-on could not be downloaded because of a connection failure on addons.mozilla.org

error shown by the add-on icon

Expected Results:  
Firebug should have been downloaded ! 

works on 3.6 but not on Minefield FF4.0b7
