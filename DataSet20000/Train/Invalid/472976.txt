firefox crash makes IE unresponsive
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; CIBA)
Build Identifier: firefox 3.0.5

my firefox crashed hours ago and I restarted it seconds later, but this time, when I clicked the don't restore in the pop out session manager, firefox became unresponsive, I had to shut it down in task manager. then I had to use IE7 to surf the net. what I found was IE7 became unrsponsive,too
I restart my PC, IE7 works well. I then open firefox, session manager poped out again and firefox became unresponsive again, IE7 also became unresponsive later
I restalled my windows XP, the bug was still there
but this bug didn't affect safari and opera, IE7 was the only victim.
I had to uninstall firefox temporalily and use IE7 as an alternative.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open firefox
2.session manager pops up
3.both firefox and IE7 unresponsive[I cannot surf the net now]
