Hello everyone,

Let's get straight to the point: A script in Firefox freezes at startup. For dutch people, see below, for people with other languages, i'll do my best to translate:

"Een script op deze pagina is bezig, of het reageert niet meer. U kunt het script nu stoppen, of u kunt verdergaan om te zien of het script zal worden voltooid.

Script: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox%203%20Beta%202/components/nsExtensionManager.js:2097"

English translation:

"A script is busy on this page, or it doesn't react anymore. You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete.

Script: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox%203%20Beta%202/components/nsExtensionManager.js:2097"

For your information: I've had this problem already in Firefox 2.0.0.9, I didn't do anything strange, I barely use extensions, I'm Dutch and a very bad translator. Also please note that probably nobody else has this problem, what means that this is less inportant than other problems.

Thanks in advance,
... eh... Somebody. :P
