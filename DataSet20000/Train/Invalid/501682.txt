when using the addon "reload every" on the new version of firefox 3.5, I get the above error repeatedly.  It doesn't matter if I have 2 tabs or 12 tabs open reloading.  It only seems to happen when using the reload every.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open a few tabs in firefox.
2.  Set reload every to 5 seconds and enable all tabs.
3.  Wait.
Actual Results:  
After just 1-2 minutes, I received the error A script on this page has been stopped due to a low memory condition. 

Expected Results:  
Tabs should just reload every 5 seconds with no errors.  

I had no problems with the previous versions of Firefox.  I would like to have the Firefox 3.0.10 again until this is resolved, how do I do that?  I also don't know how to check and see what "theme" I'm using.
