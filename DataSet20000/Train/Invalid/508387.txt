I've been using this addon for a while:
http://urandom.ca/nosquint/
it allows me to set certain zoom settings per page, and control at the same time both page and text zoom, unlike Firefox default.

earlier on 3.6, support for this addon broke. it was later fixed with addon version 2.0b6.
but with yesterday firefox build, support got broken again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.set a zoom setting for a page
2.reload the page or change to another
3.
Actual Results:  
zoom defaults to 100% but addon states its the old value

Expected Results:  
for firefox to keep user set zoom
