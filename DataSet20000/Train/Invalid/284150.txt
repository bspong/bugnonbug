installation broken when installing 1.0.1 over 1.0PR zip firefox folder
this may or may not be an edge case, but filing because I can reproduce it.

0. grab a .zip (compressed, non-installer) of firefox 1.0PR: it can be either
unpatched or patched 0.10.1 version (bug still occurs with both).

1. decompress and launch 1.0PR --I've tried with both a fresh profile and an
existing profile I had created with ffox 1.0 (official release).

2. add some bookmarks, surf around and develop some global history, try out the
Find toolbar in a couple of pages. that all works fine.

3. go to install the 1.0.1 .xpi (click on
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/experimental/update/en-US-1.0-1.0.1.xpi)

4. run through the installer, but do a Custom installation so that you can
select the *same* folder you had installed 1.0PR at (in step 1).

5. after the installer completes, it won't autolaunch ffox, as expected, so
double-click the desktop icon to start ffox.

results: while ffox 1.0.1 did install (confirm by looking at about:), I see
these problems:

- all of the bookmarks are gone
- the default start (home) page is blank
- when I do load a page and try to use the Find toolbar, found items are *not*
highlighted anymore.
