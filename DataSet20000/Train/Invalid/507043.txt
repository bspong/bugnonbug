XP system crash (blue screen) upon Firefox (3.5.1) with Google toolbar (3.0.20090324W).

After upgrade to Explorer 8.0.6001.18702, the system crashes (blue screen) when I open Firefox (3.5.1).  This occurs if Google toolbar (3.0.20090324W) is enabled.  It is possible to open Firefox (if the toolbar is disabled before closing the previous time), enable the toolbar, and then restart Firefox.  In fact, the blue screen only happens the first time that Firefox is loaded after a restart or shutdown (I have reproduced the problem many times, but can avoid it entirely by using Stand By rather than shut down ("turn off")).  The hardware is an ASUS Eee PC. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Upgrade to Internet Explorer 8.0.6001.18702
2. Enable Google toolbar
3. Restart the computer.
4. Start Firefox
Actual Results:  
Blue screen system crash.

Expected Results:  
Opened Firefox.
