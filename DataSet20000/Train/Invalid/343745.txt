Copyright symbols and foreign accent marks, such as Pele', appear as ? marks. Before yesterday, they appeared correctly.

I have just noticed that the copyright sign (c) does not display properly. Nor do foreign accents such as the acute "e'", along with the trademark sign. Examples are provide from my homep page. Interesting, on my other web site, www.sanstefano.com, the copyright symbol appears properly on the home page. 

These features appear properly with MS IE 6.0.

Examples:

F&#65533;tbol
(Pel&#65533;).

SitePal&#65533; (trademark sign)

Thank you.

Reproducible: Always

2. View the top of the page. The words "Futbol and Fussbol" do not display properly.
3. In the credits section at the bottom of the page, the copyright and trademark symbols don't display properly.

Actual Results:

(Pel&#65533;).

SitePal&#65533; (trademark sign)
