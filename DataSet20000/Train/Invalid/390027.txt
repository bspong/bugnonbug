Memory leak after loading large HTML document

The single document (English) version of the PHP manual (html format) (about 11Mb) is download onto the local hard drive.

Firefox 2.0.0.5 is then started with a "small" page viz., the Google search page. At this stage Task Manager reports the firefox process using about 60,000K of memory.

A new tab is then created and into that tab the PHP Manual is loaded using File -> Open. The amount of memory used by the firefox process is reported as about 160,000K. If the "PHP tab is closed, the memory used by the firefox process decreases marginally to about 158,000K. After a further 5 to 10 minutes (without any firefox events, the used memory drops to about 154,000K and remains constant.

If a new tab is now created and the PHP Manual loaded, the memory used is reported at about 230,000K. If the tab is then closed the memory once again drops by about the same ratio as before to about 220,00k and remains constant at that level of memory usage. At this point, if another relatively large application is started (in my case winword (version 2003)), then the memory used by firefox drops by about 55,000K and at the same time task manager reports that the memory usage by winword is about 53,000K.

N.B., I have never been able to find a methodology whereby the amount of memory used by firefox comes back to the usage level when it is first loaded.

If firefox is completely terminated at this point and restarted with only the Google search page, the memory used is, as above, at about 60,000K.

This memory usage scenario is 100% reproducible.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. see details above
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
see above

Expected Results:  
see above

Released all the memory used when the PHP manual was loaded, once the PHP Manual tab is closed.
