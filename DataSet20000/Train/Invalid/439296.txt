Hello,

i've been trying firefox 3 rc1 on kubuntu hardy since it came out on 11th june. I've had so many "freezes", completes OS freezes while using firefox. That hasn't happened to me using other browsers or even earlier versions of firefox 3, like beta 5.

The thing is.... for example:

I'm i a website with a simple html form. When i press on the "submit" botton, firefox and the whole kubuntu freeze, and i have to press the reset button.

Other situations when i've experienced this whole hanging thing is when i've got several tabs opened and i close one by pressing the "middle botton" from the mouse. Also when there's a simple html link and i use the middle botton to open up the link in a new tab.

As this hasn't happened to me with other browsers or firefox versions, i guess there's must be something wrong with this version of firefox.

Just let me know if i can provide you with any extra information you need.

The details of my system are:

firefox version:

firefox-3.0                                3.0~rc1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.1                  safe and easy web browser from Mozilla

kubuntu version:
2.6.24-18-generic #1 SMP  x86_64 GNU/Linux

Thanks.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open some tabs with different web sites.
2.In one of them try to open up a http link by pressing the middle button from the mouse
3.If your system doesn't freeze, try closing one tab by pressing the middle botton again.



It doesn't always happens, i don't actually now how to make it always happen.
