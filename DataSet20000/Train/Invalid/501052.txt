While trying to install "Forex Currency Converter 1.3" from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7908, it says "This add-on is for older versions of Firefox". Ideally the latest version of firefox should support all the add-ons that are compatible with the previous versions

Reproducible: Always
