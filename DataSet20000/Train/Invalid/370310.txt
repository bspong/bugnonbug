Ctrl-K sends FF to Google's Firefox Start instead of placing cursor in web search box

Using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl-K is supposed to put the cursor in the web search box normally in the upper right corner of Firefox. However, something has happened to mine (and a few others throughout the internets): Ctrl-K now causes Firefox to go to Google's Firefox Start page instead of putting the cursor in the search box.

One temporary fix is to right-click the toolbar area, choose customize, remove the search box and then add the search box back to the toolbar. This fixes the Ctrl-K behavior until the browser is restarted (at least in my case... I believe that it has permanently fixed others' similar issues).

What else can I provide to highlight the problem? I don't tihnk the "Steps to Reproduce" will recreate the problem for many people. But it did start happening with FF2.0 for me.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Press Ctrl-K


Actual Results:  
Firefox Start page at Google loads instead of putting the cursor in the search box

Expected Results:  
The cursor is placed in the web search box
