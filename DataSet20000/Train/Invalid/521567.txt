While downloading a 3.5 GB file, the file size became negative in the downloads window.

While downloading a 3.5 GB file, the file size became negative in the downloads window. This does not affect the downloaded file. FireTorrent was in use at the time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have FireTorrent installed.
2. Download a 3.5 GB file through FireTorrent (An linux distribution, for example).
3. Watch it sometime past 1 or 2 GB.
Actual Results:  
The file size became negative at some point, I would assume 2GB (The computer was abandoned at 1GB and it was working then), since 32-bit signed integers would overflow at that point and cause the specified problem.

Expected Results:  
The downloads window should have shown the positive size; ~3.5 GB

I was using FireTorrent at the time; it is entirely possible that the problem actually resides in it; but if Firefox uses 32-bit signed integers for the file size downloaded, Firefox is at fault.
