I have used Mozilla for many years without any problems until a couple of weeks ago.  I have a keyboard that has been functioning properly, but I recently noticed that I can't use my 'page down' and my 'arrow down' keys to scroll up/down as I used to use them when reading a page/article on the INTERNET.  

Before these 2 problems arose, when I used to use the 'down arrow' key, the page would scroll down one line each time I hit the key.  The same for the 'page down' key,  except the screen would move down one page at a time. 

Now the 'page down' key sends the screen to the end of the article OR NOT move the page at all.

Now, 'down arrow' key causes the entire screen to scroll instantly to the bottom of the page. 

NOTE:   These 2 keys function properly when I use Internet Explorer!   Which I don't want to use.    Thank you for your attention.   Gary
