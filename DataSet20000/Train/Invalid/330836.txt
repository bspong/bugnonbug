Flash ActionScripts in Firefox trigger action in Safari & Internet Explorer

We discovered that the Flash plug-in in Firefox will send messages to the Flash plug-in in another browser. We have only tested this with both browsers have pages from the same domain open. But, I am worried that this could target .swf files on other domains and represent a security issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://www.dreamworksanimation.com/dwa/opencms/movies/movie_sharktale.html in both Firefox and Safari/Internet Explorer.
2. click on one of the teaser trailers in Firefox


Actual Results:  
The trailer will now play in Safari/Internet Explorer

Expected Results:  
The trailer should only play within the window that it was in.

I have tested this on Mac OS X 10.4 and a friend has tested this on Windows XP and we have had the same results. Please do not make the URL public, because we don't want people to target the website.
