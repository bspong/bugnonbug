I downloaded weather forecaster for desktop and nothing comes up except a 'bar' at bottom of my screen and script - <menuitem label="&ff.main.options.label;"accesskey="&ff.main.options.acesskey;"default="true" oncommand="window.openDialog........   Then I run out of screen.   It has affected my main browser window in Firefox AND Netscape.   I did a System restore but it is still there.  HOW CAN I GET RID OF IT/CORRECT IT PLEASE?!  Thanks.
