After update Firefox cannot show any web pages.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.17 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Safari/530.17
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Today, I was browsing the net, then firefox said, it downloaded 3.5.2 update, and is it ok to restart firefox. I said ok. But when firefox restarted it couldn't connect any web page at all.. I checked with other browsers, there is no connection problem at all. BTW, I don't use any proxy.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Update to 3.5.2
2. Restart firefox
Actual Results:  
Firefox couldn't connect to any web pages. It only shows:

Unable to connect

Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at en-us.www.mozilla.com.

    *   The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few moments.

    *   If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network connection.

    *   If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have worked normally.

I have adblocker, noscript, foxmarks installed but these add-ons were always installed so I don't think that's relevant.
