Sometimes when I bookmark a page using Ctrl+D, the Page Bookmarked dialog appears uninitialised. It displays all possible fields (Name, Location, Feed Location, etc.) but all are blank, including the Folder menu.

The page is successfully bookmarked (added to to the Bookmarks menu).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. bookmark page with Ctrl+D
2. Page Bookmarked dialog appears uninitialised
Actual Results:  
Dialog is uninitialised; fields are blank

Expected Results:  
Dialog should be initialised appropriately for the bookmarked page, showing just the Name, Folder and Tags fields.
