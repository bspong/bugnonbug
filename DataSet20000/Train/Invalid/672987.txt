Apple Left (Command Left) fails to go back.
Hello,

Firefox 5.0. Mac OS X 10.6.8.

I create a new Firefox tab. I go to www.google.fr . I enter penguin. I have
the Google Instant search turned off. I press Return. I get the Web results. In the black top bar, I click on Images. I get the Images results. The annoying new Google Images results, with intrusive zoom and pseudo-pages. I want to go back to the Web results, so I press Apple Left (Command Left). This must go back. This does crap in the Google Images results, but does not go back.
I tried a lot of things, including clicking in the page background, but no way to make this keyboard equivalent do its job.

This is a key ;-) feature of all Web browsers. This must work consistently, as expected. Even if some Web designer at Google thinks otherwise.

Thanks for correcting that,

Nicolas
