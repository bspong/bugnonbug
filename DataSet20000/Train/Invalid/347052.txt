Firefox opens a new tab every five minutes.  I am running win xp pro sp2 with all the updates and the latest version of firefox with callingid and google extetions.
it doesent matter what site I am on the problem keeps ocurring.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start the browser
2.begin surfing
3.wait a few minutes

Actual Results:  
Blank tabs were opened automatically every few minutes.  I've restarted firefox and the system but the problem persists.

Expected Results:  
firefox should wait until I click on new tab to open a tab.  I don't accidently hit control t either.

even when I am running only a window without a menu or toolbars a new window pops up with a blank tab and keeps on adding tabs.  It maximizes the window automatically whenever a tab is created and opens a new window if there is only an untabbed window running.
