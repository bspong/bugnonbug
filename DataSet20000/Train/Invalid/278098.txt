I am using firefox for both Linux and winXp.

There is a feature I would like but don't think exists, yet.

To automatically update [refresh] a website on a user defined periodic basis.
I have a few weather sites which I connect to as a grouped tab home and 3 of the
4 are weather sites.
One has a built in auto refresh from the source, the others do not.

In Linux Mozzilla this feature exists as 'Auto Reload' as a tab pulldown mouse
window and a popup to set the timeout value.

This feature I like and use always.


One other thing:
In Linux Mozzilla I can set a bookmark to always open in a new tab, but in winXp
firefox I have to use the mouse to open these via a pulldown menu each time I
open any bookmark.
I much prefer the Mozzilla way.

Reproducible: Always
