When setup so that there are subfolders in Bookmarks Folders, hovering the mouse over folder does not open folder.

This is a new issue that I noticed with Firefox 1.0.7.  When there are folders
in folders in the Bookmarks of Firefox, hovering over the first folder opens the
next group, but hovering over the folder inside the folder (With the exception
being the top folder inside the folder), closes the bookmarks.  It is possible
to get this to work if you move your mouse verrrry slowly...  If anyone has any
further questions please E-Mail me, as I would be willing to do anything I can
in order to get this corrected as it is very annoying.  I hope I described the
issue well...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click Bookmarks
2.Hover over folder in Bookmarks
3.Hover over subfolder in folder in Bookmarks (Not the first folder)
4.Bookmarks closes...

Actual Results:  
Bookmarks closes.

Expected Results:  
Open the subfolder.  This worked in Firefox 1.0.1-1.06.  The issue only exists
in Firefox 1.0.7
