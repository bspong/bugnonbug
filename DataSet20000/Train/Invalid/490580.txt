After the firefox update this week sometimes ( this due to autoupdate feature in firefox) the add-ons such as FireBug is no longer working.
FireBug cannot be opened anymore.
Also, and website that has popup doesn't work. 
Example: http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html  clicking on the  TimeZones button does nothing.  ( it was all fine until the new update for firefox was done ).

Reproducible: Always
