Firefox 4/5 submits GET form with POST data from subsequent form
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0

My intranet page has multiple forms with properly formed and closed tags. Two are SELECT drop down boxes with onchange javascript submit. For my second SELECT form, Firefox 4/5 includes POST name-value pairs data from a subsequent form erroneously through the GET method.  This shows in the address bar and my web server throws an error page because the GET data was too long.  Firefox 3.6.17, IE9, and latest Chrome do not do this.  I presume that this is a new unfixed bug in Firefox 4, and upgrading to 5.0 has not solved the problem.  This happens whether I use document.forms.formname.submit() or document.getElementById('formname').submit()

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
Firefox should not have grabbed form elements past the </form> tag from another form tag.
