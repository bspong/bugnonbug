Yellow bar when using encrypted connection is gone

In Firefox 2 the URL field got coloured yellow when an encrypted webpage was visited which was very useful because of being an eye-catcher.

As of Firefox 3, this feature no longer exists and it is much harder to see if the web page is encrypted (only some eyecandy on the left side of the URL bar and a lock at the bottom of Firefox). I have also tried the Windows build, and it is the same with it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit https://bugzilla.mozilla.org
2. Look at the URL bar
3.
Actual Results:  
You do not see that you are visiting an encrypted web page at first look.

Expected Results:  
Should be colored yellow at best.
