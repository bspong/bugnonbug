A page that freezes Firefox 2 for a while
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; fr; rv:1.8.1.7) Gecko/20070914 Firefox/2.0.0.7

This page freezes Firefox 2, reproducted on 3 different computers, and in safe mode. Since it's a Google page, it cannot be a Javascript problem I guess.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox 2 in safe mode
2. Load the address http://www.google.fr/search?q=man+fopen
3. Wait quite a long time before Firefox responds again!
Actual Results:  
Firefox freezes for a minute or so

Expected Results:  
Should load the page! Even IE7 can do it!

The actual result must come from one of the Google results, that may contain some piece of crap.

Important: Firefox does NOT crash if his user agent is changed using UserAgentSwitcher.
