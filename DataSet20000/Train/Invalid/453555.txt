When you open a new window via javascript, if the user drag and drop any text, including pdf text, onto location bar, the user may change location url and navigate for instance into google or another search engine. The location bar shows a "go to" icon "->" to navigate outside the website, but if you try to change that url by typing, the location bar is blocked.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a window via javascript, try open a PDF file, for instance.
2. Drag any text into location bar and clik the arrow icon.
3. You are outside the original site.
Actual Results:  
The user can navigate outside the original site, when no link is placed to do that, of course.

Expected Results:  
The user must not navigate outside.

The user just can navigate via hyperlink to another page or to the same page, via anchor, not dragging and dropping text into location bar. Instead, why the location bar is locked to typing?
