A top level domain website page sets a cookie for the domain as the toplevel:

cookie.domain = example.com

I can confirm the cookie exists as a session cookie for that domain.

If I then navigate to a subdomain such as news.example.com where data set into the parent domain cookie is required to maintain logon, the cookie is not sent by the browser. Subdomains should receive cookies set by the parent domain.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create website on parent domain which sets session cookie
2. navigate to subdomain address
3. watch header of request for cookie from parent domain
Actual Results:  
Cookie for parent domain not sent in header of subdomain request.

Expected Results:  
subdomain receives parent domain cookie.
