I've been developing a Google Maps custom map for some time now. And my main development browser is Firefox due to the many useful extensions for it.

However I've been ecountering a rather strange issue on my main development box. It seems that showing an info window in Google Maps with form elements can make the render stop working in a specific window.

The issue seems to be localized to just this box. But with no idea how solve it my AJAX development environment is seriously broken.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click 'Add Marker'
2. Click on map
3. Click 'Add Marker'
2. Click on map

Actual Results:  
The 'add marker' will work first time I try. But second time it will make the window freeze. The window seems to respond as if nothing is wrong (except the displayed content is never updated again).

I can open another window and it'll work fine. And I can also close the window with the issue just fine.

Expected Results:  
A new 'Add Marker' info window showing where I click.

This seems to ONLY happen on my main development box (PowerMac G5 Dual 2GHz). But not on my other computers (PowerBook G4 and Windows XP box). And neither does it happen in any other Gecko-based browsers (Camino and Mozilla).

The issue persists even after having completly reset FireFox tho. And also in safe-mode.

This may be something wrong in the OS installation. But I have not observed any other similar issues. And I am not seeing any useful info in any log about what is happening.
