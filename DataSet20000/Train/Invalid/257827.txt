Delete Directory button name/dialog text mismatch in installer
Today's linux aviary nightly.

Attempting to install over an old Firefox install prompts the user with a
dialog, asking if the whole directory should be deleted. The text suggests the
user click the button " 'Delete Directory' ". The button is actually labeled
just "Delete".
