A <hr> tag with a style "height: 1px" is displayed the same as with "height: 2px". In other words, it is displayed to big. In the previous version (FF2) it was displayed correctly. Is doesn't matter if the style is given within the <hr> tag or via a CSS.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Create a html file like this:
<html>
<body>
<hr style="height: 1px">
</body>
</html>
Actual Results:  
The horizontal rule is displayed as it would be when the style was set to "height: 2px"

Expected Results:  
The horizontal rule should be displayed as a one pixel high line

In Firefox 2 this was rendered correctly
