Every website using flash will not display the flash file. It displays the quicktime Q with a questoin mark. I have removed and reinstalled firefox and quicktime. I have downloaded and installed shockwaver and flashplayer plugins. This problem has been happening for about 1-2 months.

Reproducible: Always
