When I use the gmail link from the google toolbar, whatever text is in the search box will be sent to gmail as a search of my mail.  So the link takes me to the search page of gmail with the results of whatever I typed into the search box last.  This may be a google toolbar bug, or just a strange interplay between the two.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type text into Firefox search box
2.Press the gmail button on the google toolbar
Actual Results:  
That text will be searched for in gmail and the button will take you to the results page instead of to the inbox

Expected Results:  
The software should have taken me to the inbox.
