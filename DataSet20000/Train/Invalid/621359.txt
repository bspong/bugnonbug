"Restore defaults" in search engine list does not use locale set in about:config

I accidentally somehow installed firefox with the my locale set as en-gb making all of my default search engines use the UK sites. However my real locale is en-us, so I changed that in the about:config. When restoring the default search engines it will still restore the en-gb engines and not the en-us ones.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox with the locale as en-gb
2. Go to about:config and change the general.useragent.locale key's value to en-us
3. Restore the default engines
Actual Results:  
The en-gb engines are restored

Expected Results:  
The en-us engines should be restored
