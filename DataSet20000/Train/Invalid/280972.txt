Essential navigation buttons missing: "Up" button, Clear Location Bar button, and Close button on tabs

Three small, but essential navigation tools are missing in Firefox: an "Up" 
button, a Clear location bar button, and a close button in each tab. 
 
The Up button would be located around the Back and Forward buttons (to the 
left), and functions as follows when clicked: 
1)If you're on a page with a query string in the URL, strip it and load the 
new URL. 
2)If you're at a page with a file at the end of the url, strip the file and 
load the new URL. 
3)If you're at a page with a directory at the end, go up one level, and load 
the new URL 
... or something to that effect; you get the idea. 
 
The clear location bar button simply clears the location bar to allow you to 
quickly and easily type in a new one. It would be located probably to the left 
of the Location: label. 
 
The close buttons on tabs should, at the very least, be a configurable option 
versus the "master" close button at the right of the tab bar, as it is now. I 
would submit that the "master" close button makes it easy to close the wrong 
tab, as the button doesn't have any visual cues to which tab you are closing; 
and it's easy to think "I want to close X tab" when that tab isn't currently 
active, click the close button, and then, after it's too late, realize you 
closed the wrong tab. Also, a tab button directly on the tab allows you to 
quickly close tabs that are not currently active without switching to them, 
thus saving time. 
 
I realize most or all of these features are available in Extensions, but I 
contend that these are basic, highly useful, and intuitive elements of 
navigation that should be included out-of-the box. Konqueror, for instance, 
has these controls and I find I'm able to navigate much more quickly using 
them. 
 
Thanks for your time!
