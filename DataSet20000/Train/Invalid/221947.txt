Firebird cannot open new tab - new tab is frozen

In first sorry for my English.

I found this problem in versions 0.5, 0.6 and 0.6.1. When I open about 30 (maybe
32 - it'd be logical) tabs, last opened tab will be frozen and in most cases I
cannot open next new tabs. And in this case I met one interesting thing: when I
was trying to open new tab, new tab was opened and frozen, but content of
requested page was opened in previous tab(!). And titles of pages were shifted
by one. So I think that there is a overflow of some variable or only partial
incrementing... Did you met this problem? I cannot find it in known bugs.

This problem persists in  Linux stable versions of Firebird.

This problem was discovered in Mandrake Linux 9.0 and 9.1. On dial-up connection
and on GPRS connection.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Open in sequence more than 30 tabs (by click on roller) on background.

Actual Results:  
When this bug appeared I had to close whole program and start it again.


MyPC:
MDK 9.1 and 9.0, PC Athlon XP 2,1, 512 MB RAM, Ext3, kernel from 2.4.18 (mdk) to
 2.4.21-0.13mdk (now). I use Czech translation of Mandrake (not Firebird), but I
use more programs in English w/o problems.
