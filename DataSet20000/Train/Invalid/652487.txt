Context menu item to search the web for selected text should just use the user's default engine
It's really easy for users to encounter mode errors when they have momentarily changed their search engine to do a quick search of another site (wikipedia, amazon.com, etc).

I recommend that we keep the context menu search command stable, with the user's default as the main command, and a split menu exposing the additional search engines.  This would revert the change made in bug 203959.

This way the search behavior will remain predicable.  Also it seems strange for the search bar to control the context menu, since the two controls are otherwise considerably detached.
