After upgrading from Firefox v3.5.7 to v3.6 the exception list located in "Firefox Preferences/Security/Passwords/Exceptions" is wiped out. Upon visiting a new password site such at Gmail, and being prompted by Firefox with "Do you want Firefox to remember the password for <user> on google.com?", and choosing "Never for This Site", the site is added to the exception list. However, as soon as Firefox is closed and reopened, the exception list is blank once again. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start with a version of Firefox v3.5.7 that has the exception list populated.
2. Upgrade to v3.6 of Firefox
3. Upon opening the browser after the upgrade, the exception list will be empty.
4. Add a new item to the exception list by visiting a password prompted site, and choosing to never remember the password.
5. Verify the existence of the exception that was just added.
6. Close and reopen the browser.
7. The exception list will now be empty.
Actual Results:  
The exception list is never retained.

Expected Results:  
Retain the site added to the exception list
