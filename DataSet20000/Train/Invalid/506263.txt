Upgrade to 3.5 did not port Identity Safe
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.12) Gecko/2009070611 Firefox/3.0.12 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Firefox 3.5

When I upgraded from 3.0.12 I lost Identity Safe add on which had all my logon and password information for many websites.  I went back to 3.0.12 and they were back.  But no matter what I do,  I cannot seem to get 3.5 to recognize/use Identity Safe, a Norton 360 Product.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install 3.0
2. Install and use Identity Safe
3. Install 3.5
Actual Results:  
Going back to 3.0 fixes problem.  I have done the install 3 times to 3.5 all with the same results.  It will not recognize Identity Safe

Expected Results:  
I expected 3.5 to work with my software which is very widespread since it is given to every Comcast.net customer as part of the cost of service.

Ported Identity safe and its information.
