AutoComplete in Address Bar doesn't work if 'http://' or a dot ('.') isn't present. URL which is clicked in dropdown menu isn't loaded.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030429 Mozilla Firebird/0.6

When you type an address of the page you want to visit, AutoComplete doesn't
work. This happens when the URL which should be AutoCompleted doesn't start with
www. \, or if the typed phrase doesn't contain 'http://' or a '.' somewhere.
Firebird then starts looking for the typed phrase, instead of AutoCompleting and
following the clicked URL in the dropdown list.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Mozilla Firebird (doesn't matter whether homepage is loaded or not)
2. type an address (for example 'bugzilla.mozilla.org') and close Phoenix (this
step, and also step 3, is needed if there isn't a webpage without 'www.' in the
AutoComplete cache)
3. Start Mozilla again
4. In the address bar type 'bugz' and click on the resulting
'http://bugzilla.mozilla.org' in the dropdown menu.

Actual Results:  
Mozilla Firebird starts trying to find webpages with 'bugz.com', 'bugz.net' and
so on.

Expected Results:  
It should have loaded the clicked 'http://bugzilla.mozilla.org'.
