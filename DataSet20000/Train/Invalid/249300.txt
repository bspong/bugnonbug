CSS doesn't display when XHTML Doctype(trans. or strict)  is specified
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040626 Firefox/0.9.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040626 Firefox/0.9.1

When viewing a site with the Doctype declared as XHTML (transitional or strict),
the CSS that is linked within that page will fail to render. This causes Firefox
to display unstyled content.

This page has the doctype declaration and will display unstyled content:
http://64.91.227.98/~spitting/index.php

This page has NO doctype declaration and will show the styled content:
http://64.91.227.98/~spitting/test.php

The pages are exactly the same except for the Doctype Declaration.

This may also hold true for any doctype declaration such as HTML 4.01
Transitional, etc.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a page with the Doctype declared as XHTML 1.0 (trans. or strict).
2. Ensure that the page has an external stylesheet linked to it.
3. When loading page, it will display unstyled content.

Actual Results:  
Was presented with unstyle content.

Expected Results:  
Shown the page has indicated here (http://64.91.227.98/~spitting/test.php) with
the styled content.



URL showing bad action: http://64.91.227.98/~spitting/index.php
URL showing page as should be: http://64.91.227.98/~spitting/test.php

I have confirmed that this is not a mime-type error on my server, as I thought
that when it first occurred.
