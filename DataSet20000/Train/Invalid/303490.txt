Freezes everytime the broswe starts for about 2 minutes, also when opening new
windows and sometimes you'll be broswing a site and you'll get somewhere that
has been loading and go back to the web page and won't load and you'll have to
restart the broswer! It has been like this for over 3 months. And all of this
doesn't go for any other broswer but still like this one better then IE and i
don't have any viruses or anything.

Reproducible: Always
