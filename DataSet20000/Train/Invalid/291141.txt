The start page and any other page i load is blank
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050319
Build Identifier: the new firefox

I cannot select any options from the toolbar, except when i left click I can
bring up the menu that says customize on it.   If i left click in the bookmark
toolbar i can bring up the menu with manage bookmarks on it.   If i try to pick
a bookmark to load, then the page stays white.   I am running windowsXP with
service pack 2.
    Also, a little box that says failure to authenticate appears in the top left
hand corner.   I think it is an old bookmark server trying to reach an account
which I no longer have.   This is most likely a bug with that program.    

 Thanks, sorry if this is a bad report, I am running out the door to work!.
