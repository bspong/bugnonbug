Under IE the top of the page appears to use JavaScript driven DIVs with alpha
blending to 'wipe' between DIVs.  This does not animate at all under Firefox. 
Could be an IE'ism, but maybe not.  Additionally, notice that the bottom right
most "box" on the page renders a different size under Firefox compared to IE6. 
All of the other content appears to render the same.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the page in IE6
2. Go to the page in Firefox
3. Observe the differences

Actual Results:  
The pages looked different

Expected Results:  
Rendered the pages the same, in as much as that is possible.
