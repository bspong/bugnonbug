I have two different free hit counters on this page: from GoStats.com and the eXTReMe-tracker (http://www.extreme-dm.com/tracking/) which both display properly their graphics in IExplorer, but no pictures come up in Firefox 1.5.0.2. Both counter codes use Javascript for the hit tracking. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.load the page
2.--
3.--

Actual Results:  
I've enabled every Java option in Firefox, but only the alias text shows up, no counter pictures. They do count, though, all Firefox versions, as I see in the statistics. There is no error message about the counters in the Javascript console, just a lot complaints about "unknown scrollbar properties".

Expected Results:  
I would want to have the counter pictures displayed. The eXTReMe tracker should show the purple ball and the GoStats display the hit numbers with brass-and-black number pictures.

I can see from the counter statistics, that Firefox shows up as browser more frequently, replacing Netscape. E.g. the uses for the ref. site: MSIE6 66.10%; Firefox1.5 12.71%; Safari 9.32%; Firefox1 6.78%; Mozilla1 1.69%; AOL9 0.85%; MSIE5 0.85%; Netscape7 0.85%; Firefox0.x 0.85%.
As webdesigner I want my pages to look good in ALL common browsers. Difficult task.
