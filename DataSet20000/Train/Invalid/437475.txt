after updating XP to SP3 Firefox will not start/open
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1) ; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; Media Center PC 3.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Firefox Setup 2.0.0.14.exe

Firefox was working as advertised until SP3 for XP was downloaded from MS and installed.  Then Firefox would not start/open.  Specifically, after clicking on Firefox the hourglass appears briefly and then disappears.  Checked task manager, nothing happening.  Waited 5 minutes and checked task manage again, nothing happening.

Uninstalled Firefox.  Downloaded and installed a clean version of Firefox Setup 2.0.0.14.exe from Mozilla website.  Firefox will not open.

Checked the MS website for issues with XP SP3, found a note that only IE7 works with XP SP3, earlier versions of IE will not work.  Perhaps that is the issue with Firefox.

Went to Control Panel (on my PC), then to Set Program Access and Defaults.  Mozilla Firefox is listed, but not checked.  So I checked it.  Upon clicking OK the selection defaults back to Use Default Browzer.  Firefox will not open/start.

Back to Control Panel (on my PC), then to Set Program Access and Defaults.  Removed access to IE.  Upon clicking OK, selection defaults back to permitting access to IE.

This PC is part of a 2 PC network.  The other PC OS remains XP SP2 and Firefox works without issue.
