When I go to lilo.go.dyndns.org/ and the click on the text that say HERE it
takes me to a ftp list. In that list after  lilo-22.5.7.2.announce.txt I start
getting strange characters. These characters look like a tall rectangle with
four letters in them or numbers in the same patter as a dice with the number
four on it. I have seen this on other pages before but lilo.go.dyndns.org is the
only place that it happens all the time.
