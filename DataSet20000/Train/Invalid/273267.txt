"disc" should be "disk"
This is from a reporter with an en-gb 1.0 Firefox Version:

>In the Firefox download manager, it says 'Save to Disc'. 
>
>Disc with a 'C' indicated an optical drive, such as a cd. By default
>most people will be saving to their hard drive. The correct word
>should be 'disk'.

BTW: It's "disk" in the en-us Version.
