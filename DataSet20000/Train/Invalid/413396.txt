While testing with the Ctrl-Alt-M feature in firefox for combining multiple windows into one tabbed window, I noticed the data in the forum I was working on did not port over. Instead, it seems a new session is created for the forum in the tabbed window. This would be fatal if the user was in the middle of witting an email...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.N/A
2.
3.


Expected Results:  
Ported over the user session over to the tabbed window

It would be great if session data/activities were ported over to the tabbed window.
