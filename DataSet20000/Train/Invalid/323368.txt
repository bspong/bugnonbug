i just updated firefox and now middle clicking links doesn't do anything at all. and i cant find any option that activates the middle button to make it work. i even deleted this version and reinstalled a previous and the problem remains


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open mozilla
2.try to middle click a link to open it in a new tab
3.fail

Actual Results:  
absolutely nothing. hence the problem

Expected Results:  
opened the seleted link or bookmark in a new tab

i had no theme or anything, just the basic firefox window. also there is no option anywhere that i could find that reactivates middle clicking. adding that option in the options menue would be good
