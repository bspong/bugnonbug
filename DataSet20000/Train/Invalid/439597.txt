When I open a HTML page stored in an SVN repository, then instead of being rendered it will be displayed as plain text.
This applies to all versions of Firefox.
IE handles such cases correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the SVN URL pointing to an HTML file with Firefox

Actual Results:  
Contents of the file are displayed as plain text.

Expected Results:  
HTML file will be rendered as HTML.
