This happens on firefox 3b5 on Windows 2000

Just go to the URL above. Shows

in status bar.

This seems to frequently happen on pages with 3b5, but not 3b4. Occasionally a
page will get through when redisplayed so this may be a timing/intermittent
bug.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to URL
2. If it works brows a few more slashdot pages
3.
Actual Results:  
Hangs, showing 

waiting for pagead2.googlesyndication.com...

in status bar.
