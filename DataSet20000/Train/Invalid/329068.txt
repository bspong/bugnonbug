Need a way to keep both history and websites in view
Since history sidebar is replaced by Places, I can't keep history and requested websites in view at the same time. In order to click a history link, I first need to click the Places button, and then I need to do another click to go back to the website.
This repeats itself for every history link and costs me to much time.
Especially because I use history so often.
The Back-button is a poor way to replace Go-menu and history sidebar. The history displayed under the Back arrow disappears after every browser session and is different for every tab.
