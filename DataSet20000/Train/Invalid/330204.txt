File > Properties should not be always enabled in Places
The File > Properties menu item in Places is always enabled, even when groups (e.g. for a hostname) or nothing is selected, resulting in nothing happening when clicked. The item should only be enabled if it does something (same as New/Delete on the toolbar).
