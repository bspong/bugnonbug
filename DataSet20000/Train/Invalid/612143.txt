Some Places contextmenu entries collide with Selector API (invalid string due to ":" character)

While working with the placesContext context menu today I have discovered that the chosen id's of some of the items cannot be used with querySelector. The following code snippet will fail:

window.document.querySelector("#placesContext_show:info");

> message: An invalid or illegal string was specified
> SYNTAX_ERR: 12
> name: NS_ERROR_DOM_SYNTAX_ERR

The reason is the ':' character which collide with the syntax to query for CSS attributes.
