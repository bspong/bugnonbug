Spell checking is great, but there should be an option to disable it as it takes up quite a lot of resources on page load (eats something on my hard disk while spell checking).

I believe there should be an additional tab in the "Options" dialog which would allow to do that and also something quickly accessible like a button and/or menu option (in the "Tools" menu for example).

Particularly long edit boxes might occur on Wikipedia or when administrating some other CMS or stuff like that.
