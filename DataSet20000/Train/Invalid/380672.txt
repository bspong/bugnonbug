Firefox application using svchost.exe locks up memory

Occurs during bootup, which can extend for 30-45 min and use 50-75,000 K of CPU. My cure is to delete the offending svchost.exe. The only impact of deleting the offending svchost.exe is that sound is no longer available in applications like YouTube, accessed from Firefox. It appears that the routine that makes sound available to YouTube, and activates during boot up, has a bug in it.
