Loss of functionality
---------------------
I installed FFox 1.5
I went to google.com , I am now unable to simply click on the 'images' search link, I am forced to open the link in a new window. There are other links that behave the same way. Also, after visiting a number of sites I am unable to see a listing of them when Iclick the "blue down-arrow" in the URL address field. I am forced to start typing the site I want to see possible listings.

I have gone back to FFox 1.0.7 ....I have no problems surfing/googling now. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to google URL, try to search on "images" ....problem occurs, must open in new tab.
