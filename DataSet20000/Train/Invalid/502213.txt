When using "Sort By Name" on the top level bookmarks folder the static menu items are sorted as well
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090624 Firefox/3.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When I try to sort my root bookmarks folder (folders/bookmarks visible when clicking on the Bookmarks menu item), what I would consider the "static" menu items (e.g. "Bookmark this page", "Bookmark all tabs", etc.) are sorted along with the bookmarks.  This behavior is maintained until I restart Firefox at which point the static menu items are restored to their original positions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on Bookmarks menu item
2. Right click "Sort By Name"
3. Static menu items are now sorted
Actual Results:  
Here is what my Bookmarks menu looks like after sorting:

Recent Tags         >
Recently Bookmarked >

Arts & Crafts       >
Cycling             >

Bookmark All Tabs...
Organize All Bookmarks
