href="javascript:function();" Will No Longer Work, href="#" onclick="function();" Works
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_3; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.342.7 Safari/533.2
Build Identifier: 3.6.3

Since the 3.6.3 update, a coworker and I have suddenly lost the ability to use href="javascript:function();" links to trigger javascript functions. It just loads a new page that says false.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an html link. 
2. Point the href attr at a custom function
3. ex. <a href="javascript:removeWeight('3');">Remove</a>
4. function Declaration: function removeWeight(which){ alert(which); }
Actual Results:  
Acts as if a form has been posted and loads a new page, with the browser url set at "javascript:removeWeight('1');". the page source is empty, but the page says "false"

Expected Results:  
Alerted the number '3'

This has only happened following the recent upgrade. Chrome and safari run fine, and firefox has up to today. I mark it as severe because a LOT of webapps all over are going to be broken now.
