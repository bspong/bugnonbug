Having the "Show tab previews in Windows taskbar" option checked and opening more than 20 tabs creates a preview only for the last opened tab.

Reproducible: Always

Prerequisites:
 - Options|Tabs ->  Show tab previews in Windows taskbar is checked

Steps to reproduce:
 1. Open 5 tabs, hover with mouse over Firefox button in taskbar and observe behavior 
 2. Open more than 20 tabs and observe behavior again

Actual results:
 - preview is displayed for the last opened tab

Expected results:
 - even if there are more than 20 pages opened, the list with all the opened tabs should be displayed (if list is too big to fit screen, scroll buttons should appear)
