Max remembered history is hard-coded to 180 days
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100723 Ubuntu/10.04 (lucid) Firefox/3.6.8

I have told Firefox to remember my history for "at least 3650 days" but it is forgetting everything after 180 days.  Further research has shown that the browser.history_expire_days is not correctly updated when browser.history_expire_days.min is adjusted beyond 180 days; Firefox is hard-coded to not remember anything past 180 days.  Work-around is to manually adjust browser.history_expire_days (and browser.history_expire_days.mirror) in about:config

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set Firefox to remember history for more than 180 days
2. Check browser.history_expire_days setting to verify it is still set to 180, thus purging any history older than 180 days.
Actual Results:  
History is forgotten after 180 days regardless of UI history preferences.

Expected Results:  
If history preference is set to remember more than 180 days, then Firefox should appropriately adjust browser.history_expire_days (and possibly browser.history_expire_days.mirror)

I am not sure when/in which version of Firefox this bug arose, but I have been using firefox since 1.x with the same profile and have had my history saved since then.  This subtle change in the way Firefox remembers history has deleted years of my history which frequently came in handy for me.
