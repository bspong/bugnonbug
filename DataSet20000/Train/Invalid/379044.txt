The 'Help | Report Broken Web Site...' feature assumes that you can get to the site that is broken.  It is not possible to report sites that kick you out of Firefox because the dialog only accepts the current page as input.  It cannot be overridden.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to chaseglow.com.
2. Browser vanishes.
3. How do I report the site as broken.
Actual Results:  
I suppose that since it works in Windows, it might be a plug-in issue.  I have ShockWave installed and it seems to be loaded.  The point is, you should be able to type in the URL of the broken site.

Expected Results:  
I expect to be able to override default site address (current page) with the actual broken site address.
