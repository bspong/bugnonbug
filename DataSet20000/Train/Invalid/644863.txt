Inconsistent toolbar customization behavior

When customizing the toolbar buttons I get strange behavior, including:

* The "new tab" button disappeared from my toolbar after the upgrade to 4.0,
  and is nowhere to be found in the customization dialog.  (I upgraded an XP
  system and did not lose the "new tab" button there

* Toolbar buttons display when in customize mode but disappear when dismissing 
  the customization dialog.  This seems to depend on where the buttons are 
  placed.

* Clicking "restore default set" restores the "Stop" and "Reload" buttons, but 
  when dismissing the customization dialog these two buttons disappear (see attachments).

Reproducible: Always
