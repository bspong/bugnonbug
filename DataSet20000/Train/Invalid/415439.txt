Make title for Add Bookmarks dialog (CTRL+D) more context-sensitive.
Currently, the Add Bookmark dialog (CTRL+D) says "Page bookmarked" in its title regardless of whether the page already *has* been bookmarked through clicking the Star, or whether it is going to be bookmarked if the user presses the "Done" button, for example because the dialog has been invoked directly via CTRL+D, without clicking the Star first.
The dialog title should reflect the actual condition. For this, I suggest to use the entity "bookmarkPageCmd2.label", which accessibility used for the panel's title prior to fix for bug 415105. It says "Bookmark this page", and should be used when CTRL+D is being pressed on a page that has not been bookmarked yet. The dialog already knows about the bookmark not being filed yet: The Undo button is unavailable. So within the same logic, the title should be set correctly to reflect the actual state: The user is *going to* bookmark the page, it hasn't been bookmarked yet.
