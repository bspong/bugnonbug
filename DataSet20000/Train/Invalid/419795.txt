firefox default font settings are too small

(originally filed as Fedora/Rawhide bug on the above shown URL)

Firefox shows many web sites with tiny fonts that really unreadable.
A user said that his firefox default font settings in windows are the same with
fedora but sites diplayed differently.
So the user has to go to advanced font settings and set "minimum font size" to a
different value(on every language he use). I think current value is "none"
I think that this situation is not ideal for novice fedora users.
I have to mention that this also is the case for epiphany.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start firefox
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
fonts are too small and "minimum font size" is not set.

Expected Results:  
Either fonts should be always sanely sized (probably not possible given the wide variety of webs out there) or "minimum font size" should be default to some sane size.
