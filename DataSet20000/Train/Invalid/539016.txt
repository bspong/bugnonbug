changing the zoom on any page and then clicking on a URL on that page loads the new page but resets the zoom back to 100%

Reproducible: Always

1. load a page
2. zoom in (with ctrl + mouse wheel for example)
3. click on a link on that page
Actual Results:  
the zoom is back to 100% on the new page

I would expect the same zoom to be applied as on the previous page, just like in Firefox 3.5 and earlier
