crash on startup with google desktop components [@ GoogleDesktopMozilla.dll@0x5500] [@ GoogleDesktopMozilla.dll@0x5512]

This started when at the time I had Gran Paradiso alpha 8 installed on WinXP SP2. After I updated Google Desktop, the program crashes immediately after choosing a profile from the Profile Manager. I updated to the 10-28 nightly, and it still happened. I can prevent the crash by removing three files from the 'components' directory: GoogleDesktopMozilla.dll, GoogleDesktopMozillaStub.js, or GoogleDesktopMozillaStub.xpt. All have 'Date Modified' May 6th 2007 and the DLL says it's version 5.1.704.25560. The Google Desktop update listed in Google Updater says it was version 5.5.709.30344. I can always reproduce it right now, by putting the three files back inside the directory.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Paste the three GoogleDesktop* files into 'components'
2. Start Minefield's Profile Manager
3. Choose a profile
Actual Results:
