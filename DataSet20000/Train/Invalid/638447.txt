google search continues after results display. Screen is locked
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla firefox 4.0 Beta 12

Using google tolbar search box. After results are displayed google search continues to run and links are not acessible. Cursor shows hour glass. move cursor to Red X (top right of screen) to close and it changes to pointer. Move to links and it stays as a pointer instead of changing to a hand. links are not accessible. Mozilla is unusable. Have to close it. Tried reboot several times.I've gone back to using IE for the moment so I could send the bug report.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Mozilla and Close using Red X top right of screenclick on OOpen 
2. Open Mozilla. Message: Firefox is already running, but is not responding
3. CNTRL-ALT-DEL to open Windows Task Manager, then close firefox.exe
4. Open Mozilla. Google search is still running and Mozilla is not usable, I tried Restore Previous session and Cancel. Identical results.
Actual Results:  
Started a Google search. I'm not sure which google box I used. On my Mozilla screen there are two google search boxes. One in the toolbar and one level with the URL address box which has the AVG Security symbol inside it. 

Expected Results:  
The returned search results were not acessible. The expected result would be returned search results with active links

google search should stop running when the results are returned.
I think the two  search boxes, one in the google toolbar and the AVG search, are in conflict. I changed the AVG search to Yahoo, but the error still occurs,
I removed the google toolbar, same results.
