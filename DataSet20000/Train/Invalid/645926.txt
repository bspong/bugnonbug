loading display don't use GTK Style.

I'm using Firefox 4 on gentoo Linux.
As title sayed the loading display (which is showed on the downside of the browser when a website is loading) don't use the colors of my GTK style.

I think it would look nicer (and not like copy&pasted from chrome) if it would use the system theme.

P.S. Sorry for my bad english. :)

Reproducible: Always
