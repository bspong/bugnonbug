Pop-up messages with the title: Messenger Service keeps coming up they generally
state at the begining that it comes from "Security" to "Alert"

The messages mainly state that there is something wrong with my PC and it
requires immediate attention to avoid an "imminent" crash. They also state that
a fix to my  "problem" is located at a particular web address.

The following is an example:

All the pop up are messages of this general type they indicate something is
wrong with my system and then say that a fix is available at a certain website.

When I click on the "OK" at the end the pop-up closes, I am not redirected to
any site.

These Pop-ups occur generally once every 2-5 minutes everytime I am surfing or
just reading email.
