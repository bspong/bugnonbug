When I add the AI USA feed with either the status bar button or with "New Live
Bookmark" from the Bookmark Manager, the feed fails to be downloaded.  The Live
Bookmark folder is listed as "Empty."  The XML file contains news items, though.

Refreshing the Live Bookmark does nothing.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:

2. Click on RSS button in status bar.
3. Add feed.
4. Check feed.

Actual Results:  
The folder is listed as "Empty."

Expected Results:  
Displayed the feed's articles.
