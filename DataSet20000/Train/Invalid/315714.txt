Running firefox using an X Client opens URLs in the local Firefox on the X Server system

I use Firefox to view local documentation on my Solaris box.
I also use Firefox to view the net on my Linux box.

If I have firefox running on my linux box and try and view some sun docs using firefox on the sun box - it opens the URL using my local firefox, on my box (so no docs, as they are on the sun box). This is annoying but also a security flaw.

Here we go:

If i export my DISPLAY to your X-server (a badly secured/trusted one), then run firefox a lot of times - the firefox on your system will try to open all those URLs. It is easy to cause DoS using this, although I haven't managed remote code execution yet.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have X running and Firefox running on the XServer system
2. XClient connects - opens URL using the XServer system.
3. Do it a lot - the XServer system crashes. Open URLs on someone's system using their local browser.
Actual Results:  
DoS on the XServer system. The remote system becomes unusable or firefox crashes when RAM is exhausted.

Expected Results:  
A lot of tabs/windows and disk thrashing on my XClient system - not the XServer one!
