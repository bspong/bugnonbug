Hello.

I have this annoying thing , every time I m closing my browser and open it , FF loads about the 2 of 10 tabs forever, not particular sites, so I have to stop them manually and reload the pages. Tested in 2 ISP's . Test it on I.E. with no problem there.

Version: 3.6.8
Addons running only: Css Developer


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close the browser
2. Open the browser with the 10 tabs to load
3. About 2 of them in not particular sites, loading forever.
