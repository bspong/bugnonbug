In Firefox versions from 4 links provided by a reverse ftp proxy has the auth part in it and can't be clicked.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2.18) Gecko/20110613 SUSE/3.6.18-2.1 Firefox/3.6.18
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2.18) Gecko/20110613 SUSE/3.6.18-2.1 Firefox/3.6.18

When using Firefox version 4.0.1 or version 5.0-3 on openSuSE 11.4 there is a difference in how some URL's are resolved compared to Firefox version 3.*
(the one I've compared to here is version 3.6.18).

I have an apache 2.2 server on a Linux host (host1) which act as a reverse proxy
server for a FTP photo archive on an IIS server (host2).

This is setup with apache's reverse proxy commands on host1 like this:
(Host names and domain is fake for security reasons)
---------------------
ProxyPass /photos/ ftp://host2.domain.net/photo/
ProxyPassReverse /photos/ ftp://host2.domain.net/photo/
---------------------

It is then accessed like this:

http://host1.domain.net/photos/

The IIS FTP server (host2) will then popup an authorization dialog where we in this case login with username "user" and a password.

Then the user can click on directories to get there and download/display
pictures.

That's how it worked with Firefox 3.*.

Now with Firefox 4 or 5 user can't click the directory because when hovering the
mouse over the link the URL is different than it is with Firefox 3.*.

With Firefox 3.* the link works and lookes like this:

http://host1.domain.net/photos/directory/

With Firefox 4.* or 5.* the link doesn't work and look like this:

http://host1.domain.net/photos/user@photos/directory/

and the target can of course not be found !

So with Firefox 4.* or 5.* the authorization part is added to the URL.

Funny thing is that when rightclicking on the page and viewing page source,
the links/direcories can be clicked as before from there !

I don' know if this is a bug or a feature.
I've tried with a new profile and with different users.

My question is:

Is there a way in Firefox 4.* - 5.* to change that behavior back to as it where ?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install an apache server 2.2 with proxy commands as described above.

2. Install an IIS FTP server that's not available for "anonymous" use.

3. Go to the location: http://host1.domain.net/photos/login with username
and a password and try to click a link.



Actual Results:  
Link/Directory is not found.

Expected Results:  
Link/Directory found.

If it's a bug, then the auth part shouldn't be in the url.
