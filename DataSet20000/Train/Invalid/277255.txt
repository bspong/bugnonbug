The address bar should take the Google search bar functionality in this way:
In the right corner where it is the Google search bar now should be only the 
icon of the Google or other search engine, if that icon is pressed the address 
bar should take the functionality of the Google search bar and everything that 
is typed in the address bar should be search on Google or any search engine.

Reproducible: Always

search bar, and if that icon is pressed the address bar should take the search 
function.
