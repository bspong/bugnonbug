I open firefox and my webmail notifier is empty - none of the email addresses I had entered are there any more.  I re entered them - they worked great until I closed down mozilla firefox (I closed the browser down) - then when I reopened firefox, again, all email addresses are gone.  I tried re entering them AGAIN - closed firefox - opened firefox - they are all gone.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. enter email addresses in webmail notifier
2. save them
3.  close mozilla firefox
4.  reopen firefox- all email addresses are gone.
