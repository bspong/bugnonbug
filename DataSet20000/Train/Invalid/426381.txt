Bookmark Contextual Dialog has a transparent background

When I click "Bookmarks -> Bookmark this page", the Bookmark Contextual Dialog appears, but with a transparent background: all texts and controls are present and functional, but under them I see the underlying page beeing bookmarked.

I couldn't take a screenshot because of bug 426379 and because trying to activate the screen capture utility by a mouse click makes the BCD disappear.
