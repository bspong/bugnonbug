as is for any other CSS property, I would expect that a node inside another one with -moz-user-select property assigned can re-assign the property itself as is for color, background, and others. Unfortunately, this does not happen even inline or with !important flag.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
<div style="-moz-user-select:none;">
    <div style="-moz-user-select:text !important;">
        abc def
    </div>
</div>
Actual Results:  
It is not possible to select the text. To make it possible it is necessary find each parent, verify if it has the property -moz-user-select set as no then change it and go on up to documentElement.

Expected Results:  
redefined property should have more relevance than parent one as is for color, font, background, border, width, etc etc 

Specially with third parts framework, this problem could be a massive waist of time/resources because as soon as a container has this property for labels, tabs, other purposes, every nested element will be affected without possibility to simply select a text (createRange works as expected though)
