Icons of Video Downloadhelper and Ad Block Plus are not displayed next to the URL/Status bar, I think this is because other extensions are displaying icons there at the same time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 3.5 or Firefox 3.0.11 (no problem in Firefox 3.0.10 or earlier)
2. Install Cooliris and iMacros plugins
3. Install Ad Block Plus and Video Downloadhelper
4. Restart Firefox
5. Icons for Ad Block Plus and Video Downloadhelper not visible
Actual Results:  
Icons not shown

Expected Results:  
Icons should be shown as they are part of the extensions functionality
