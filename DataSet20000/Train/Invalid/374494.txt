When trying to use Firefox with the extension MayhemEx Firefox causes the OSX Window Server to crasch and bring down the computer.
The extension adds functions to use with the website www.genmay.net, and places a context menu in the status bar.
When clicking the status bar icon the menu briefly shows and then dissappears again. After clicking the menu a couple of times the crash occurs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click context menu that the extension places in the status bar. Menu will flash briefly and dissappear. Clicking a number of times triggers the crash.
2. Crash can also occur after just surfing a minute or two, and when accessing www.genmay.net
Actual Results:  
Computer UI freezes completely, the window server crashes.

Expected Results:  
Context menu should appear normally and allow for setting the extensions preferences.

This extension works fine on Firefox on Windows. I have tried it on two Macs (one Power Mac G5, Firefox 2.0.0.2 - and one MacBook Pro with Firefox 2.0.0.1) with the same result (the crashing).
