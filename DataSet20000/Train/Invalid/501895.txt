The "Getting Started" button in the default toolbar does not have an icon.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090624 Firefox/3.5

Like I have said in the title, it does not work. The first time I noticed and clicked on "Getting Started", the icon popped up. After trying it on a clean computer again, it does not show the icon even by clicking on it. In total, there has been one time where the icon did not work in the beginning but showed up after clicking on it and the other two times where it would not show up even by clicking it.

Operating System Used:
-Windows 7 Build 7260- 1 time works when clicked, 1 time does not work even when clicked
-Windows 7 Build 7264- 1 time does not work even when clicked

Reproducible: Sometimes
