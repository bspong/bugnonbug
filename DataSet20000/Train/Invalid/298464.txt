Firefox FROZEN
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: I can not get to it but I'm up to date

I do not care about all of your procedures and dictums. FireFox is frozen on my 
computer and I am now spending part of my morning debugging your software when 
I can generate enough of my own.

WHEN I booted up this morning, something about Media connectivity fired off and 
pretty much installed itself. Before I could stop it Firefox would load but 
would not establish connections with a home page. Nor could i open the Tools 
menu. I finally took FireFox out of the system and re-installed it. Even tried 
a reboot.

Right now FireFox is frozen up and is useless on my system. I've enjoyed using 
it but I'm now back to IE. Its the only way I can work and this has put me way 
behind.

Incidentally, I went to all the trouble to register for buggerme zilla and that 
did not work either.
