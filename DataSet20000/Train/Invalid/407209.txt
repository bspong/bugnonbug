When I go to the Bricklink.com website, I cannot get the horizontal scroll bar. Please note I am using a standard 4x3 display. That is: not widescreen. This problem would not be an issue for those with widescreens, but with a standard display, it makes it impossible to see the objects on right of the screen. I have not had this problem with other browsers, such as internet explorer. This is the only website that has exhibited this problem. Please note that I am using the latest version of Firefox (2.0.0.11).
