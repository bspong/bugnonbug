list-style-image should use CSS directory for relative URL, NOT referencing page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.3) Gecko/20060425 SUSE/1.5.0.3-7 Firefox/1.5.0.3

IE does this correctly, Firefox does not.  If a CSS file contains a reference to a relative URL in list-style-image, the location should start from the directory containing the CSS file, NOT the directory containing the HTML page.  

Reason: the CSS file is mentioning the image, and so the CSS file cannot be portably reused by multiple pages if the relativity does not follow the CSS file.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

css/web.css:
li {
  list-style-image: url(asterisk.gif);
}

t.html:
<html>
<head>
<link type="text/css" href="css/web.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
</head>
<body>
<ul>
<li>Hi</li>
</ul>
</body>

Use any image file for "asterisk.gif".  Store in same directory as t.html.  Displays.  Store in same directory as web.css.  Does not display.
Actual Results:  
Firefox fails to display asterisk.gif when stored in css directory.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should display asterisk.gif when stored in css directory.

I marked this major, because if you leave it sround too long, people will recode their pages to adapt to this bug.
