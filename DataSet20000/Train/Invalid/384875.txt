If the zoom was in/decreased using the "+/-" keys and on one of the present links the context menu "open in new tab" is choosen, the tab open correctly, but the zoom level falls back to 100% in the current tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Increase zoom level (by + or via menu)
2.Right click on any link
3.Select "open as new tab"
Actual Results:  
New tab opens, zoom level of tab containing the link is back to 100 %.

Expected Results:  
Zoom level should definitively be unaffected for current level, one can argue, whether the level for the new tab should be the same one, or the 100% as it currently is.
