It is not possible to download zipped iconfiles with firefox from
http://interfacelift.com, http://resexcellence.com or any other page that offers
zipped mac os x icons. The icons are not accessible after extracting the zipfile.
only zip files, not happening with sit or dmg files.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.download
http://www.pixelgirlpresents.com/images/downloads/Starwarsiconsmac.zip (or any
other zipfile with icons in it) using firefox.
2.Extract the zipfile using stuffit


Actual Results:  
3. Folder "Starwarsiconsmac Folder" is on the Desktop

In this folder are two subfolders. In "Starwarsiconsmac Folder/Starwars icons-1"
is a textfile and a folder named icons. In that icon folder are 0k iconfiles.
In the "Starwarsiconsmac Folder/__MACOSX/" is a folder named Starwars icons-1"
(size 810.989 bytes) with nothing visible in it. Nothing is visible using the
Terminal (ls), too. So, no icons there.

Tested on 3 different pages with multiple zipfiles and it is always the same
result. It is only happening with zipfiles. NO SIT or DMG files are affected.



Expected Results:  
3. Folder "Starwars icons-1" is on the Desktop

In this folder is a text file and one subfolder named "Starwars icons-1". In
there is a folder named "icons" and in there are the icons (..., no yoda 8().
Terminal shows exactly the same directories and files.

so i expected what safari and the internet explorer did with this file.
