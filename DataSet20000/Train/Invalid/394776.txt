noticed many images are now too small on bookmarked sites; thumbnails specifically but also tabbed menu items

This isn't really restricted to any specific site, just all my bookmarked sites. Just noticed this in the last week or so. Only change I have made recently is HTML Total Validation add-on, plus installing Netscape and Opera browsers so I can check my webpages. I have changed my resolution a few times to see what my pages look like at different screen sizes, but I have always changed it back to my regular resolution (800 x 600...I only have a 15" screen). I do not have this problem in IE, Netscape or Opera, so I have been using them. Liking Netscape...it has tabs too. I doublechecked to make sure I have the right version, and even reinstalled version 2.0.0.6. If I type in the site's address directly, it comes up okay...only the bookmarks are affected. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click on bookmarked item
2.or go to pages from an application (like Webshots or Mail2World)
3.
Actual Results:  
the images on the site are half what they should be. Since many times they are thumbnails to begin with, the images are incredibly small and the text on any images are illegible.

Expected Results:  
Produced a regular webpage as usual, with full-sized images.

I have not changed any of my addons since I have had them for over a year now. Only the HTML Total validation addon is new to the Firefox application, and I deleted it. But I still have the problem with the bookmarked sites. I was reading where some problems came up because of conflicts with Adblock, but I've had Adblock since the beginning.
