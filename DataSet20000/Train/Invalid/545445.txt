The all tabs view should show URLs since it searches on them.  Perhaps title and URL should appear next to the thumbnail, so there'd be room to see full titles and URLs for the purposes of narrowing by searching

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn on all tabs view
2. Bring up all tabs view
3. Type some text
Actual Results:  
Tabs are narrowed down to those whose titles or URLs match, but even if the match is on the URL, it isn't shown

Expected Results:  
URLs should be shown.
