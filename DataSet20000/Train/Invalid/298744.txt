When you click on the DOWNLOAD button to download the skin it instead tries to
open the file in the browser, if you right click and try the Save Link As option
it tries to save a php file instead of the wal file. The best option I had was
to do the Copy Link Location, and paste it to IE, which then offered to download
the file.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.visit http://www.winamp.com/skins/details.php?id=145062
2.click the "DOWNLOAD" button on the top third of the page
3.firefox will try to open the file, rather then ask to download the file

Actual Results:  
Firefox opens the file showing a bunch of weird code

Expected Results:  
it should have sent the file to the download manager and started downloading the
file.

Random note, if TrueDownloader is installed to work with Firefox, it also fails
to download the file.
