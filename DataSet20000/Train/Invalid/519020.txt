If you sign up for a website, and it asks for you to enter a password, it should hide the password with asterisks. Some pages do not do this however. Now, on the pages that don't, you can double click the password field and it will show every password that has been put in a password field, even if firefox is set to not save them.

1. Find any site that has you enter a username and password that also shows what you are typing in plaintext

2. Double click the password field to bring down a drop down menu

It shows all passwords in plaintext

Running default everything.
