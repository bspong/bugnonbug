As with any site with post data, a stupid message pops up about post data which never helps anyone except business people perhaps who constantly sign up for porn and and don't know whoever it is with them to know about while trying to show them some previous site (how often does that ever happen?)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up a site with form data like this one.

2. Enter some stuff and press enter.

3. Backspace.
Actual Results:  
A stupid useless annoying pointless message appears about post data which never helped anyone except for porn addicts who hang around people who don't know about that addiction and have Alzheimer's.

Expected Results:  
To be able to click a little box saying, "Please do not bug me with this stupid time-wasting message again."

Get rid of it.
