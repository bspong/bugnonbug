Steps to Reproduce sums it up pretty well, basically the bookmark star seems to not bookmark pages on a single click.  However, confirming the "Edit Bookmark" option by clicking on the highlight yellow star again produces an edit dialog, which if confirmed will actually show the Bookmark in the bookmarks menu.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a site, such as yahoo and attempt to bookmark it using the bookmark star
2. The start highlights yellow, clicking on it again says bookmark added, brings up a bookmark edit dialog (Which says the bookmark was added)
3. Okaying the edit actually produces the bookmark
Actual Results:  
Clicking on the star only once did not cause the link to appear in the bookmark menu

Expected Results:  
Clicking on the star once would cause the bookmark to appear in the bookmark menu
