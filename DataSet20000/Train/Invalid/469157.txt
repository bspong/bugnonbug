browser.fixup.alternate.enabled being set to false has no effect.  domain guessing still works.

I'm trying to disable domain guessing by setting browser.fixup.alternate.enabled to false however it does not work.  I've verified this on multiple PCs, and multiple Firefox versions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set browser.fixup.alternate.enabled to false
2. type anything in the address bar , hit ctrl+enter and it still will add www. as the prefix and .com as the suffix
Actual Results:  
typed google in the address bar and hit ctrl+enter and firefox added www. and .com for me.

Expected Results:  
firefox should not have added a www. prefix or .com suffix.
