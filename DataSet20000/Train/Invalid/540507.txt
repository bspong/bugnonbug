Everytime I close firefox completely since the recent software upgrade,  I then cannot reopen firefox again as it says that firefox is still running and either all windows need to be closed or the computer needs to be restarted.  So I therefore need to log off my windows account and sign in again to use firefox.  i have noticed this happens on some of my friends computers with the new upgrade as well.

1.Install latest version of firefox on computer (version 3.5.7)

Reopen the firefox browser without stating that firefox: is still running and I should either close all windows or restart the computer.
