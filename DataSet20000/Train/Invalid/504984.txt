Unresponsive script when saving photo from web page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Since I upgraded to Mozilla 3.5, whenever I have saved a photo file such as a jpeg file, I have gotten an unresponsive script window which states that a script has stopped working.  I have gotten the error whenever I tried saving a photo from sites such as Flickr.  The error box appears just after the save file window opens.  

The error window typically reads like this:
Script: file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Compaq_Administrator/Application%20Data/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/46snwi3a.default/extensions/%7B3112ca9c-de6d-4884-a869-9855de68056c%7D/components/bootstrap.js -> file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Compaq_Administrator/Application%20Data/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/46snwi3a.default/extensions/%7B3112ca9c-de6d-4884-a869-9855de68056c%7D/lib/toolbar.js:471

I typically click the stop script button to clear the window, but usually after two clicks on it, and I usually am able to save the file without further incident.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a web page with a photo image in jpeg format.
2.Right click on the photo and select "Save Image As".
3.After Save As box opens, search and select folder to save file into.  The error box will appear during this step.
Actual Results:  
The error box opened while browsing for a folder with the heading: Warning: Unresponsive Script.  The box then had this message:

A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete.

Script: file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Compaq_Administrator/Application%20Data/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/46snwi3a.default/extensions/%7B3112ca9c-de6d-4884-a869-9855de68056c%7D/components/bootstrap.js -> file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Compaq_Administrator/Application%20Data/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/46snwi3a.default/extensions/%7B3112ca9c-de6d-4884-a869-9855de68056c%7D/lib/toolbar.js:471

I clicked the Stop Script button to clear the box.  After doing some more browsing, the error box reappeared with the same message.  I clicked the Stop Script button to clear it.

Expected Results:  
There should have been no error boxes while I save a photo file.

Never happened before upgrading to 3.5 version.  This is my build configuration information:
