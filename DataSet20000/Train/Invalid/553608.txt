FF causes computer to hang when page has too many drop down lists

When I created a web page with 200 drop down lists, Firefox 3.5 hung when trying to display it. The rest of the computer also froze and had to be shut down by pulling the plug.

It also happened when I ran FF in Safe Mode. This problem did not affect Explorer, Opera, or FF 2.5

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a text editor and paste in the following string 200 times:
    <option><select></select></option>
2. Save the document as an html file and open it into Firefox 3.5+
3. Make sure you saved your work first.

Actual Results:  
Performance Monitor indicated CPU usage was 100%. Firefox locked up. I was able to shut it down through the Task Manager. Then other programs failed to respond and reported 100% CPU use. Shutting down the computer was a slow process, as each program hogged the CPU during shutdown.

Expected Results:  
It should have displayed 200 empty drop down lists (as it did in other inferior browsers). 

Adding id's did not solve the problem. Adding content to the lists makes the problem worse -- FF hangs with fewer lists. 

Changing the Session Restore to 2 did not solve the problem. 

However, I was able to display the drop lists when running Windows in Safe Mode, and I couldn't find this bug in Google or your own bug reports, so it's possible the fault could be with me and my machine. However, since it's so easy to produce, and since the consequences are so dire, I think I should tell someone about it. Besides, I still have that 200-list form to create.
