When viewing web pages and text size is increased. Text does not wrap, but spills off screen. Also increasing text size is limited.

I have poor eyesight so use "control/scroll wheel" to increase font size on web pages where necessary.

In Firefox 2 the text becomes larger and wraps so all the text is visible. In Firefox 3 RC1 it acts like IE and spills over the page on the right hand side of the screen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open web page
2.Increase text size
3.Watch as text spills off the right hand side of the screen rather than drop down to next line!
Actual Results:  
See above

Expected Results:  
Text on web pages should wrap as in Firefox 2.

Maximum text size should not be limited.
