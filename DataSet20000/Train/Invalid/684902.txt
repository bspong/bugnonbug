FQDN .uz domain resolves in DNS but http://uz/ redirects to http://www.uz.com/
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:6.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.1
Build ID: 20110830092941

Steps to reproduce:

I followed links to http://uz/ and I also typed in the same thing into the location bar.


Actual results:

Firefox redirects to http://www.uz.com/ in each situation. Internet Explorer seems to be confused, too.


Expected results:

This is a bug in which I purposely want to view a website that has no trailing TLD (top-level domain) because uz is a TLD. What is unusual about uz is the fact that it resolves and most TLD's do not. For example, the uk domain does not resolve to an "A" record, nor does com. The browser should respect the fact that a TLD can and sometimes does resolve to a host address. The browser is using internal checking to out-think the user and by doing so, it is assuming something that is not correct.

The DNS query to the FQDN "uz." works, and it resolves to 91.212.89.8. This IP address has a port 80 web server that hosts the website for http://uz/ -- Incidentally, there appears to be a http://www.uz/ also, resolving to a different IP address.

Please compare the http://91.212.89.8/ with what happens with http://uz/ ... I believe that this was working fine in an older version of Firefox, perhaps as recent as 3.x?
