"Launch Firefox Now" button launches Firefox as an elevated process
At the end of the installer if you have "Launch Firefox Now" checked on, it will start Firefox as an elevated process.  

Running Firefox as an elevated process can lead to a lot of problems, for example, add-ons would have access to compromise a system.  It's not a huge deal because it's the same as the security in Windows XP and below, but as of Vista Windows changed its expectations on administrative accounts.

Expected behavior:
- If the user is an administrator: 
  It should use the associated unelevated token to launch Firefox. 
- If the user is a limited user and installing via elevated administrator:
  It should use the limited account user token, not the administrator who agreed to install.
- If the user is a limited user, and installs without elevating, I think it is alraedy working fine.
