Memory Leak using large amounts of page file over 24 hours
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

I use firefox and multiple tabs all the time.  FireFox nearly brings my computer to a standstill almost daily.  When it gets to this 'state' the memory usage is considerably high.  Specifically today, this was reported to me by Windows Task Manager:

    Firefox = 296 MB
    Total PF Usgae = 1.21 GB

I quit FireFox and PF Usage dropped to 468 MB used.

I do not know of any specific web sites or reasons why this occurs.  If given tools, I can better try to document what causes this, but without better tools, I don't know what else I can give you to go on.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Using web for the day will cause this to happen daily.  Not specifically reproduceable with a single action, but it *will* happen daily.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
FF and OS start performing quite slowly
