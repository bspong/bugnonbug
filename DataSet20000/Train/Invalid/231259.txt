None of the keyboard shortcuts are working.  I am not able to use apple-v to
paste or apple-t to create a new tab.  I am able to do everything from the menu
options, but not keyboard shortcuts.

They work fine on the version I built on the morning of 1/16/04, but do not work
on the version I built on the morning of 1/17/04.
