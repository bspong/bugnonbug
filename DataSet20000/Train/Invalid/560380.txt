"Server Not Found" for links and bookmarks, i.e., known good URLs
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Firefox should NOT report "Server Not Found" when it fails to find a page linked to from another page or a bookmark. Instead, it should do what now must be done manually, i.e., try again twice and return to the previous page. It's irritating to be accused of mistyping something that wasn't typed. Nine times out of 10, the second try finds the server, and if it doesn't the third try does. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Link to a know good URL when, presumably, either the network or the server are busy. 
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
"Server Not Found"

Expected Results:  
successful link

As noted above, if the URL was not typed, don't assume that it's mistyped.
