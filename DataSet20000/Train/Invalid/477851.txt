Grammatical error in "about:rights"
In aboutRights.dtd, there's currently a following entity

<!ENTITY rights.webservices-term4 "The Services are provided &quot;as-is.&quot;  &vendorShortName;, its contributors, licensors, and distributors, disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied, including without limitation, warranties that the Services are merchantable and fit for your particular purposes.  You bear the entire risk as to selecting the Services for your purposes and as to the quality and performance of the Services. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties, so this disclaimer may not apply to you.">


Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it should say "whether expressed or implied" instead of "whether express or implied" in the first sentence.
