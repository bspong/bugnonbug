direct access to my on-line bank without identification

This is the website of my bank. With Firefox 3.6.13, when I closed the browser, missing to disconnect from my bank website, it was impossible to reconnect without returning to the identification page. Now, with Firefox 4.0 Beta10, which do not record open tabs when there are several, so I have to turn on the automatic opening on the last (s) page (s) viewed, I am horrified to realize that anyone could re-open Firefox and  access directly to my bank account, and process all possible operations online, including transferring the contents of my accounts to any other account, bypassing the identification page and arriving directly on my private accounts pages, without any login or password, just re-opening Firefox 4.0 Beta10.  This is a DISASTER.  :-(
