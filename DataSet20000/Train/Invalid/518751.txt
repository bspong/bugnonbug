I have brought a new computer. How do I get to the Fire Fox manager in Vista.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3

Unable to add on "Add ons". When I download an add on Fire Fox will not restart to install the add on. The only thing I can think of is that the profile is corrupted.
I have no idea why this has happened since every thing is NEW.
