Move the version number from the Firefox -> Help -> About window to the Firefox -> Help -> Troubleshooting window
When a user opens the About window for Firefox, the window should say something like "Firefox checked for updates 20 minutes ago, you are running the latest release."

It is important to say when the last check happened and ideally to do the check when the dialog is launched so that time is very near and to drop the version and simply tell them they're on the latest or not.

If a user needs the full version information they can get it from about:support.

This will of course have L10n implications. Not sure what the right way to note that is so I've cc'd Axel :-)
