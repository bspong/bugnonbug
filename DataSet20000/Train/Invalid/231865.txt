I was wondering if Firebird could have a feature like Opera, where you can make
your own custom searches built into MFirebird.  That was poorly worded, sorry, so
I'll give an example.

All search engines use querys.  So could there be a feature where you could
program in a keyword into a query?  For instance:

If I typed in "google" in the URL bar then a space and told Mozilla beforehand
that if "google" was the first thing in the address bar, it would append what
came after it to http://www.google.com/search?&q= (and parse it as necessary)
and go there.  This has been done in Firebird already, but only with Google and
Dictionary.com (and some others, such as Amazon).  But sometimes there are other
sites where I would like Firebird to be able to do this for as well, so it would
be nice if there was some interface where the user could define these keywords.

I know I posted this in the Mozilla section, but I think it could be used in
Firebird as well.
