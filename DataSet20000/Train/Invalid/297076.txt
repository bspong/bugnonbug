Firefox fails CSS1 test of absolute length units with regards to font-size
Using: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050526
Firefox/1.0+

According to CSS1 specifications (http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS1#length-units),
browsers should support absolute length units such as inches and centimeters.

Please note that for the following tests, your computer must be set so its
internal ruler reflects 'real-world'lengths, as described in the prologue to
these tests, at http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS1/current/sec01.htm, in the
section entitled "Units and Monitor Testing."

All tests explain what behavior is expected according to CSS1 specifications.

Firefox passes tests involving absolute length units with regards to
text-indent, @ http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS1/current/sec547.htm, and
margin(bottom and top)and padding (bottom and top), @
http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS1/current/sec411.htm. 

However, Firefox fails when it comes to font size, as demonstrated in the
font-size test, http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS1/current/sec526.htm. The
one cm and ten mm font-size was actually about 7 mm, the half-inch was about 3/8
in., and points was about 3/16 in. instead of 1/4 in. (one point = 1/72 inches).
