If you go for example to gmail.com, stay there, delete your cookies
and then try to login you'll get the message that your cookies are disabled.
This error is 100% reproducible on Linux, as well as on x86_64 Windows 7 for me.
Then, if you click the back button and login again, everything is working fine.
