Contacted geocities to see if it was a problem with coding as the site has
worked fine in every other browser I have ever tried.  Geocities tech support
said that Mozilla is not a good browser, "Garbage" was the actual description.
Recommended I use netscape or IE. There are no java script or complicated
applications on the site, only text and pictures.  I still want to use Mozilla,
but it appears incompatible with simple html coding in this case. Is there
something wrong with the site or does Mozilla simply not like the fonts. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to any of the above listed sites 
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
The font diplays incorrectly and changes to smaller or larger sizes randomly
when the coding is for the same size. Roughly half of the links do not work and
appear as just text.


Expected Results:  
Displayed the site as every other browser does.

Also when updating in Mozilla, all of the ' punctuation is changed to ?, so it
is impossible to update when using Mozilla.
