Drop down menu's do not show

When I start Firefox everything works fine. But after say half an hour the drop down menu's for history, bookmarks, extra, help etc do not show anymore. Instead a gray vertical line appears that shows where the right border of the dropdown menu is and a similar horizontal gray line shows the bottom of the drop down menu. The menu itself is totally oblique (if that's the right word: transparent, you simply keep seeing what was already on the screen)
The same effect is seen with the bookmarks in the title bar and the labels underneath the title bar for the windows I have opened in one copy of Firefox. 
Shutting down Firefox by clicking on the red cross in the upper righthand corner doesn't work. I'm not sure whether these problems are related though.
After forcing shutdown via ctrl-alt-del and restarting Firefox, the drop down menu's appear again. For as long as it lasts...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox
2. use it for 30 minutes or more
3. I don't do anything special, just wok with Firefox as I've done for years. 



Seems to be a bug of your newest version (which is still in beta...) Did not have this problem until the latest update
drop down menu's like the one on this page for Severity also do not work
