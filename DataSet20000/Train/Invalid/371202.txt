Pressing enter while page is loading opens a new tab that tries to load that page in parallel.

Pressing enter after typing an address in the address bar loads the page specified.  Pressing alt-D then enter when the page has loaded fully reloads the page.  Pressing enter while the page is still loading generates a new tab that loads the page in parallel, which is unexpected behavior.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type the address of a slow loading web site in address bar and press enter to start loading.  
2.Reselect the address bar and press enter.  

Actual Results:  
The web site that we are trying to load in the active tab is now trying to load in another tab in the background.  

Expected Results:  
The existing tab will try to reload the entered address, instead of opening a new tab.  

This is particularly annoying on intermittent connections, where some requests may not make it to the server.  This is new behavior to Firefox 2.0, and may have been an intentional change in design.
