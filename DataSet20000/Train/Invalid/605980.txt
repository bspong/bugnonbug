Updating to Firefox 3.6.11 changes language to English
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.11) Gecko/20101012 Firefox/3.6.11

After automatically updating Firefox to version 3.6.11 the language of the UI (menus, preferences, even: add-ons like NoScript) changed to English. There is apparently no possibility to rechange the language in "Options..", as I only found a language option for website content displaying. Do I have to uninstall and reinstall Firefox to get my old language (German) back?
