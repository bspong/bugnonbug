Entire machine locks up in Server 2003 at random times
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.2; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; InfoPath.2)
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.5.0.1

At random times, while using Firefox 1.5.0.1 up to the Bon Echo alpha and the latest nightly releases, my whole computer becomes unresponsive.

First, it appears as though Firefox and other applications lose their internet connection.

Second, explorer locks up completely and new applications cannot be launced.

Third, processes cannot be terminated for the whole machine.

After removing the network cable and plugging it back in, everything returns to normal and internet access is restored.

The problem seems to occur more frequently when Firefox is running and I am using other apps that use the internet.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch firefox, browse around a bit
2.Move to other internet requiring apps
3.Whole computer locks up, network cable needs to be removed

Actual Results:  
Computer returns to normal after reconnecting the network cable and waiting a few seconds.

Expected Results:  
Not have caused the whole system to lock up.

The problem only occurs while Firefox is running. Other browsers, such as Opera, IE6/7 do not cause the problem.

Problem occurs with all firewalls off and with McAfee VirusScan 8.0i disabled.

No extension installed.
