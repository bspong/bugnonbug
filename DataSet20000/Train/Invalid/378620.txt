Figure out tooltip whitespace stripping behavior for Firefox 3
I know some people (Steuard being one of them) have strong opinions about what we should be doing with regard to whitespace stripping. This bug will hopefully be a good place to discuss pros/cons of each approach and ultimately decide whether we want to keep the block of code at http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/browser/base/content/browser.js&rev=1.778&mark=2690-2696#2690, without resorting to baseless advocacy.

Here is the list of pros/cons that I know of for our current behavior (strip out whitespace):

Pros:
- In accordance with HTML spec (not sure how relevant this really is)
- Better behavior in some cases where markup includes unintentional whitespace
- No change in behavior if we ever fix bug 322270 (other than for whitespace entities)

Cons:
- Doesn't match behavior of either SeaMonkey or IE
- Doesn't gives authors a way to explicitly add line breaks (at least not until bug 322270 is fixed)

I might be forgetting something here, but I think those are the salient points. Thoughts?
