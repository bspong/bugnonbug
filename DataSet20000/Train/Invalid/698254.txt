every time i update to mozilla 7.0.1 my internet stops working (on all browsers) and i have to do a total system restore
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:7.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0
Build ID: 20110922153450

Steps to reproduce:

Updated Firefox


Actual results:

Disconnected me from the internet. Would still connect to the router and all my flatmate's computers stayed fine but I had no internet access. I've tried to update so many times but everytime I do I have to do a complete system restore.


Expected results:

Firefox should have updated and kept working fine.
