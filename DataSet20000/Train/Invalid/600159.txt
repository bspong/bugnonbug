New About window doesn’t display UserAgent string in full
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:2.0b7pre) Gecko/20100927 Firefox/4.0b7pre
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:2.0b7pre) Gecko/20100927 Firefox/4.0b7pre

How as a developer can I report a bug and pass the version of Firefox to support if I can’t copy/paste it easily from the GUI?

Is the suggestion after the new redesign to visit a HTTP Header echoer?

3.Profit
Actual Results:  
Visit About. Feel glum about only seeing 4.0b7pre
