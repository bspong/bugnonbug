I Wikipedia and likely other site, use of the Page Down key will get "stuck" at the bottom of the left-hand navigation column and not continue further down the page.

I don't recall this behavior in Firefox 2.x (I am no longer in a position to check) and IE 7 will page down all the way to the bottom of the page.

Work-around: Spacebar, Scroll wheel and elevator bar work as expected.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Navigate to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exxon_Mobil (or possible any number of web pages)
2) Click somewhere in the main article (not a link, but the text to get keyboard focus into the main browser window
3) Page Down a few times.  The browser will get "stuck" at the bottom on the left-hand navigation "column" (in this case, the "zh." language link), which is only 20% down the page as a whole.  This happens even if I did not click in the left-hand column in step 2.

Actual Results:  
Navigation stop at the wrong location

Expected Results:  
Navigation should proceed toward the bottom of the page
