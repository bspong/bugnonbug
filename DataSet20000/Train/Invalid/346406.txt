When I click anywhere on the page it is scrolled to the top, even if clicking on links. This happens only the first time I click. Following clicks perform the correct action (that is, clicking on links surf to the link, clicking on empty area does nothing and so on).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the page
2. Scroll down
2. Click anywhere

Actual Results:  
The page scrolls to top and nothing else, even if I clicked a link.

Expected Results:  
I would expect it not to scroll.

Happens with FF 2.
