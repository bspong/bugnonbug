When the Bookmark Manager is open, if I click New Bookmark and add a bookmark, it is always created in the root of the Bookmarks tree.  This is unexpected behavior if I have a subfolder open in the Bookmarks tree.  I expect it to create the bookmark in the folder I'm currently viewing in the Manager.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a folder below the root Bookmarks folder.
2. Select that folder in the Bookmarks Manager (it will be empty)
3. Hit New Bookmark, add bookmark information.
Actual Results:  
The Bookmark is created in the top level (Bookmarks) folder.  It is not immediately visible to the user.

Expected Results:  
The Bookmark should be added to the currently visible folder (Created in step 1).


This behavior is very confusing...especially when the root Bookmarks tree is already very full.  The fact that the new bookmark does not come into view when it is created leaves the user to believe that the bookmark failed to create at all.
