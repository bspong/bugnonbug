The new blue progress bar runs over the bottom of the location bar and the progress bar that appears on the top of tabs when they load is too close to the favicon and is too rectangular. The look that was present in the mockups (https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/c/c3/Mockup-4-0-Vista-%28TabsBottom%29-%28LocBar%29.png, https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/d/d7/Mockup-XP-%28Combined%29-002.png) are good but the blue gradient is indeed better than green.
