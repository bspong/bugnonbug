Firefox not passing Google parameters in query string
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; MDDR; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Query string parameters are not being passed through from Google to our site when Firefox is used. Any Major browser other than Firefox(such as Chrome, IE, Safari and Opera) works as expected. Similarly, Firefox works as expected with other Search engines, just not Google.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Ensure Firefox is not currently running. Start Firefox and navigate to http://www.google.co.uk
2.Enter the search term “mycashplus”
3.In the Paid ad (pink background), click on “Prepaid Gold Mastercard”
4.Note that the parameters in the address bar do not appear in the 'Apply Now' button
5.Reproduce the steps above using another search engine or browser to see how the 'Apply Now' link is populated.
Actual Results:  
The 'Apply Now' link is no longer populated with the query string parameters passed by Google when using the Firefox Browser.
