When I opened some tabs and wanted to compare some styles for a forum I noticed that some tabs rendered the forum with the wrong style. It seems they got mixed up between different tabs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
The problem can be replicated is as follows:

1. Open a new browser and create 2 tabs
TAB 1: http://demo.punres.org/?id=105
TAB 2: http://demo.punres.org/?id=48

2. Next, go to tab 1 and click 'test forum'. 

Actual Results:  
You'll see that tab 1 now uses the style of the forum displayed on tab 2...

Expected Results:  
The correct CSS files should be loaded and used on the two tabs separately. At this moment the pages in the tabs use the same CSS document while in fact they differ.

Quick resolution:
A shift + refresh solves the problem
