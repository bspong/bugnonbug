Confusing behavior for password permissions in about:permissions
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:6.0a2) Gecko/20110525 Firefox/6.0a2

When having multiple sub-domains, the Store Passwords option to allow or block, can be confusing. Follow the steps to reproduce in order to get an idea of what I want to say.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new clean profile
2. Go to navigation bar and write mail.google.com
3. Go to about:permissions (You'll have two entries: mail.google.com; www.google.com)
4. Set store password "Block" for mail.google.com
5. Login into gmail.

Actual results:
 - the user will be asked whether he/she wants to save the password

Expected results:
 - the user shouldn't be asked to save the password

Workaround:
 - Set the password store on block for www.google.com domain

This could be confusing for some users - blocking mail.google.com will be seen as not functioning.
