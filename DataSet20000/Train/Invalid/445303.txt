Hey,

You know the new feature in firefox3 ... it's when you close firefox it gives you a prompt to save & close.

I opened two instances of firefox and browse some pages with these two windows (not tabs). In each instance i opened many tabs.

When I colsed the first instance it showed me the new prompt window if I want to ('save and close', 'close' or 'cancel') I selected 'save and close'.

Then I closed the seond instance normally without saving the tabs.

The problem is when I opened firefox again (after closing the two instances) it gives me NOTHING, because I closed another instance without saving the tabs so it erased the first instance's tabs.
