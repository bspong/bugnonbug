User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:6.0.2) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.2
Build ID: 20110902133214

Steps to reproduce:

Browsing the web and suddenly, for no reason at all, it crashed.  Uninstalled everything, tried reinstalling 6.0.2, 6.0.1, and 6.0 (safe mode/non-safe mode) and they all failed to start up.  Kept saying "Firefox had a problem and crashed. We'll try to restore your tabs and windows when it restarts."  It would only work after I went to an earlier version such as 5.0.1.

Crash ID: ed362d31-f3bb-40f9-8105-87e352110916


Actual results:

It appears malware must have been the culprit and I'm guessing as soon as it installed on my system, Firefox crashed and I could not get it to start.  After using your useful tool to analyze the crash, I noticed a strange dll called "NativeHelpNotifier.dll" I did not recognize.  Google and Avira scan turned up nothing on this file and it appears to have been installed recently.

When running msconfig.exe, I found this mysterious entry.
Location: HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
Command: rundll32.exe "C:\Users\choyj\AppData\Local\eapapiARM\NativeHelpNotifier.dll",fxMobileCmds uniapiclass
Manufacturer: "Unknown"

I deselected that entry, renamed the eapapiARM directory to something else, rebooted the system.  After that, Firefox 6 was able to startup once more.  Glad to see that Firefox 6 was able to detect this problem, as well as the crash reporter helping me to narrow down to the problem.  I've archived the offending DLL and deleted it from my system.  I wanted to submit a comment on the crash report, but it wouldn't let me (no authorization), so I submitted this bug so that others are aware of this problem.


Expected results:

Would be nice if Firefox could tell me about the Malware instead of crashing, but that's a bit of a stretch to ask for.

I've attached a zip of the offending malware DLL that's given me quite the headache
