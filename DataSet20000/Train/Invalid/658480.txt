When loading Firefox with saved app tabs it loads a default 'normal' tab to keep browsing.

If this tab is closed a strange behaviour moves the URL panel upwards overlapping the tabs panel.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load Firefox 4.0.1
2. Create some app tabs
3. Close Firefox
5. ReLoad Firefox
3. Close default created tab

Actual Results:  
The URL bar overlaps the tab bar

Expected Results:  
The tab panel and URL panel should keep the same distances.
