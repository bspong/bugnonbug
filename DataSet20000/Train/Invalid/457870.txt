When trying to export bookmarks to a html file, the windows 'open file' dialog box opens, pressing 'save' closes it, but no bookmarks.html file is generate
(broke somewhere in updates to FireFox V3.0.3)

This was in the error console:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "'JavaScript component does not have a method named: "getURIFlags"' when calling method: [nsIAboutModule::getURIFlags]"  nsresult: "0x80570030 (NS_ERROR_XPC_JSOBJECT_HAS_NO_FUNCTION_NAMED)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/places/places.js :: PO_exportBookmarks :: line 381"  data: no]

1.Menu: Bookmarks > Organize...
2. Pointing to all bookmarks, choose menu: Import and Backup > Export HTML
3. use whatever as directory & file (I used D:\Temp\bookmarks.html)
Actual Results:
