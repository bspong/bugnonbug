 I looked up a picture on google, of a Ocelot. When a satisfactory image was found and a picture displayed, I right clicked on the image and chose to save image as, which would have triggered a save as "download sort instance" (downsort 2-5-8) installed and reported compatible. No download window triggered and no download went through. I had to use copy image , and fire up irfanview, to paste the image from the clipboard into that application - then save it. 
Further other extensions also will not work.
I may revert to version 3 (or go to a competitor.
This is a case where not enough research went into the upgrade revision.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log onto google website.
2.Look up any favorite image
3.If the image selected comes up with a page or magazine background, the save image as will most likely not function
Actual Results:  
1. Displayed image as above.
2. Chose to "save image as" with download sort installed
3. No download window started and no download took place

Expected Results:  
Download of image should have started with the save as box displayed.

 Avast antimalware installed on system.
