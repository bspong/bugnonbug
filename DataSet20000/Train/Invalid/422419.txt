The current theme used in Firefox 3 beta 4 uses quite ugly icons for back/forward buttons, especially their visual thickness seems odd in comparison to reload and stop buttons.

Please use something like in the mockup in attachment. The arrows are simply made from the 'X' symbol, splitted in half. This way the theme remains consistent and easy on the eye.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
The back/forward buttons look out of place when "Use Small Icons" is activated.

Expected Results:  
The back/forward buttons should be visually appealing and consistent with the theme.

Please see the attachment.
