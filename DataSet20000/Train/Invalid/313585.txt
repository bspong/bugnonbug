dwwin.exe causes ALL open instances of FF 1.07 browser windows to crash every time.

I run XP Pro with AVG Firewall. At odd times a very quick message from the FW says 'malicious dwwin.exe' blocked, at which time All instances of FF crash immediately.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I have no idea where this dwin.exe comes from...the core browser, extentions I use or the AVG FW
2.
3.
