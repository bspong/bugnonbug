The latest version of the Flash Player (FlashPlayer 9.0.64) isn't completely compatible with Firefox. When I open a new window using JavaScript and ActionScript 2.0, it is blocked by the popup-blocker, even if it's in response to a click of the user.

You can open an new window using Flash and JavaScript as long as it's in response to a click of the user. Here is an example:
myButton.onRelease=function()
{
	getURL("javascript:window.open('NewWindow.html','myNewWindow')");
}
A lot of sites use this behaviour (for example the ActionScript 2.0-Version of the YouTube-Player).

Will this issue be fixed?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Execute this ActionScript 2.0 Code:
myButton.onRelease=function()
{
	getURL("javascript:window.open('NewWindow.html','myNewWindow')");
}
Actual Results:  
Popup gets blocked

Expected Results:  
A window that is opened in response to a click of the user shouldn't be blocked.
