Under view I choose to not use toolbars and no matter what I select they reappear

When launching Firefox 1.5.0.7 (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7) I can see the toolbars that I disabled during the previous session. This also occurs during launch of a new window

To re-itterate my process I go to <view> then on to <toolbars> and then deselect 
the toolbars I want to disable. 

Close firefox then check to verify that it is closed in the task manager
relaunch Firefox and the toolbars reappear as though I never disabled them

I tried rebooting to fix this as well and the same problem exists

additionally though I don't use the bookmarks toolbar I have noticed (cause it won't disable) that the bookmarks don't appear on the tool bar even if I put new bookmarks in the bookmarks toolbar folder manually.

 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.tried several times to disable the to bars under view toolbars
2.rebooted and again tried several times to disable to no avail
3.happens whether relaunching or whether I am just opening a new window

Actual Results:  
Just launch Firefox and once launched open a new window

Expected Results:  
Toolbars all appear even after being disabled

This was not happening until Firefox auto updated this morning
Unfortunately I do not have record of what version I was running 
prior to the auto update
