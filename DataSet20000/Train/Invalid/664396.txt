i opened keezmovies.com categories and this spurious link said you must update mozilla
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1

my firefox has updated befoe to last version {4.0.1} but this link wants to update firefox to unknown version

Reproducible: Always
