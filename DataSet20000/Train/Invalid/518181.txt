Firefox doesn't remember scroll position/page view in history(back button)

Whenever I do a search in google and I scroll down the page, I find a link I want to look at, and then I hit the back button to go back to the search. It doesn't remember the scroll position but always takes me to the top of the page. This is not only so for google pages but others as well. I looked at another bug that was "fixed", that was the bug "Restore Scroll Position" extension referred to(disclosed), but when I commented to it I was told to file a new bug, since it wasn't the same problem(why?)

Unnecesary to say, this is annoying, every other browser I've tried on the same pages, safari, opera, chrome DOES remember the scroll position, so I doubt that google and every other has the cache.no-cache set.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Scroll down on any page, so that the top of the page is invisible
2. click on a link
3. hit the back button to go back to the origin page
Actual Results:  
The browser doesn't remember the place it was on the origin page but scrolls to the top. You can see it stays on the right place for like a millisecond before it scrolls to the top.

Expected Results:  
The browser should remember where it was on the origin page, not scroll to the top.

This is a clean install of firefox, no themes, no extensions or addons installed.
