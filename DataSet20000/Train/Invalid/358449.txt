Foxit pdf reader not compatable with latest version of Firefox

I had no trouble using Foxit pdf reader with earlier versions of Firefox. However, when I installed version 2 I was unable to download or open any pdf files. I got an error message that stated that the pdf file was corrupted. I removed Foxit and all registry entries for Foxit (the uninstall program does not remove registry entries) and installed Acrobat reader. The problem was resolved. 

Reproducible: Always
