SNI support appears to be broken in Firefox 3.6.8

After updating to Firefox 3.6.8 I can no longer access private sites configured for Server Name Indication, these are client sites so cannot provide a sample url, sorry.

Server log states no hostname was provided for SNI.

I found nothing in the release notes related to this so I assume it's a regression, if you use test based development a test for this would probably be worthwhile.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Connect to an SNI based virtual host.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Firefox connects to the default virtual host.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should connect to requested vhost.

Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Ubuntu) mod_ssl/2.2.14 OpenSSL/0.9.8k

[error] No hostname was provided via SNI for a name based virtual host
