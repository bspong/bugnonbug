Look & feel of "inline" XUL

Currently, XUL files displayed within the browser window, such as "about:config", are styled the same way XUL outside the browser window is. Yet some pages, like the "Problem loading page" pages, have a different look & feel.

I propose the creation of a project whose aim is to create a user interface style for XUL rendered within the browser, which would have at least these goals:

1. It should be obvious to the user that he's not viewing a website.
2. The UI should look the same across all platforms.
