Back/forward buttons don't enable/disable after switching tabs

The back/forward buttons appear to be enabled or disabled based on the most history of the most recently opened tab, not the currently displayed tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox, go to any website, click on a link.
2. Verify that the 'back' button is enabled
3. Open a new tab
4. In the new tab, go to any website
5. Verify that the 'back' button is disabled (you haven't followed any links yet)
6. Click on the first tab.

Actual Results:  
The back button is still disabled, even though this tab has a history.  Hitting ALT-Left does nothing, but hitting 'Backspace' still works (however, the Forward button remains disabled).

Expected Results:  
The forward/back buttons should reflect the history of the tab you switched to.

It looks like the forward/back buttons are attached to the most recently opened tab even after you switch tabs.

I have similar problems with the search box (it always tries to find in the most recently opened tab) and the URL bar (switching tabs doesn't update the location bar).
