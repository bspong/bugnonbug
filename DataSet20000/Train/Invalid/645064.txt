The shortcut doesn't work with the "/" key on the main keyboard if I use the "Portuguese (Brazilian ABNT)" keyboard configuration on Windows 7 64bit.

It works if I use the "/" key on the numeric keypad.

If I change the keyboard configuration to "US International" the shortcut works. Note that with the keyboard misconfigured in this way I actually have to press the ";" key, that outputs an "/" in this case.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press the ctrl + / with the keyboard set as "Portuguese (Brazilian ABNT)"
2. Press the ctrl + / using the numeric keypad "/" key with the keyboard set as "Portuguese (Brazilian ABNT)"
3. Change the keyboard type to "US International". Press the ctrl + ;
Actual Results:  
1. Nothing happens
2. Works as intended
3. Works as intended

Expected Results:  
1. toggle add-on bar
2. toggle add-on bar
3. toggle add-on bar
