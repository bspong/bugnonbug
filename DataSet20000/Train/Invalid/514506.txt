I just want to tell you I have this too. I experience this bug as VERY annoying. I changed for that my preferred browser to GChrome, I am sorry. My 3.5.2 is (when Java is on) often slow in showing the typed letters. Maybe there is a link with the number of add-ons I have , now about 36.
Please do add back also the closing x in the first tab, because my setting is "show always tabbar"). It was still there in FF 3.5. Maybe the general closing of FF is related to this removal.
Maybe also related to "This is annoying"-dialogbox after restart.
Please revert those "bad improvements"
