Using the back/forward buttons in applications that use Google Web Toolkit-style history tokens (i.e. http://example.com/#token) causes the page titles in the back/forward button dropdown menu to become incorrect (affects GMail)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008051206 Firefox/3.0

The Google Web Toolkit (http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/) uses history tokens appended to the end of URLs in order to maintain state without refreshing the entire page. For example, GMail uses URLs such as https://mail.google.com/mail/#inbox and https://mail.google.com/mail/#starred to load different sets of messages without reloading the entire page. Firefox correctly notes these as different pages (even though the base URL is the same), but when using the Back/Forward buttons to navigate back and forth through series of such pages, the titles shown in the back/forward button dropdown menu become switched. Specifically, if you start on page A and then navigate to page B, the page titles are stored correctly and in the right order. However, if you then click on the back button to go back to page A, the entries in the back/forward button dropdown menu now depict two instances of page B rather than one of page A and one of page B with page B appearing after page A (chronologically). The original page title for page A has been replaced by that of the page visited immediately before using the back/forward button.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open page A (e.g. https://mail.google.com/mail/#inbox).
2. Navigate to page B (e.g. https://mail.google.com/mail/#starred). Note that the two pages are treated as different pages and the ordering is correct if you view the dropdown menu for the back/forward button.
3. Open the dropdown menu for the back/forward button and click on the entry for page A (i.e. one page back). Alternatively, click the back button.
4. Open the dropdown menu again and note that the page title for page A (which is the current page) has been replaced by the page title for page B. The title of the window has been changed correctly, but the page title shown in the dropdown menu does not match.
Actual Results:  
In the back/forward button dropdown menu, the page title for page A (which is the current page) has been replaced by the page title for page B. The title of the window has been changed correctly, but the page title shown in the dropdown menu does not match.

Expected Results:  
The back/forward button dropdown menu should display titles for page A and page B with page B after page A (chronologically). The current history item in the dropdown menu should also match the window title.

Performed on a new installation of Firefox 3 RC1 in Windows XP SP3. Also appears in new installations of Firefox 2.0.0.14 in Windows XP SP3 and Windows 2000 SP4.
