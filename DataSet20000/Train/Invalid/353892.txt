I tried to download firefox browser and the webpage turned out to be a fake for  downloading firefox.  After I accepted the downloading it took me to a webpage that said there was a different owner and new web address on Quailish.com. I did not click on the web address and I realized then thatthis was not the legitimate download page.  However, just downloading the fake browser page has given someone access to my computer and information. Each time I try to sign it says the information is encrypted but is to be sent to a third party that will gain access to information. I am in the process of having someone reformat my computer. I realize this is not your fault and you are not responsible. I would like for you to investigate fake webpage and web address and have this site shut down if possible so this will not happen to someone else.  I know you do not want your company to be represented in this manner.  I believe you have a strong company and it is a shame that someone would do this not only to me but to your company.  This problem has also caused my browser to crash.  They have taken over my browser. I know you cannot fix my problem but I do hope you are able to shut down the fake website.  
Thank you,
Debbie

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
Shutting down a fake website and hopefully having my computer secure again.

I do get a talkback crash ID and a browser crash. I do know that the software crash ends in .dll. I am not sure of the rest.
