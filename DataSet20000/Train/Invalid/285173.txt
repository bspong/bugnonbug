When using a <img> tag inside a table cell there is a small band of empty space
that is inserted into the table cell below the image.  This is seen even when
you manually set both the table/row/cell size along with the image size.  In the
posted link you can easily see this since I have set the cell background to a
color.  http://abserver2.mmg.uci.edu/~ccrowder/lab/bartest2.html

Expected Results:  
If you load the above page in IE or safari it correctly sizes the table to fit
the image so that 2 rows will have no vertical space between the two images.
