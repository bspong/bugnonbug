If you add a keyword search for the allrecipes.com site instead of automatically searching when you type the "keyword" "content of search" it pulls up the allrecipes.com/default.asp (the homepage) and puts your search in the search bar. Then you must manually click the search button. It is not a huge deal just an annoyance.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to allrecipes.com
2.Right-click the search and select "add a keyword for the search"
3.create that bookmark with the desired keyword
4.type the keyword then a space and a word to search
Actual Results:  
allrecipes.com/default.asp is brought up and the search is put in the search bar.

Expected Results:  
it should go directly to the search with what ever was typed in
