3.0rc1 doesn't load objects from chrome:// URLs that an extension adds to web pages:

Security Error: Content at http://www.google.fi/search?hl=fi&q=hello&btnG=Hae&meta= may not load or link to chrome://wot/skin/fusion/16_16/plain/trusted.png.

This breaks the WOT extension and probably several others. Still worked in beta 5 and all earlier versions.

Reproducible: Always
