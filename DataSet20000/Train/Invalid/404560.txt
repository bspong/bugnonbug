Somehow, the installation of adblock plus or the removal of the navigation and bookmark toolbars has disabled the regular bookmark window that pops up when right clicking the mouse -> bookmark this link. The new window has no cancel button or a close window icon. Now a toolbar like bookmark window pops down from the top left with only the close and done buttons. Clicking "close" still adds a bookmark and hitting 'esc' key doesn't close the window either. One has to then go to bookmarks -> organize bookmarks to delete the bookmark.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Remove the navigation toolbar
2. Remove the bookmark toolbar
3. Install adblock plus, restart firefox
4. Right click a link -> bookmark this link, strange window without cancel button pops down from the top left.
5. Disable adblock plus, restart, still same behavior
Actual Results:  
Strange bookmark window with close and done buttons pops down from top left.

Expected Results:  
Regular bookmark window with cancel button should show up.
