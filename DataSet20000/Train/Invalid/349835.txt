In many cases where we need to scroll quickly to the other end of the tab bar, the tab scrolling button is clicked repetitively. However, this will trigger a doubleclick on the tab bar and spawn a new empty tab. Worse still, it may not be noticed by the user until multiple empty tabs are created.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a big number of tabs until the tab scrolling button appears.
2.Click on the right arrow button multiple times quickly and repetitively.

Actual Results:  
Multiple empty tabs are created.

Expected Results:  
Tab strip scrolls to the end of the tab bar and right arrow button becomes inactive.
