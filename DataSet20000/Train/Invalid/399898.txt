Screenshot of Bug

Within the new Places folder on the bookmarks toolbar, there is a "Most Used Tags" container. Under this, your most used tags will appear and you can see the bookmarks associated with these tags as the menus are expanded out.

Right now, when the final bookmarks are shown, the titles are not displayed, only the favicons. The links work but you won't know what you are selecting. See attached screenshot.

This was seen on Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.9a9pre) Gecko/2007101504 Minefield/3.0a9pre but I saw it in yesterday's build, as well.
