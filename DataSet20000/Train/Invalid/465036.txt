Newest updates cause yahoo mail classic to freeze when replying or downloading attachments.

Ever since the update on 11/11/08  I can log into my yahoo mail classic and read my messages and move and delete them as normal, but when I hit reply, and I type my response and then hit send, it won't send it.  The same thing happens when I try to open attachments.

However, if I Copy my response, then go back to the inbox, click on the message again, click reply again, and paste the message then quickly hit send (all this has to happen in 3 seconds or less) then it will send it.  The same goes for attachments, if I click the attachment the second the windo opens it will download it, but if I take a minute to red the e-mail and then click on it, nothing happens.

Every thing functions normally in IE.  Also, please know that I'm not the only person having this problem, two of my friends are also having this issue.
