Nesting a link within a span within a link causes the html to be rendered incorrectly.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

This HTML:

    <a href="#">
        <span><span>
        a<a href="#">b</a>c
        </span>d</span>e
    </a>

Renders correctly in other browsers but not in Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to the specified url in Firefox
2.Go to the specified url in Opera, IE etc
3.Compare
Actual Results:  
The letter a is enclosed in both sets of spans (you can see this because the tabs have borders in my example.)

Expected Results:  
The letters a, b and c are enclosed in the first span. The letter d is outside of that span but still within another span. The letter e is outside of all of the spans.

I know that people should not enclose links within links but they often do in things such as nested navigation menus etc. This error only seems to occur with spans.
