In Firefox 4, when a <select> dropdown list of options had a large number of options, scrolling through the options often causes the option text to disappear.

Only the option under the mouse pointer is visible.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit site with a large list of drop down options. An example would be:

3. Scroll through the options, either with the mouse scroll wheel or scroll bars.

Actual Results:  
After scrolling, the option text disappears.

This bug doesn't appear to happen in list views, only dropdown lists.
