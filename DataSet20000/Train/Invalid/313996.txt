Keyword Search (bookmark and %s) fails in new tab

When using a keyword search and ctrl+enter to open the results in a new tab, the browser treats the entered text as a URL, not a keyword search.

I have a google bookmark (http://www.google.com/search?q=%s) set with a keyword of "g".

If I enter "g <search phrase>" and hit enter, it works fine

However, if I enter the same string and do ctrl+enter (to open a new tab with the results, so as not to lose my current page) I get "The URL Is Not Valid and Cannot Be Loaded"




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a keyworded bookmark - http://www.google.com/search?q=%s, keyword g
2. enter "g <some search text>" into the location bar
3. press ctrl+enter (assuming that's set up as a trigger to open the location in a new tab)
Actual Results:  
"The URL Is Not Valid and Cannot Be Loaded"

Expected Results:  
Processed the search by opening the keyworded bookmark with the entered search query
