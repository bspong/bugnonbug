Firefox incorrectly detects another running instance

(originally reported as https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=449188)

Firefox won't start due to a claim that it's already running. It brings up a
dialog box, saying:

Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window, you
must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart your system.

The only problem is that there isn't an existing firefox process on that box.
However, there is a running firefox on another box, and my home directory is NFS
mounted, and hence shared between the two. I can't believe this behaviour is
intentional. After all, it's been possible to run two instances of a browser on
multiple boxen pretty much since the dawn of the web. It's quite a regression
that we're unable to do so now...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. NFS mount your home directory on two boxen
2. Start firefox on the first box
3. Attempt to start firefox on the second box
Actual Results:  
It is not possible to run two instance of FF in the given configuration

Expected Results:  
It should be

If you want to run two independent instances of the browser in the same home,
create a different profile for each box. It's not a bug, it's intentional
because of the session management.

Wrong. Maybe Firefox has made such braindead design decisions. But the bug
still stands. Firefox *is* still incorrectly detecting another running
instance, and neither of the proposed actions in the error message will
work. At the very least, the error message needs fixing.
