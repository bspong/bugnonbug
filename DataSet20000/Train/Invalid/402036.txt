After about half an hour, my computer simply stops responding. It always happens when I'm typing a reply to a post in a board (any board... not one specific one or one type).

The only solution is restarting, meaning I often loose updated documents and other things I'm working on.

Because IE just doesn't cut it, I depend on Firefox a lot... but if this keeps going I will have to switch, as I can't keep on doing the same corrections every single time Firefox decides to stop my computer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
It happens after about half an hour of Firefox usage, but the problem is, I don't really know when exactly. All setup is regular and so far, it's only happened when replying/posting on boards, but considering that is about 90% of my internet-usage, I don't know whether it's limited to that.
Actual Results:  
My PC simply stops responding to anything. At first I even thought it was a hardware problem, but... it ALWAYS happens when in Firefox. If I play a game, without opening Firefox, I can keep going for an entire night/day.

Expected Results:  
It should have kept working. 

The problem doesn't occur when hitting 'send', but during the actual typing...

Everything is on default, but I usually have two sessions and several tabs open.

Oh and severity... is all of those.
