After installing several extensions, suddenly my Firefox 1.5 does not open anymore. I shows up in my processes menu. It acts as though it wants to load up, but it never actually appears.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Double click Firefox in your desktop.
2. Wait
3.

Actual Results:  
It grays the titlebar of the screen I am in, but nothing ever appears.

Expected Results:  
It should have opened up and let me surf my first site.
