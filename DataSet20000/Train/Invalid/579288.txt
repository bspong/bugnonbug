Minefield name instead of Firefox name in the default program window

I removed all FF or minefield from my computer.
I installed FF 3.6 and it has been declared as my default browser. That was the case and it was present in the default program window : it was associated to 5 extensions and 3 protocols.
When I installed 32-bit Minefield, I didn't declare it as my default browser.
FF 3.6 is still my default browser, but in the default program window, the Firefox name is replaced by the Minefield one. The logo is still the Firefox one.

For me, it is a different bug from 568849 as it is about 32-bit version.

Reproducible: Always
