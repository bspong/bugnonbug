mac nightly builds of FF 3.0a should be, at some time, built with --enable-accessibility
I do not know why I am filing this bug, but I do not see this recorded anywhere else. Which seems odd.

FF 3.0 will become final at some time X. I assume that --enable-accessibility will have to be turned on at some time Y, with Y hopefully before X.

So, what should (X - Y) be? Well, if everyone is completely sure there will be no problems with turning it on, then (X-Y) can be a day. Is this what people think?

I keep looking in the about:buildconfig pages of the nightlies. For example, I just checked:

- Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a8pre) Gecko/2007081205 Minefield/3.0a8pre
- Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.9a8pre) Gecko/2007081204 Minefield/3.0a8pre

Neither one is using the flag.

So, do people know when the time Y will occur? If it is in the plan, I can stop checking for it manually. Thanks.
