While I'm opening a web page that containing a media object like MP3 background music, then I will get an error message. That the massage box will displays following details.

Message heading: Microsoft Visual C++Runtime Library
Error message: Runtime Error!
               Program: C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe
               R6034
               An application has made an attempt to load the C runtime library incorrectly. Please contact the application's contact team for more information.

This message box will come 3 times and the back ground music will work properly. But after some times Microsoft common Error reporting dialogue box will come and  Firefox will close automatically.

Now a days i'm feeling Firefox is bit slower, means web page loading. And hanging this software while I'm opening more than 5-6 tab at a time.

Some times I got another problem that while I'm serching something in Google, then  I will open 5-10 search result at time. But some page wont load automatically, that means I want to press the GO button or refresh button manually but that URL will display in the address bar.
