I was playing around with firefox and when i closed it my computer started going very slow. I checked my task manager and firefox.exe was taking 99% of my CPU processing. There were no windows of firefox open anywhere. I took some screenshots of the taskmanager and also the error message that came when i tried to open firefox again. The only way it would close was to end the process. It has happend twice so far. 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open firefox
2.Make sure there are tabs open.
3.Close firefox and hit the quit button.
Actual Results:  
Most of the times is closes no problem but twice it has stayed open with no windows visible and the computer starts to go slow. 

Expected Results:  
Program close.

Here are a few screen shots of what it looked like.
