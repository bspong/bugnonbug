My computer has Windows ME and Firefox. When I log into my snapfish account to upload photos, it tries to install their 'quickupload' tool which let's you quickly select multiple photos to upload. However Firefox just hangs and every 15-20 seconds the page reloads but it never progresses past the 'installing software' screen. The quickupload tool works fine in IE 6 and Netscape 7 on a Windows ME machine, so I don't think the problem is with Snapfish.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into www.snapfish.com account.
2. Go the upload photos sections. Select folder to upload to.
3. Quickupload tool tries to install. Browser gets stuck in loop trying to install tool.
Actual Results:  
Have to exist browser.

Expected Results:  
Installed quickupload tool so I can upload photos.  It works in IE 6 and Netscape 7.
