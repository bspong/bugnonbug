Recently Bookmarked does not follow syntax specs

It seems to me that the default value for Recent Bookmarked in the Smart Bookmakrs sis not correct. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set browsers.places.createdSmartBookmarks to false
2. Relaunch Minefield
3.
Actual Results:  
The location of Smart Bookmarks > Recently Bookmarked contains several query components like folder=TOOLBAR_MENU etc. This should be folder=2 etc. Moreover, the "specs" (as far as they exist) say that having several 'folder' components gives the *intersection* of the folders. It seems that what you want is the *union*. 

Expected Results:  
Components should be folder=2 etc. 

Which is wrong, or am I wrong?
