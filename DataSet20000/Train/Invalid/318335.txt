FireFox 1.5RC3 displayed full list of quick search engines. After upgrading to the 1.5 final release, there are no engines listed in quick search. Clicking on add engine does not allow adding of "standard" engines.

Reinstalled 1.5final and had same problem.

Talkback 1.5 and All-In-One Gestures 0.17.4 installed.

Reproducible: Always
