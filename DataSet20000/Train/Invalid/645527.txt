This graphic site works OK under Internet Explorer;  It first delays, then shows a "Green" airplane.  Click on airplane slowly brings up the map and tracks.

Two Mozilla Versions ago it worked.
One Mozilla Version ago it sometime shows map, but never tracks.
Latest Mozilla Version never shows the "green" airplane to get map started.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bring up website
2. My system never brings up "green" airplane
3. Previous Mozilla never brought up tracks.
Actual Results:  
Just invoke website and click on the "green" airplane symbol.  Works OK under Internet Explorer.
