More buttons in Customize Toolbar dialog.
I like Firefox' minimalist approach to toolbars, and the default set of 5
buttons suites the needs of more general users. It is the intermediate to
advanced users who actually use the Customize option in the toolbars. Thus the
dialog should contain some buttons that will cater to the more advanced users.
These buttons should not be in the default UI but should be easily added by
simple customization. I suggest the following buttons: Up, Snapback, Show/Hide
Images, Full Screen, Font Size, Print Preview, and JavaScript Console. Feel free
to suggest others. Some of the buttons I suggested may even be more useful than
some buttons which are already there, such as Cut, Copy and Paste.
