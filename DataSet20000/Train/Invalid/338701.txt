xsl:output method="xml" breaks XHTML rendering
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-UK; rv:1.7.13) Gecko/20060418 Fedora/1.0.8-1.1.fc4 Firefox/1.0.8

When applying an XSLT transformation, the contents of <head/> (such as the title) get rendered in the main document window as if they were specified in <body/> if the output method is set to "xml".  i.e.:

<xsl:output method="xml" version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" omit-xml-declaration="yes" doctype-public="-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" doctype-system="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd" indent="yes" media-type="application/xhtml+xml" />

Changing the method to "html" fixes the problem, but this seems broken since XHTML is really XML rather than HTML (which doesn't require tags to be closed).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Request an XML document which links to an XSLT stylesheet that sets the output method to "xml" and output's an XHTML document containing <head><title>Foo</title></head>

Actual Results:  
The title appears in the main window as if it were part of the <body/> rather than appearing in the window titlebar.

Expected Results:  
The resultant XHTML should be parsed as if it were received directly from the server.

Selecting the whole page and viewing the selection source shows that the XHTML has been generated correctly
