[proto] HTTPS pages lead to left end of location bar being displayed twice

HTTPS locationbar, broken

Whenever I access a Mozilla https site, the round part on the left-hand-side of the location bar is rendered twice. See the screenshot.

This does not happen when a company name is displayed in this spot, as is the case for Ebay (second screenshot).
