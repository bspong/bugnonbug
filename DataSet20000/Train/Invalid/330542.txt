When opening Firefox continually prompted to download ADSAdClient31.dll
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

After the latest upgrade as soon as I load Firefox I am prompted to load ADSAdClient31.dll. The problem intensifies when I then use Hotmail where I get the same prompt between 2 and 4 times with every e-mail that I read, delete etc.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox - Prompt to download appears
