I got firefox from downloading the google toolbar. it was a package. the google toolbar on firefox does noy have a link for google bookmarks. there is no option in "options" to add it either. somewhere in "add-ons" instruction was given on how to get the link on the google toolbar, but it didn't work, in fact it interfered with the browser operating efficiently. i have google bookmarks on the google toolbar on IE..it automatically is there. how do i get google bookmarks to appear on the google toolbar on Mozilla Firefox?

this feature is a part of the google toolbar and should be there from the beginning.
