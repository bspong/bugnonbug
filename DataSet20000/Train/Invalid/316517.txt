The background image in the first URL below was somehow replaced by the image in the bottom URL when I view any hfboards.com page.  I found the second image by looking at the pages in my history that I viewed today.  This happened for any page views for 16 hours (over 50) but now has returned to normal.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Viewed the koto01.jpg picture.
2. Went to hfboards.com
Actual Results:  
The background image on all hfboards.com pages is the koto01.jpg image.

Expected Results:  
The background is supposed to be the bg.jpg image.

As this looks like a cache problem, it might be from the google web accelerator as I have that installed.  I have cleared my cashe in both Firefox and the google web accelerator and tried to reproduce it but after the 16 hours of the problem once it went away I haven't been able to reproduce it.
