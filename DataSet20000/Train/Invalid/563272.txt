"Fast Browser search" installed I believe from the use of some Facebook apps. Has its own useless toolbar in Firefox now and is the default tab provider whenver I open a new tab.

Ive followed instructions for removing this crap from various internet guides - playing with the plug ins, messing around with about:config, uninstalling from the control panel and in the end uninstalled firefox and reinstalled it (without migrating any of my old settings over so losing my old favourites in the process) I've even tried using RevoUninstaller Pro. In spite of all these things whenever I open a new tab I still get this annoying fast browser search page as the default that loads up and it still hijacks me when a click on a variety of internet links

The wife and her Facebook addiction have a lot to answer for! I love Firefox but unless this thing is fixed by some update soon I think Ill have to revert to using Internet Explorer as that remains unaffected by this on my PC for now.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on open new tab
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Fast Browser Search page opens in a new tab

Expected Results:  
Should have opened a blank tab for me to enter a URL into

The above is irritating but you can get round by clicking home to take me back to the google site I have set as my home page, whats more annoying is in many instances I will clikc on an internet link or search result and Ill get taken to teh fast browser search instead of the intended target with a message saying fast browser search cant find the website.
