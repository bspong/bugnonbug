Whenever there is a website that needs flash, the bar comes up that says "an additional plugin is needed, click to install". This happens even though I have flash already installed. Whenver the flash plugin is installed (it successfully identifies, downloads and "installs" the correct plugin), flash still doesn't work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to www.youtube.com
2.click any video
3."install" flash
4.try any youtube video again
Actual Results:  
The bar that says flash is needed still appears.

Expected Results:  
Flash should have installed and the video should have played.

My computer is AMD, which shouldn't cause an issue but you never know. I've also done some about:config things, but only involved things like max requests and pipelining.
