Installation of extensions and personas not working (because xpinstall.whitelist.add always gets reset).
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6

xpinstall.whitelist.add and xpinstall.whitelist.add.36 are emptied.

This prevents personas from being shown when hovering over them at getpersonas.com.
That way using this nice feature is discouraged due to the missing preview.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Check the FF preferences and make sure there IS a value in Security > Warn, when websites try installing extensions > Exceptions.
E.g.: FF 3.6 sets these default values:
addons.mozilla.org
getpersonas.com
Set them.
about:config says, that the values (xpinstall.whitelist.add) are empty.
Opening the preferences menu again, they are still in this field there.

2. Close FF and start it again.

3. The values in xpinstall.whitelist.add and in the field are empty.

Actual Results:  
xpinstall.whitelist.add and also xpinstall.whitelist.add.36 should still be set.

Expected Results:  
The values I set should still be there.

Worked in FF 3.5.

Looking in about:config FF notes the empty strings as "changed/set by user" and I can set them back to the default. This is then also displayed in about:config.
But after a restart these values are again gone.

As this breaks the preview of the major feature personas, I set this bug to "major".
