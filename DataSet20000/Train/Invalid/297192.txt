Temp files from Internet do not clear

The temp files created from internet browsing do not clear when exiting session,
nor do they clear when hitting "clear cache" in the tool, or even when using
Disk Cleanup utility from Microsoft.  I had 20 sub-directories with over 1500
items in each.  Please advise.  I love FireFox and plan to continue to use it -
but I must be able to correct this problem.

Thank you

Reproducible: Always
