nsSVGUtils::ReportToConsole() is unused?
The nsSVGUtils::ReportToConsole() method seems to be unused, there are no calls to it. This also means there are no error messages to display from the SVG category?

See bug 595934 which is about tracking the relevant messages from all of the categories. SVG seems to be one, but the aforementioned issue seems to make the SVG category not relevant.
