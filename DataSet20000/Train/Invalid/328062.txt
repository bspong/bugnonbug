Memory leak is still really bad!

I'm getting REALLY sick of Firefox crashing MULTIPLE times a day!!!  I'm in it most of the day and end up losing A LOT of information that is sometimes difficult to return to.

The reason for the crashes - Firefox (curr. ver - 1.5.0.1) is not releasing memory and will even continue to eat memory when I'm not doing anything.  Even using a memory manager doesn't help.  

Last night, I closed all but one tab (which had very little on it) and it still said that Firefox was using almost 200MB of memory!!!  When it crashed the last time, it was taking up over 300MB of memory!!!  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox, browse somewhere
2. Open a couple of tabs with links
(check memory in Task Manager)
3. Open a few of the links from those pages (so that some pages stay static while others continue to load)
(check memory in Task Manager)
4. Repeat a couple of times, opening and closing tabs
(check memory in Task Manager)
5. Repeat steps 3-5 for about 3-5 HOURS
(check memory in Task Manager)
6. Close all but one tab
(check memory in Task Manager)

Actual Results:  
Current memory in use by Firefox, with 4 tabs open - 206,516K (fluctuating between 201,180 - 206,800)

Expected Results:  
Making a list/log of the various memory checks, you should find that the memory will sometimes drop, but not significantly.

With only a single tab open, Firefox should eat up very little memory (10MB-50MB), but instead it fails to release the memory.
