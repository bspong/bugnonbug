New download of 0.91 Firefox application will not launch on iMAC running OS X.  I installed over a 
previously installed version of 0.8.   First try I imported bookmarks, etc. from 0.8 install.  Initiating 0.9 
version, icon shows up in finder bar, but then disappears - and no app running.  Removed all files / 
references to Firefox installation, and retried from fresh DMG download.  This time did not import 
bookmarks.  Still, no application running.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  download distribution
2. unstuff
3. click app to start

Actual Results:  
app failed to launch

Expected Results:  
browser app should have launched

could this be a weird iMAC OS X idiosyncrasies?
is there any known incompatibilities with Sophos virus protection software not recognizing Firefox app 
and killing the new install launch?
