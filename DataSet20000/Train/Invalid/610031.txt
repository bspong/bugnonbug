Everytime you open a Gadget there is a blank place, but when you open it with the newest opera or chrome all is okay and the gadget works normally.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. deinstall firefox 3.6.12
2. install an older version which works with HTML5
then it works

Actual Results:  
you run an older version but that can't be a solution

Expected Results:  
it should run with the newest version

i think its maybe a problem with the HTML5 support, because Google Wave works with it
