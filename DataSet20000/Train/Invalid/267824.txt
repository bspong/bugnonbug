Firefox is ugly and sucks

You can't release Firefox 1.0 like that! Just see how ugly it looks like,
horrible! You need to improve Firefox for at least some years to get a decent
release!

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to spreadfirefox.com
2. Download Firefox
3. Note ugliness

Actual Results:  
I was horrified and went back to IE (after a short jump over to Mozilla).

Expected Results:  
Stay with Firefox :)
