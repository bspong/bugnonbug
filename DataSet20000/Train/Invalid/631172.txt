If the user opens more than one tab in the browser, then makes one of the tab active and tries to close the other (inactive) tab by clicking on its Close Tab (X) button the inactive tab becomes active for a moment so one can see its content. Then this tab successfully closes and the focus switches back to the active tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open multiple tabs in the browser (2 will be sufficient).
2. Load some content to each tab.
3. Make one of the tabs active.
4. Close some other (inactive) tab by clicking on its Close Tab button (X).
Actual Results:  
The focus quickly switches to the inactive tab which is being closed so one can see its content for a few moments. Then the focus switches back to the active tab and the inactive tab successfully closes.

Expected Results:  
The inactive tab closes completely in the background without temporary switching focus to it.

The default theme is used.
