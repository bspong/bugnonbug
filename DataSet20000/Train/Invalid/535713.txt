I have RoadRunner account and the delete button will not work in open mail scrren.
I have to close open mail and go to main screen to open up list of mail, then toggle each email to be deleted and delete in list mode rather than open mail mode with delete button on that page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open mail to read actual message
2. hit delete on message screen for that message
3.
Actual Results:  
mail will not delete

Expected Results:  
delete current message and open next message into screen
