Firefox bars occupy most of my screen, no more room for the html page.
[default ubuntuOS install]. I could have used the fullscreen F11 key but I finally had to install Google Chrome.

Firefox is not usable for normal users. Because normal users will not fullscreen, they will bother with Firefox default bars.

Think about improving the screen space and give space for the html page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open Firefox from scratch
2.notice how few place remains for the html page
