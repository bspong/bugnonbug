investigate using _draggingContainer on all platforms when dragging folders on bookmarks toolbar
spin off from bug 418671

We are setting and unsetting _draggingContainer for all platforms, but using
only in Linux, investigate activation of that on all
platforms, i think it would greatly help on Windows too.
