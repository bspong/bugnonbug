Unfortunately, I cannot paste a screen print of the files but I have been uncovering .MOZ files in my C:\RECYCLER\NPROTECT folder....they are reflected in my spyware/malware scans and I am concerned as to how they got there......there are tens of thousands of them intermixed with some .sql and .txt files but most are .moz files......are these in any way related to your processes?
I am running Mozilla Firefox and am completely up to date......
Thanks for your efforts,
Blazer
