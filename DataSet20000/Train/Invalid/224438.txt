Drop down nav menus appear in different place than in the Windows version of Firebird 0.7 & Clicking on them does nothing
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)

The drop down menus at the top of the page work fine in my windows version of 
Firebir 0.7, but on my linux machine, using the same browser, they don't work.  
They appear in the wrong places, and even when you get the mouse over them to 
click (you CAN do this if you play with it enough), they do nothing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try using the nav-bar @ http://campbells.dikaios.net in the Mozilla Firebird 
0.7 Windows Version
2. Try using the nav-bar @ http://campbells.dikaios.net in the Mozilla Firebird 
0.7 Linux Version

Actual Results:  
Menus were non-functional, even though the code is COMPLETELY w3 standard

Expected Results:  
Exactly what was seen in the windows version.

Code on site is w3 standards compliant
