Widescreen display corrupts after PC up for 48 hours

I have an LG 1920x1200 monitor. If I maximise the Firefox window the top menu bar and toolbar only enlarges to about 1200px wide - the rest is filled with garbage. The status bar also fails to enlarge properly. 
This happens with ActiveState Komodo IDE 5.0 as well. 
The two programs exhibit this effect at the same time - usually about 48 hours after PC startup.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Komodo 5.0 and Firefox
2. Leave PC up 48 hours (with apps open??)
3. Maximise either window
Actual Results:  
The screen does not redraw properly - seems mostly to be toolbars/menu/status bar.

Expected Results:  
Should have filled the screen with Firefox

None
