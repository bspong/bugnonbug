PNGs with alpha transparency that are set as a background image using CSS' url('image.png') get darker after a seemingly random amount of time *not* looking at the webpage.

The URL is my personal website in-progress, which is where I'm encountering this bug, specifically on the "home / search plugins" bar. If the background image is also embedded using the normal <img> tag, *that* will not get darker, while the the background image will.

Right-clicking on the strip and selecting "View Background Image" will show the image correctly.

I've also attached a side-by-side image.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the included URL in a new tab.
2. Do something else for a while. Doesn't matter what, but the time seems to be random.
3. Check back now and then.
4. Select "View Background Image" from the context menu.
5. Press "Back".

Actual Results:  
Eventually, the "navbar" will be significantly darker. Once you view the background image, it will return to normal.

Expected Results:  
The PNG should not get darker after any amount of time.
