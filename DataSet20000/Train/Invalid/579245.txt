Seems like firefox crashes every time you right-click a file in any open/save file dialog. It simply shows a 'waiting' cursor and hangs. Force-kill the task to close it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go on File -> Open File...
2. Open a folder where a file can be seen
3. Right-Click the file to open a context menu
Actual Results:  
Firefox hangs.

Expected Results:  
Showed Windows file context-menu.

Windows is Build 7100. Does seems to happens on RC and OEM softwares I tested as well.
