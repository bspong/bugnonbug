AdBlock+ memory/cpu usage leak

After installing AdBlock 6.1.2 I noticed a large spike in memory and cpu usage, to the point where I can no longer operate Firefox and have to restart the browser.  Note:  AdBlock 6.1.2 is the only extension installed, and this was not an issue until I installed it.

Once it starts "leaking" (as it will operate fine for the first twenty minutes or so, then CPU usage will spike to 95-99 and memory usage goes up to over 100,000-150,000), clicking on links yields no results; right clicking or going to menus show only shadows of the menu and no options appear; and the only way to navigate through tabs is by ctrl+tab -- clicking on tabs does not change the view.

Reproducible: Sometimes
