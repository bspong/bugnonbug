When you are reading through gmail messages it is not possible to open a new tab to read the message by right clicking on the message.  Instead of the right click menu for links you get the right click menu for anywhere on a page (Back, forward, reload instead of Open Link, Open in new window, Open in new tab).  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open gmail
2. Right click on a mail message
3. Observe that you are not given the option of opening a new tab/window.
