Produces Black Lines on Screen
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506; InfoPath.2)
Build Identifier: We have tried several versions and they all have problem

This url: http://devel.webproadvice.com/dimon/water_portal/country/Canada.html is one of a set if over 200 web pages that all have the same problem,

Black lines apear on the screen that are not in the programmed tables.

Problem does NOT occur with all versions of IE or Safari.  Only with Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://devel.webproadvice.com/dimon/water_portal/country/Canada.html
2.Scroll down the page.
3.
Actual Results:  
Black lines appear in Firefox only.

Expected Results:  
Should have displayed tables without the black lines.  Should display as in IE and Safari, etc.

This is specualtion:

All the web pages on this site that have tables which display this problem have a commonality that MIGHT be germane.  The tables were generated by Microsoft Excel 2007 running on a Windows Business Vista OS.  Tables were developed in Excel and formatted with the same Macro.  Then saved as html,  Then pasted into the web page.

There may be something about either the Macro that was used or the Excel 2007 save as html filter that produces something that Foxfire sees but the other browsers do not.
