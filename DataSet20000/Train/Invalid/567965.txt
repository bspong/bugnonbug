I am using the following code in my .htaccess
#Stop Image Hotlinking
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http(s)?://(www.)?mysite.net [NC]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !google. [NC]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !search?q=cache [NC]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !msn. [NC]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !yahoo. [NC]
RewriteRule .*\.(jpe?g|gif|bmp|png)$ – [F]

Its strange that the image is not hotlinking on IE but on firefox it loads, what exactly is the problem ?

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
The image loaded

Expected Results:  
Image shouldn't have loaded on another site except mine
