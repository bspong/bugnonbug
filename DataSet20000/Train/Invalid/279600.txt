Entire machine crashes when viewing site containing Flash

When I visit a site that has flash anywhere in it (banner ads, etc.), my entire
machine freezes and I have to press and hold the power button to shut it down.
Ctrl-Alt-Del does nothing. Entire machine hosed. This has happened on any site
with Flash (nytimes.com, ivillage.com for instance). I've seen other bug reports
about Flash issues but they never mention people's entire computers crashing. I
have tried uninstalling every version of Firefox that I had on my machine and
then installing the latest version, and then going to Macromedia and downloading
the latest Flash plugin. That worked for about 2 seconds and now I'm back to the
crashing problem. I don't even care about the Flash ads! If they didn't render,
that would be okay! I just want to use Firefox and right now I can't!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any site that has a Flash animation on it.
2. Watch entire computer freeze.
3. Force machine to shut off.

Actual Results:  
Machine crashed.

Expected Results:  
It can do whatever it wants with the Flash animations as long as it doesn't
crash my entire machine.

I don't get any crash messages, so I can't report on them. If this is the same
as someone else's bug, my apologies, but a) half the bug reports are written in
techie so I can't understand a word of what's actually being said, and b) I
didn't see any other examples of people's entire machines crashing.
