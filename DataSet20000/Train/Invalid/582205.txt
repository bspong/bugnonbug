Whenever I open an existing text doc on my Google Docs account, as well as a new one, as default layout google chooses the one for mobile phones (although I'm using a 15" notebook).
This does not happen on Firefox 3.6.8 using the same Google account (so, it's not an account specific-setting issue).
Perhaps Minefield is telling google it's being used from a mobile device?
