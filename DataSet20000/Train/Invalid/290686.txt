     This report applies to Firefox 1.0.3, which I installed last night (April
16, 2005).
     The application does not complete loading. The browser screen comes up, but
the progress bar goes only half-way. A message displays in taskbar, lower left,
that it is looking for Google.com. Everything stays in that state from then on. 
     I have backed up to Firefox 1.0.2, and it works with no problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download Install Firefox 1.0.3

3.

See details above

Expected Results:  
Load completely and run as previous versions.

Program does not actually crash. It just fails to finish loading. Cannot add
anything else,
