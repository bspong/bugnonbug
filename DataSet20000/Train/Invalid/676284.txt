slow downloads; more bytes transferred results in lower data rate
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build ID: 20110615151330

Steps to reproduce:

http://linux1.fnal.gov/linux/fermi/slf6rolling/i386/iso/SLF-6-i386-2011-07-01-Install-DVD.iso

I attempted to down the ISO from the link above on this web page:

http://linux1.fnal.gov/linux/fermi/slf6rolling/i386/iso/

Using Firefox 5.0


Actual results:

Very slow download.  Perhaps, zero bytes per second.


Expected results:

The ISO should have downloaded.

When I use the exact same link with wget the file downloads in about 6 minutes
(I have a 100MbHz kink to the server from my workstation.  Average wget download
speed was 11.2 MbHz.

I have seen this problem in every 3, 4 and 5 version of Firefox I have used.
(At least the following: 3.0, 3.5, 3.6.4, 4.0, 4.0.1 and 5.0).  This problem only
seems to occur on large downlaods (10s of MB or larger)..
