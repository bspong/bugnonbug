I want freedom to go to #firefox on the freenode IRC network. If I can't, I want to know why. If I can't get either, then I don't know.  Anyone that can give me freedom to go to #firefox on freenode IRC network can communicate with me on IRC: /msg psycho23 on freenode. And if the someone that has the authority to unban psycho23 ("*!*@97-120-238-71.ptld.qwest.net") can't communicate with me (CH, Inc) via /msg psycho23 on freenode, then that person may use the communication medium of email: ch.1987.ad@gmail.com

I can't just /msg ernov with my solution.  I need to be in #firefox so that I may represent ernov on the basis of the channel's purpose, which is to support those that have needs related to using Mozilla Software.

If I'm not in #firefox I do not represent anything other than the business of CH, Inc.  So in order to supply ernov with a solution of anything, I must be in a channel that he is in. I do not want to represent CH, Inc.  I want to represent the purpose of #firefox on freenode.  However the assumed bottom-line of ernov is: "I want the Adobe PDF Viewer Plugin for Firefox to autosave the PDF to the filesystem on/when the Adobe PDF Viewer Plugin for Firefox pdf file download complete."

So if I go back to #firefox and ernov is still there, I don't know, because I haven't been in #firefox, so I don't know what ernov had stated while I was not in #firefox.  Therefore I will type this in IRC:
ernov: I was outside of #firefox for some time, is ernov's bottom-line still "I want the Adobe PDF Viewer Plugin for Firefox to autosave the PDF to the filesystem on/when the Adobe PDF Viewer Plugin for Firefox pdf file download complete."?

And after I do that, I don't know.

Reproducible: Always
