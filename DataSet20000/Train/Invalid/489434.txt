attempted to load browser backgrounds 0.2 extension for my firefox browser. went to http://browserbackgrounds.com/ website and i am able to see the home page, but when i click on the link for the backgrounds page i am unable to see the various backgrounds offered on the page. all of the images are in gif format and they don't appear on any pictures that are gif images. i have tried half a dozen websites with gif images and the same issue there too. at all of the sites the name of the gif image will appear but not the pic itself. also have downloaded the install program from above website under the extension tab on the websites homepage.
