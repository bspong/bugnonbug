patcher2.pl doesn't clean up temp files
Having run patcher2 a bunch of times during setup and testing I managed to fill up my temp dir. When I went and looked there were TONS of directories lying around that had un-marred mar files in them. No wonder I ran out of space. A full gig dedicated to patcher. :-)
