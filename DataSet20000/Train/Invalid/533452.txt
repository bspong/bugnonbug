firefox 3.5.5 will load one page (slowly) and then rarely will it load others
User-Agent:       Opera/9.80 (X11; Linux i686; U; en) Presto/2.2.15 Version/10.10
Build Identifier: [user@localhost ~]$ rpm -qa firefox firefox-3.5.5-1.fc12.i686 

I've been going in circles on this one with IRC people. Got GDB installed and found lots of .dynamic errors though unfortunately couldn't get gdb to tell me why pages load so slow. OPERA 10 loads all pages very quickly for me. FX few to no pages load at speed or at all.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start firefox
2.wait for pages to load (almost never happens)
3.
Actual Results:  
I waited.
