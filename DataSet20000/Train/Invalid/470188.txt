Maintains visited pages history even though option is turned off

"Remember visited pages for the last 9 days" is unchecked, yet 2.0.0.19 still remembers visited pages, because it attempts to autocomplete them. "Recently Closed Tabs" is populated which also did not happen in 2.0.0.18

I want to downgrade back to 2.0.0.18 but that is nowhere to be found. Aargh. I'm perfectly aware 2.0.0.19 is EOL but WTF ?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to a site.
2.Close window or tab
