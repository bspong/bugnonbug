As illustrated by the URL above, the links in the Mediawiki site navigation box become "inactive."  That is, they do not appear as links.  When cliking on them or mousing over them they appear as text except you cannot select the text to copy it.  The top three links (Main Page, News Updates, and Recent Changes) are affected.  In addition the box title "site navigation" cannot be selected to be copied (the other titles can be).  

The occurs in Linux and Windows XP versions of Firefox 1.5.  It does not occur in IE 6.0.  This occurs in all instances of MediaWiki we've installed.
