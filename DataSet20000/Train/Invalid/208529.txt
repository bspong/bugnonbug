In "Bookmarks Manager" window, I'm tring to copy & paste a set of bookmarks from
"Bookmarks Toolbar Folder" to root folder (I want display them in main
bookmark's menu) but I can't, because "paste" menu item is disabled.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open "Bookmarks Manager" window
2. Select a bookmark inside "Bookmarks Toolbar Folder" (or any other internal
folder)
3. Select "paste" in context menu
4. Click in bookmarks' root folder (all toolbar buttons will be disabled)
5. Open context menu and you'll see disabled paste menu item. 

Actual Results:  
Paste menu item is disabled while I'm located in root folder, so I can't copy
bookmarks from any folder to root folder.

Expected Results:  
Paste menu item should be enabled, and I'll could copy & paste bookmarks to root
folder
