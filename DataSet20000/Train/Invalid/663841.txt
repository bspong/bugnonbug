Firefox Beta by default should not be installed into Release Firefox File directory
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0

Since Firefox Beta is designed to be a beta channel and hence forever in beta, it should not install itself by default in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox" but in C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox Beta or C:\Program Files (x86)\Beta instead. 

The problem with this current default is that you may end up overwriting Firefox Final with Firefox Beta, unintentionally.  

Reproducible: Always
