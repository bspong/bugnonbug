Something is wrong when updating the extension ColorfulTabs, since if you update it, it just finds the same update though it's already updated.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get a FF2 or FF3RC1 compatible ColorfulTabs extension (http://binaryturf.com/software/colorfultabs-for-firefox/) .
2. Launch FF3RC1.
3. Go to Extensions and check for updates.
4. Install the new 3.0 RC1 version.
5. After installation, relaunch the browser.
6. Go to Extensions and check again for updates.
Actual Results:  
The installation is maybe not complete, hence FF3RC1 keeps saying that there's a new version available

Expected Results:  
Should've said that there are no new updates
