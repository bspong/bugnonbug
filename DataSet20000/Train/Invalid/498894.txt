When I updated FF to 3.5b99 I began to notice whenever I try to download anything from anywhere the name is blank. I am using Zone Alarm Extreme on FF and IE8. Using FF I notice next to FILE name it is blank. Next to TYPE it read unknown. When I click SAVE the FILE NAME is blank. If I name the file it will download but you have to choose an application to open the file. What a pain. I switched to IE8 64 bit and tried the exact downloads. This time next to FILE there is the name of the file. Next to TYPE it give me the type of file. When I click SAVE the name of the file is there. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click download no file name or type
2. Click save as or even run no file name
3. If I name the file it will download but you have to choose an application to open the file.
Actual Results:  
I had to choose an application to open the file. The blank file that I had to name in order to download does not have an extension.

Expected Results:  
next to FILE there is the name of the file. Next to TYPE it give me the type of file. When I click SAVE the name of the file is there. I should not have to name a blank file only to find out I still cannot open it.

This is pain because I am a FF user and not a fan of IE. I am forced to switch to IE when I need to download anything.
