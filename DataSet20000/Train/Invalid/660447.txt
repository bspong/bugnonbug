middlemouse.contentLoadURL is reset to false at each restart
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1

Every time I restart firefox, middlemouse.contentLoadURL is reset to false.
If I go to about:config, set it to true and exit firefox, the following line is inserted in prefs.js:
user_pref("middlemouse.contentLoadURL", true);

As soon as I restart firefox, the line above is removed from pref.js, and about:config reports the option as "false".

I also tried to add the line above to my user.js, but it does not have any effect.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. set middlemouse.contentLoadURL to true in about:config
2. restart firefox
3. go to about:config and check for its value
