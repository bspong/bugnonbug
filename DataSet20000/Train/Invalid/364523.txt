Don't get angry, but I (jidanni) reported at least 50 firefox bugs to bugs.debian.org as I can only use email, and just barely this web interface, here in my batched environment. Do check there to see if there are any worthy bugs, and in the future, I will make a script to submit bugs via this HTTPS form.

Reproducible: Always
