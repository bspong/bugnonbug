I have to terminate Firefox if the page contains endless alert script, because I can't stop it.

This bug has been filed for some prior versions, but still not fixed. There are some bad pages, that contain <script>while(true){alert('whatever');}</script>. If I open such a page, I can't close the browser because of endless alerts, so I have to terminate it, using console, losing all the opened pages and the data, I have typed in the forms, dropping sessions, etc. I think in every alert there must be an option to stop the JavaScript on the page, so user can quit the endless loop. I think it must be fixed in next version, because it's very easy to distrupt normal user's work because of that.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Notepad
2. Write "<html><head><script>while(true){alert('OMG');}</script></head><html>"
3. Save it as html page
4. Open it
Actual Results:  
I can't close the browser, and I must terminate it, losing everything I opened, written, etc.

Expected Results:  
There should be a button or checkbox "Prevent this page from opening additional windows" or "Stop JavaScript on this page", so I can quit alert loop.

I know, I post the duplicate, but this bug has been posted for many prior versions, but still not fixed.
