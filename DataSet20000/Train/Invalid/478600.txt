When I swipe left or right, Firefox moves through the tabs (either left or right) instead of going forward and back in history.  All the other gestures work as stated.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a few tabs
2. Go through a few links in one tab

Actual Results:  
3. Try to go back or forward in the middle of the tab history and it just goes through the open tabs

Expected Results:  
Go back and forth between history of the open tab.
