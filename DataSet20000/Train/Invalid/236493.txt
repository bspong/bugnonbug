Firefox has a problem with backqoutes
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

I use backqoutes in some form elements because my database has text fields that
contains both " and '.

Example: <input type='text' name='Author' size='40' value=`Michael O'Toole`>

But Firefox only prints the the first word after the `.
