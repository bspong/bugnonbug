Major system failure
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.7.1) Gecko/20040707
Build Identifier: Firefox versions 0.9.1 and 0.9.2

When using the latest two builds of Firefox the system would spomtaneously
restart.  This usually occurred after being on for some minutes and when
clicking on a link in Firefox.  This did not occur with previous builds and I
have not managed to reproduce this with any other application, including IE and
Mozilla browsers.  It has become such a problem that I uninstalled the app. 
This is a pity as I think it is great.  After the reboot, the only message I get
is that Windows has recovered from a major problem.  I stress that this only
ever occurred when running Firefox and clicking on a link on a web page (any site)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox
2. Browse for a short while
3. Click on a link

Actual Results:  
Spontaneous reboot

Expected Results:  
Obvious!
