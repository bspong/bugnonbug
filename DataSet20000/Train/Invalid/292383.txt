need floppy status screen for saving pages

If I save a web page onto a floppy disk, I do not get any kind of status screen
from Firefox (or windows for that matter) that tells me how much has been saved
of  a page, or if it's even done. Most of the time I have to guess if it's done
or not, and if I'm wrong (the write decides to pause for a moment and I think
it's done), then I end up with a corrupted floppy disk. Firefox needs to have
some kind of status screen for saving pages/anything from the browser, onto a
floppy drive.
