Ask me before clearing private data is grayed/greyed/disabled.

I have installed different versions of 1.6 and 1.5 and they all have the same problem. A reinstall of the browser does not solve the problem. I assume something got set by some beta-version at some point and now this can not be changed through menues.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to Menu -> Options -> Privacy
2.Clear private data tool
3.

Actual Results:  
"Ask me before clearing private data" checkbox is greyed out.

Expected Results:  
"Ask me before clearing private data" checkbox available.

Many versions of alpha and beta Firefox have been installed on the system before.
