Computer freezes repetitively when using Firefox 3
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.16) Gecko/20080702 Firefox/2.0.0.16
Build Identifier: Firefox 3

Since upgrading to Firefox 3 earlier this week, my computer freezes repetitively. The freezing is initiated by a mouse click which renders both mouse and keyboard inoperative.

This happens on any website including Firefox home site.

When I tried IE7, I had no problems with freezing. Right now I've switched back to Firefox 2 and all seems to be ok.

I notice the same problem being reported by other users on a number of online forums.



 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Firefox to access the internet
2. Usually freezes within 2-3 minutes. 
3.



Sorry about that, I am not sure what theme was being used........I think it was the default but didn't pay close attention to that.
