"links" on jafi.tapuz.co.il don't show as "read"/"visited" color

It's a feature that IE has and Firefox doesn't have.
Some forums, such as the example I gave, hold the messages' content within a span/div. Clicking on a message's title changes a CSS display property from "none" to "block" to display the message content.
MSIE keeps the message titles in its history, so when you refresh the forum page you can see which messages you have already read (they're colored as vlinks). Firefox doesn't.

I may have been kind of vague.. see the "steps to reproduce" :)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the example URL (http://jafi.tapuz.co.il/tapuzforum/main/forumpage.asp?id=272)
2. Click on a message title (below the "add message" line) to view message contents.
3. Refresh.

Actual Results:  
If you use MSIE the message title is colored as vlink.
If you use Firefox the message title is colored as an unvisited link.

Expected Results:  
The message title to be colored as a visited link (vlink/purple)

Other people experience that too, and I don't know of any Firefox users who don't.
In addition, while the source code of my example is long and confusing, similar, simple html pages that I've written produced the same problem so it's not the tapuz.co.il website's fault.
