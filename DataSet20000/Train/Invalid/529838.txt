I created Master Password to Firefox. But it is easy to not enter that password. You just have to open another Firefox window. Master password works only for the first Firefox window that you opened. So this protection become useless (((

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create Master Password
2.Close Firefox
3.Open Firefox - it will request for Master Password...
4.Open another Firefox window (for this window Firefox will not request for Master password, so you can easily do whatever you want.
Actual Results:  
for second open window it ignores master password

Expected Results:  
It shouldn't allow you to enter to Firefox, unless you will enter Master password..

I think I explained everything above.
