Clicked on particular link in Google results; BOOM. XP crashes.

Google toolbar search feature
2. Clicked on the link "The Soft Revolution - Los Angeles Times"

Actual Results:  
XP completely shut down; blue screen of death, STOP error.

Expected Results:  
You'd think it would have just displayed the web page I clicked in rather than
shutting down the operating system. Hmmmmm?
