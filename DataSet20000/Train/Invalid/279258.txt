Print to PDF slow and creates corrupt PDF

When trying to print to PDF, Firefox attempts to print to PDF. It goes through
the  page count (printing page 1, 2, 3). It stalls with the spinning ball icon
for about 30 seconds to a minute. The it acts as though it has completed the
request properly. When I try to open the PDF with Preview, the file wont open
because it is corrupt. Not all Ebay web pages act this way. I would estimate
about 40% do. Note: I do not have the same problem on that web page with I.E.,
Camino, Safari, or Netscape. Those browsers create a usable PDF file from that
web page. I am using Mac OS 10.3.7 on a 400mhz G4 computer. The printer driver
is for the Laserjet 1200
