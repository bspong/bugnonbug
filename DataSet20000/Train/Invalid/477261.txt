I am having a slow internet connection so most pages take more time to load, when a page is loading if I switch to a different tab and return to the first tab I opened the progress bar at bottom of window resets to the beginning and starts from first. This problem is in all versions of Firefox. “Firefox is great”
                    
For better results have a very slow internet connection.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a big web page(That takes some time to load in your connection speed, for better result make your internet connection slow as my dialup).
2.Let the progress bar progress to some extent.
3.When the first page is loading open a new tab and switch to the new tab.
4.Then return to the first tab in which you opened a web page.
5.You can find that the progress bar has been reset to the beginning(The page should be still loading and should have not finished loading that is why I Suggested a slow connection and big web page)

Actual Results:  
The progress bar resets to the beginning.

Expected Results:  
The progress bar should indicate the actual progress.

This occurs in the default theme.
I am having a good PC with good speed but a very slow internet connection.
