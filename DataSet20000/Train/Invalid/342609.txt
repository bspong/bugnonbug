background frames and tabs get reduced or truncated, when converted into pdf format, through a pdf virtual printer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install a virtual printer (currently PDF reDirect v2, freeware)
2. Choose any web site with tabs or embedded frames
3. Print it, using this virtual printer

Actual Results:  
Even if the page printer preview looks OK in appearence, when you start this virtual printing, background frames get reduced into ridiculous size, web site tabs get truncated in the end pdf file.
This issue does not happen with Internet Explorer.

Expected Results:  
Frames and tabs with normal size and at the right place, should be as shown in printer preview.

I think there is something to do with vectorial conversion, like with some fonts.
Saving a web page as a file is not interesting with htm format (not faithful). While the pdf format is universal, therefore it is very interesting to do it this way.
As I said, this bug doesn't occure with Internet Explorer. Too bad !
