HTML <select> tags do not render correctly

When rendering a <select> Firefox 1.5 shows two elements. One is the <select> you asked for - just under this another empty one. The HTML does not contain this additional element.

HTML Extract:
<td>
<select id="resources" size="15" style="width: 250px;" onClick="previewResource();">
<select>
</td>

NB: The above <select> element was generated by a Struts 1.1 tag lib.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Attempt to render a select element
2.That's it
3.

Actual Results:  
Two select elements are rendered. The first is correct, the second is a one line empty one.

Expected Results:  
Rendered a single, correct <select> element.

This works absolutely fine with Firefox 1.0.7. This seems to be quite a basic rendering error in 1.5 RC1 which must be fixed.
