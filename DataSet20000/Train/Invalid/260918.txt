Some links within live bookmarks don't work (invalid RSS, may result in "tag is not a registered protocol")
When using the RSS 2.0 feed from feedHouse, some Live Bookmarks don't work. 
Currently, ones from weblogs.mozillazine.org work fine, as does one from Eric
Meyer's website.  The items related to MozillaZine stories, however, don't work:
I get the error message "tag is not a registered protocol."  The RSS1 feed works
fine, which is probably why I'd never seen this before, as I usually migrate my
bookmarks between nightlies as opposed to having fragmented bookmarks files
everywhere.

This might be a duplicate, but I saw nothing promising in the Firefox product
with rss in the summary, so I'm filing it to be safe.  Right now I'm using a
Firefox branch build on Linux that I spun for myself a few hours ago.
