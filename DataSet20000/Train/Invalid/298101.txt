I can get into Pogo, but when I click play, Everything shuts down, except the
computer itself.     2wKK78O8fQ <-   I get this number when I try to copy and
paste the Mozilla Quality Feedback.  It says  in queue  program crash, try to
delete this.  Even when I restart the computer, before getting online, The
Mozilla Quality tab comes up, however, it  is not successfull in sending the
message.   
I have run AdAware, Spybot, Norton, and Stinger.  No major problems come up.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Try to get into a game in Pogo...says looking for Java, but can't find...I
have it.
2.Restart computer...get Mozilla Quality popup try sending, get crash.
3.While in POGO...it looks for Java and says that I don't have it....I do.  

Actual Results:  
See above

Expected Results:  
I should have gotten into a Pogo game.
Or....The Mozilla Quality Feedback Agent should have sent a message.
I can get into my ISP or Yahoo or other sites with no problem.

I don't know what a Module is.  I use Firefox, my ISP is Bluefrog.com
and then I got to Pogo and try to into a game...crash.
or I try to send the Mozilla Quality and it crashes...actually.
