rendering of DIV enclosed by CENTER differs from DIV align=center
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; ru; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

There is a violation of the HTML 4.01 standard.  The standard states that <<The CENTER element is exactly equivalent to specifying the DIV element with the align attribute set to "center". The CENTER element is deprecated.>>, but Firefox renders it differently.

If one uses <body><center><div>...</div></center></body> then Firefox will render the whole DIV centered (including the content inside the block).

But if we try to substitute <center><div>...</div></center> with <div align="center">...</div>, then Firefox will justify all text elements _inside_ the DIV block, but not the block itself.

It seems like a direct violation of the standard.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a document with the following content:
<html>
<body>
<center>
<div style="border: solid red; width: 50%">
<p>short line
<p>A much longer line to show the problem
</div>
</center>
</body>
</html>

2. create another document with the following content:
<html>
<body>
<div style="border: solid red; width: 50%" align="center">
<p>short line
<p>A much longer line to show the problem
</div>
</body>
</html>

3. Open both documents using Firefox (they should be the same but they would not).

Actual Results:  
These documents (described in 'Steps to Reproduce' looks different when rendered by Firefox.

Expected Results:  
The aforementioned sample documents should be rendered exactly the same (the standard states that).
