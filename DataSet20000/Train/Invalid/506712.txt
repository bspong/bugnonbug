Alt text gets stuck and appears on different pages
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

This has been happening to me since version 3, I think. The alt text popups "stick". After viewing the alt text on a link or image in its popup, the text sticks and pops up randomly on other webpages I view within Firefox. 

This happens both in the original tab where the alt text was displayed as well as in new tabs I've opened. I don't have to be hovering over a link or picture for it to happen; the mouse pointer coming to rest makes the text appear. 

I have tried clearing all of my history, cookies and cache, but it persists. The only thing which resets it is closing out my browser session and starting fresh. But then it happens again with the first instance of alt text. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Hover over picture or link
2. Alt text pops up
3. That text now pops up when I hover over any link or picture, as well as when I let the mouse pointer rest on any page
Actual Results:  
After I performed the above steps, the first instance of alt text "stuck" and kept appearing until I closed and restarted Firefox.

Expected Results:  
The text should have disappeared from the screen and not appeared again unless I hovered over that specific link/picture containing the respective alt text again.

Using Aeon Clouds 3.5, but this has happened with the default theme as well. It has also happened with previous versions of Firefox, going back to at least 3.0, if not earlier. I never found other complaints while searching Google for it, and just never reported it here until today.
