right hand column links within a div within a div with an id are not clickable, works in IE
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.4) Gecko/20091016 Firefox/3.5.4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.4) Gecko/20091016 Firefox/3.5.4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

If I remove the id from my right column div then the links in that column work  I finally managed to fix it by putting an invisible link at the end of the div ??? this seems like a firefox bug. The html and css all validate.

I made copies of the front page of the site to try to fiddle with it to see if I could fix it

with the div all links below the subscribe box are broken ( i even  gave the id for the div a new name -- newrcolcontainer )

no id on the div the links work find (right column has dropped to end of page tho)
