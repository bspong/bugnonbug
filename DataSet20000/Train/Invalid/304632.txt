Cannot switch between tabs correctly when clicking on them.

If there are multiple tabs open at once and I click on one of the other tabs
which is not currently open, it will switch to it for as long as I hold the
mouse button down.  However, once I release the mouse button, the focused tab
switches back to the tab I was previously at.  If I do this, and then click the
original tab which it brought me back to, it will then switch to the tab I
clicked and tried to get to origianlly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up 2 or more tabs.
2. Click one of the new tabs (you may hold the mouse button down for as long as
you like, but once you release the button, the tab focused will go back to the
tab you were previously at).
3. Click the tab you are now looking at (on the list of tabs).

Actual Results:  
The tab I want to switch to appeared, then disappeared when the mouse button was
released.  After step 3, you will find yourself at the tab you originally tried
to select.

Expected Results:  
The tab should be switched to and stay there once clicked.
