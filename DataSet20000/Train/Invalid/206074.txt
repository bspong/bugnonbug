After highlighting and copying text left-click takes browser back one page in history
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030516 Mozilla Firebird/0.6

When I highlight and copy text into the address bar the next time I use
left-click the browser goes back one page in the history.  Alternately it will
ignore the next right mouse-click.  A second try works fine. The indication that
the mouse click won' t work properly is that the highlighted text is   "stuck"
in its "already highlighted" color (grey).  Two clicks clears it up.  I have the
"Text Links" extension installed but the problem occurs even with it disabled or
not installed.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Highlight any text (usually a non-link URL) and copy into address bar.
2. Go to URL.  Go back to previous page. Highlighted text should be in "already
highlighted" color.
3. Left-click, or right click

Actual Results:  
If you left click the browser will go back one page it the history.
If you right click nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
Left click (and hold) should let you highlight new text
Right click should bring up browser menu.

I have just (really, right- now) discovered another way to recreate the bug. 
Double click anywhere in text, and everything up to the last space is
highlighted.  Right-click and the menu which should appear does not. 
Right-clicking will then (maybe) take you back a page.  I have been trying to
make sense of this bug since I replaced 0.5 with the 05/10/03 nightly.
