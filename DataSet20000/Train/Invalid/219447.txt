Some embedded Flash videos appear fine... some do not appear at all (the space
remains a blank white box).

SOME Flash videos on AlbinoBlackSheep.com work correctly, like this one:

http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/hewo.php

SOME break, like this:

http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/nokia.php

When I view the latter URL, all I see in the box is ... whiteness.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the latest Firebird *INSTALLER* for Windows. Run it.
2. Close Firebird. Download the Flash plug-in installer. Run it.
3. Run Firebird. Go to one of those pages. See blank white square where Flash
video should be.

Actual Results:  
I saw a blank white square. Where the video should be. And I'm talking like...
Strong Bad.

Expected Results:  
It should have displayed the video!

Can someone email me please? I will grant VNC access so someone can actually SEE
the bug occurring (so you'll know I didn't just hallucinate it)
