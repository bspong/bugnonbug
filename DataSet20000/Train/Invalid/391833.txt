wish to change attached xsl-file (e.g. depenging on kind of browser or URI). This should be able with php script (see sample link). 
InternetExplorer works fine (can see html page with new xsl). FireFox seems to think, that xml file is html page :(

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create xml file with link to xsl file.
2. create new xsl file with another URI (another file)
3. write php script, which changes link to xsl, all other xml lines will be transferred originally.
4. start this php script with IE and with Firefox :(
Actual Results:  
firefox shows plain text of xml content

Expected Results:  
firefox should display xml with new xsl
