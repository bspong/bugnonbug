Printing to PostScript file no longer prompts with nice file dialog box.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11

Up to v3.0, firefox will display a nice file dialog if PostScript file printer was chosen. v3.5 no longer has this nice file dialog that the user can navigate. Instead, it just has a simple dialog box edit control. Not very helpful unless one knew the exact file path.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0. Install a virtual PostScript printer (from Adobe for e.g.)
1. File >> Print
2. Select the virtual PS printer. OK.
*** a file dialog should pop up for v3.0 ***




I thought this is a very nice feature of firefox. Please don't take it away!
