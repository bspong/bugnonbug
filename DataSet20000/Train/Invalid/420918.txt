Startup with Restore Session: serial 304 error_code 8 request_code 146 minor_code 3
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9b3) Gecko/2008020513 Firefox/3.0b3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9b3) Gecko/2008020513 Firefox/3.0b3

Running 3.0b3 just fine on my main Linux userid.  Tried to start it on a 2nd userid (same machine) and it immediately dies with "serial 304 error_code 8 request_code 146 minor_code 3"


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start 3.0b3 for first time.
2. Proceed through all steps until it asks for new/restore.
3. Restore... loads a couple of pages and dies. These pages load fine on the other two userids.

Actual Results:  
$ The program 'gecko' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)'.
  (Details: serial 152 error_code 8 request_code 146 minor_code 3)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)




I believe there is something amiss in that one userid because of past problems with Ff (don't recall specifics); but I've never found anything obvious that could explain why this userid is different with respect to Ff...

I'm mainly looking for a hint where to look for this particular error so that I may do my part to locate its source...
