Having two shortcuts for the same action is a bad thing as it use one accel. key for nothing. ctrl+l is used in many other application to change the location (nautilus comes to mind) and this shortcut is shown in the file menu.

I was discussing this issue with the french translation team as it was conflicting with another menu accelerator. 

IMHO alt+... should be used to access menus and ctrl+... for actions.

Selecting the location bar is an action and therefor we should only use ctrl+l_ocation for it.


Reproducible: Always
