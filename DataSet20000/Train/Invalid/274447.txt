FIrefox does not process charset=UTF-8 included in html page
It seems to me that Firefox uses whatever information is getting from the HTTP
Server (Apache in my case) about the character coding. I think this is not
correct since the Server could be sending different files in various codes
(applets for example) and most people don't have access to the server to
configure it to send UTF-8 characters, for example. I think the browser should
use whatever char. coding the html page describes and override any other coding.
Firefox correctly detects the code included in the <meta http-equiv...
charset=UTF-8> tag and shows it in the "Page Info" window but ignores it, if the
Server is configured to send ISO-8859-1, for example.
