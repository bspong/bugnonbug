Firefox doesn't properly assign the remaining 100%
Can you explain why Firefox doesn't properly assign the remaining 100% of a 
layer?

For example, put one layer alongside other items inside an outer layer with an 
assigned static width. Set the inner layer to take the remaining 100% of space 
left inside this outer layer.

Instead of doing this properly as Internet Explorer does, Firefox makes the 
inner DIV ignore the other items that are along side it, and simply sets it's 
width to the exact same as the assigned width of the outer layer. This results 
in stretching because there are other items inside the outer layer taking up 
space.

Shows the specific error. Open it in Internet Explorer, and then open it in 
FireFox.
