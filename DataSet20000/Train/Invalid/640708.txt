Hello,

We have some sites with SSL (not self signed) and firefox don't recognize them as trusted and warn visitors about untrusted sites...

In internet explorer this issue not occurs.

We are not sure if it's a firefox bug or the SSL cert has some problem.

what do you think?

Thank you.-

Reproducible: Always

3.



Chrome and IE recognizes the SSL as trusted and valid certs.
