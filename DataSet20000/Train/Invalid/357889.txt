After customizing the navigation tool bar,  all of the menu items (File, Edit, etc.) were grayed out and I couldn't use them.  In addition, all of my bookmarks on my Bookmarks Tool Bar had disappeared.  When I did this again in another browser window, the menu items grayed out but the bookmarks stayed.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right click the Menu or Navigation tool bar
2. Select Customize...
3. Close out of the customize window

Actual Results:  
The menu items grayed out, and were rendered unusable.

Expected Results:  
NOT have grayed out all of the Menu items, so I could still use them.

I was using the Gray Modern2 theme for Firefox 2, although this happens sometimes with the default theme too.
