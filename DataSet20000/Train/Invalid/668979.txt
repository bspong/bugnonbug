Shopping cart at transcendcoffee.com works in Chrome but not Aurora
I order coffee from transcendcoffee.com every two weeks, give or take, and have never had a problem with the cart until today.  Now, in Aurora, you can "view full cart" but "proceed to checkout" doesn't work, and removing items from the cart doesn't work.  Both of these actions work fine in Chrome.

I'm using build 6.0a2 (2011-07-01) which is up to date.
