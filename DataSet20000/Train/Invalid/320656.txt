Links from an email from iTune generates an ALERT "Item is not registered".  It does not specified what item.  It does not load anything in the window and after clicking ok, it stops and status bar dispalys done. I am runung it under Fedora Core 4.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on a links in email from iTune store.
2. Switch to FireFox window.
3. FireFox displays "Loading...  Please stand by."
4. Immediately an alert window pops up with "Item is not a registered protocal".

Actual Results:  
It just displays the alert message and waits for ok button pressed and then stops loading.

Expected Results:  
To go to iTune website and display the holiday gift guide 2005.

I searched for the solution and found "rtsp is not a registered protocol" message at: http://www.gryzor.com/rtsp.html and followed the reccomendation, but it did not seem to help.
I added this string in "about:config":
network.protocol-handler.app.rtsp
Value: /usr/X11R6/bin/realplay

I am just using the default theme and no extention.  This is a new Fedora Core 4 install.
