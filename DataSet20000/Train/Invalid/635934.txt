The current mockup shows 'Facebook', 'Twitter,' etc. as being listed in full text.  Users should have the option to use site favicon, text-only, or favicon+text to display tabs.  For users who use many "app tabs," or the 'Faviconize Tab' extension, a build-up of text may clutter the tab bar quickly.
