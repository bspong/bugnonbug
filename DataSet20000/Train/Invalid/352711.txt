This latest nightly (2006/9/14) broke something from the night before (2006/9/13).

Typing the location is visible, but using the enter key or 'Go' button doesn't. A recent and related bug was due to Tab Mix Plus, but I do not have this installed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type a URL into location bar
2. Hit enter key
3. Hit 'Go' button
Actual Results:  
No page is loaded at step 2, current page reloaded at step 3.

Expected Results:  
Page at URL should be loaded at first step 2 then again at step 3.
