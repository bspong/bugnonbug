Deleted Bookmarks Findable in Bookmark Manager
Replicated on WinXP and Mac OSX:

* Open bookmark manager
* Create a folder
* Create a bookmark named "foo"
* Drag bookmark into newly created folder
* Delete newly created folder
* Enter "foo" in the search box
* "foo" appears as a found bookmark

The bookmark "foo" continues to exist as a sort of phantom, viewable only by search in the bookmark manager. It persists if the bookmark manager is closed and reopened, but is not persisted if Firefox is restarted.
