See only tree structure in properties window on not bookmarked sites
Steps to reproduce: 
1. Start Firefox and on your homepage rightclick and choose "Bookmark this Page".
2. In the Properties window you'll see a tree structure of bookmarks folders.
3. Now go to another page and call Properties window again.
Result: tree structure gone.

Tree structure is also missing when I rightclick on bookmark and choose Properties (or is this intentional).
