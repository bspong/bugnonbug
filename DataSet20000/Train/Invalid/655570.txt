Unable to add exceptions in options to block images from particular site.

And I cannot add a particular path of site in the list.
For eg. I added apps.facebook/cityville in the white box to block but in the list it was displayed apps.facebook.com only..

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Select Options and go to Content tab
2.Check Load Images Automatically and click on Exceptions
3.Add bbc.com or any site in the list and Click to Block it
4.Close and open bbc.com site

Actual Results:  
Images on bbc.com site are loaded

Expected Results:  
Images on bbc.com site must not load

However, on unchecking Load Images Automatically option works for all sites as usual.
