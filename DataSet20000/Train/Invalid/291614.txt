firefox.exe process remains running

When closing Firefox, the 'firefox.exe' process often remains open even though
the GUI of the browser has closed. Upon attempting to start another instance of
Firefox, another 'firefox.exe' process momentarily opens, then closes, and new
new instance of the browser appears. Manually killing the process enables a
fresh instance to be launched successfully. The problem seems to be more acute
when using XP's Quick User Switching, but occurs also when this is not the case.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox.
2. Close Firefox.
Actual Results:  
The process remained open, and I was unable to launch a new instance without
first killing the first.

Expected Results:  
Closed itself properly.
