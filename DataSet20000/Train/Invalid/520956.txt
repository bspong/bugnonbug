Since last firefox update, I have this same problem occuring on several sites : I open a web page in a tab, it is displayed normally, then I go to another tab but when I come back to the previously loaded tab it is just blanked (grey). This occurs for a lot of webpages, each time I have to reload the page in order to show it.
Note that when the page is blanked, I can still access the HTML source code of the page.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open the browser on http://www.airmauritius.com/kestrelflyer.htm
2.open a new tab
3.go back to previous tab
Actual Results:  
Tab is blanked

Expected Results:  
Should show page previously loaded

I can reproduce it on my browser which is localized in french language but I can't reproduce the error on an english language firefox (same version 3.5.3)
