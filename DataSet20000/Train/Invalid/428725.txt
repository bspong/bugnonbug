using taskbar object open behavior creates new window, but  'use existing window' is  checked
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (OS/2; U; Warp 4.5; en-US; rv:1.8.1.13) Gecko/20080401 Firefox/2.0.0.13

Summary describes the problem.

If I've switched to another program and want to return to Firefox, using the taskbar results in starting another Firefox window.

The taskbar properties, the original properties, the RUN!!.exe properties, all call for 'use existing window'.

Very frustrating,
Thanks

p.s. Didn't have this trouble in 2.0.0.12
