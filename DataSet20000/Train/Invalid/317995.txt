After closing a window with a java plugin -- an applet from the teamtrack ticket system in this case -- firefox won't response anymore.

When closing the last window, a firefox process - and the java plugin icon - will remain and one can't open another window since "firefox is already running".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go on a site with java applets, preferably from teamtrack
2. close the window
3.

Actual Results:  
firefox will become unresponsive

Expected Results:  
not becoming unresponsive? ;-)
