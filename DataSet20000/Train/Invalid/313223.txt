Its the god damn cut/copy/paste bug... but i can reproduce it 100%

Ok i have a clean install of Firefox beta 2!, no extensions, old profiles are
deleted totally B4 install!...

Bug is 100% repoducable in normal mode but 100% unreproducable in safe mode!
to test it u will require virtual dimension  get it from here
http://virt-dimension.sourceforge.net/ install it and have at least 2 desktops

God damn fix the damn clipboard bug its been around for almost 2 years! if u
cant fix it write the ENTIRE clipboard code... IE is quickly catching up to FFs
abilities...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.close down firefox totally
2.open fire fox
3.goto google.com 
4. open a new tab
5. in the tab goto google.com
6. go back to the first tab, select random text and copy
7. WITHOUT DOING ANY ELSE TO FIREFOX goto Virtual dimension and switch workspaces
8. WITHOUT DOING ANY ELSE goto Virtual dimension and return to firefoxes workspace
9. WITHOUT CLICKING ANYWHERE ELSE ON FIREFOX select the second tab
10. select the googles pages text box... and try to paste...

Next> 
Now install google bar... remove the bookmarks toolbar... are repeat the above
steps... and the text WILL PASTE INTO THE ADDRESS BAR!!, EVEN THOUGH THE CURSOR
IS FLASHING IN googles textbox!... this means that firefox is INCORRECTLY
TRACING focus!.. I SUSPECT THAT FIREFOX DOESNT CORRECTLY handle windows change
of focus events... as well as other CRITICAL SYSTEM BASED EVENTS..
