When using facebook chat, if you receive a new message and you are on another tab, the title of all facebook tabs changes its name, alternating between "New message from X" and whatever the usual name of the tab is. I this is annoying as the size of the tab changes so it is hard to close it without first clicking to the tab to stop the name changing. When you have many tabs open on facebook, all of them do this so significant tab shifting occurs.
I don't know if this is a FB or FF problem, but it would be useful to fix.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ask someone on facebook chat to send you a message
2. Go to another tab
3. Receive the message
Actual Results:  
The facebook tab(s) open will change their name and size.

Expected Results:  
It would be simpler if they either changed name without changing size, or even if they changed only once and didn't alternate.
