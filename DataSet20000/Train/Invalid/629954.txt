I have the Bartab extension installed. On any version of Firefox 4, unloading tabs by right clicking on them doesn't work properly and creates duped tabs that can't be closed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Instal Bartab on any beta or nightly of Firefox 4.
2. Right click a tab to unload it (unload other tabs works too, but it's more annoying to deal with).
Actual Results:  
Visually, the tab is duplicated, and the duplicate appears to be unloaded (lower opacity). When you click on it, the page will load, it works like it's supposed to. However, the first tab (the one that isn't the new duplicated) can't be switched to (via clicking or ctrl-tab) or closed, and will stay in the tab bar until you restart Firefox, when you'll be able to close that tab.

Expected Results:  
The tab is supposed to be unloaded and left with a lowered opacity in the tab bar.

Being a noob to Bugzilla, I'm not totally sure this report belongs here, since it's an extension. I thought I'd post it anyway since it's related to the way Firefox 4 handles tabs, though you can close it if need be.
