Firefox 1.0 on Windows places an insertion point where one does not belong
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; WinNT4.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

If I view a webpage and click some static text on it, Firefox may place a
blinking insertion point at the spot where I clicked. Firefox does not do this
on all of my computers, but ones where the insertion point does appear, it will
appear reliably.

The operating systems on these computers vary widely, but all are somewhere in
the Windows NT-98-2000 range.

Refreshing the page or navigating back and forth will remove the insertion point
until I click text again.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. View any webpage made of text or with text on it.
2. Try clicking some of the text.
3. Look for a blinking insertion point.

Actual Results:  
A blinking insertion point appears in the text of web pages on some of my
computers when I click on static text.

Expected Results:  
I don't think there should be a blinking insertion point presented in static
text. Obviously it isn't very useful.

I cannot narrow this down to any one thing. I can have two computers that are
nearly the same (maybe a difference in memory or hard disk size) but one will
exhibit the problem and another will not.

This does not happen in the full Mozilla 1.7 browser suite. I don't recall ever
seeing it happen on versions of Firefox prior to 1.0 either.
