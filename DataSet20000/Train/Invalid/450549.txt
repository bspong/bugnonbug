No border shown on element with only one thing specified in border-right

I have an test example like this:

<html>
	<head>
		<style type="text/css">
			.class1 {
				border-right: 3px solid orange;
			}
			LI.class2 {
				border-right: red;
			}
			</style>
	</head>
	<body>
		<ol>
			<li class="class1 class2">
				Test item
			</li>
		</ol>
	</body>
</html>

Previously the li would have a 3px solid red border, but since upgrading it now has no border.  Presumably before it was inheriting the 3px and solid from class1 and only overriding the orange.  I had a look at the spec and got confused as to what it should do here, it's possible that firefox has been fixed to do the correct thing now and I should change my css.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
View a page with the following source:


<html>
	<head>
		<style type="text/css">
			.class1 {
				border-right: 3px solid orange;
			}
			LI.class2 {
				border-right: red;
			}
			</style>
	</head>
	<body>
		<ol>
			<li class="class1 class2">
				Test item
			</li>
		</ol>
	</body>
</html>
Actual Results:  
No border on li

Expected Results:  
Red border on li
