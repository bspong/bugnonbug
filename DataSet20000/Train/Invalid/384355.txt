Session Manager remembers windows closed during File>Exit
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20070515 Firefox/2.0.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20070515 Firefox/2.0.0.4

Tested with Firefox 2.0.0.4 and Session Manager 0.5.3.4
With "Don't clear the list of closed Windows at shutdown" enabled in Session Manager

If Firefox is exited with File>Exit Session Manager will see each window being closed during the shutdown and add it to the list of closed windows.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable session restore in Firefox
2. Install Session Manager
3. Enable Don't clear the list of closed Windows at shutdown
4. Open several windows (more than 10, the default max of session manager to remember)
5. Close some windows, leaving 10 behind.
6. Exit Firefox using File>Exit
7. Reopen Firefox, Tools>Session Manager>Closed Windows: will show only those windows that were open during the shutdown, not the ones closed manaully just prior to shutdown.


Expected Results:  
Session Manager should retain the same list of recently closed windows that was available before Firefox was shutdown with File>Exit
