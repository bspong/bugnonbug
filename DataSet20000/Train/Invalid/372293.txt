I've seen bug 319196 but I don't think it's the same problem.
Bug not happen with version 2.0 but happen on version 2.0.0.2. I've try it on 32 and 64 bit.
I've use this xml file to test search plugin http://mycroft.mozdev.org/opensearch.xml

I've try to delete the different .rdf and noting fix the problem.
Also when you open firefox there's exception in error console

Error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIFile.directoryEntries]"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: file:///home/choinif/firefox/firefox/components/nsSearchService.js :: SRCH_SVC_loadEngines :: line 2241"  data: no]
