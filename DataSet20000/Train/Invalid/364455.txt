I updated to 2.0.0.1 and Firefox couldn't do much.  It couldn't get to GMail, nor check it's own updates (menu Help/Check for Updates...).  It could get to Google and a Yahoo News site.  I then installed the full version of 2.0.0.1, and the same thing happened.  I then went back and installed 2.0, and everything is working again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install 2.0.0.1 by either updating 2.0 or installing full.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Try to connect to GMail.

Expected Results:  
Connect to GMail.

Get the Firefox "Can't connect to web site" with the "Try Again" button.
