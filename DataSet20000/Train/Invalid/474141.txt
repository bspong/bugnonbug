On startup firefox flashes the last page visited regardless of configuration settings
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008121623 Ubuntu/8.10 (intrepid) Firefox/3.0.5

On startup, firefox will always flash the last page visited before going to my home page.  I've tried deleting both cache and off-line browsing cache but to no avail. I do not believe it's going to the actual site however, because of the speed at which the page is rendered.  This behavior occurs regardless of my configuration settings (go to home page, open a blank page). Once the last page is displayed/rendered, only then will firefox take my configuration settings into account.  So, if the last page I visited was bigboobs.com and my home page is google.com and I set firefox to go to my home page on startup, it will only do so after first rendering the bigboobs.com page.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load any web page
2. quit firefox
3. startup firefox
Actual Results:  
The last page visited is displayed before going to my home page.

Expected Results:  
going directly to my home page as indicated in my configuration settings
