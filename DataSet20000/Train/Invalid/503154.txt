I am using TWBooster which i downloaded from http://twbooster.freehostia.com/download/twb.xpi
The problem i'm facing is common with most users of this add on:
The icons for the toolbar don't show up unless i do one of the following:
- Install Personas Addon 
- Install a theme for firefox
- Switch my computer theme to Windows Classic

Now i told this to the developer but he can't figure out the problem so i am hoping you do because i really like this extension and i want to switch back to windows xp theme and keep my firefox the way it is while using it

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download the toolbar
2.Install the toolbar
3.Restart Firefox
Actual Results:  
The toolbar shows just with no icons (some might appear occasionally)
But all you see is a blank row which might give u the impression that the toolbar is corrupted or not working...

Expected Results:  
The icons should have shown
