User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:7.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0.1

Steps to reproduce:

I see numerous reports re. memory leak for Firefox (Thunderbird is just as bad), yet these always get marked as "Works For Me".  Well, thats a nice way to avoid the issues while Firefox just gets worse and worse.  Yes, its also a simple matter to blame plugins, again to avoid the issues.

Its TIME for the developers to pull their heads out and address the issues!

Firefox regularly falls into massive memory usage - for myself 600MB +

This is very simple to fix using Firemin, however its now time for the Firefox developers to stop dodging this problem and FIX IT!




Actual results:

After running Firefox for several hours memory usage exeeds 600MB


Expected results:

Memory usage should stay below 200MB
