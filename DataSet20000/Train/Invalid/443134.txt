Firefox sometimes steals focus from other applications just after losing it
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008062908 Iceweasel/3.0 (Debian-3.0~rc2-2)

I use the Fvwm2 window manager with default focus policy (a.k.a. FocusFollowsMouse). When I move the mouse pointer from Firefox to another application (A), the following problem sometimes occurs: (A) gets the focus, Firefox gets it back, (A) gets the focus again, and so on, many times a second, during several seconds, after which the focus remains with (A).

This problem occurs only with Firefox (in fact, Debian's Iceweasel 3), and it is new to version 3. I've never had any problem with previous Firefox (Iceweasel) versions. It seems that the current web page doesn't matter. Concerning the application (A), I could reproduce the problem with XTerm, Emacs and GNOME Terminal; so it seems that the application doesn't matter either.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move the mouse pointer from Firefox to XTerm (see the context above).
Actual Results:  
Sometimes XTerm gets the focus, Firefox gets it back, XTerm gets the focus again, Firefox gets it back, and so on, many times a second, during several seconds, after which the focus remains with XTerm.

Expected Results:  
XTerm should get the focus, and Firefox shouldn't take it back.
