I get thrown out of Firefox when exiting a link from the primary URL.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

Since downloading Firefox 2.0 the other day every time I "X" out of a link from a primary URL (when the Back button is not available) Firefox disappears and I am returned to my desktop display and icons.  I initially got the "you are about to close 2 tabs" message and when I clicked continue the same thing happened.  Out of frustration I checked the "Don't show me this message again" box and now I get thrown out of Firefox without any intermediate message.  Please let me know if I'm doing something wrong.  Thank you.
