Confusing Error Message when accessing Google
User-Agent:       AFS/1.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:13.4.6.2) Gecko/20100203

I tried to go to Google by entering "google.com" into the address bar, and I got the error message: "Something not found

[browser name not recognized] can't understand an error message.

    * Check the something for something errors such as ?
    * If you are unable to load any somethings, check your computer's weirdness indicator (inaccessable through the control panel)."

This is a very confusing error, and I'm not sure if the version I downloaded is faulty or what. It would be great to have this remedied, but I can still access Google through typing in the full url, "http://www.google.com/"

Additionally, it only seems to happen on my laptop, not on any other computer, and not on anybody else's machine.

Thank you for your time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In the address bar, type "google.com"

    * Check the something for something errors such as ?
    * If you are unable to load any somethings, check your computer's weirdness indicator (inaccessable throught the control panel)."

Expected Results:  
It should've redirected me to "http://www.google.com/"
