I can no longer open PDFs in FF with Acrobat Pro 9.  I must download them and open separately.  Attempting to open in FireFox results in blank tabs opening until I click "stop".  Attempting to open a PDF in FF results in this error message: "The Adobe Acrobat/Reader that is running can not be used to view PDF files in a Web Browser.  Please exit Adobe Acrobat/Reader and exit your Web Browser and try again."  Acrobat is never running when this pops up and exiting does not solve the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on a link for a PDF
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Error message "The Adobe Acrobat/Reader that is running can not be used to view PDF files in a Web Browser.  Please exit Adobe Acrobat/Reader and exit your Web Browser and try again." shows up twice - must click "ok" twice for it to disappear.  Then am left with a blank, white page with the URL for the PDF file in address bar.

Expected Results:  
Opened the PDF in the same tab.
