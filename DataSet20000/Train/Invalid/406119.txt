Places menuitem on Bookmarks Toolbar lacks any sort of unique identifying information aside from its label. Thia means that not only is it impossible to skin this item in a language-free manner, the various menuitems in the dropdown menu also cannot be skinned.

I have large themes that require large menuitems. The default image (query.png) looks ungainly at 24x24 and 32x32 pixels.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Inspector Widget.
2. Click on the Places item at the starting end of the Bookmarks Toolbar.
3. Observe the selected item in the DOM Inspector.
Actual Results:  
Object - DOM Node contained only a label (in my case, English), class (bookmark-item), type (menu) and container=true, all literally nondescript. The element is toolbarbutton, also fairly anonymous.

Expected Results:  
Object - DOM Node should have contained an ID, or a command or a key - something to identify the item in a non-localized fashion.
