After setting Mozilla Firefox 1.0.4 release as default browser I find out that
picture file types are not set to open with Mozilla Firefox 1.0.4 by default. 
This also happens with Netscape 8.0.1.  Mozilla Suite 1.7.8 sets the file types
right.  I am guessing it is a Mozilla Firefox 1.0.4 bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Insall Mozilla Firefox 1.0.4.
2. Set as default browser.
3. Picture file types are not set to open with Mozilla Firefox 1.0.4.

Actual Results:  
Picture file types are not default to open with Mozilla Firefox 1.0.4.

Expected Results:  
Auto setting of Mozilla Firefox 1.0.4 as default for picture file types.
