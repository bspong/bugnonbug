FF modifying html source code in download links - download manager hangs.

correct download links in source code are not being translated correctly into Save As... links.

HTML Page code:
<div align="left"><a target="_blank" href="C:/Program Files/EasyPHP2/www/data/temp_files/test2009-03-14_2_r">test2009-03-14_2_r</a></div>
Save link as location = 
c:/Program Files/EasyPHP2/www/data/temp_files/test2009-03-14_2_r

Please note the lower case "c". - the original is C:/

Their is also an absence of "file://" which I am sure was in earlier versions.

BTW - the file has no extension - the data output from an animation camera ... needed to input into another program to create matched moves in 3D graphics: I'm the programmer having to write the data file interface - the files have to be exchanged over the internet, either by http or ftp.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the page
2. Save link as 
3. Download manager then hangs with an un-resolvable path.
Actual Results:  
Save Link as... launches download Manager which then hangs on the deadline.



Expected Results:  
be nice if you can save the file! 

If not a http:// address, the file:// should be substituted. 

At the very least, C:/ should not be downgraded to c:/

This bug highlights a big hate of mine - The Download mangaer is flaky in the extreme. On slow connections, it just doesn't do its job - it just jacks in the DL after completing 135Kb of a 2.3M file, with a cheerful message saying done. basic one-line maths will detect an incomplete download and warn the customer the file (critical for a vital meeting he is rushing to), is corrupt; Happened to me and its not funny.

Be good too if the properties were at least editable - then there s some chance of manually editing the bug.

As it stands, the download module of FF2 and 3 sucks big-time. With FDM not being supported by FF3, it really needs to be redesigned and made to:
1: report failed downloads... Definitely should not say done.
2: Downloads should be resumable.

FF2.0.0.20 is locking up on vista and task manager cannot close te program - requires a full reboot.
