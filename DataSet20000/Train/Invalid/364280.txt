Additional GET-form fields 'x' and 'y' are shown in URL after submit

Specified URL is a website that is leaving strange result when using the enclosed search function ("Sök produkt" in upper left corner).

When submitting the form using Fx 1.5.0.8 two additional 'x' and 'y' variables are shown in the URL, which values are correspond to the cursor's x y position over the image submit button. Some times these values are 0 when clicking on the image submit button.

These fields are not present in the HTML-code, nor is JavaScript using.

(I'm the web developer for the site)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://flugbutiken.se/
2. Simply click on "Sök" button in upper left corner without typing anything into the box.
3. Watch the URL in the adress bar.

Actual Results:  
X and Y variables are added to the URL, which values are correspond to the cursor's x y position over the image submit button. Some times these values are 0 when clicking on the image submit button.

Expected Results:  
X and Y variables not present.

I suspect that add-ons like "Web Developer" might be involved.
