FindWhatEverNow hijacked Firefox? (spyware)
I've been hijacked. Today I was looking at a search site & my PC did unnessesary
installation. 2 minutes later, I typed an incorrect website name, but instead
seeing a message box it looked like an IE MSN cannot-be-found search page. It
looked suspisious, and had no graphics like the original IE MSN-cannot-be-found
search page. I searched my website in the search box, clicked Search and it took
me into an adult site. I have used spy, ad & hijacking removal software, but
still doesn't remove. I thought Firefox has the ability to remove these kind of
stuff. Can you remove it, so the message box only appears?
