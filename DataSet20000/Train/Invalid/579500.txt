items added to the palette via the DOM are not visible in the customization UI
in bug 568932 i add Jetpack widgets as toolbar buttons to the navigator toolbox palette. i know they're added, as i populate the add-on bar with them using only the ids of the widgets via toolbar.insertItem.

however, they do not show up in the palette when i view it via View/Toolbars/Customize.
