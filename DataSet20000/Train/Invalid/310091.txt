1 x Hidden field name: usertypeid (could possibly also 
? x Radio buttons named: usertypeinfo (can also be select tag)

When the hidden field comes first, then using checked/selected for radio 
buttons, checkboxes and select drop-down does not show even when it is set in 
the HTML

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Hidden/text field named: usertypeid
2. Radio buttons named: usertypetext
3. One radio button set as checked

Actual Results:  
The checked radio button does not show as checked.

Expected Results:  
The radio button set to checked is supposed to have been selected.

If the hidden (possibly normal text field) comes after the radio buttons then 
it works. This also applies to the select tag.
