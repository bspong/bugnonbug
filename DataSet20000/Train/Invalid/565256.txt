Searches hijacked by Bing/Bing Toolbar
We're seeing a number of users complain about keyword.URL searches turning into Bing or their default search engine being set to Bing.  A number have also complained that they suddenly have a Bing Toolbar (some may have removed -- although possibly just hidden -- it and are seeing the left-over search redirection.

Some clues point to Facebook as being the source of the unwanted Toolbar:

"I was on Facebook and a video was posted. O tried to open the video and FTV Player popped up and want to update. The Bing Search bar was installed in Firefox at this time and I cannot figure out how to remove the unwanted search bar.
Facebook wanted to upgrade the FTV player on 05/03/10."

AND

"I cannot get rid of a tool bar. It is a bing tool bar. I got it after my facebook account was phished. I also am seeing popup windows when I search google."

I know this is almost certainly not the right place for this issue but it gives us somewhere to talk about it and figure out exactly is going on.
