Firefox 8 beta fails without error to run some javascript (www.gucci.com)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; rv:8.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/8.0
Build ID: 20111026191032

Steps to reproduce:

Visit http://www.gucci.com/us/home on FF8.  On the very top right is a link marked search.  Click on this.


Actual results:

Nothing is displayed.


Expected results:

There is an overlay (a hidden div) which is supposed to show.  Note that this works properly in all other browsers (including FF7 and below).

I see an error showing up in firebug, but this is always present and does not seem to have anything to do with this problem.  Other than that, there is no indication of anything going wrong.
