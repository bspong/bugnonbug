Firefox doesn't start up
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_4; en-us) AppleWebKit/533.16 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0 Safari/533.16
Build Identifier: 

Using Firefox 3.6.6 and Mac OS 10.6.4.

Suddenly Firefox doesn't start up. I used Firefox the whole morning. I shut off my computer. And now, when starting my computer again.......Firefox shows this problem.

When clicked, the icon in the dock bounces up and down and then stops bouncing after 5-6 seconds.
When I click the Firefox app in the App Folder....same problem.

I CHANGED NOTHING......no settings, had no downloads.......absolutely nothing.

I used Disk utility to repair disk permissions.
I restarted my MacBook Pro several times.
To no avail.

I now use Safari to get to this site.


Reproducible: Always
