The right <Alt> key not work on Linux and Solaris platform
Please refer to test case : http://litmus.mozilla.org/show_test.cgi?id=2293

   1. Focus (using the mouse or the keyboard) the search field.
   2. Type some text.
   3. Press Alt+Enter.

Expected Results:

The search results should open in a new tab. 

The bug is when use the right <Alt> key (Alt Graph), will open in the current tab. The right <Alt> does not work on Linux and Solaris platform. 

On windows, both left and right <Alt> key works. On Linux and Solaris, only the left <Alt> key works. 

If the Linux and Solaris system do not support right <Alt>, should add comments to test cases : http://litmus.mozilla.org/show_test.cgi?id=2293
