"More" and "Less" button in Library has non-transparent background (white)

Library View with the more button

I've searched for this because I thought it was logged but I cannot find it. 

Using the default Mac theme, if a user goes to the Library and looks at a bookmark, the details pane beneath shows the Name, Location, and Tags of the bookmark by default. Beneath these items, there is a "More" descriptor next to a downward facing arrow. Selecting this arrow changes the view to show Keywords and Description. It also then changes the descriptor to "Less" and makes the arrow upward facing.

Both the downward facing and upward facing arrows have a white background. They are place on a gray field so you wind up with an arrow in a white box on a gray background, which looks rather unpolished.

This was seen in Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9b5pre) Gecko/2008031104 Minefield/3.0b5pr but has been around since the new theme went in.

I'm attach screenshots.
