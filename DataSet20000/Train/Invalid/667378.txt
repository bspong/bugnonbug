It seems 5 is not compatible with zone alarm 70.483.  I even tried to go back to 4.01 and it no longer worked.  I can access my network and router, but no internet.  If I turn off zone alarm, everything works.  I use a netgear fa310, intel P4 processor, netgear router.  Now even 4.01 doesn't work without disabeling zone alarm.  I use another computer on same line, it works fine with 70.483, it is an AMD. other computers work here too, only this one doesn't.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Worked OK with 4.01
2. Installed 5
3. No work, network OK as I can access my router.
4. Works (like now) by disabling ZA 70.483
5. Other computers work on same network without disabling ZA 70.483 with W2k etc.
6. I can't get this one to work at all, may try vs3 of firefox.



I went away from pale moon because it crashed with my version of Adobe acrobat (7.14)
