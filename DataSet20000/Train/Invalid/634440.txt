don't close find bar on page load if it has focus
Bug 628179 is really messing me up - I'm used to being able to open the findbar while a page is loading, and then type something once the page has finished loading. This no longer works because the end of the page load now closes the find bar. I think this is a common findbar-power-user scenario. I propose we avoid auto-closing it if it has focus.
