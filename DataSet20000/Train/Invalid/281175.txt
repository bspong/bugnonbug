Firefox prompt me to download .aspx file when accessing it through localhost (IIS)!
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

I've installed ASP.NET and IIS. I can access a ASP.NET page (.aspx suffix) fine 
with Opera and IE, but not with Firefox.
Firefox displays the file-download-dialog to let me save the file to disk. In 
other words Firefox do not recognize ASP.NET applications ...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type http://localhost/test.aspx
2. Press Enter
Actual Results:  
3. File download dialog appears, asking me to download test.aspx

Expected Results:  
Displayed the page!

I've been developing ASP.NET for some time now (so my setup works fine), and 
never had problems until using Firefox ...
