Link to PNG opens (unusable) dialog instead of showing the image

I get this problem whenever I try to view an attachment a Bugzilla bug at
Eclipse.org.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the provided URL.

The provided URL goes directly to a Bugzilla attachment. The parent page that
links to the attachment is https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=55760.

Actual Results:  
Firefox opens a dialog that prompts me to open the image in "Firefox" or
"gimp-remote". Selecting Firefox pops up a dialog telling me that Firefox is
already running (this is a separate bug - "Firefox" shouldn't be an option if
it's not going to work). Selecting "gimp-remote" does nothing. This could just
be a configuration problem on my machine.

Expected Results:  
On all other browsers, going to the provided URL just correctly shows the image.
This is the correct behavior. I'm filing this as "major" because Firefox is
failing to do something as basic as showing an image.
