menus all jumbled up after deinstalling deer park alpha release and going back to using firefox 1.0.4
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de-DE; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de-DE; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

I installed the Deer Park alpha browser but on some web page something went
wrong (I think it didnt load the page correctly, a problem that persisted upon
opening other pages) so I decided to deinstall the alpha release and reinstall
Firefox 1.0.4. Having done so, I found out that all the menus are closely packed
together, buttons don't function any longer. Moreover, when I open a menu like
the "File"-menu, the pop-down menu is black so I don't get to see any entries.
I really hate this because I love using the browser. Can you help me?
P.S. I won't use any alpha releases any more. Promise.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. deinstall firefox 1.0.4
2. clean up registry references to mozilla firefox
3. reinstall firefox 1.0.4
4. problem persists
5. see above under 1>4

Actual Results:  
The problem persists.

Expected Results:  
Functioned as if I'd never installed the Deer Park alpha.
