Page fails to reload on IP accessed webpage

The page fails to reload if you reload a page that has been loaded by an IP.
For example I am developing a session based php application. If I load it directly from the IP let say "192.168.35.121" and log in to the app, it loads fine for the first time but if you reload the page lets say with "F5" it gets stuck at "Connecting...", but if you access it over a domain name, for example "app.development.inet" it reloads fine.

The only way you can get it to reload is to use "ctrl+f5".
I have also noticed this with the latest firefox 3.

It is not reproducible with any other browser thus ruling out the possibility of being a server side flaw. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. access a webpage over IP
2. website has to store some session data/cookie
3. reload the page
Actual Results:  
The page didn't load after the reload button was pressed or "F5" was used to reload.

Expected Results:  
Load the webpage

I have also replicated this on the latest firefox 3.
