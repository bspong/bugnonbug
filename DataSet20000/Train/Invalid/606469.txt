Windows media player video does not play after installing the windows media player plugin

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download and install windows media player plugin from http://port25.technet.com/pages/windows-media-player-firefox-plugin-download.aspx
2. Open above test page


Actual Results:  
It shows a page without any player and with java script controls at the bottom

Expected Results:  
Test video should play without any issues.

Tested in 3.5.x, 3.6.x and 4.0 beta versions same issue, video does not play. I think this might be the issue with the plugin.
