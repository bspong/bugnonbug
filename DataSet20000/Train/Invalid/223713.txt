Right-click image menu above top of page

When I right-click on an image (it doesn't matter if it is linked or not), the
context menu goes off the top of the page, and so the topmost menu items are not
accessible. This only happens if the image is about a third of the way down the
viewing area - any higher and it displays below the mouse like it should.
Obviously it only occurs if it is still high enough to go off the top of the
screen. It may have something to do with screen resolution - mine is 800 x 600.
