Password save request field goes away before you can click on it

When I go to a page that needs a password, and log in there, Firefox puts the prompt at the top of whether I want to save the password, as it should, but it then vanishes in a second or two, not giving me a chance to actually click on the button to save (or choose not to save) the password.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a web site that needs a password
2. Log in
3. Watch the password save prompt appear and disappear quickly
Actual Results:  
The password isn't actually saved.

Expected Results:  
I should have a chance to choose to save the password (or not) as I wish.
