List numbering not working when <ul>/<li> added dinamically with DOM/JS
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)

Lists (<li>) with (upper|lower)-roman "list style type" and dinamically created using DOM (using createElement and appendChild) don`t get the numbering updated every time a new list is added.

Please see URL for a live example.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press "create list" to add a new <ol> and <li> element
2. Press "create list" again to keep adding <ol> & <li> elements or sub-elements

Actual Results:  
The list number is not increasing

Expected Results:  
The number should have increased

Doesn`t work on IE either.
