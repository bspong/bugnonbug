I am using Linux Fedora Core Release 3 (Heildelberg) Kernel 2.6.9-1.667 on a Pentium 4 CPU 2.27 GHz (i686) with 384MB RAM.
I am using the following browser with this setup :
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041020 Firefox/0.10.1

I noticed that following webpages are not at all intelligible / garbages with this browser while they show correctly with IE6. All these are bengali newspapers.

However, I found the follwing webpages display correctly with the same browser while those are also bengali sites.

In the following link, once you click on any link other than one which indicates a pdf file, shows the html source, not the intended page with mozilla browser..

On the same machine with Windows XP (SP2) and following browser, I have noticed the same performance except that this time http://www.jugantor.com/demo/index.php also became garbages :
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7

However, all these webpages show up correctly once those are view with IE.  Even installing new fonts stated in the source of these pages didnot result anything differant with Firefox.I have tried changing Character encoding to Autodetect btu could not really determine which one to select. In IE I dont have to select anything other than Selecting Encoding -> Auto-Select. I think this may be introduced in the Firefox browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.It reproduces everytime. I have put details of it in the description I think you can also make it.

Expected Results:  
Bengali webpages.
