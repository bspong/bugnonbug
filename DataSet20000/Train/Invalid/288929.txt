I searched for bugs but can't seem to find the exact problem. I use to ISPs to
connect to the internet, one that is direct connection and one is through a
proxy server. Ideally when I set the option to Auto Detect, I can always browse
the web pages whichever connection I use.

However, if I set the browser to Auto-Detect Proxy settings, and I connect to
the internet using the ISP that requires proxy to connect to the internet,
Firefox still behaves like it is connecting directly to the internet instead of
connecting to the proxy first before using that to connect to the internet.

Note that this is not just an ordinary proxy for anonymous surfing. Instead,
requests have to pass this proxy server before going to the internet.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. You need a connection that uses a proxy server to connect to the internet. It
means that if the proxy server is down, you cannot access the internet
2. Access the internet with the options Auto Detect Proxy settings
3.

Actual Results:  
Cannot access internet, status bar actually shows "connecting to yahoo.com"
immediately

Expected Results:  
Should be able to access internet, status bar should show connecting to
xxxx.xxxx.xxx(proxy server) before connecting to yahoo.com
