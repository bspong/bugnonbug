Cannot create a new separator in Bookmark Manager
If a user opens the Bookmark Manager and clicks on a bookmark in the right pane (the list of bookmarks), "New Separator" is grayed out on the toolbar above and in the context menu. There is no way to create a separator.

Doing the same thing in FF2, the items are not grayed out and the user can add a separator.

Steps to Reproduce
1. Have at least two bookmarks saved. Open the Bookmark manager.
2. Select the topmost bookmark.
3. Attempt to insert a separator (to separate it from the second bookmark in the list) by toolbar or context menu.

Result: A separator cannot be added.
