mouseup on outside calendar breaks date range selection
Open up places.  Start to select a range of dates.  But do so in this way:

1. In the places calendar widget, select a day with no history.
2. Mouse down on a day in the middle of the calendar.
3. Move the mouse around to highlight a specific range of dates that includes at least one day of history.
4. Move the mouse outside of the calendar widget and mouse up.

From here, the calendar does not set the range of dates to look at, because we're still seeing the day of history in step 1.  Also, you can mouse around in the calendar widget and it will act like your mouse is clicked and you are dragging it arround, but your mouse is still up.
