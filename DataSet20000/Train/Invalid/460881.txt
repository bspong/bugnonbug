Mozilla Firefox does not seem to work well with Windows Live Messenger.  Messenger does not seem to recognize that the internet is up and working when Mozilla Firefox is working.  As a result Messenger does not open.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Computer and Internet
2.Start Mozilla Firefox
3. Attempt to start Window Live Messenger
4. Messenger spins and cannot find the internet because Explorer is not working.  It appears that Messenger looks to see if Explorer is working so it know that the net is up and working.
