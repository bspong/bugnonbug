Randomly, all firefox 4 (from beta 1 to 4.0.1) gives BSOD when entering pinkbike!
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1

I enter pinkbike.com, and sometimes, totaly random, my computer blacks out, getting a black screen of death, and then i have to turn it off. When turning on, and starting firefox, it ALWAYS freezes the first time, then i have to make it close, and start it again. Then everything is back to normal. This happens with AND without addons. I'm using WebMail Notifier and AdBlock Plus. I got newest flash, shockwave, acrobat, java etc... It has NEVEr happend on other browsers (chrome, IE), and not on newer builds of firefox (like 3.6).

I'm getting seriously tired of this. Hope you can fix it, or i will have to go to Google Chrome :( (which have never crashed for me)

YES, i have tried reinstalling firefox. And tried on other computers... BSOD! :(

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to pinkbike.com
2.Wait for BSOD....
3.If no BSOD, try again

Actual Results:  
BSOD, black screen of death

Expected Results:  
Showed the page without crashing the computer

I think there is some flash-stuff that crashes it, not sure..
