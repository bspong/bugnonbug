When I type in the location bar, a list of suggestions appear only if the number of characters typed so far is odd.  If the number of letters typed so far is even, then nothing appears.  For example, if I type the word "firefox", the autocomplete suggests appear when I have typed "f", "fir", "firef", or "firefox". However, if I have type in "fi", "fire", or "firefo", then no suggestions at all appear in the location bar.  This occurs for all words that I try.
