GMail not working after "forgetting this site"
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b7) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b7

While viewing my history, I selected my gmail history entries and clicked on "Forget About This Site" (which took a while)!

Ever since, gmail never gets past the initial loading progress bar. All videos on Youtube now just say "an error has occurred. please try again." I tried safe mode and everything works fine. I'm using a profile that I've used with 3.6 for a while.
