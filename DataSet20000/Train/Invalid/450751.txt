page zoom doesn't zoom image when you first load it

Page zoom doesn't zoom an image when you first load it by clicking a link, but it does zoom the image if you go back to the page you loaded it from and then forward to return to the image.

For example, I've attached an image to this bug report.  If you zoom this page and then click the link to load the attachment, the image loads unzoomed.  But if you go back and then forward, the image appears zoomed.

Presumably the image should have been zoomed right from the start, as page zoom should apply to all kinds of content loaded from the site.  Alternately, perhaps it should only apply to pages, not to images loaded directly.

Either way, the behavior should be consistent between different ways of going to the image.
