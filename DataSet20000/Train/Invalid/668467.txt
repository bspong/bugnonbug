Tab Mix Plus causes New Tab button to become stuck at left of tab bar
Created attachment 543091
A quick screenshot of exactly where my plus is stuck. It looks fairly normal except that it won't move.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build ID: 20110615151330

Steps to reproduce:

I decided to move the "New Tab" button to the left of my tab bar via the customise option and clicked "Done". After deciding it was actually less convenient there, I tried to move it back.


Actual results:

The plus became stuck there and will not move back to the right. It moves during customisation, but as soon as I click the "Done" button, it immediately jumps back to the left. Putting spaces between the tabs and the plus does not help, nor does shutting down Firefox and restarting it.


Expected results:

The plus should've moved back to the right and stayed there. As is, it won't budge.
