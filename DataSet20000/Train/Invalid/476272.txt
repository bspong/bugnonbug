When deleting email from my att.net account, I have started getting Security
error:  Domain name mismatch error messages.  This doesn't happen every time.
I contacted ATT & they said they don't support Mozilla browsers.  Since then, I have gotten the error on Internet Explorer also.

It is possible the error message is displayed when I delete email from:
rmiug-jobs@yahoogroups.com

The error message reads:
You have attempted to establish a connection with
"contentyieldmanager.com". However, the security certificate
presented belongs to "a.248.e.akamai.net"....

Is this a certificate mismatch issue belonging to
rmiug-jobs@yahoogroups.com ?  Is this an issue I should be
concerned about?

 



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into att.net email account
2. Delete email
3. Get Security error:  Domain name mismatch error message.
Actual Results:  
3. Get Security error:  Domain name mismatch error message.

Expected Results:  
Email is deleted successfully, error message does not display.

I have WinME OS on my PC & attempted to download Firefox 3, however
I got a message that says I need at least Win2000 to be able to
download Firefox3.

I have just started getting this error message in the past 3 days.
