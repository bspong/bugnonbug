window.focus() does not bring opened windows to front

As Firefox doesn't have showModalDialog function, a way to create an equivalent function is using the focus() method to return focus to popup window when it looses it.

The method focus(), actually, is not working (version 2). When I uninstall version 2 and install version 1.5, the method works perfectly.

Returning to version 2, the method stops working again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Save the code below to a file (temp.htm)
---------------------------
<html>
<head>
</head> 

<script language="JavaScript">

var Wnd;

function OpenWnd() {
	Wnd = window.open("about:blank","Janela","Height=300px,Width=400px,center=yes,help=no,status=no");
	Wnd.focus();
}

function GoFocus() {
	if (Wnd) {
		if (!Wnd.closed) {
			Wnd.focus();
		}
	}
}

</script>

<body onFocus="GoFocus()">

<input type="button" value="Open Window" onClick="OpenWnd()">

</body>
</html>
---------------------------

Open the file in FF 2. Clicking the button, a new popup window is opened. When I click on the parent window, the popup disapears (goes to background).

On FF 1.5 the popup window remains on top (as desired when using focus() method).
Actual Results:  
In FF 2, after the popup is opened, clicking on the parent window, the popup disapears (goes to background)

Expected Results:  
If the focus() method works correctly, the popup window remains over the parent window and doesn't go to background.
