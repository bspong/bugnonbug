I used to block cockies and images from different websites like google.
suddenly when I visited google images got loaded and cockies accepted!

I checked out the exception lists and was surprised that both, the coockie exeption list and the image exception list were empty!


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to preferences, and click the "Exception" button for "load images" 
2. add google.com
3. visit google.com
4. close browser, restart browser
5. visit google.com again to see if images are still blocked



I was able to reproduce this once,
but now it seems to work...

looks like some websites found a way to make FF erase your block lists...
