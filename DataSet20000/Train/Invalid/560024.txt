This page renders poorly but most importantly it contains a link that crashes Namoroka: http://www.initium.demon.co.uk/charactr.htm (that _is_ the way it is spelled).

My URL "about:crashes" says it is here: http://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/bp-c9b2be60-1481-4a8f-ab65-0ff482100417


After the Crash I also got a pop-up that says I now have two Add-ons disabled and asking for a restart, they are:
Java Deployment Toolkit 6.0.170.4 - Blocked
Java Deployment Toolkit 6.0.190.4 - Blocked


I will restart for the "Blocked", then come back to retest the URL.

Thanks,
Rob
