http://rowlett.ws/wx/ passes html validation. Graphical links in the lower left column do not display in Mozilla, but they do display in Seamonkey 2.0.11.
The two missing graphical links are below the WFAA Weather RADAR Map and just above the AWEKAS link. Both missing links are to Weather Underground.  They have been working fine until the last Fedora Update.

Reproducible: Always

1.View page in Mozilla 
2. View page in Seamonkey
3. Click on HTML 4.01 validation link and see that page passes.
Actual Results:  
Weather Underground links do not display in Mozilla, but do display in Seamonkey.
Page passes HTML Validation by clicking on the link at the bottom of the first column.

Expected Results:  
Weather Underground links should display in Mozilla as they have since I put my site up last August.
