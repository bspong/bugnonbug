Firefox has a hard time loading images
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051105 Firefox/1.5 ID:2005110502

repro:
1.Open FF (I tried with new default profile/no extensions/themes)
2.Open given url

result:
FF has a hard time loading the images on that page (often taking minutes, sometimes they simply fail to load).

both in Opera8.5 and IE6 that page+images opens in a flash.
