I want to cooperate with the Fox.
I've just installed the 2.0 version and I've found a bug, I think.
When I click Options->Principal(general in english I think) everything is ok. But When I choose Tabbed Browsing Option, the OK->CANCEL->HELP buttons disappears. I can see some 'code trash' in the place of these buttons.
I have Tabbrowser Preferences 1.3.1.1 installed, among others.

that's it, thanks for this gorgeus project.
We really don't need the Blue E, hehe
