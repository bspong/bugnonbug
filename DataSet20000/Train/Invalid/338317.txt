How can i disable the url completion that adds ".com" to my adresses? 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Typing in "lala" as a url leads me to "http://www.lalatimes.com/" (the result of google i-feel-lucky). this is mostly ok and can be disabled by setting the preference "keyword.enabled" to false.

But then, "lala" leads me to "http://www.lala.com/". I was unable to find
an option to disable this "feature". If such an option exists, it is too obscure. If not, please include it!

In addition, when testing local web application, *sometimes* 

  http://localhost:8080/...parameters...

will be redirected to 

  http://www.localhost.com:8080/...parameters...

which is utterly unacceptable as the parameters might include security-relevant information. I am unable to reproduce this latter problem; simply stopping the application will nearly always lead to the correct "Unable to connect" error page. It might be timeout-related (stopping the server whilst generating the response).



Expected Results:  
There should be a possibility to disable the "www."+name+".com"-Expansion.
