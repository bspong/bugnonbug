knotlowfarm stylesheet crashes both Firefox and Gnome
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090730 SUSE/3.5.2-2.1 Firefox/3.5.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090730 SUSE/3.5.2-2.1 Firefox/3.5.2

The follow html extracted from the URL reported above will crash firefox (both 3.5.1 and 3.5.2) on my Suse Linux 10.3 platform. The problem does not seem to 
occur with Windows version. For interest if the same psuedo page is view with an
Eclipse internal browser the problem can also be reproduced. This suggests a linux library problem. Not sure what. I am not a web developer and don't know 
much about Firefox interals either. At the time of writing the website behind
the URL mentioned above seems to be under a subtle attach with strange links 
being embedded. However, I don't think that this is related to this problem
because I can reproduce it with the html below.

Here are the lines I put into a file called index.html.

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-gb" lang="en-gb" >
<head>
        <base href="http://www.knotlowfarm.co.uk/" />
        <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
        <link href="/templates/js_jamba/css/style1.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" />
</head>
<body>
</body>


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Take the html above.
2. Copy into /home/user/index.html
3. Open file:/home/user/index.html

Where user is your userid.
Actual Results:  
Firefox hangs for a few seconds. Then crashes. Then gnome crashes and offers login prompt again.

Expected Results:  
Display a blank page.

Needs all three lines in the head section. 

Normally reproducible in safe mode.
