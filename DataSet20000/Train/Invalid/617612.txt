Build Identifier: FF 4.06b

Can not get a ftp client to work in this build.  I 'publish' my own set of web pages and this is a premiere utility. Works fine in the FF 3 builds, is quick, easy, and while it may not do everything I need, has been flawless in accomplishing what I have asked it do.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open FF 4+
2.Go to add-ons
3.Try to install FIREftp
4. will indicate not able to install app.
Actual Results:  
NO joy, what-so-ever.

Expected Results:  
transfered files from my computer to Go-Daddy, who provides my domain & web pages service.

Been waiting through the 4+ builds for this easy problem to be resolved.
