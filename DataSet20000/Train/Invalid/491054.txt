Unable to access youtube files or to open PDF files. Mozilla refers us to the Adobe website to download the appropriate versions of Acrobat reader and Flash Player. When attempting to download these files the Adobe website advises that the our platform (Intel 64-bit processor) is not supported and that we need to run Firefox (and also Thunderbird we presume) in 32-bit mode.

How do we do this?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Access a 'youtube' or PDF file.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
'youtube' file does not open.
PDF file does not open.


Querying the Adobe website indicates to us that there is no plan in the immediate future to create a 64-bit compatible version of these two plug-ins. Why I connot imagine. Both Intel and AMD are producing 64-bit processors.

The computer's configuration is pretty much basic Windows XP(Home) with System Commander in charge of the boot procedure.

Thanks for any help you can give us with this problem.
