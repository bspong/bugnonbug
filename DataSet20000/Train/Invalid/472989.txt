The menubar will reappear when it is set to hidden. This only occurs when the window is created by opening a link from the Bookmarks Toolbar by right-clicking on it, and selecting "open in a new window".
The menu needs to be re-hidden by right-clicking on the toolbar and unchecking the menubar option.
Note new windows created by using CTRL +N, or by right-clicking on a web page link do not have the problem.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Hide the menu bar by right clicking on the toolbar and unselecting "menu".
2. Right click on a link in the Bookmarks Toolbar 
3. Select "Open in a new window"
Actual Results:  
The resulting new window will have a menu bar showing.

Expected Results:  
The resulting new window should keep my preference and not show a menu bar.

Note this also happens on Windows XP.
