New layout design in Firefox 1.0RC not user-centric
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3

Just checked out the 1.0RC and noticed the design is not as user-centric or slim
as 0.9. I consider problem areas as Web Search command under Tools menu as well
as the Mail tie-ins to thunderbird (Many people may not have, and it's
annoying).  Also, if I have a FF 0.9 open and try and run 1.0RC (double click
'FF1.0RC' .exe, 0.9 opens instead.

On the plus side, extensions update checking seems more stable and the browser
seems to be at a good point (other than above) to release FF as 1.0 (meaningful
only to non-techies I spose)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.



Expected Results:  
Remove the offending entries from the crowded tools menu, they aren't applicable
to everyone and I don't think another websearch feature is necessary. FF was
originally built for speed and responsiveness.
