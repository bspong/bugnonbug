If I either Quit using menu command, or close via Task Mgr for hanging during session, I am not able to open Firefox because it is still running (somewhere...) It presents problems when trying to load programs requiring exit from the browser because I usually have to reboot to get it to turn off ( a small window DOES pop up saying "close firefox now?" during that process so SOMETHING is running.   Since scanning and repairing registries with PCFIX 20109 to improve computer speed), I can now  stop Firefox by holding down the CTRL + X keys for a minute or so until the icon stops flashing, which seems to indicate that it is closed...
  A related problem is that the X/Close Window button sometimes closes ALL windows, and no command keys will bring up them or new ones...I have to somehow quite Firefox and restart a new session.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.quit  using menu command or X (close)button  OR through Task MGR
2.always happens no matter how I exit the program...even happened with my brief try at the Beta, which Ii have given up due to my inexperience and lack of time
3.
Actual Results:  
Must reboot the computer   OR  hold down CTRL + X  for a minute (icon flashes  and when it stops, I can restart Firefox.

Expected Results:  
It should stop running when you Exit any way you do it...

Many times the X/Close button DOES NOT WORK  , especially if there are more than 2 windows open.  Either nothing happens or ALL windows close, and the computer says that Firefox is still running, as in the main bug reported above by me  and by many others
