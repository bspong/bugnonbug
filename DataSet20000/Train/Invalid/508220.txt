A quote from the description says "Hello, I am just starting coding in C++ so I decided to make this to practice. This Firefox Stealer finds the Firefox passwords in the computer, decodes them and uploads them to an FTP server
"
Sorry I haven't downloaded and tried the application (not my thing) but if it does what it claims there may be cause to beef up the password security.

Reproducible: Always
