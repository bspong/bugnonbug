This is not a bug, but a missing feature.  I hope I don't upset you. Mozilla needs a way to run XUL applications, as desktop applications.

mozilla -P empty wordprocessor.xul

where an empty frame would load with the xul application in the window.  It is very difficult to make applications on Linux when you consider all the dependicies needed.  For example, python with gtk, is a poor choice since each user would have to install a gtk to run a program. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. mozilla -P user.js wordprocessor.xul
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
user.js is a attempt to make an empty shell.  User is given option to use profile.  mozilla writes a lot of config files to directory and changes prefs.js.  The window opens up changed, but menu bars still exist.  The application looks as if it was opened in a web browser.  If the browser is already open, the xul is placed in a tab. 

Expected Results:  
An empty frame with the xul application running.  The application should look like any desktop application.  The command should open up a new independent frame of Mozilla.

firefox -P empty wordprocessor.xul, should open a window with empty frame and wordprocesser.xul running in the window.
