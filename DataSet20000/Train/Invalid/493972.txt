* copied the theme from the 'mac firefox installer' into windows firefox

Some items in the menu-bar menus and right-click menus have disappeared but their placeholders remain. The items appear when they are hovered over with the mouse.

Reproducible: Always




(Also, I can't use the ALT key to select menus with the keyboard with the Mac theme)
