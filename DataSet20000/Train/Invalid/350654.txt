"Firefox.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvinience."
"Please tell Microsoft about this problem."

Error report:
C:\DOCUME~1\Vlatko\LOCALS~1\Temp\cbcd_appcompat.txt

- I found the file, but don't know what to do with it. 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Usually when few windows are open.
2.I manipulate these few windows at approximately same time.
3.It happens two-three times a day.


Actual Results:  
One window appears on the screen. Please see the Detail section (above).

Expected Results:  
I have to click on "send error report" or "don't send" which closes all windows when you click "don't send." 

I guess, when a person browse the Internet and only few windows are open, nothing should happen. The notebook I use is IBM R50e Thinkpad purchased a year ago. The internet speed connection is 56mbps.
