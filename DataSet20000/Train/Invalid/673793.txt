Steps to reproduce:

I'm using an up to date firefox 5.0.

I tried to submit feedback, see below in "what should  have happened".


Actual results:

NOTHING happened.


Expected results:

The following feedback should have been accepted.

2) take a vote on UI and other functionality changes and/or enhancements BEFORE you implement them so your customer base is not so angry all the time about what you geniuses (you ARE geniuses!) are doing! (in other words, pay attention to ALL your "customers")
