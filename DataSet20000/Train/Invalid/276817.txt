Switching from remote logon to direct logon causes machine crash
Firefox 1 and Thunderbird with latest downloads from your site.
Client Machine-Sony Vaio VGN A290, XP SP2 Dual monitor
Host machine MSI Bookshelf, XP SP2
Belkin KVM 
100 mbs ethernet, ms firewall and symantec av on all machines
Host machine running Direcway v 4.2.1

I was running Firefox and Thunderbird on the host remotely using a remote
desktop connection from the client machine. There were two logons on the
host....an administrator running the direcway navigator and domino server v
6.5.2 and the remote connection with user client privelege.

I switched the monitor and kb to the host for a direct logon without
disconnecting the remote session. I do this all the time without incident.

Strange things happened.....several error messages as the host shutdown and
rebooted.

I was not able to get the host to run after this until I restored to a date
before firefox and thunderbird were loaded. 

Before the restore the host would just randoomly halt and reboot.

Nornally I would reproduce this several times before reporting, but this is just
too scary.....I have run in this configuration for several months without a
problem. The host is a stable machine that has run flawlessly for over 3 years.
It seems to be running ok now that firefox and thunderbird have been removed and
the system restored.
