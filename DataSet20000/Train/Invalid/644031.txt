Normal upgrade from Fx 3.6.16 to Fx 4. Ran into a problem with a missing bookmarks toolbar chevron. Went to look for Safe Mode to check it out with no extensions.

No directory containing Safe Mode, despite telling Firefox I wanted an icon installed on the Startup menu.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Upgrade install fx4.
2. Look for program folder
3.
Actual Results:  
No program folder.

Expected Results:  
Should have been a program folder.

Told installation I did not want a desktop icon (option for Quick Launch icon not present).
