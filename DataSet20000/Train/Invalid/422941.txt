Potentially detecting invalid or unsupported compression incorrectly

When I try to load certain pages at work it reports the following error:

"The page you are trying to view cannot be shown because it uses an invalid or unsupported form of compression."

FireFox 2.0.0.12 does not report this error and simply renders a blank page with no source when you do "View Source", but IE 6.0.2900.2180.xpsp_sp2_gdr.070227-2254 renders the page just fine.

I believe that this might be somehow related to the proxy/network at my work, because the page loads fine at home with FireFox 2.0.0.12. I noticed that bug 324363 may be related in someway, so I generated log files using the described steps in that bug of 2 example websites that demonstrate this problem.

The page should render correctly as with IE 6.
