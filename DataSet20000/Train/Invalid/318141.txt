Title bar remains after tab is closed

Upon closing a tab, the title remains.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open www.google.com in the main page. Title says "Google - Mozilla Firefox". Make sure you let the page finish loading.
2. Open a tab and open www.w3.com. Title says "World Wide Web Consortium - Mozilla Firefox". Let the page finish loading.
3. Close the w3 tab.
4. Notice how the title bar still says "World Wide Web Consortium - Mozilla Firefox", even though that web page is no longer displayed anywhere and you are on the Google tab.
5. Clicking on the Location bar and pressing Enter refreshes the title to what it should say.

Actual Results:  
After step 4, the title bar referred to a website I was no longer displaying. Clicking on the URL in the Location bar and pressing Enter restored the proper title bar.

Expected Results:  
As soon as I closed the w3 tab, the title bar should have reverted to "Google - Mozilla Firefox".
