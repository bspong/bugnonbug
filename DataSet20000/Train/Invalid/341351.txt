Page and URL blanked out after finishing display

When loading the URL above, the page is shown just an instant, before the whole tab is "reset" to a status like a new tab: No URL, tab title "(Untitled)", and a blank page. The only thing which is not reset is the history of the tab.

I've tried to clear the cache, but the page still shows up before the tab is "reset". I've also tried closing the tab and opening the page in a new tab, opening the page in a new window instead of a tab, and restarting Firefox before opening the page. None of these worked.

Prior to the error, the browser had been running for about 18 hours.

The page worked fine yesterday, when it was heavily used.

Reproducible: Always




In the JavaScript Console I get the following message every time a tab is reset:
Error: [Exception... "'Component does not have requested interface' when calling method: [nsIInterfaceRequestor::getInterface]"  nsresult: "0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE)"  location: "<unknown>"  data: no]
