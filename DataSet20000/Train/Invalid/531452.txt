Gmail usually crashes after I log on, it happens when the webpage tries to load the chat portion of the site. I can't stop it from loading. Facebook crashes when people send me a message. Youtube just crashes firefox.
When I say crash, I mean that it stop responding.

Reproducible: Always




Bug occurs on any theme. I was using a soccer theme on Personas. Other plug-ins I had were skipscreen greecemonkey with a youtube auto buffer, facebook cleaner (removes ads etc), I also used site launcher. This started pretty randomly.
