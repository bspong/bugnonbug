When the valid use of self-closing tags are used on a site, rendering is halted. Once removed and changed to the less clean <meta ...></meta> or other tags are used, rendering is fine. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go To URL


Actual Results:  
Only HTML styling in CSS is processed, rest is halted.

Expected Results:  
Entire site is processed/rendered. Use current public version of FFx to see real results.

If needed, I can create a demonstration page, but due to time constraints and anger, I have neglected to make one.
