Conflict between Google Toolbar and tabbed browsing
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4

Began having issues with tabbed browsing when I updated to 3.0.4. Could create tabs but if I attempted to navigate from them, browser navigated in the tab created at startup. Attempts to "open link in new tab" fail. Occasionally if the page script requires link to open in a new tab it will, otherwise cannot use more than one tab while surfing.

Reinstalled Firefox: did not fix.

Disabled all addons: problem stopped occurring

Enabled one at a time: problem starts with enabling Google Toolbar for Firefox 5.0.20080919Wb1

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install version of Google Toolbar
2. Try to create another functioning tab
3. Cry in frustration
