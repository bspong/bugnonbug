Hi,

i am using the bookmarks synchronizer 3 plugin. My bookmarks are synchronizing with the bookmarks synchronizer 3 plugin. I do have a subfolder located in the bookmarks toolbar folder. After the synch. is complete i can't access "properties" in this subfolder (with a right click). I only get: open, open in a new tab, open in a new windows. It does work within windows, but i won't work in linux (i am using ubuntu, kubuntu. I've tried it with the ubuntu package and also with the source code from mozilla.com. Also i've verified it on two different machines. 

When i am open a new Window everything works as usual. 

I know this bug isn't that big of a deal. But it's a little bit annoying cause i use this subfolder for online comics witch change very often :D

Also when the bookmarks are synchronized you have to restart firefox to get him recongnize the change (this also isn't needed in windows)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use bookmarks synchronizer 3 plugin
2. use a subfolder in the bookmarks toolbar
3. synchronize and try to access the properties dialog directly from the toolbar

Actual Results:  
only open, open in new window, open in new tab is avaiable

Expected Results:  
everything including properties should be avaiable

only seems to happen in linux
