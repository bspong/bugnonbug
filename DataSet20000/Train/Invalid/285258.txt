Using Mac os 10.3.8, and a Lynksys web camera type WVC54g v.1.1. I can access the camera's web 
page on the local network but cannot see the camera output. The camera's internal webpage (it is a 
stand alone device) tells me that I can only see the video stream using internet explorer, or if I am use 
netscape I must use Lnksys's own viewer software, which is of course windows only. Mac version of IE 
also does not display image so this may not be a bug but a 'feature' of MIcrosoft's crippled Mac 
products. The video is said to be mpeg 4 but clearly they do something strange to it as mpeg 4 should 
open fine. Sorry if this is not a bug but a feature....
