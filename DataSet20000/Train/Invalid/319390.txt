Long page titles stay in Window List, but not in the titlebar
Steps to reproduce:
1. Navigate to a page with a really long title; e.g. bug 216714.
2. Click back.

Note that the correct page title (the one you're currently viewing) is shown in the titlebar, but the old page's title (the one with the really long title) is still shown in the Window List as the window's title.

I filed this with GNOME, but then realized that it doesn't occur with other applications; e.g. Opera or Epiphany.
