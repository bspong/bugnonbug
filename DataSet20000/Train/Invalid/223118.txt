On a number of sites where I have requested addtitional information that appears
in a pop up window, the window is substantially higher than the screen/Firebird
window.  The above site it typical:  If you go to that URL and click on the
second box down on left "Animated NBC 5 Storm Track", the resulting window will
open substantially higher than the screen/Firebird window with no scroll bar so
that once cannot see the bottom.  This is disasterous if one is trying to click
"continue" as I was trying to do on a tech help site the other nite.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Click on http://www.nbc5i.com/weather
2.  Click on yellow box seond down on left marked "Animated NBC 5 Storm Track"
3.  View window that is much higher than screen with no scroll bar.
4.  Problem can almost be worked around by pressing F11; but not quite.

Actual Results:  
Requested Pop Up window is too high.

Expected Results:  
Should have sized Pop Up window to fit on screen

I have posted this on the Firebird bug discussion forum and there have been a
number of other people who responded that observe the same problem.
