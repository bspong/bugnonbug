If you have a customized a quick launch shortcut (at least, possibly any installer created-shortcut), the installer options lead to either: the customizations being destryoed or the shortcut being deleted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install a FF build (a testing build, say)
2. Change the quick launch shortcut to a batchfile (e.g. MOZ_NO_REMOTE ... -p testing)
3. either
4-1. Have the installer install a quick launch shortcut
4-2. Have the installer not install a quick launch shortcut

Actual Results:  
5-1. Your shortcut pointing to a batch file is overwritten with the default
5-2. Your shortcut is deleted

Expected Results:  
5-1. Installer doesnt mess with my shortcut
5-2. Installer doesnt mess with my shortcut

-1 is perhaps acceptable. -2 is not. "Dont install" !== "Dont install and delete if you find something else"
