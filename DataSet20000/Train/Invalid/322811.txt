js error in "native frame :: <<unknown filename>> :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 0

not sure if this is exploitable (no current exploit) so feel free to resolve
as invalid. just have mixed feelings about its security.

it is possible to cause a js error in 
location: "native frame :: <unknown filename>"
at least via wsdl callbacks.

error in a native frame is not a good sign imho.

eventually may be exploitable via java objects 
(not sure if the java bug is fixed).

testcase to follow.
