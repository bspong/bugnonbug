From the point of logging on and during my session on the internet, unwanted tabs keep opening up.

Each time I'm on Mozilla, unwanted tabs open up.  Some come on faster than my homepage and continue to open the entire time I'm on the internet.  I've tried updating my Mozilla Firefox but this problem is still occurring.  Some of these tabs are very raunchy and I have kids I don't want to see this stuff.  I've had this problem since around mid-July.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Double clicking my Mozilla Firefox icon
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Going on Mozilla brings on the problem during login

Expected Results:  
Unwanted tabs begin to open.  Some come faster than my homepage.

I should only have tabs that I have created by intentionally logging onto the web address.
