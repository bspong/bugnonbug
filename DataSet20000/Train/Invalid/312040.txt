Since Beta 2 (or Beta 1) I don't have "view image" and "Copy Image location" in
image context menu, if the image is "broken" after page load.

This is very bad, because some pictures are "broken" by original site when they
are linked into some forums, and having "copy image location" menu before
allowed me to open the image in new tab without any referer, thus usually
loading it correctly. (or View image opened it in same tab, and than after
"back" the broken image was replaced from cache with actual image)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open some page with "broken" images
2. right click on "broken" image icon to bring up context menu

setup: clean profile in Beta 2 / latest nightly did reproduce the problem, also
my original profile, so no special setup necessary.
Actual Results:  
there are no "View image" / "Copy Image location" items in context menu

Expected Results:  
context menu should contain those missing items
