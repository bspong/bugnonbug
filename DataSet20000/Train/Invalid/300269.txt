My computer has crashed about five times when I close Mozilla after a session of
browsing. Every time it happened there was less than one gigabyte of free space
in the partition where the browser is located. Most of the time I get the blue
death screen. When it crashes I loose my favorites. The last time it crashed
(yesterday) I had to restart the computer in safe mode and do a system restore
as the computer refused to boot any other way. Even though I have a backup copy
of the program I'm unable to retieve my favorites. 

Reproducible: Didn't try
