ff 5 hangs when downloading
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build ID: 20110615151330

Steps to reproduce:

tried to download a file or image


Actual results:

the browser hangs and then windows 7 become unresponsive.  It gets bad enough that I cannot even ctr-alt-del and have to restart by turning it off the power.  I'm getting disk corruption also, severe enough disk problems that I'm unable to boot windows 7 and need to boot from a different install and run chkdsk.  One chkdsk took 45 minutes to complete as it had enough problems.

I have not had such problems in the past when losing power.  Things work fine in FF 4 and things work fine in FF 5, until I download a file or image.  I don't know if the extensions are a problem as currently I am reluctant to turn off the extensions and download with FF 5 due to corruption problems.

I realize this might not be optimal but is a serious issue such that I cannot use FF 5.
