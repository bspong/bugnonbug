Firefox 3.0.14. Problem worse since automatic update.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.14) Gecko/2009082707 Firefox/3.0.14 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Firefox still remains in the processes list. Unable to restart Firefox unless you go into the process list and terminate it. Then you get an error indication of an unnatural termination and it reverts to the page thanking you for downloading and installing, etc.

Also, XP hangs during shut down until you take action to terminate the Firefox process.

This is not new -- getting worse -- and is quite aggravating. I've been recommending Firefox for years and don't feel I can do this any more. Inexperienced users can't handle this level of "ease of use."

I really don't want to go back to Internet Explorer! ...
