When i select more than one bookmark in Organize Bookmark and click in "Abrir tudo em abas" (portuguese), something like "open all in tabs", all current tabs are closed before the bookmarks are opened.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open firefox
2.open some tabs, lets say, 4 tabs
3.open organize bookmarks
4.select, lets say, 2 bookmarks
5.select "Abrir tudo em abas" (portuguese) in the context menu
Actual Results:  
the first 2 tabs are used to the bookmarks selected and the other 2 tabs are closed

Expected Results:  
actually, i whould prefer to open the bookmarks in new tabs, so i would have 6 tabs, 4 that are opened already and the new 2 tabs for the bookmarks, but if it opened the 2 bookmarks in the 2 first tabs would work to, but not to close the other tabs
