Display block (when applied to hidden input elements) is allowing styling of those elements, such as borders.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a form with hidden inputs (a bunch makes them more visible)
2. Add a CSS containing: input {display: block; border: thin solid red;}
3. Make sure the border color in #2 is not the same as you background color


Actual Results:  
Load the file, and you should see collapsed borders around your hidden inputs (in the example they would be the color red.

Expected Results:  
No borders around hidden inputs, the display mode on a hidden input type should not matter.

This occurs in Camino 1.0b2 and Firefox 1.5.0.1
