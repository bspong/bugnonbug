Opening the HUD with Inspector open causes Style Panel to move
Opening the HUD while the Inspector is open causes the Style panel to move down level with the bottom of the HUD Console. Style panel is currently attached to <browser> top and this moves it.

This problem should go away when the title bar patches are in (bug 552982) and the Inspector makes use of them.
