live bookmark doesn't show properties in bookmarks manager or bookmarks sidebar
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1b2) Gecko/20060821 Firefox/2.0b2

When i ctrl-click on a broken live bookmark (default "Latest Headlines" is experiencing this problem) in the Bookmarks Manager or the Bookmarks Sidebar, I do not see the Properties item listed or the Delete item.

Those do appear if I Ctrl-click or right click on the live bookmark in the Bookmarks Toolbar.

I should be able to delete from those two locations it if it doesn't work.

To reproduce:
1. Open a FF window and do Command-B (to open bookmarks sidebar)
2. Click on a broken live feed (at the moment Latest Headlines is broken). You will get an alert, saying the feed could not be loaded.
3. Right click on the live feed

Expected: context menu showing options to Delete or see its Properties, such as when you right click on the live feed found in the bookmarks toolbar.

Actual: context menu with options to Open or Copy.

This also happens if you use the Bookmarks Manager.
