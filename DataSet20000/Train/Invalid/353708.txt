Firefox will not access web after update.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.5.0.7

Firefox, and Thunderbird do not work on my system after the update...I have uninstalled everything related to Firefox, and reinstalled and still not working... The message says "Server not found." Problem is I am accessing the web with IE, and it works just fine. 

Reproducible: Always
