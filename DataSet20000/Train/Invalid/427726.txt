in RTL build, underscore is ordered strangely in some chrome text input fields
This might be due to not setting up my desktop as a proper RTL environment, but FWIW: 

If you enter a string beginning with an underscore into certain textboxes (e.g. the search bar but not the location bar) most of the characters preserve the order of entry but the underscore is moved to the end of the displayed string.

Where         You Enter  You See
------------  ---------  -------
Search Bar    _ABCDEF    ABCDEF_
Location Bar  _ABCDEF    _ABCDEF
