CTRL-LeftClick Works Like Left Click Alone On Certain Web Links, Such as Yahoo Mail
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.13) Gecko/2009073022 Firefox/3.0.13 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

On certain sites, CTRL-Left Click does not work on weblinks as expected and instead works as if only Left Click was pressed.  This means that the link opens in the same tab rather than opening a new tab.  Right clicking and selecting "open in new tab" and middle mouse button work as expected.

This behavior has been noted on Yahoo Mail Classic webmail (mail.yahoo.com), when clicking on messages and folders.  There have also been unverified reports of it occurring on ebay.co.uk.  Further information on this is located on the provided URL which describes the issue on the Mozilla Forums.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Sign in to a Yahoo Mail webmail account (mail.yahoo.com)
2. Left click on "Inbox" on the left hand side
3. CTRL-Left click on any message in the inbox.
Actual Results:  
Message opens in the same window, replacing the inbox folder display.

Expected Results:  
Message should have opened in a separate tab.

This issue has been documented as occurring in safe mode (with all customizations off) and on two separate systems (thanks to smsmith).  It may be the result of some specialized script that Yahoo is running which suppresses this behavior.  Setting "browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction = 0" did not solve this bug.
