When hovering over a bookmark in the bookmark toolbar or over an element inside a live bookmark there is an empty "hint text" (What's the right word for that?)
In Live Bookmarks when the Headline doesn't fit the width of the dropdown hovering over it showed the complete headline until Thursday or Friday update.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Fill your bookmark toolbar with at least one element (Bookmark, Folder or Live Bookmark)
2. Hover over the item with your mouse
3. You'll see an empty alt/title text
Actual Results:  
The alt/title text is empty

Expected Results:  
The alt/title text should contain the full name of the element
