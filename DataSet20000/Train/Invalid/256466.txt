In Mozilla/Firebird when a style is applied to a <colgroup> or a <col> in a
table the styles are not applied to the <td> elements in those columns.  The
only style that seems to be able to be applied is the background.  Anything
affecting text, padding, margins, et cetera is not inherited by the cells in the
column.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Just try and apply styles to a <col> or <colgroup>
Actual Results:  
Nothing, except when you applied a background.

Expected Results:  
The styles applied to the <col> or <colgroup> should be inherited by the table
cells in those columns.
