Hello

While I was working on my page, I started having a vertical pixel color/shift issue.

when I use a unordered list property under a div, a line is visible between them. This only happens in firefox. I'm 

not highly experienced in html/css but I tried everything I can think of and I can't get rid of the vertical pixel. 

The pixel is red and it's between the green div and blue ul (see link).

Also, If i decided to add a yellow div under the green div instead, the pixel bug will appear at the last pixel of 

the green div and it's color will be shifted to yellow.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
The unordered list should of lined up directly below the div without mislabeling of color.
