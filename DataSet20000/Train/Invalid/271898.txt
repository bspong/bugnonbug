"Autour du romantisme: le roman" is an academic CD-ROM produced by Trevi, which
contains complete novel texts with a searchable interface, etc. It works
properly with Internet Explorer, and presumeably the antiquated Netscape it
comes with, but not with a more modern Firefox. When attempting to begin using
the software, it gives the error "unable to open HTML\Choix\choix.htm (19)"
(using the address http://127.0.0.1:9088/HTML/Choix/choix.htm); attempting to
open that file using the File --> Open dialog box works only briefly; later
pages also fail to load. It's very possible that the CD-ROM is just doing evil
nonstandard things which make it break. ;3 But I hoped that there might be some
legitimate problem that could be fixed, since I actually have to set my default
browser to IE to use it.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch software
2. Click "Consulter"
3. Click "Commencer"
4. :(
Actual Results:  
The software gives the "unable to open HTML\Choix\choix.htm (19)" error message.

Expected Results:  
The software should hopefully have launched the HTML interface.

The bug appears in the default configuration.
