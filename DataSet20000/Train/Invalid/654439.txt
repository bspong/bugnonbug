Awesome screenshot: capture and annotate 2.2.1 extension not working even when enabled
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1

Eight days after installing firefox 4.0, I notice that my capture shortcut icon which was meant to be displayed beside my google search engine could not be found.
Then I went to check my add-ons page, extensions to know if Awesome screenshot: capture and annotate 2.2.1 is enabled, to my suprise it was enabled. I disabled and enabled it, but all to no avail.
Any help in regards to this will be appreciated. Thanks in advance.


Reproducible: Always
