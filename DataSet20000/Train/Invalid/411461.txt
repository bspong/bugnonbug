investigate client side sql injections
clients side usage of sql makes suite vulnerable to client side sql
injections.

iirc there was a bugzilla bug about a sql injection in dead code (don't
remember the bug number atm)

potentially buggy method is:
ExecuteSimpleSQL

i grep'ped for its usage but couldn't find any bugs.

are there other functions/methods like ExecuteSimpleSQL that execute a sql
string that should be checked?

probably it is a good idea to add a scary comment in ExecuteSimpleSQL about
the dangers of its usage.
