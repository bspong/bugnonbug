When selecting an auto-complete entry for a text input field (either by mouse or keyboard), an onchange event connected to the input field is not fired.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create the following form: <form><input id="test" onchange="javascript:alert('changed!')"><input type="submit"></form>
2. Fill in something in the text field, and exit the text field (for example by clicking anywhere on the page). The alert box shows.
4. Submit the form, it comes back emptied.
5. Perform an action to display the autocomplete list, for example by double-clicking the input field, or pressing the Down arrow while the field is focussed.
6. Select a value from the autocomplete list, either by mouse or keyboard.
7. Exit the input field (for example by clicking anywhere on the page), no alert box is shown this time.
Actual Results:  
In the last step, no alert box is shown.

Expected Results:  
The alert box, that is opened by the onchange event, should show.
