If you go to www.aol.com a popup window should appear, but by default, Firefox
will block the popup(good, means popup blocker is doing its job) Now when the
yellow bar appears, it explains has blocked a popup, you have the option of
clicking the yellow bar and getting a three options.

Now the problem is how come it only gives me three options instead of four. The
three options that are given to me are

1.Allow popups for www.aol.com...

2. Edit popup blocked options...

3.Don't show this message when popups are blocked...
____________________________________________________

Now if im correct it should have a fourth options which should say 

Show popup window from www.aol.com (this is basically a temporary option that
allows you to view the popup with out actually adding it to the allowed popups
feature) I know I have seen this feature before but at this time or writing I
can not find a website that gives me this feature.

Is this a bug?

If it is not I would like to request this feature to be added to the next
Firefox release.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to www.aol.com
2.watch for the yellow popup bar
3.when it appears rightclick and see three options
4. where is the fourth option that allows me to show the popup blocked without
actually adding it to the allowed popup feature

Actual Results:  
can produce the fourth option which I have explained all over this article.

Expected Results:  
The fourth option should allow me to show popup blocked without adding it to the
allowed popup feature.
