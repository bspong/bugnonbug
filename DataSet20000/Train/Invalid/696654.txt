Steps to reproduce:

Upgraded from FF 5 to FF 7.0.1.


Actual results:

Suddenly many websites show dashes and quote signs as boxes with numbers. Until FF 5.0 everything was displayed fine. The fonts contain these signs. Playing with "character encodings" option changes only for worst. Happens in SAFE MODE too. I run MacOSX 10.6.8!

Expected results:

Display correctly all characters like in FF 1.5 to FF 5.0 ...
