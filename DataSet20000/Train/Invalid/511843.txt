problems with "customize toolbar" (Print Preview Toolbar Button 0.1)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.13) Gecko/2009073022 Firefox/3.0.13
Build Identifier:  Firefox 3.5.2

After "customize" the toolbar the menus are not available anymore neither the back and forward buttons. I have to restart firefox again to make these available.
I have gone back to the 3.0.13 version

Reproducible: Always
