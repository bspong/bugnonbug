Whenever I am downloading a .msi archive from Tucows or Sourceforge, Firebird
insists on adding a .exe extension on my file, making it useless to windows.
Example: 

link to file "File.msi" puts up download dialog and automatically adds .exe as
file extension, so that downloaded file will be named "File.msi.exe" 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a download on Tucows or Sourceforge with .msi extension
2. Click the link and chose save


Actual Results:  
3. Locate the downloaded file, it is now .msi.exe

Expected Results:  
mozilla should not add .exe extension to anything at all except .exe files!
