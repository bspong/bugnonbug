Fails to open websites often, only when opening new wbesites, not when opening new pages of same site

While trying to open certain web pages (problem does not exist while navigating
between pages of the same site, but only when navigating to new sites), I
receive one of several similar error messages, generally stating that the page
cannot be found. This problem will occur with sites of known reliability (such
as google.com) just as often as others. The problem began only after I upgraded
from Firefox 1.01 to 1.02. Sometimes a page will open only if opened within a
blank tab; other times the browser refuses to open ANY page. This latter problem
is usually remedied only by restarting the browser several times, or by
restarting the computer. I am fairly certain this is not an issue with my
internet connection, as other programs continue to function normally (IM, IRC,
etc.) 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
I can reproduce the problem on my own computer, but I do not know how or if it
can be reproduced on another computer.
1. Open any web page in the current tab (sometimes the error occurs, not always).
Actual Results:  
Error looking up the specified page. In the status display in the bottom left,
it reads "Looking up DOMAIN.org" until it displays the error.

Expected Results:  
It should have navigated to the web page as expected.

I have Verizon 10 Mbps DSL.
