I followed the steps in this KB article using Firefox 1.5 Beta 1 

http://kb.mozillazine.org/Links_to_local_pages_don't_work

file:// links on my intranet are still giving the JS Console security error.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a page on a server (my server was an intranet server called http://wiki )
2. Follow steps in http://kb.mozillazine.org/Links_to_local_pages_don't_work to
add http://wiki to user.js
3. Visit the page and click the file:// link

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.

Visit the JS Console to see security error.

Expected Results:  
The link should have been followed.

The same setup works in Firefox 1.0 when the checkLoadURI setting is disabled.

However, this setup does not work in 1.5 Beta 1:

user_pref("capability.policy.policynames", "localfilelinks");
user_pref("capability.policy.localfilelinks.sites", "http://wiki");
user_pref("capability.policy.localfilelinks.checkloaduri", "allAccess");
