The bookmarks will not sort. After selecting Alpha (descending) by Name, the software ignores the change, or worse, chooses a different sort -- every time.

I Select All Bookmarks, Sort by Name, in Ascending (A-Z), and it won't take. Often it selects some bizarre combination, and then defaults to "none."

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Bookmarks 
2. Organize Bookmarks, Select All Bookmarks, Bookmark Menu
3. Select View, Select Sort, Select Sort by Name, Select View, Select Sort, Select A -> Z.
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens. The software defaults resume unchanged.

Expected Results:  
After the tenth time, frustration.

Sorted the bookmarks first by name, the by A -> Z sequence. Kept those choices until changed. It never changes.
