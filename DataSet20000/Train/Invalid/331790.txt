I am getting a lot of email concerning my website which is www.springbeerfest.com. The problem is that Firefox converts Frontpage gif files to pdf. I am only getting complaints from Firefox users. I know that if you key in on my website you will find this problem exists. None of the IE users have complained of this problem.
