Several days ago I reported a 'page will not display' bug that was a case of OS X being blocked by Microsoft. I took the opportunity to send feedback asking for an explaination. I reported to you their response. Today I received an email from Microsoft asking me to participate in a survey on the quality of their support on my recent feedback. I clicked on the above URL intending to ask why they are blocking OS X on Firefox. What I got is the following:

Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error '80040e10'

[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver]COUNT field incorrect or syntax error

/msnsrvy/survlogin.asp, line 120 

I tried to get to the page by copying the URL and pasting it in with the same result.

I am using Firefox v 1.5.0.3

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Copy above URL and paste it into Mac Firefox and click return.

Actual Results:  
See Details above.
