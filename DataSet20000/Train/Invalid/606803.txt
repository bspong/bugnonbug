add action indicators when dragging tabs
since Bug 483776 was wont fixed. i am opening a new bug with my comment from there.
when dragging tabs, usability and discoverability dictates that we should have visual feedback for the possible actions and outcomes:
1. indication when the dragging operation is in action (possibly bugs 455694, 485105)
2. "+" sign when using ctrl to clone tab
3. relevant indications for special drop zones:
   a. disallowed (or no action) zones
   b. when dropping on a button (e.g. home) it should get highlighted
   c. dropping on a windows folder should not highlight it, as it does now
