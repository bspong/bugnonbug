Whenever I press the tab character to go from one field to another, for example in a form, Firefox does not go to the next field--it stays where it is. Moreover, it performs a very weird reformatting of the page. For example, right now as I'm typing this bug report and I press tab, the screen reformatts from san-serif font to serif and back. Really weird. Reproducible every single time--no exceptions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Place the cursor in any text field.
2. Press the tab key.

Actual Results:  
The results are above in the details.

Expected Results:  
Focus should have gone to the next text field.

I'm using the default theme.
