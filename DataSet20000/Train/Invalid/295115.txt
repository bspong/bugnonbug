Greasemonkey 0.3.3: "Could not download user script"
When I try to install a greasemonkey user script, it displays an alert box with
this error:

"Could not download user script

[Exception..."Cannot modify properties of a WrappedNative" nsresult:"0x80570034
(NS_ERROR_XPC_CANT_MODIFY_PROP_ON_WN)" location: "JS frame ::
chrome://greasemonkey/content/greasemonkey.js :: anonymous :: line 251" data: no]"

Steps to reproduce:
1. Install Greasemonkey 3.3 and restart Firefox (http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/)
2. Right-click on of the scripts on that page and select "Install User Script...".

Actual Results:
The above mentioned error is displayed in an alert box.
The download manager shows the download of the script as "Starting...".
The js console displays:
Warning: assignment to undeclared variable folder
Source File: chrome://mozapps/content/downloads/downloads.js
Line: 745
Error: doc has no properties
Source File: chrome://greasemonkey/content/greasemonkey.js
Line: 34

Judging from the error, this is a regression from bug 281988.
