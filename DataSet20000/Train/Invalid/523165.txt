I have a website contains header and navigational menus.  The content of the page has form with many text fields.  When load a page, the page moves up and set focus to the first text field in the form.  Focus to first text field is very cool but it is NOT cool to move the page up where the first text field is at the top in the browser and not seeing the header and navigational menus.

Reproducible: Always
