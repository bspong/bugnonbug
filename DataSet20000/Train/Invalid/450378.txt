Every single time I attempt to open an SVG file from a local disk (so it's a file:/// URL), instead of displaying the file, the dialog box asking if you want to open the file or save it appears. Bizarrely, SVG files get displayed properly if retrieved from a http: url.

In addition, if I use file>open file... then SVG files don't show up if "Images" is selected as the type. Possibly both these problems have the same cause.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find an SVG file on a local disk, or put one there if you haven't already got one.
2. Go to File>Open File... menu item and navigate to the location of the aforementioned file.
3. Notice the SVG file only shows up with the "All Files" filter selected, not with "Images".
4. Open the file.
Actual Results:  
Dialog box appears asking whether I want to open or save the file.

Expected Results:  
The file should have been displayed as an image, like it is if accessed via HTTP.
