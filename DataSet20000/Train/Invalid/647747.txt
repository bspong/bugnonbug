Frequent black screens and Firefox 4 becomes unresponsive
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

Several times a day since upgrading to Firefox 4, Firefox will become slow and unrseponsivie, and eventually the content area will turn black. The Toolbars and tabs still display but do not function. Firefox will now outright crash on me sometimes as well, just completely close and dissappear. This never occurred before Firefox 4.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I am not sure how to reproduce this issue other than simply using the browser for an hour or so. It happens several times a day, but I have not seen a pattern in any specific pages or actions that cause it. There are similar reports of black screens in other bug reports, but they mention things like playing videos or viewing content in full screen mode.

This is probably the closest bug, but is marked as resolved, and the user states he can change tabs. I am unable to change tabs once this issue occurs:
