hey guys, somehow this got broken along the way. all dialogs in OS X no longer have the keyboard shortcuts to confirm the dialogs.  I noticed it in rc2, but figured it would get fixed sorry i didnt pipe up earlier

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. find a site where a dialog occurs
2. have a mac
3. cry, because you have to use the mouse

Actual Results:  
nothing

Expected Results:  
first letter of a dialog typically activates the button

please fix!!
