Trying to move multiple items (bookmarks or folders) between folders by drag-and-drop, I noticed that only one item is moved. Rest of the selection stays in the source folder

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox (Minefield version mentioned in the bug)
2. Open 'Bookmarks -> Organize Bookmarks...'
3. Select multiple items (folders or bookmarks)
4. Drag the selected items to a different folder
Actual Results:  
Out of all the selected items, only one item is moved. Rest stay put.

Expected Results:  
All selected items should be moved
