SSL is not initialized when firefox is started. Therefore SSL-encrypted connections are disabled.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11

After the latest NSS updates on my Debian/Linux SSL has been disabled from my firefox (and from epiphany, as well). When firefox is started, the immediate reposnse on console is:

/usr/lib/iceweasel/firefox-bin: Symbol `SSL_ImplementedCiphers' has different size in shared object, consider re-linking

and when the browser starts, it gives a warning text box saying:

Could not initialize browser's security component. The most likely cause is problem with files ......


Also, related to this I think, evolution will not start at all, but instead it complains about NSS not being initialized:

(evolution:6708): evolution-smime-WARNING **: Failed all methods for initializing NSS

(evolution:6708): camel-WARNING **: Failed to initialize NSS



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start firefox e.g. with 'firefox'
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Browser works OK with non-encrypted content. Password-manager is disabled.

Expected Results:  
Also https-pages should be accessible. Now they are not.

I have a feeling that this problem has to do with libnss3-0d version 3.12.0~1.9b1-2 which I installed with the most recent updates.

I have reported a bug about the problems with evolution to gnome:

http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=507470

At this stage, I enter the Severity as Major, as I find it a major obstacle not to  be able to use SSL-encrypted connections, i.e. HTTPS.
