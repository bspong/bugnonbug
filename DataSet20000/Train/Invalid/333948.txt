With your new release 1.5.0.2 RoboForm no longer works.  Where the Roboform toolbar used to be, it now says "Unsupported browser".  When you click on it, it says "This Adaptor (6-6-6) supports only Firefox ver. 1.5 to 1.5.0.*. You are using ver."

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firefox.

I tried to download the RoborForm adaptor again but it didn't help.
