When resizing the browser small enough to reveal scroll bars, then using the scroll bars considerably fast, the browser will not always update the applet draw area. but if the scroll bars are moved slowly the applet is more likely to be re-drawn.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a page with an applet (eg. http://have2chat.net/login.html, no need to accept any popups)
2. resize the page small enough to reveal scroll bars (on the right)
3. scroll up and down the page width mouse or mouse wheel fast, to show bug.

Actual Results:  
ghoast like images from previously viewed areas.

Expected Results:  
expected to see all of the applet rendered correctly.

4. scroll up and down the page very slowly to allow applet to render correctly,
