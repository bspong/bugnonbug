Problem with Google search, which does not repeat when experimenting with Safari, Search directs to odd list, not the usual search, then when I try and link, it often comes up with a different search engine list of results.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.4; en-GB; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008061004 Firefox/3.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.4; en-GB; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008061004 Firefox/3.0

Stems from Google search. Only happenes on Firefox. Links to random unrelated pages. Sometimes links to other search engine results list. Makes Firefox impossible to use. I am not a techie, but will help all I can. It is annoying.
