Upgarded to version 1.5.0.3 now unable to connect to the internet using Firefox.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; AOL 9.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.40607)
Build Identifier: 

Program tries to access internet using AOL dialup connection. I have no dialup service. I am on a home network with router for ethernet connection to internet.
The network is functioning because I can access the internet using AOL or Internet Explorer and I can access shared files on other computers. There are five computers in the network. I have the only one that uses Firefox. I was able to connect with Firefox before installing the upgrade. 

I have tried to change network settings but nothing seems to help. I see no way to instruct Firefox not to use AOL and especially AOL dialup.
I have checked my firewall settings and connection to Mozilla Firefox is enabled.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Double click on Mozilla Firefox icon
2. 
3. 

Actual Results:  
Get "Unable to Connect" message "Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at www.google.com"

Expected Results:  
Expect to connect to google.com
