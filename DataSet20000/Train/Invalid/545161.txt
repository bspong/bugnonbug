I was trying to addd a Canadian Payee in ONline banking, and after I chose Canada as the country, I was hoping to see Canadian states in the drop down but I only saw all the northern US states in the drop down.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I logged into online banking using username: alok and password: canvas
2. I traversed to Add a Payee module
3. I chose to add a Canadian Payee
4. I entered payee "Canada Utility company"
5. I went to the states drop down
6. It shows US states!  Funny!
