Since recently full screen mode has spurious tool bars.

since a recent update (Summer 2006?) there is still a parasitic menu/tool bar appearing even after hitting F11 to obtain full screen. (normal browsing, no tabs, javascript working) 


Thanks to examine this issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1)Check the example link http://www.shedrupling.org/nav/nav.php?index=deb-eee
2)hit F11 to see the page as it was designed for. In place of full screen I still have a tool bar.
3)Use the navigation bar at the bottom, if you can reach it, as the unwanted toolbar can shift it out of reach.

Alternative:
1)Check the example link http://www.shedrupling.org/nav/nav.php?index=deb-eee
2)click the link "read the stories in full screen" (it is present for IE users!)
3)hit F11, this time it works, I have the full screen. This is because this link is a 
onClick="window.open('URL','NavBonheurFullscreen','fullscreen=yes, scrollbars=no')">. But this uselessly opens a second window.

Actual Results:  
Using normally F11 still produce a half-full screen, with a menu bar (not auto-hide).
To have a true full screen requires a special window.open link with fullscreen=yes and then clicking F11 


Expected Results:  
Full screen should appear automatically and without need for special tricks, just when the user hits F11 (eventually F11 could trigger a series of various modes more or less full screen)


Please note that in the instance a true full screen is strongly needed, and even "critical", for obvious artistic reasons, and that this page does not trap the user, lefting the choice open.

I think full screen should work easily, not trapping the visitor, but without hassle for the newbie user, just respecting his choice. F11 was a simple thing to do. 

Also note that I have now no full screen at all with IE. If you want to catch my visitors...

I have no special info about my configuration.
