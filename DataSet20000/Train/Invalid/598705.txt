I saw others have reported this same problem but on other operating systems so I am opening a new ticket with mine -- 64-bit Windows 7.  As others have reported, all system sounds functional, all media player files functioning properly, only when streaming video in Mozilla Firefox that I get no sound.  Began after Firefox upgrade to v.3.6.  I tried multiple fixes by uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox, Java, etc.  Nothing worked.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Upgrade to Mozilla Firefox version 3.6
2.  Attempt to open any streaming video, ie. those located on YouTube.com
3.
Actual Results:  
Video works.  No audio.

Expected Results:  
Video works.  Audio works.

As stated, there are multiple tickets open for this problem across all platforms.  I only opened a new one because I did not see where anyone else had reported it on 64-bit Windows 7.
