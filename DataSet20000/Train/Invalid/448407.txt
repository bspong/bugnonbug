New version creates Firefly tabs on its own when I used a tab key.

The new version creates Firefly tabs when I enter the Tab key on any web page.  The focus is on the firefly tab, taken away from what I am trying to do.  The firefly page is just blue with"Start Page Settings" at the bottom.  It doesn't seem to be functional and the browser is quickly filled up with many Firefly tabs.  I think this may happen with other key strokes as well (perhaps return, arrow keys).  Needless so say this is extremely annoying.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. My previous version of Firefox had Firefly installed.  
2. go to a page where you would normally enter a tab key, like login in to yahoo.com
3. The new tab appears
Actual Results:  
I had firefly working with the previous version of firefox.  When firefox came up yesterday, it did an update.  On opening the browser, entering a tab key causes a new tab to appear that is labelled Firefly.  Focus is more to the new tab.  This also happens when I use the search box (with Google) in the upper right hand corner.  Type in something to search, hit "return" (a normal way to initiate the search action) and a new tab comes up labelled firefly.  

Expected Results:  
I expect tab and return to act normally without the side effect of creating the new tab page.
