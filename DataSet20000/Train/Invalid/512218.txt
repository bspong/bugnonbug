When typing the Home key quickly twice in a row, a "Quick Bookmark Search" form appears.  When entering anything into the form field, it never actually searches my bookmarks.  It acts in an identical way to the address bar, but without the ability to actually match against bookmarks.  I therefore believe this is a redundant undocumented feature which should be removed to prevent confusion, as it can't be disabled.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Apply a keywrod with the value "unix" to a bookmark
2. Press Home button quickly twice in a row
3. Type in "unix" into the form field and press enter
Actual Results:  
A Wikipedia page is presented.

Expected Results:  
The matched bookmark would be loaded.
