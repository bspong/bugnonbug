firefox has problems with webservers that do chunked encoding only (e.g. publicfile) and misses to read e.g. css style files like in this example

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.visit http://nn7.de/pics/photos/bled08/002-CIMG3681.JPG.html using firefox
2.do the same with i.e. IE6/7, opera: firefox misses to load the css
Actual Results:  
page misses style files and is plainly displayed, although there should be a grey border around the small images


it seems to be that publicfile does only chunked encoding and never uses content-length:

I think the problem here about 'YUM' is exactly the same that hits firefox:

I agree.  What makes publicfile different is that it seems to use
chunked encoding all the time.  There's no rule against this, but most
servers only use chunked encoding when they "need to".  The chunked
encoding is intended largely to deal with dynamic data for which the
content-length is not known at the time the transaction begins.
Othwerwise, it would not be possible to do keepalive because the
client would have no way to locate message boundaries.  For most
static files with an obvious (from stat) file size, most servers send
the file with "identity" encoding and provide a content-length.

Again, the issue is not that publicfile is wrong.  It's just a little
different from how most servers behave.  Neither it nor the other
servers are incorrect.  This is not a protocol-violation issue.  The
issue in yum is above the protocol layer.
