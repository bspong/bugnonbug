Firefox keeps accumulating entries in Task manager; crashes Windows
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

Since 1.5, Firefox will keep accumulating entries in Task manager that cannot usually be ended with closing the browser or "ending" in task manager.  Sometimes when the browser has been on long enough, closing the browser will crash Windows.  When I restart, Windows says that there's been a serious error that forced a stop.  Firefox is the ONLY program that does this.  

I am also running the latest builds of Zone Alarm, SpySweeper and NOD32 from Eset.

I have noticed NO particular web site or function that crashes the system except that Task manager seems to have a lot of Firefox entries that it will not let go of, even if the Firefox window is closed.  

Also, sometimes I see FoxSrvr2 in the entries; sometimes not.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Leave Firefox on for a while, doing normal browsing.
2. Leave anti-virus, anti-spyware, Zone Alarm on, as usual.
3. Keep checking Task Manager (XP Pro) to see if all/any Firefox entries can be ended
4. When Firefox entries number at least 3 and the accumulated memory is > 80M, a crash is inevitable.  I have 512M memory.
