After closing both Tool and Navigation-Address Bars, and you close all FIREFOX pages, when you re-enter the FIREFOX you have only the chance to recover these Bars if you go to  Start Menu, you instruct to open the browser in Safe Mode and then instruct to recover losted bars. Please install an ICON-buttom or other procedure that enable a simple action to recover the bars you want them available when you deserve it. Will be pleased with such convenience as others that by different reasons of use to reduce the frame to get more space due the monitor is not big enough or use large windows with graphics, etc. Many thanks
