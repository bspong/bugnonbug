When browsing Newegg's product selection page, Nightly will lock up when an option is selected from any of the drop down menus on the left of the page and "search" is pressed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Select any of the categories from the orange bar on the Newegg homepage. (Computer Hardware > SSD; in my case)
2.On the left of the page, under "Narrow Results" click "Advanced"
3.Several drop down menus will appear, select any one and choose a selection (Form Factor > 1.8"; in my case)
4.Press "search" button

Actual Results:  
Browser locks up and will not respond.  Had to end process in task manager process window.  Nightly successfully recovers all open tabs.  

Expected Results:  
Should have loaded the webpage with the results narrowed down as requested.

Software: Nightly 6.0a1 (2011-04-27) x64 build.

Also tested on Internet Explorer 9 (x64) and Opera 11.01 (x86) and both of those browsers could successfully load the webpage without locking up.
