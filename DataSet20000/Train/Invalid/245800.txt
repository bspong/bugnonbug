    for the current session only

When it asks if i want to accept or reject the cookie, and i accept it, the
cookie is set for the session.

If I accept all cookies for the domain, a new cookie will get accepted but not
only for the current session...

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Check "for current session only" (along with "ask before accepting")
2. Go to a site set cookie for longer than session.
3. Accept cookies one by one.

4. Do it again, but with an always accept for domain.

Actual Results:  
1,2,3 set cookie for session
4 sets cookie for longer time

Expected Results:  
4 should also set cookie for session
