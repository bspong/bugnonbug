doesn't start firefox when network workgroup upgraded to domain
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: http://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-1.0.6&os=win&lang=nl-NL

Hi, I was Administrator on my local computer when I first installed Mozilla 
Firefox(at that time version 1.0.3). Then after a few months my network was 
upgraded to a domain, so I added my computer to the domain. After that, Mozilla 
could start, but no standard page was loaded and I couldn't use any menus or 
buttons, accept for the minimalize, maximize and close buttons in the right 
upper corner. Put in a short sentence: Mozilla Firefox became useless to me, 
and I was forced to use Microsoft IE, which of course still worked. The problem 
didn't go away with versions 1.0.4 or 1.0.6. With 1.0.4, I didn't uninstall 
first, just overwrote it, with 1.0.6, I did uninstall first, then installed the 
latest version 1.0.6... 

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. A computer part of a workgroup, logged on as Administrator
2. Install Firefox (doesn't matter which version)
3. Surf in Firefox.
4. add your computer to a domain
5. Log in as an account in the domain.
6. Start Firefox.
7. Try to do something(surfing, using menus/buttons) in Firefox.
