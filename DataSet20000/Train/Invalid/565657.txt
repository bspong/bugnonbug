When I try to download/open a pdf, first a window opens but not to save the file, instead it wants me to open one! It works in Safari, so I know it's not my machine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click on a link to a pdf file
2. Firefox should download the file
Actual Results:  
a window opens but it's for opening a file, not saving one. Clicking on cancel leaves me with a blank page with the url to the file in the menu bar.

Expected Results:  
a pdf file on my Mac

either opened the pdf in a firefox window or the download window should open and the file saved to disk.
