Crashes Mac OS X kernel! (com.symantec.kext.internetSecurity?) (rdar://5818025)
I am running 2.0 RC5 and now the latest nightly minefield. I have had 5 kernel traps. These only happen when I am using Firefox. It has happened a few times when I close a quicktime window. It also happened when I clicked on an upload file icon to put an attachment on a bug report.

While it is hard to pin down these sorts of traps, it has only happened when I was using FireFox.

It made no crash reports, and the kernel trap reports were inscrutable--they got sent to Apple.

This is on Leopard 10.5.3 on a MacPro with 8 GB memory.
