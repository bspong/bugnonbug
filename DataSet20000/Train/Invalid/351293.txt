MSAA IAccessible.accRole returns string "form" instead of vt==VT_I4 with int role constant
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.13) Gecko/20060414

The MSAA IAccessible.accRole documentation...
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/msaa/msaaccrf_002t.asp

..clearly states that for the retval: "The variant member must be VT_I4, and the IVal member contains and object role constant."

Yet Mozilla seems to return a string variant containing the text "form" for all-form elements.

If you have any questions about this, just ask; I will be following this thread.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Traverse the MSAA tree.
2. Find the node representing the HTML "form"-element.
3. use .get_accRole(self) to get its role field.
4. Profit?
