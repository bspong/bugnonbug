Custom option should let the user choose, what all components an experienced user wants to install during the installation of Firefox, but wizard never shows those options and install the software. It is quite possible that this functionality is doing what it is supposed to do, but user is never informed about it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. double click on firefox installer (Firefox Setup 3.0.exe)
2. choose custom to install specific components ONLY
3. user is never asked by the installer what components he/she wants to install


Expected Results:  
there should be a screen in wizard (like all other softwares) wherein user can choose what to install.
