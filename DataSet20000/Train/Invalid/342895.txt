meta refresh doesn't redirect to the correct url
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.3

when using the following url 
www.uprising.me.uk
you should be redirected by the meta refresh line in index.htm to this url www.uprising.me.uk/uprising/index.html
This works fine with IE but Firefox tries to redirect to this url
http://www.uprising.me.uk/%5C%5Cwww.uprising.me.uk/uprising/index.html

The index.htm page that should redirect is coded as follows

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
<html>
<head>
<title>Untitled Document</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1">
<meta http-equiv="REFRESH" content="0; URL=http:\\www.uprising.me.uk\uprising\index.html">
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>

I have tried  the redirect using both / and \ and get the same results
