In a positioned/styled menu of a UL and four LIs, I have an id attribute on each LI and inside it a hyperlink pointing to that id attribute (was wanting to use :target for styling & testing purposes). When clicking the link, however, the browser not only shifts view to the top of the UL (good), it actually repositions / redraws the UL higher than it was and is supposed to be. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open attached testcase
2. Examine positioning of the navigation (UL+LIs)
3. Click on any of the tabs to trigger the bug. Scroll back up after click to see in better view.
Actual Results:  
UL menu gets repositioned.

Expected Results:  
UL menu isn't being targeted by any styles on :target, nor are the LIs, so it shouldn't shift / change in rendering.
