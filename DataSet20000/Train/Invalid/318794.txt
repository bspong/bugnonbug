One way that firefox could get a large number of parent to switch would be to have an extesion availible that allowed them to filter out swear word, and vulgar language.  What I envision is some thing that would replace the cuss word with a custumizable string, or random $%^%&% characters.  Such that the user could change the string for each word so F--- could be replaced with fudge, and A-- with Butt. (or what ever word the user wants)  Another key componet would be that users could add their own words.
