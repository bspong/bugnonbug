I have seen this bug reported several years ago and no fix listed.  I am using 3.0.5 and having the problem every day.  When clicking on a link, it sometimes takes 2 or 3 attempts before the click actually works.  This ONLY happens in Firefox, so it cannot be a computer of mouse problem.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Click a Link
3. Click again, and perhaps again!


Expected Results:  
I expect that one click should work on any link!

I find this problem not only annoying, but it can also cause difficulties when ordering something online.  One is never sure if submitting a payment has been accepted or a second (or third) click is required.  In the event one "jumps the gun", it can cause a double charge to a credit card or completely screw up the order and cause you to have to start over.
