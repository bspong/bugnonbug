this has happened to me about 8 times now.  I have been using firefox 3, then I was using the 3.4 beta for about two weeks, and then I just downloaded the 3.5 RC and the exact same thing happened, while using firefox my computer just freezes and the keyboard wont type and mouse wont move, CTRL alt delete does nothing, the only thing that works is if I restart the computer.  It has happened 8 times with the latest betas every time. I am getting nervous about using firefox.  this has never happened to me while using internet explorer.
