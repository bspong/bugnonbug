Dear Firefox,
I found a not-documented-so-far bug in Firefox 1.0.2.
When I open the "Bookmarks>Manage Bookmarks" webpage (as a new tab-window, then
at any other tab-window I cannot use the "mouse right-click" to copy/paste any
text. I have to close the "Bookmarks>Manage Bookmarks" webpage in order to be
able to copy/paste any text from any webpage.

Thank you
Keep up the good work

right-click".
4. The "mouse right-click" DOES NOT GIVE YOU the option to copy/paste any text.
5. Close "Bookmarks>Manage Bookmarks" webpage
6. Now go to any other tab-window and YOU CAN mark and copy any text (by using
