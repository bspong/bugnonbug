[split] autocomplete shows credit card numbers when only the first number is typed
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; en-US; rv:1.3a) Gecko/20030105 Phoenix/0.5

Autocomplete seems to collect information that users may not want collected,
even down to incorrectly typed URL's, and incorrectly entered user-name/password
details, but what is worse, it collects credit card numbers, and other
"sensitive" data, and displays them whenever a number is typed, as long as the
number entered is the first number of the series.
OK so autocomplete can be turned off, not that your everday user knows where to
find their profile, and then knows to create a user.js file. But even with
autocomplete turned off, does it continue to secretly squirrel away information
in the event of being turned on again.
It would seem a lot of information is collected with the everyday user having no
idea how to edit this info, even down to Download manager continuing to collect
download info which it is unable to delete simply because there is no apparent
way of finding it.
Anyone with the knowledge of where these details are stored and how to access
it, can use this information even when they do not have the authority, simply
because the average user has no idea on the internal workings of Mozilla, and
Phoenix.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. details above should be self explanatary
2.
3.



Expected Results:  
able to edit autocomplete, or have the ability to determine what information is
collected, or turn autocomplete off, and have no information collected at all.

There appears to be no level of severity to cover the loss/misuse of sensitive
personal data.
