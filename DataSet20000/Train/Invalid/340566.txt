The flash player plugin used in video.google.com causes Firefox to be slower and slower after several hours/a day (probably). Tab switching for example becomes slower and annoying. When refreshing the page, the tab switching becomes faster again.
Using Flash player 9 beta version 9,0,0,296 (Since it fixes bug 334322 )
If this is a flash plugin bug, please keep the bug open until it is fixed and only then mark as Invalid (as was done in bug 334322), in order to keep track of this issue which affects Firefox users.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open several tabs of simple, static html content like www.mozilla.org, which is not supposed to cause performance problems.
2. Open http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-570288889128950913&q=ethanol in another tab. Wait until the video starts to play a few seconds, and stop it by pressing the pause button. Note: the video download continues to progress in the background, you can see this on the video progress bar after some time.
3. Wait until the progress bar indicates the video completed loading. Make many switches between tabs by clicking the mouse on them. There is a small delay in tab switching (barely unnoticeable,but much slower than without google video affect, you can see this by refreshing the page, pausing again, and switching tabs - now much faster), and from time to time 1 out of several switches has a longer delay.
4. Wait another day. Tab switching gets very slow for every tab switch.
5. Refresh the google video page. Pause again after several seconds of video play. Switch between the other tabs that are not of video.google.com - now the switching is fast and immediate.

Actual Results:  
Firefox is less responsive and slower. Can be seen by trying Tab switching.

Expected Results:  
Fast tab switching
