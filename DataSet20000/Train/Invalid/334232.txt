"Steganos Security Suite 7" one-click-destruction is started by ordinary clicks within ordinary browsing: when clicking a link to open within the same tab for instance. 

This happens randomly rather than with a predictable click pattern, as far as I can tell. 

The problem first appeared when I did a major update from v 1.0.7 to 1.5 last week. 

This can  happen 10 or so times in a 4 hour session.

Steganos is a trace destruction program that I have set to run when all windows of the browser are shut. 

The problem starts up without my having closed a browser window.

Steganos was stable with the earlier version of Mozilla Firefox.

The program has a timer so it is easy to stop it going through the cleanup process. If it does go through the process then good access to the browser is impeded, but I'd expect that.
