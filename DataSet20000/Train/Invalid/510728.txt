Only Firefox versions 3.0.13 and 3.5.2 cause movie clips and audio/video file names to be deleted with ForceField.  PLEASE SEE BELOW!

After I installed Firefox 3.5.2 and 3.5.1 (update 3.0.13), I discovered an incompatibility with Zone Lab ForceField that was not present in 3.5.1 (update 3.0.12).  In Firefox 3.5.2 when I downloaded movie clips or audio/video files, Windows was unable to determine what type of file they were, and if I indicated that they should be run with Windows Media Player (my default for this type of file), it took a very long time for them to begin running.  If I closed ForceField, they would automatically run in Windows Media Player.  I thought that perhaps a ForceField file may have been corrupted, so I uninstalled ForceField and then reinstalled it.  However, movie clips or audio/video files would still not automatically run in Windows Media Player when ForceField was on.  Therefore I reinstalled Firefox 3.5.1 (update 3.0.12), and now audio/video files would automatically run in Windows Media Player when ForceField was on.  It appeared that when ForceField was on and movie clips or audio/video files were downloaded, the file extensions associated with the temporary internet files were deleted by Firefox 3.5.2 and 3.5.1 (update 3.0.13) so that Windows could not determine what type of file they were.  Could you please fix this bug in Firefox 3.5.2 so that I can reinstall it?
