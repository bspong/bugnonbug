Download Manager loses downloads if another instance of Firefox is started in windows 7.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; fi; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; fi; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7

Download was in progress. I closed Mozilla but left the download manager on to download a file. Later, I wanted to start browsing again, but clicking the Firefox -icon on the taskbar would only hide and unhide the download manager (due to the new taskbar behaviour in windows 7). Because of this I had to click the Firefox -shortcut on my desktop to start firefox and when it did, the download manager had lost the file it was downloading, instead showing some old, already finished downloads from the previous browsing session.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start downloading a file (Firefox & Windows 7).
2. Close the browser, but leave the download manager on.
3. Start Firefox again trough a shortcut.
Actual Results:  
The downloads on the download manager have been replaced with the downloads from your previous browsing session with firefox.

Expected Results:  
The downloads should have stayed the same.
