Locationbar autocomplete doesn't get opened when Clear Recent History is called before

While sitting on fixing some of the broken Mozmill tests I have discovered this scared issue. When calling removeAllPages right before you open a couple of pages and press the down key while the location bar has the focus the auto-complete popup doesn't get opened. I can only reproduce the described behavior with mozmill. Trying to do those steps manually I don't see it.

Steps:
1. Install Mozmill (https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/9018)
2. Load and run the attached test

When running the test the autocomplete popup will not appear at the end of the test. But commenting out the line "historyService.removeAllPages();" will solve the problem.
