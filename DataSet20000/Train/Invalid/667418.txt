User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build ID: 20110615151330

Steps to reproduce:

Loaded up the following page as normal: http://rad.co.uk/contact/


Actual results:

The email field has a placeholder of Email Address... which firefox flags as invalid because it isn't a valid email address.


Expected results:

There should be no validation on page load, this should only kick in once the user starts editing the field.
