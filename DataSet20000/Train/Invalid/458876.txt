firefox 3.0 conflicts not only with realplayer but also stops realplayer from downloading videos, and also causes problems with flash player. Not to mention also causes system crashes on my pc and i'm running a high end gaming computer with 4 gb of gaming ram and 2 9800 graphic cards in sli and so on.

I would be happy to upgrade again to the 3.0 versions once these problems have been taken care of.
