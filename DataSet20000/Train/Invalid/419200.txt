There are two small-phi letters that are used for different purposes in math:
    (a) curly small letter phi font (known from Latex as varphi)
    (b) a miniaturized capital phi (known from Latex as straightphi)
According to the accepted definition of Unicode (see  e.g.
   "http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr25/#_Toc23")
   &#x3C6; (&#966;) corresponds to (a),
   and &#x3D5; (&#981;) corresponds to (b).
Firefox 2 uses the correct rendering on Windows and on Mac. Minefield renders correctly on Windows, but not on Mac where (a) and (b) are switched. The STIX fonts for mathml display correctly on both platforms. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open on Mac the attached file with Firefox 2: The rendering of the phi is according to the rules of unicode. 
2.Open on Mac the attached file with Minefield: The rendering of phi is switched, except for the STIX fonts.
3.
Actual Results:  
The pair of small phi letters is not rendered correctly according the Unicode specification on MAC by Minefield (except for STIX fonts)

Expected Results:  
The pair of small phi letters should be rendered correctly according the Unicode specification on MAC by Minefield.
