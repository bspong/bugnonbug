Many of us in IT use self-signed certificates, and my online tutorials have been hit tens of thousands of times by commercial and government users worldwide.  Firefox 3 Beta 5 treats them (verbally, the message on the screen) as errors, rather than as bona fide and legitimate uses for openssl by IT professionals, for special purposes, test machines, and limited-audience venues.  Please change the message to be less error-oriented.  Firefox 2.x handled it more appropriately, IMHO.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a web site with a self-signed certificate.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Was presented with "(Error code: sec_error_unknown_issuer)" and irrelevant error-related information.

Expected Results:  
Should have been prompted to the effect that the CA was unknown, and whether or not it ought to be trusted -- this session only, into perpetuity, etc.
