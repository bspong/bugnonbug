Clickable list doesn't work in FF
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I believe that FF should also work with "IE-only-compliant" javascript commands (See the FAQ web page I provided - the questions in the list should show up). Or at least show some warning, that the web page contains FF-incompatible commands and can't be viewed correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the web page
2. Click on any question -> Nothing happens
