Something checked in before 11:00 PM EST on January 17, 2005 has broken TBE. TBE
doesn't work at all now. I suspect some of the Javascript changes but that's
just a wild guess. Moox' build early morning 1/17 doesn't show the problem. I did a
build on a pull late 1/17 and it has the problem. The problem shows up in the
Official 1/18 nightly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install TBE or use a profile that already has it
2.Try to use any TBE features like sidebar in left hand side.
3.

Actual Results:  
TBE doesn't do anything that TBE usually does.
