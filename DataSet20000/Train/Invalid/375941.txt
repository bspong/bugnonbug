When opening various numbers of tabs they tile and a nearly tab sized gap appears between the close button and the tabs making for an odd look. It is important because it's distracting because it's ugly and that space should be used to put an extra tab in.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up enough tabs till they tile.

2. Watch a gap appear between the tabs and the close button on the right.
Actual Results:  
A gap appears.

Expected Results:  
No gap to appear and instead for the space to be filled out with a tab or for the tabs to have more room to lengthen so that you can more easily read their titles.
