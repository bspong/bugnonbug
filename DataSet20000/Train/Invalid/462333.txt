- If I right click there is no option to select language or to spell check.
- There is only an option to install dictionary (which I did with US english and British english) but still nothing changes.
This is happening on two machines now.

This is what I tried:

a. new user and fresh profile
b. no add-ons
c. tried installing dictionaries but it doesn change anything
d. The option to check as I type is selected in the options
e. right click doesn't give you the option to select the dictionary or to spell check
f. reinstalled FF with new user
g. tried with root user
