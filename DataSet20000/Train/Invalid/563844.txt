Well it's just a simple appreciation.

Hello,
Why you can not block some sites to be displayed on your browser, I mean that, the only option I found on the Mozilla Firefox Configuration Dialog about block sites, Is to block sites reported as attackers, First question that comes to me is that How does it work?, Is there any companies looking for attacker Websites or What, and Second and more important, Who are them and why them can decide which pages can I display and which not, and on the other hand why I'm unable to do it (I mean to block sites such as foken yahoo) if I want, Don't you think you're forgetting the old principles of the free software? Make Software which gives the people freedom to make what they want to do and not to subjugate people to what a company or whoever is behind this real threat, want to do or will be capable of do. 
Cheers.
