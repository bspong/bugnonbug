Not sure at what point i went to use arrows on right side of browser screen to scroll down while reading a page. its not there. I checked to see if IE had it still and it does so i have to use my keyboard up and down arrows to read a page useing Firefox wich is my browser preference.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce



Expected Results:  
Getting back the scroll bar on right side instead of useing keyboard arrows.

??? at a loss here !
