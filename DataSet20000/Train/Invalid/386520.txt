Gmail inbox does not display properly with Firefox.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; Media Center PC 4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: 2.0.0.4

Firefox does not properly display my Gmail inbox. Emails are not clickable, nor are they in a list format. The buttons on the side, such as "Inbox", "Sent", "Trash", are not there either. The only form of navigation I do appear to have is on the bottom of the screen. The page appears in mostly text form, as if there has not been any coding done to create some sort of UI.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Mozilla Firefox
2.Load Gmail.com
3.Log in
Actual Results:  
The page displays as described.

Expected Results:  
Displayed the page as it is supposed to be displayed; Internet Explorer does this.

It is obviously the new version of Firefox that creates this problem, as the old version was fine. I have searched both the web site and in Google to find others with the same problem, but have not found anyone, so I assume this problem is rather specific, not general.
