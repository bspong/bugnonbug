cannot set Firefox as default browser using Windows XP Set Program Access and Defaults
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

Even though Firefox can be set as the default browser via its Preferences, this
option does not propagate to Windows XP's _Set Program Access and Defaults_
menu. After having previously made Firefox the default browser, visiting the
SPAD applet shows the default as

[X] Use my current web browser
[ ] Firefox                      [X] Enable Access to this program
[ ] Internet Explorer            [X] Enable Access to this program

Choosing Firefox as the default, then pressing 'OK' yields the message "Setting
default browser" and then opens Firefox. After closing Firefox, then revisiting
the SPAD page, the option remains unchanged.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start -> Control Panel -> Add or Remove Programs -> Set Program Access and
Defaults
2. Custom area -> Choose Firefox as default browser
3. Click OK.

Actual Results:  
Firefox opens, but the option in SPAD remains unchanged.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should not? open, and the option in SPAD should change to reflect that
Firefox is now the default browser for Windows. As a side note, maybe this
option should change in Windows when Firefox is made the default using the
option in its Preferences dialog :)
