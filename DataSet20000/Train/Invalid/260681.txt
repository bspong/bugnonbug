Typed URLs in the location bar will self-delete within 1-3 days.

I believe this problem is not related to the Tools > Options > Privacy > History
setting of "Remember visited pages for the last XX days". True, the clear button
next to History will delete the visited pages and typed URLs in the location bar
but the typed URLs in my location bar are being deleted on their own,
(self-deleted) within 1-3 days after I type them.

Reproducible: Didn't try
Steps to Reproduce:
1. N/A
2.  
3.

Actual Results:  
I can't really reproduce this problem, I just notice that typed URLs are missing
when I click the location bar drop box and sometimes as many as 3 URLs will be
missing but usually just 1 at a time will be gone.  
    
   

Expected Results:  
I beleive that typed URLs should remain in the location bar unless you manually
clear History in the Tools > Options > Privacy > History settings and hit the
clear button.

This same problem occurred when I used Firebird 0.7. I never used 0.8 - 0.9 so I
don't know if this would occur in those versions. 

Perhaps is there a tweak I could make in the (about:config) Preference page?


Thanks,
