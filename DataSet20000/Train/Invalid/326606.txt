This is a virus, infection, or hijacking that is redundant and I can't get rid of it.

Spy Falcon keeps poping up on my screen weather I am on line or not.  It says that Firefox is recommending that I purchase it to rid myself of: Spy Sheriff   Registry  Item name: [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{D1A2E7CD-F5C'; 2Search   Registry   Item name: [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Interface\{03BE31FE-65;  Spy Sheriff   Registry   Item name: [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\\   Item value:  {D1A2E7CD-F5C1-21A8-CA2C-13D0AC72D19D}; and Spy Sheriff   File  C:\WINDOWS\system32\dxmpp.dll                    
I have Norton and Spyware Doctor and Registry Mechanic.  I do not want this unsolicited product!!!  As soon as I uninstall Spy Falcon, it immediately reproduces itself.  Can this not be gotten rid of?  Is this what's known as a hijacking?  This caused my screensaver to disappear and turn into a blue background.  Also it has caused numerous attempts to boot up Mozilla Firefox to come up empty.  I have Firefox because I believed it to be far safer than Internet Explorer.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.  David Weaver
