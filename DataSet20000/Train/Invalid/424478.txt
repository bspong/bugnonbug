Firefox doesn't release memory after all tabs are closed and uses memory very inefficiently
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; FreeBSD i386; en-US; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080229 Firefox/2.0.0.12

I had over 25 tabs open with different sites and Firefox had memory image 770MB.
After I closed all tabs memory usage didn't drop and resident size was 540MB.

I loaded some other large process causing resident size of Firefox to go down below 100MB. But after I opened just one new tab with Google page resident size immediately went up to 470MB and and total memory image even grew to 780MB.

Conclusions:
1. Memory used by pages isn't released when pages are unloaded. Maybe memory is lost.
2. There are some very sparse structures that have high access coverage even when just one new tab is opened.

Firefox has to free memory once it's not used any more.

Why would any objects related to pages stay in memory after I closed all tabs?
