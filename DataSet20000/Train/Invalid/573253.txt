ALOT toolbar somehow got attached to my Firefox browser, and I can't get rid of it.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.375.70 Safari/533.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla Firefox 3.6.3

I downloaded free Open Office, and since then I cannot open Firefox without getting the ALOT toolbar that I did not request and do not want.

Reproducible: Always
