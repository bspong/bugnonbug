When overriding compatibility of any "incompatible" add-on the override compatibility button appears to work but the yellow restart banner doesn't like previous version. Furthermore when FF is restarted the add-ons haven't been enabled, when in the addon manager the override option has gone and been replaced with an enable option however this option has no effect whatsoever.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ensure nightly tester tools add-on is installed
2. Override the compatibility of an incompatible add-on(note lack of yellow banner)
3. Restart browser
4. Enter the add-ons manager to see that the compatibility issue has gone but the add-ons are still not enabled and the enable buttons have no effect
Actual Results:  
Add-ons were not enabled

Expected Results:  
Add-ons should be enabled and working
