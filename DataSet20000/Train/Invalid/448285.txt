I am a web developer. I use createElement and appendChild function to add script tags dynamically in order to load other JavaScript files. I could not get data from those JavaScript file in the DOMContentLoaded event handler. But from firebug, the new added script tags are loaded. The same codes are applicable in Opera browser, so I think it might be a bug for Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a new HTML file and add the follow codes in a script tag.
var newScript = document.createElement("script");
newScript.type = "text/javascript";
newScript.src = "test.js";
var headTag = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0];
headTag.appendChild(newScript);

window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function()
{
    //myNumber is defined in test.js, but Firefox could not get this.
    //Opera can alert the correct data.
    alert(myNumber);  
}, false);
2. Create a new javascript file and put the follow codes in it and save it as test.js.
var myNumber = 100;
3. Open the HTML file in Firefox.
Actual Results:  
Firebug shows that "myNumber is not defined".

Expected Results:  
alert the 100 in the message box as Opera browser does.
