Shiretoko nightly wont resume a paused auto-update download after entering private browsing mode
Auto update wont resume on shiretoko nightly after entering private browsing mode after previously pausing it in a normal session.

Using Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1pre) Gecko/20090523 Shiretoko/3.5pre, I started to auto update to 20090525. 

Midway through I paused the download and entered private browsing mode. 

When in private browsing mode, I clicked resume to which it is now stuck on "Contacting to the update server"....

Steps to reproduce: 

1. Start with a fairly recent shiretoko build and begin to auto update it
2. Begin the update and pause it.
3. Enter PB mode
4. Help -> Check for updates.

Expected Results: Update resumes
Actual Results: Hangs on "Contacting to the update server..."

I have tested this with a new profile. 

In PB mode, is this behavior expected?
