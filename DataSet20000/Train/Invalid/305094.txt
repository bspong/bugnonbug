When FF is open and there are multiple tabs open, minimising the window and then
closing it via Right Mouse Button (RMB) then close causes the close tabs window
to ask for confirmation. On confirmation that you wish to close FF remains on
the taskbar.

* RMB - close again pops up the confirmation window.
* Maximising the window after any number of attempts to close it causes FF to exit.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open FF, Open multiple tabs
2. Minimise FF window.
3. RMB and close from the taskbar
4. Confirm yes to the closing multiple tabs confirmation dialog.

Actual Results:  
FF stays on task bar until the window is maximised again.

Expected Results:  
FF closes cleanly when you say yes on the confirmation dialog.
