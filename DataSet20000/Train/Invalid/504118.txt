Foof left a window jammed on my screen

First foof didn't work. Then the window wouldn't close.
Couldn't figure out how to remove foof, did search & delete
instead, couldn't get it all to delete. Maybe incompatible
with Noscript?
Then my Canon utility cd left in the cd slot did the same 
thing, got a window stuck on my screen that wouldn't close,
had to end & restart Firefox.  Removed the Canon cd, but then
my computer kept asking for the cd back & the window still
wouldn't close. Had to end firefox again! Seems ok now.
