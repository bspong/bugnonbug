Javascript: popup.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla firefox 1.0.3.

When a popup is launched, i have with a function opener this mesage: (when i  
use a function who call a element in the source windows):

"Error: uncaught exception: Permission denied to get property 
HTMLDocument.getElementById.

I think that Firefox lost the address of the parent after the launch of the 
popup because if the popup is not reload that's work fine. The opener property 
specifies the window of the source document and persists across document 
unload in the opened window....but don t work on firefox! 

Mozilla 1.7.7. and I.E. 6.0 work correctly

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.call a popup from a page
2.reload this popup.
3.call in the popup a function who use a element from source page.

Actual Results:  
Don't work
Message : "Error: uncaught exception: Permission denied to get property 
HTMLDocument.getElementById.
