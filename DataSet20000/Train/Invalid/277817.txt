There should be two javascript menus on this page(I know because it's my own site):

1) a javascript menu listing the links, appears not to be there at all. 
2) The main menu, which is there but not working, although it works on other pages. 

The page functions fine in my usual browser (IE 6.0)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just go to the page - one one menu there, which doesnt' work.


Actual Results:  
Main menu doesn't funtion. Links menu not visible.

Expected Results:  
Main menu should function. Links menu should be visible on the page and should
function - check it in IE to see how it should look.
