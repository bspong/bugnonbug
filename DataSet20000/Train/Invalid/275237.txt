I have this button missing problem on Amazon.com submit order page and other
such pages! After some experimentation I found that in the 800 x 600 graphics
mode everything usually works fine, that is buttons and associated graphics show
up, but in smaller modes like 1024 x 768 the buttons just disappear yet moving
the cursor around may make the cursor turn into a hand so you know to click but
you have to know where to look and on new pages you don't know and you just hope
that the button you click on is submit and not cancel!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go into graphic mode numerically higher (physically smaller) than 800 x 600.
2.Go to any website with buttons for update or any other function.
3.The buttons are physically invisible though you may be able to click them by
movie the cursor around until it turns into a hand or some other indicator.

Actual Results:  
Buttons usually work but their graphic does not show up. Also nearby graphics
may not show up! I have screwed up my orders with Amazon due to this mess! Have
been unable to cancel an order, etc.. This is costing me money and likely other
people too shy to admit it. It was a long time before I realized that a lessor
graphics mode would normally make the buttons show back up.

Expected Results:  
All graphics and buttons should load.

I searched for this bug but found nothing just like it though my technical
background does not include all the terms that you people use so maybe someone
is working on it but I can't tell.
