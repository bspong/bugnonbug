I have created my own bookmark folder "Tickets" and created in it a lot of subfolders. If I try to use "Sort By Name" they aren't sorted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a mainfolder for your bookmarks.
2. Create in it a lot of subfolders that are alphabetically unordered then.
3. Right click any subfolder and choose "Sort By Name".
Actual Results:  
The subfolders are unsorted.

Expected Results:  
The subfolders should be sorted by name.
