In the page
http://www.concursosfcc.com.br:8080/concursos/jsp/cadastroWeb/NovoCadastro.jsp
it's impossible to correctly fill the forms with some keys disabled.
Ex: the form dont accept @ where you supposed to put your e-mail adress.
The same page works perfectly on Linux with the same version of the browser.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to fill any information with major caps on the forms
2. Try to put @ on the e-mail adress camp
3. Try backspace in any camp of the form

Actual Results:  
It shows a JavaScrip Application warning "caracter inválido".

Expected Results:  
The keys should be disabled only in some particular camps of the form.
