90% of the time, nothing happens when I highlight and click on a word or phrase previously typed in a dialogue or search box.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type "mountain" (or any other word) in a dialogue box and hit enter. 
2. Delete "mountain" from the diaglogue box.
3. Type "m".
4. "mountain" appears in drop-down box.
5. Select and click on "mountain."


Actual Results:  
Most of the time, nothing. The letter "m" remains in the dialogue box instead of being replaced by the word "mountain."

Expected Results:  
The full word "mountain" should replace the single letter "m".
