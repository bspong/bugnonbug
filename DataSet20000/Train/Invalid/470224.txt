With public fox enabled and password protected a user can still go to about:config and change settings.

I installed public fox to cease a separate user from making firefox changes. It is password protected and the lock about:config box is checked. When about:config is put into the address bar it required a password, but if about:Config, about:CONFIG or similar with case differences was typed you can log on and remove the public fox password or disable it altogether. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run about:config (password required)
2.Run about:Config (password not required)
3.Run about:cOnfig (password not required)
4.Run about:CONFIG (password not required)
Actual Results:  
I can disable the password by removing the string @ exceptions.dlwatch.pass string. Then make exceptions.dlwatch.lock false.

Expected Results:  
Should not be able to open about:config at all.
Should always ask for password.
