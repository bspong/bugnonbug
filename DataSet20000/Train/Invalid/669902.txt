One particular Live Bookmark isn't reloading.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build ID: 20110615151330

Steps to reproduce:

I have subscribed to the following RSS feed:
http://www.comunio.de/external/phpBB2/smartfeed.php?feed_type=RSS2.0&limit=1%20DAY&sort_by=postdate_desc&forum=31&max_word_size=All
This feed appears to be well formed and doesn't have any syntactical errors.


Actual results:

This bookmark never reloads itself. It remains in its original condition. This happens even on a clean Firefox profile wihout any addons.


Expected results:

It should reload after some amount of time as all other live bookmarks do.
