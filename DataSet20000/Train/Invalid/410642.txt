Goto any page with a properly coded data table on it:
http://www.mit.edu/~rjc/htmlTests.tests.html

Move to the table with the Jaws virtual cursor.

Move to a row and read across with control+alt+rightArrow or control+alt+leftArrow - jaws should read column headers as the row is traversed. It does not.

Steps to Reproduce:

2.
3.See above.

Actual Results:

Expected Results:  
See above.
