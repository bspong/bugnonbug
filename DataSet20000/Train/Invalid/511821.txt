Something claiming Firefox Update auto-installed even tho option set to "ask me first"

I have my options on Firefox 3.5.2 set to "check for updates" but to "ask me first" when they are found instead of auto-installing. At approximately 6 PM EST today (Aug 20, 2009),I had Firefox open and suddenly a pop-up window appeared and said "downloading and installing update" a few seconds later it said "update will be finalized the next time you start Firefox" Neither window identified what was being downloaded. Not only was my Firefox already updated, but I have my options set to "ask me first" before installing *any* update -- this option isis set true for all my software, including Firefox, Thunderbird AND any Windows updates.

Was this a genuine update or something else? Either way, why did was my instruction to "ask me first" ignored? I also have current updated versions of AVG anti-virus and Spybot programs running and received no warnings from them when this happened.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. not an event I can attempt to reproduce
2.

Expected Results:  
According to the setting in options, Firefox should have "asked me first" if I wanted to install updates instead of proceeding automatically to download and install whatever it was.

I have been running Firefox for the past year and this is the first time by option to "ask me first" has been bypassed. NOTE: Same thing happened with my Thunderbird installation about 6 hours later.
