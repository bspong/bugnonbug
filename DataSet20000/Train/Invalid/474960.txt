Hi!

Firefox 3 opens GuitarPro tabulature instead of prompting to download or open in GuitarPro application.

This is a major pain in the ass, as the users of my tabulature site are flooding me with the emails about the tabs being broken.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to an URL of a GuitarPro tabulature file
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Firefox opens the tabulature as a mess of characters

Expected Results:  
Firefox prompts for downloading the file or open it in GuitarPro
