Leopard 10.5.2, FF 2.0.0.12

Searching bugzilla for "unicode", "decomposed", "utf", "umlaut" did not produce information about this, so I am creating a new bug.

I am checking in subversion commits using svnX with log messages containing Estonian umlauts. svnX uses command line svn binaries in the background. I am viewing subversion information through everyone's favorite project environment trac, the problem shows up in Timeline and other pages where the log messages are displayed.

svn client uses decomposed unicode characters, I recompiled my svn binary according to this:

There is additional information about Mac Firefox having problems with decomposed Unicode characters already from 2006:

Safari 3 shows everything in question correctly. Curiously, Firefox 3 Beta 4 also shows everything in question correctly. Therefore it seems something in the Firefox font rendering engine has been altered to handle this. But since my whole browsing ecosystem only runs on FF2 for now, it'd be nice to get some information if it's possible to fix this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
View attached HTML page.
Actual Results:  
Umlauts are displayed with an empty box instead of the accent.

Expected Results:  
Normal umlaut display.
