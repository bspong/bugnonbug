a bookmarklet that used to work in ff 1.0.6 now doesn't.

the bookmarks eases working with bugzilla by enabling me to quickly assign a bug
to someone. it prompts for the login name of the assignee, then creates a
default comment, changes the radio button and puts in the login@mycompany and
submits.

it gets the login name via the 'prompt' function.

now, the prompt function doesn't run (i don't get a prompt window) and returns
an empty string (not null, since my code checks for null, to allow cancel).

i would happily sumbit the bookmarklet's code, but because of another bug i
can't open it for editing. 

Reproducible: Always
