Typing with dead keys does not work correctly in GTK2 builds

Firebird built with GTK2 doesn't seem to pay any attention to the definitions of
what dead keys (e.g. "dead_circumflex") set in 
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose (in RedHat 9). Instead it seems to
use some default definitions. Thus "dead_circumflex" + a does produce "â", but
"dead_circumflex" + c does not produce "&#265;" (c with circumflex), although that is
what is defined in "Compose", and although that works in all other (Unicode
capable) programs, and in all non-GTK2 builds of Firebird and Mozilla.
"dead_circumflex" + u produces "û" although I've redefined it to produce "&#365;" (u
with breve) in "Compose" (which works in all other programs, e.g. KDE programs,
and in non-GTK2 builds of Firebird and Mozilla). Other custom keyboard
definitions done with "Xmodmap" do work, e.g. the "dead_circumflex" is on the
key where I put it, but it does not do the things I've defined in "Compose".

I can type the above mentioned special characters if I define them with e.g.
AltGr in my Xmodmap file. Only when they're defined with dead key combinations,
the problem occurs.

This is most probably a problem with GTK2 itself, since I've seen the exact same
problem in a GTK2 build of the text editor Vim. But I thought it needed to be
reported for Firebird as well. Actually as long as this bug is in GTK2 (if there
is where it is) GKT2 builds of Firebird are defective.

Most probably the same bug shows up in GTK2 builds of Mozilla (if there are any
such builds).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make some custom redifinitions of dead keys in "Compose" (make sure they work
in e.g. a Unicode aware console.
2. Try to type the customs characters (e.g. in the URL field) in a GTK2 build of
Firebird


Actual Results:  
The custom definitions where ignored.

Expected Results:  
It should have used my custom definitions just like all other programs do, and
just like non-GKT2 builds of Firebird do.
