A virus using a dutch tool logged and saved all my mozilla firefox saved passwords as well as other programs like messenger] and sent them out. A watermark in one of the virus files lead me to tool-store.info, this is where the tool for stealing the passwords is found.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. get the virus
2. see 1
3. repeat steps 1-3
Actual Results:  
Passwords get sent out, someone else accesses my crap, spreads the virus claiming to be me

Expected Results:  
passwords should be encrypted, and not sent out.

a simple encryption is something along the lines of taking each letter of the password and applying a calculation like: chr((ord(LETTER) - 6)). That is of course EXTREMELY simple, but even that's better than nothing.

Note: flagging severity as critical, "causes you to lose data". This is the logical fallacy of equivocation, being that this is not what you meant at all by that line, but you do lose your passwords.
