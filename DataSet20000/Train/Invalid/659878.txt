URL Autocomplete should not flicker when user keypresses match the autocomplete

Currently, typing letters into the location bar that have already been autocompleted for you causes the autocomplete text to flash rapidly. This is because even though what you typed matches the autocomplete, it updates by removing the autocomplete text and displaying it again.

For example, lets say that you type "fa" into the location bar and Nightly autocompletes it with "facebook.com". If you continue to type "cebook.com", the autocomplete text rapidly flashes. It constantly removes the autocomplete and redisplays it for every single letter that you type. This is very distracting behavior and gives the interface a sluggish feel.

There are two ways to fix this:
1.) Make autocomplete faster so that you can't see the brief period where there's no autocomplete text.
2.) Do not redisplay autocomplete text if it hasn't changed. Simply update the highlight selection.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start typing a URL that you have visited before
2. Notice that autocomplete text flickers when you type more of the URL
