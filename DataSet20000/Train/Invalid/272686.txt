"Sort by name" adds a phantom separator

When using the "Sort by Name" function to sort bookmarks, the bookmark menu
immediately closes.  Upon opening it again, the bookmarks are properly sorted,
but there is a separator at the bottom of the bookmarks.  Going to the "Manage
Bookmarks" feature allows you to add and delete other separators as usual, but
this new "phantom" separator does not appear in the Manage Bookmarks feature and
thus cannot be deleted.  Closing and reopening Firefox appears to solve this
problem.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the "Bookmarks" menu and right-click on any bookmark.
2. Select "Sort by Name."
3. Open the "Bookmarks" menu again.
Actual Results:  
There is an extra separator at either the bottom or the top of the "Bookmarks"
menu.  This separator does not appear in the "Manage Bookmarks" feature.  This
process can be repeated and will spawn a new separator each time.  After sorting
all my bookmarks' sub-folders, I had one on the bottom and about six on the top.

Expected Results:  
There should be no such separator or separators spawned upon execution of the
"Sort by Name" feature.

The separators can be dispelled by closing and reopening Firefox.  I have yet to
find a way to remove them in the program as "Manage Bookmarks" does not see
them, but closing and reopening Firefox should remove all of them.
