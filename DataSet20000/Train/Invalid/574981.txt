multiple problems with titlebar with new theme, esp. w/persona
Clean profile, default theme, Jun 26 Nightly.

First start:

Looks mostly good, though notice that "Go to a new web site", "Google", and the tab favicon have a thick bottom line, like it's being duplicated.  Resizing the window vertically fixed it.  (Also note the background window which is missing rounded top left/top right corners -- I suspect this is tree style tab's fault, though.)

After a persona is installed:

Note that the persona covers up the window buttons in the top right, but they're still there and active -- just being drawn underneath.  Hovering over the close button still makes it glow red, and you can see its right side peeking through.

There's also a 1px thick line on the inside of the window border on the right side of the toolbar -- not sure why this happened, but the window currently thinks that it's in "Tabs on Top" mode.  When I unchecked that, nothing changed except that that line went away.

Real tabs on top with persona:

partially opaque tabs, but translucent toolbar background looks weird, especially the 1px thin border dividing the two.  Also note the alignment issues with the persona and the content area -- the content area is 2-3px wider on either side than the persona, and sticks out.  Also jaggy back button, but I think that's known.
