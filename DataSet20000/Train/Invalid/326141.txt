doing google-lucky-shit despite keyword.enable being false

I have been instructed to set keyword.enable to false in order to avoid the google-lucky-shit. Now, today I wanted to go to some bugzilla site (starting with "bugzilla" in the name), and typed what you see above as "URL", but w/o the trailing slash. Then I accitentically hit the "Enter" key because I have problems typing some times, and with some keyboards even more so. Then this site appeared on my screen and in my location bar: 

http://www.bugz.com/hunter_home.htm


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In about:config, set keyword.enable to "false". Restart browser.
2. Type "http://bugz" in the location bar and hit Enter
3. See the ensuing problem with your own eyes.

Actual Results:  
Redirection happened. I didn't use tcpdump to find out if it was a Google-lucky-thing again, but have no alternative explanation.

Expected Results:  
I'd like to see any one of "Page not found" or "Host not found".

I'm very disappointed about how Google apparently subverts the development of Firefox, and stick to my interpretation that this (and the whole keyword mess) is a significant privacy issue.

Not tagging "Security" since these problems are long known, and I want at least the bug report to stay in the open as a testimony, if nothing else.
