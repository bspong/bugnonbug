3.5b4 does not behave the same as 3.0.10 wrt browser.links settings
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1b4) Gecko/20090423 Firefox/3.5b4 GTB5

Using the following settings:
browser.links.open_external - 3
browser.links.open_newwindwo - 2
browser.links.open_newwindow.restrict - 0
FF 3.0.10 will open a link from an external application (e.g. thunderbird/shredder) in a new tab, but FF 3.5b4 will open a link in a new window.

To recreate: send an email with a link, e.g. http://www.mozilla.org
set the browser.links prefs as above in ff 
Using thunderbird (I used 3.0b3pre, aka shredder), open the email, click on the link.  Using 3.0.10 you get a new tab, in 3.5b4 you get a new window.  

I don't know which is right - the 3.0.10 behavior is certainly preferred by me - but either this is the result of a bug fix or a regression in 3.5b4.

What I'd really like is to be able to differentiate between links that want to open new windows inside FF and external links.  I believe 3.0.10 does this - I allow it to open new windows as needed, but links from outside apps are opened in new tabs with using these settings.  3.5b4 removes this behavior.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open ff, set the following parameters:
browser.links.open_external - 3
browser.links.open_newwindwo - 2
browser.links.open_newwindow.restrict - 0
2. Using thunderbird (or shredder 3.0b3pre) open an email with a link in it, click on the link
3. Observe that 3.5b4 opens a new window, while 3.0.10 opens a new tab
Actual Results:  
3.5b4 opens a new window

Expected Results:  
expected a new tab - same a 3.0.10
