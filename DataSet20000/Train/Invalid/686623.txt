Steps to reproduce:

Under Options -> Privacy -> Settings -> History I cleared the cookies, while leaving active logins alone.


Actual results:

When I restarted Firefox, all of my active logins were gone because they were stored in cookies.


Expected results:

My active logins should have remained even after the cookies were cleared.
