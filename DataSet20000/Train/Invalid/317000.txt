Crash (seg fault) if I try to scroll in file selection dialog/window.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

If I try to scroll in a file selection dialog/window, Firefox 1.5 RC2 and RC3 crashes ("segmentation fault" is output in console).
The file dialogs where the crashed are:
  - Open (File->Open)
  - Upload (HTML form)
  - Download (from web page; select a destination)

The first time the file selection dialog is opened it takes a while (5-10 seconds) during which time the CPU is pinned at 100% usage.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open browser
2. Choose 'Open' from the 'File' menu
3. Try scrolling (via mouse wheel or the scroll bar)
4. Crash immediately

Actual Results:  
Segmentation fault.

Expected Results:  
The file list should scroll down.

I'm using Gentoo Linux.
Kernel 2.6.11.11
GNOME 2.10.2
GTK+ 2.6.10 (I list this version because the file selection dialog seems to be the standard GTK one).

Firefox is the binary from mozilla.org (after being automatically updated from RC2 which was automatically updated from RC1).

I didn't notice this problem on Firefox 1.5 RC1, though I didn't explicitly test it.
The problem is not present in Firefox 1.1.
