No Installation program. When run firefox.exe, get error "The system cannot find the file LIBC05."
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)
Build Identifier: 

The other programs for OS/2 seem to have an installation program.  From what I 
could gather, with Firefox all you're supposed to do is unzip the folder and 
then execute firefox.exe.  When I do that, I get: "The system cannot find the 
file LIBC05."

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download firefox zip file for OS/2 from indicated website.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Execute firefox.exe in an OS/2 command window.

Actual Results:  
Error is reported: SYS1804: The system cannot find the file LIBC05.


Expected Results:  
Firefox browser should have started.
