"CTRL + drag tab" no longer duplicates tab + state, instead opens up new tab with same URL
Since tab animation landed and the new dumb and unwanted behavior of duplicating tabs (bug 675438), the tabs actually don't get duplicated anymore at all.
Instead of tab duplication - the browser now just opens a similar tab. That's absolutely not the same as duplication.
