Internet explorer correctly shows the small thumbnail picture only on the right
hand side.  In firefox, I see a second copy at the top of the page, distorted so
it almost spans the page width.  

Also, in firefox, there are extra erroneous characters, for example

- Governor link is preceded by a '<' symbol
- the "what you can do" title has a tiny little 'v' in the upper left corner of
the W in "what"
