Firefox 3.6 Hijacked by XPSYSCLIENT.DLL
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6

A window popped out in the browser saying that the computer had been infected, and after that, everytime I google for antivirus on google and click on a link redirected the browser to  findservicesonline.com and the page changes all the time.

Redirection of browser happens even under (Private Browsing mode)

No antivirus in the market was able to find the file. I had to manually remove it from my computer because I found it in the startup programs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.google for antivirus
2.click on on of the results
3.Firefox goes to spam website
Actual Results:  
1.google for antivirus
2.click on on of the results
3.Firefox goes to spam website

Expected Results:  
1.google for antivirus
2.click on on of the results
3.Firefox goes real website

I believe someone is exploiting Firefox vulnerabilities with this file and Firefox should always go to website specified, not other spam website.
