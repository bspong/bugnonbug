General problem after installation of upgrade 3.0.1
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; it; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1
Build Identifier: Firefox/3.0.1

After having downloaded and installe the upgrade Firefox 3.0.1, the browser does not recognize any (any!) of the previously installe components or themes. It keeps saying that Firefox must be restarted in order to see the components, but this never happens. This is a major bug!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the upgrade (as suggested by a Firefox message)
2. Loss of every added component or theme
3. Loop: receiving a message to restart the browser, the next time the situation is the same!
