Web Console cleanup: "StopIteration" is not thrown properly in the Web Console storage
In ConsoleStorage.displayStore(), we do "throw new StopIteration()". This will fail (and does in the unit tests if there aren't enough nodes in the output); the correct way to spell this is "throw StopIteration".

Not marking this as post-Firefox 4 since this is a bug (albeit a bug only in code that's unused), not just a refactoring.
