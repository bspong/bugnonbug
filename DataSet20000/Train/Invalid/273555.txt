Browser adds code to prevent site menu entries appearing
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

My menu is meant to include a Downloads link. And it does - view the page
source. However the link fails to appear, even though it has alt text. It does
appear if I view the page in IE and it does appear when I view the copy of the
page on my local computer.

Although the page source appears normal, when I saved the page as a "Web page,
complete" I noticed that among the normal modifications saving a page offline
makes line 23 had had style="display: none;" added, hiding the image.

This bug breaks page display.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit attached URL in Firefox - observe lack of "Downloads" link in the site
menu.
2. Visit attached URL in another browser (only tested in IE) - "Downloads" link
is between Media and Forums.
3. Save as a "Web page, complete" through FF and observe the code that has been
added to line 23 in the process: style="display: none;"
Actual Results:  
"Downloads" link is not shown; presumably due code added to line 23 by browser
(style="display: none;") which is not shown in View > Page Source.

Expected Results:  
Shown "Downloads" in the menu, between Media and Forums. Not inserted extra,
harmful code.
