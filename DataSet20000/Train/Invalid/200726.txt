The image manager window description says "sites from which images are or are
not loaded". This is a bit sloppy. If "load images" is checked you should write
"sites from which images are NOT loaded", if not checked "sites from which
images are loaded". I suggest adding the terminology "whitelist" and
"blacklist", in parenthesis, at the end of the related sentence.
