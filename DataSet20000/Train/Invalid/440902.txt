ALT+S DOES NOT SEND DATA IN VBULLETIN
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404 Firefox/2.0.0.14 ImageShackToolbar/4.4.3

When I hit Alt-S in forums that use vbulletin it drops down my history box. I did a search on the net and found this solution

1. about:config
2. change entry "ui.key.contentAccess" from 5 to 4
3. change entry "ui.key.chromeAccess" from 4 to 5

And that above worked to fix Firefox 2.0 but doesn't seem to be fixing Firefox 3.0. When I hit Alt-S now although I don't get the History dropdown I just get a minor page-down function and my text does not send in the forums.

Could someone please help? This drives me nuts as I browse forums a lot!!

Thanks,
Shaun
