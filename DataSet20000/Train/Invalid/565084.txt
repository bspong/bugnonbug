Clear History on Site Preferences clears cookies exception list.  This is unexpected.

     It appears that I have found a bug in Firefox 3.6.3.  Clearing Site Preferences wipes out my cookies exception list.  This happens regardless of whether I have the setting to accept or reject cookies in general.

     It might be argued that it is not a bug since it is documented with:
"Site Preferences: Site-specific preferences, including the saved zoom level for sites, character encoding, and the permissions for sites described in the Page Info window."

     My argument is that the quoted material is not much for documentation, and that the behaviour violates the Law of Least Astonishment.  Note that the first values have more to do with presentation.  I think that this is a documentation bug.  It is misleading since cookies are an entry in the clearing form.  I think that clearing the cookies exception list should be a separate entry from clearing site preferences.  I lost a few dozen entries because of this.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Check the cookies exception list.  If there is nothing there, put at least one entry there.
2. Clear History specifying Site Preferences only.
3. Check the cookies exception list.
Actual Results:  
After step 1, there will be at least one entry in the cookies exception list.
After step 2, there will be no entries in the cookies exception list which will be seen to be so in step 3.


Expected Results:  
Cookies exception list should not be emptied.
