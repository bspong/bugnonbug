I use earthlink mail program. When I check for mail it gives the message 0 mail
received (errors). I can access my mail through Web Mail. Using Internet
Explorer I can access my earthlink mail program/client.  Started happening three
days ago. It may have been after I downloaded and installed a Firefox add-on,
don't know which add-on. Could not use Firefox Browser to transfer money using
Western Union yesterday. Changed to Internet Explorer and was able to do the
transaction. "Connection Refused"--why

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Check for email using Earthlink mail client and it cannot access
ftp.earthlink.net--connection refused.
