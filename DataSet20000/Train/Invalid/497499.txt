In 3.5 beta 4 there is no cookie site interface, so you can't edit the cookie site list of sites.

Note this is not the individual cookies, but rather the list of all sites allowed or disallowed to set cookies.

The functionality has been removed in 3.5 needs to be put back in. 

Reproducible: Always
