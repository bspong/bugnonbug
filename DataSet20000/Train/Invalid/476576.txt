Firefox freezes REGULARLY after update from Ubuntu 8.04 to 8.10
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008121623 Ubuntu/8.10 (intrepid) Firefox/3.0.5

After the ubuntu update I notice REGULAR Firefox freezes.

The network environment is identical. Firefox freezes on all kinds of websites. 

During the freeze, which may take a couple of minutes no other Firefox windows or tabs in a window can be used.

In the beginning I noticed the freezes in regard to GMAIL usage. But even without GMAIL Firefox freezes quite frequently.

This error did not exist before the update from Ubuntu 8.04 to 8.10 .



Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Firefox freeze

Expected Results:  
No freeze

As a software developer myself, it seems there is a general problem in the Firefox design.

Individual websites should not be able to create a freeze of all existing displayed Firefox windows or tabs.
