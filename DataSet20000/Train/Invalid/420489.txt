Read-only location bar for popups says "Search Bookmarks and History" at first
I noticed today when clicking a mailto: link in GMail to open a new message compose popup, that when the window first showed "Search Bookmarks and History" in the read-only location bar until the actual URL got filled in. It also wasn't greyed out. Shouldn't that text only be shown for location bar fields which are actually editable?
