FireFTP explorer displays wrong icons for files in the local explorer everytime  the name of the file itself or the name of its parent directory contains special characters (like we do in French). It gives the icon of a directory instead of icon of the type of file defined by the extension of the filename.
Nevertheless, this does not affect the process of publishing or downloading files, which works properly with filenames containing special characters – providing everything is in Unicode.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use FireFTP
2. Have filenames and foldernames with special charactes (like français or dépliant)
3. Observe the icon at the left of filenames in the local explorer



This does not affect the function of the programm
