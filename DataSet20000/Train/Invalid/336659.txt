The URL link is to a page with a 50x50 table of the same small (94 b) PNG image. The page renders very slowly, and acts as though it downloads the image repeatedly. However, there is no network traffic during most of this time. The processor on my box is pinned at 100% while this page loads and renders. IE renders the page at a very fast rate.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the URL mentioned in this report.
2. See how long it takes the page to complete loading.

Actual Results:  
Slow render time, of about 10 seconds.

Expected Results:  
Much faster render time (page is not complex, and the image is in cache)
