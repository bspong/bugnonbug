When I try to run a local web application I see the following error on screen. -2146893039 (0x80090311)

I was initially asked for a username and password via a login prompt but when I made my best guess the number above appeared.

I have tried stopping and starting my local webserver.  I also stopped and started IIS.  Neither have removed the problem.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
login screen to local web application
