Every morning my screen has a website consisting of Japanese warriors. All the writing is all Japanese or Chinese. Not sure which.  I have tried to block it, but it keeps coming back up. Usually if the computer is idle for a while. It comes from Mozilla Firefox.  I can't find any other web site to respond to.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.When the computer is idle
2.just moving the mouse from the screen saver
3.
Actual Results:  
It will appear from nowhere, I think it is some kind of game. I don't play games on my computer.

Expected Results:  
How do I get rid of it? Or keep it from just showing up on my screen?

I have looked all over the site when it comes on my screen for some kind of clue as to where it comes from. I can't read Japanese or Chinese and that is all there is on the site, except for it using this (Mozilla Firefox) browser.
