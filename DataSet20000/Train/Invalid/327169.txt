Dear mainteiners,

My firefox did not show the google-talk menu. BUT, when I simple deleted the files:
~/.mozilla/firefox/5f11658h.default> rm bookmarks.bak
~/.mozilla/firefox/5f11658h.default> rm bookmarks.html

And reload the page, the google talk appear!

I tried to import again the bookmark, and the googletalk stoped again.

I can do this over and over, always the same: I need to choose if I want my bookmarks, or if I want to see who is online in googletalk.

What strange link is in this?

Thank you your attention,
Beco.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox with you bookmarks
2.Open gmail
3.There is no google-talk
4.Close Firefox
5.Delete the bookmarks.html and .bak
6.Reopen it with gmail
7.There it is: google-talk is working!

Actual Results:  
The exact problem I told: no google-talk working with bookmarks...

Expected Results:  
Maybe this is an obvious question, but answering it: I do believe that I could have my bookmarks and yet use google-talk. So, the software should do not stop this "frame" just because I have bookmarks. ;)

The same happens with mozilla. :-O !
