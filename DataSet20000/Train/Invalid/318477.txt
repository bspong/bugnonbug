I updated my Firefox browser yesterday and I found that the RSS-feed icon that is supposed to show up on designated pages were missing. Instead I now have a safety-lock icon in it's place(which I know I've seen there before but prior to updating Firefox I really can't remember the last time I saw it there).

Reproducible: Always




Additionally I have the GMail notifier icon down right. I also have an extension called 'Signature' which I plan on uninstalling for now, since it isn't compatible with 1.5, which also resides next to the safety-lock icon.

I also have these extensions up in the toolbar:
Googlebar, Stumbleupon, WebDeveloper, and del.icio.us.

Other 'regular' extensions: PDFdownload, Foxytunes (with 1 skin), Colorzilla (left side), Tabbrowser Prefs, Talkback and DOM Inspector. (I have no idea if this is at all helpful).
