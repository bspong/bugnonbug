FF 2.0 does not offer SSL 2.0 support which much existing infrastructure requires
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

FF 2.0 for Linux no longer offers SSL 2.0 support.  Only 3.0 and TLS 1.0 are supported.  Much existing web infrastructure still uses and requires SSL 2.0 so we are unable to access these services using FF 2.0.  Recommended solutions such as found here: http://ffextensionguru.wordpress.com/2006/10/24/firefox-20-ssl-2-tweak/

do not work as SSL 2.0 still does not enable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. access any site that only supports SSL 2.0
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Firefox issues a dialog box saying it cannot connect to the site because an unsupported security protocol is required.

Expected Results:  
It should have connected in https mode using SSL 2.0 protocol

It is perhaps premature to disable SSL 2.0 support since many server infrastructures are not yet upgraded to SSL 3.0 or are even capable of that upgrade.  Is it possible to deploy a scheme that will use 3.0 if the server supports it but seemlessly fall back to 2.0 if 3.0 is unavailable?
