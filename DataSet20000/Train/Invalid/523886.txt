Firefox does not import Safari home page during File -> Import
Firefox does not import your home page preference from Safari when doing the File-> Import.  This does work for the initial migration request as part of the first startup with a new profile.  The File->Import home page migration has not worked in a long time.  Marcia and I tested this on 3.6B1, 3.5.3, and 3.0.0.14.  All on Mac IS X.  I did not test this from other browsers like Opera or Netscape.

User agents I tried and failed on:
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.2b1) Gecko/20091019 Firefox/3.6b1

Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3

Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.14) Gecko/2009082706 Firefox/3.0.14

STR: 
1. Set bugzilla (or any page of your choice) as your home page on Safari
2. Make sure no instance of Firefox is running and delete your profile
3. Start Firefox and select import nothing
4. Using File-> Import command, import all data from Safari into Firefox
3. Click on the home button or check your homepage in Preferences and see that bugzilla is not there

Expected result: 
    Bugzilla to appears as you home page
Actual result: 
    The Firefox start page is your home page (http://en-US.start2.mozilla.com)
