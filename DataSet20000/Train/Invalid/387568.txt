If the "Remember form history" option is turned off in IE 6 (which it is by default), then when you import from IE 6 into Firefox, your existing *Firefox* form history is eliminated.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Install Minefield nightly on Windows XP with IE 6 installed.

1. Open IE on a fresh Windows XP system
2. Tools->Internet Options, Content Tab, Click on AutoComplete button
3. Ensure the "Forms" checkbox is *unchecked*. This is the default setting, so it should be.
4. Close IE and open Minefield
5. Go to www.google.com and enter a few searches that all start with the same letter, for instance "h".
6. Go back to www.google.com, type an h in the search textbox, note that you see your previous searches that began with the letter "h".
7. File->Import and choose to import from IE.
8. Ensure all import options are checked.
9. After the import, go to www.google.com.
10. Type an "h" in the search text box.  Note that there are no suggestions, the form history is gone.
Actual Results:  
The Form history is eliminated after the import.  Note that if the Internet Explorer "Form History" setting is activated (the checkbox in step 3 is checked) then the Form History from IE is successfully merged with the existing Minefield Form history.

Expected Results:  
The Minefield form history should not be eliminated after the import.

In Firefox 2.0.0.4, you have to also manually enable the Form History option.  But once that is enabled, you can run the same test case as above and you will see the same problem.

I used the release version of Firefox 2.0.0.4: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/2007051502 Firefox/2.0.0.4
