xsl transformation fails if xsl file is specified as a remote file on some URL
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.0.7

using the following statement in the xml file thats needs to be transformed:

<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="http://host.domain.com/xsl/report.xsl"?>

The the transformation does not get applied at all resulting in a completly trashed output. If the same xsl file is local or in a relative path the transformation works fine. Also verified that the browser is able to independently access the xsl file from the http://host.domain.com/xsl/report.xsl URL.
Internet explorer 6 correctly renders the xml.
This is a major issue when we need to place the xsl on a remote location due to continuously changing paths.
In case this is an error on my part, request that you please advise what I am doing incorrectly. Thanks

Reproducible: Always
