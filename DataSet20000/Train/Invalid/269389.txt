Warning from Symantec re Mozilla trying to access the Web; incorrect import of favourites

At start of installation Symantec/Norton recommended blocking of Godzilla
attempt to access the Web; however, it also recommended automaticaly configuring
internet access! I don't understant the contradiction. Wnet ahead anyway. 

Found that Firefox had incorrectly imported favourites from MS Explorer. Omitted
some that were favourites, and included others that weren't.
