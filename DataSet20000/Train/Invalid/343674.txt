[Mac] Default favicon and close button look similar and make tabs look cluttered
Tabs on Mac look pretty horrible in the bon echo builds. There are three issues that leap out at me. 

1. with the addition of the tab close button, the tab now has two very similar icons when loading an empty page or a page without a favicon. The grayed out close button and the default globe favicon give the tab a cluttered appearance and confusing target for selecting/closing. 

2. the blue border for selected tabs often doesn't match the actual tab dimensions and looks very bad. 

3. with the new tab scrolling behavior, a tab can be cut off by the scroll button. Tabs should not be truncated like this. We should either show the whole tab, or move it out of view and resize up the remaining tabs. 

Screenshots coming.
