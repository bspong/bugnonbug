©1998-2007 Contributors. All Rights Reserved. Firefox and the 
                                 Firefox logos are trademarks of the Mozilla Foundation.  All rights 
                                 reserved. Some trademark rights used under license from The 
                                 Charlton Company.

expected results:
no mentions of Firefox nor Charlton. For people who are curious, in some jurisdictions it seems we're using the word Firefox under license from them.

This bug is not critical, however I believe we should fix it, as it does bother my licensing feelings.

I'm doing two other things in my initial patch:
1. per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved - I'm removing the sentence from each about instance.
2. I'm adding a slot for an extra trademark bit. I didn't know about Charlton, but conceivably it should be possible for a Gecko application to want add a trademark license to it and all brandings, I'd rather they not have to do this work later.

I'm asking for reviews from mitchell and gavin. I'm hoping not to need to get extra reviews for each application, however if people object or are concerned, I can push for firefox now and the others later.
