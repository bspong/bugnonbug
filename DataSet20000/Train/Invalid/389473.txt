Right-Click Context Menu for a Folder
To set a folder as your new toolbar folder, you need to

1. Open up a Bookmarks Manager.
2. Select a folder.
3. Go to Edit in top menu and select "Set as Bookmarks Toolbar Folder".

Even though this isn't a widely used function, would it be useful to add this option to the right-click context menu for folders?
