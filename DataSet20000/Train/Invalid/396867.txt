When I do not use FF long time and leave it opened OS unload application to swap.
When I start using it FF is loaded back from swap tooooooo long ~10min.
Task manager (CTRL+SHIFT+ESC) shows that 'Memory usage' grows from 7Mbyte to 300Mbyte and this process long enough and some times this is hard to switch to another application while this unswapping in progress.
procexp.exe utility for XP shows that 'Page Faults' grows rapidly for a short period of time

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open FF with 10-15 pages opened (~300Mbype of Virtual Memory + 100Mbyte system memory)
2. Run some application that intensively uses system memory, so FF will be unloaded to swap
3. Do not use computer long time, for example leave it from evening to morning. I lock computer (Win+L)
4. Alt+Tab to FF next day
Actual Results:  
FF unswaps too long and some times hungup system for a long time

Expected Results:  
fast unswaps. May be you must rewiev memory managment
