Although the default theme shows a disabled state in its icon when the row of scrollable tabs reaches the far left end, the disabled condition is not passed to where a third-party theme can make use of it.

When one uses DOMi to inspect the scrollbuttons when they are in a disabled state, the right scrollbutton shows disabled=true when one inspects it in a new window. However, when the left scrollbutton is inspected in a new window while it is in a disabled state, the disabled condition is not displayed.

Although the default theme shows a disabled left arrow, when the left scrollbutton is inspected in a new window, no disabled state is present.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Build a third-party theme with the current default scrollbox.css file
2. Install it in Firefox.
3. With Firefox open, make enough tabs to require scrollbuttons.

Actual Results:  
The left scrollbutton does not show a disabled state.
The right scrollbutton does show a disabled state.

Expected Results:  
Both scrollbuttons should show a disabled state.

When scrollbox.css is transplanted unchanged from the default theme to a third party theme the disabled state does not appear.

Even though the left and right codes are identical except for filenames, the right scrollbutton shows a disabled state where the left scrollbutton does not.

The visual appearance is reflected in the code apparent in DOMi.
