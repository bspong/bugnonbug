Site button colors should match larry icon colors

The green color in the location bar doesn't match the green of the Larry icon on Mac OS X. They seem to be different shades, which looks weird.

The blue also seems off, but less so.

(Not sure if this is a dupe, but johnath said to file, so dupe away!)
