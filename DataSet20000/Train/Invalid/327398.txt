In Firefox 1.5, Bookmarks Manager shows the contents of the Bookmarks toolbar as a folder named "Bookmarks Toolbar Folder".  Expanding this folder allows users to manage the links that appear on the bookmarks toolbar.

In Places, there is no analogous virtual folder for managing the links that appear in the Places toolbar.  Since the toolbar itself is not keyboard-navigable, the only way to add an item to the Places toolbar is with drag-and-drop, and the only way to remove an item is to use the mouse to right-click and select "Delete".
