Javascript Confirm appears to not work correctly in FFX 2.0.0.12

I noticed while trying to reinstall Joomla (www.joomla.org) version 1.0.14... On Step 1 where inputting database info you can not proceed.  The Javascript ends with a confirm(bla bla bla) function call... and the confirm dialog never shows up... it did in prioir Firefox version and does in IE7.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Joomla 1.0.14
2.Proceed thru installation until you get to the screen with the database info... 
3.Fill in the correct DB info then try to press the Next >> button in the upper right
4.Nothing appears to happen... It should show a confirm dialog asking if all the info is correct then allow you to either go on or not



May be a simpler test to verify.  Also can not uninstall components or other things in Joomla now which have a similar confirm() call in their javascript
