Firefox keeps freezing when opening it.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.0

Whenever I open firefox, it freezes. I cannot use the browser anymore

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. 
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
The browser freezes. After restarting the computer, restarting firefox, 
uninstalling and reinstalling firefox, it still does not work

Expected Results:  
Fix the problem of the browser freezing so I can use firefox again. This 
problem has never occured before. 

One of the most noticeable differences in the browser before I click any 
buttons is that my searchbox size adjuster extension is not there anymore and 
the size of the searchbox is the same size as without the extension. The 
adblock icon is no longer there also. The toolbar buttons and the location bar 
is also frozen. The crashing first started as a very rare occasion. However, 
it has gotten to the point that I cannot use it at all anymore.
