Firefox fills system memory after staying open

Immediatly on open, firefox takes 45ish MB of ram. In the next couple of seconds, it builds up to over 100MB [took 30 seconds for me, watching task manager] and will hover around that level. After browsing a while, it continues to grasp more and more ram, until there is no more to take. I notice my ram meter reading 94% full, so I bring up the task manager. Sure enough, there it is holding 432,884K of  ram. Possibly a potential security flaw, if the 'memory leaks' [as I call them, perhaps due to lack of better words] are exploitable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox.
2. Browse.
3. Watch RAM usage.

Actual Results:  
Ram at 97% full. Killed firefox.exe, drops to 65%. [I have 1024MB of RAM]

Expected Results:  
Not eaten my ram. ;)
