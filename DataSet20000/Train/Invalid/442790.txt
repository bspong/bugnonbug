There seems to be a problem with some of the Tools=>Options...
some options get automatically re-checked if they where unchecked!
i can't say how it happens because i don't see any "reactivating-order", like after every restart of the pc or when browsing a specific site. it happens happens from time to time for me with no plausible reason.

these options reactivate automatically:
"Remember passwords for sites"
"keep History at least xx days"
"Remember what i have downloaded"
"Remember what i enter in forms and the search bar"
"Enable Java"

i usually have all these options disabled and i use the latest anti-virus/firewall software.

but because of the types of the options that keeps getting reactivated this looks to me like a security hole which might be used through some other script by websites to activate the java-engine and get sensible data like passwords.
please have a look at this. thx.
