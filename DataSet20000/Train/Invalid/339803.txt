When right clicking on a folder in the main bookmarks list the first option in the context menu is "Open in Tabs".  Clicking on this won't open that folder in tabs.

Yet, if I click on the "Open in Tabs" entry at the bottom of the listing of bookmarks in that folder - Open in Tabs functions normally.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Left click on Bookmarks
2. Right click on a folder
3. Select "Open in Tabs" on the main context menu
4. Nothing happens

5. In the submenu that opens (with all the bookmarks for that folder visible) click on the "Open in Tabs" item at the bottom of that menu.
6. Firefox then opens the full folder of tabs normally.

Actual Results:  
Firefox didn't open the tabs that I wanted open

Expected Results:  
I expected all of my bookmarks to open in tabs in the current Firefox window

This occurs on several of my systems and occurred within the last 2 or 3 updates.
Could be related to another bug report that I intend to submit where the "Open in Tabs" selection only opens a few bookmarks and then stops at a bookmark that points to a file on my local system.
