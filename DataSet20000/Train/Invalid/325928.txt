Since Firefox upgraded itself to version 1.5.0.1 it fails to connect to ANY internet site. Version 1.4 worked fine, and I already downgraded it once few weeks ago, after experiencing similar problems.
But now I can't find a 1.4 firefox download anywhere.
Any request for a www.site hangs with "loading" animation.
My IE and netscape work fine.
I am also unable to kill firefox tasks in the Task Manager.
