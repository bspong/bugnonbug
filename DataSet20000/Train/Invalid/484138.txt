When creating an XUL addon and attemtping to use the menuitem.style.backgroundColor property, no color change is noticed in the menuitem you have obtained.  This property does not work in javascript or in XUL. It still works properly in FF2.

Reproducible: Always




I am the developer of the sportsFox addon.  You can try the addon in FF2 and FF3 to notice the change in behavior. I change the foreground and background colors of the menuitems depending on your favorite teams you selected in the "options".
