After you initially check the'unless I have removed cookies set by this site',
any sites whose cookies you delete BEFORE exiting options are not added as
blocked to the exceptions list.

....For all subsequent visits to Options-->Privacy-->Cookies the setting causes
deleted sites/cookies to be blocked

Note: Leave 'unless I have removed cookies set by this site' checked, close
options and repeat 1,3&4 again, and now deleted cookies ARE set to block in the
exceptions list.
