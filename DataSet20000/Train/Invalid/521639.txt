Given by a report in mda.firefox we have a regression in our tabbar when Tabmixplus is installed. It started between Firefox 3.5.3 and Firefox 3.5.4 build 1. The following items are misplaced (see the screenshot):

* The new tab button is positioned at the most left side of the tabbar (left side of the scroll button if that one is visible)
* The close button of each individual tab is missing but shown as a combined button at the end of the tabbar.

A regression test on 1.9.1 nightlies turned out that bug 513394 is the culprit. Since its landing those items aren't shown in their original order anymore. That behavior is visible on all branches.

CC'ing some people so we can find out if it's our problem or something in the extension. If it's our fault other extensions could be involved too.
