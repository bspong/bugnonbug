Normally, changing the theme in Windows Vista is not possible due to restrictions placed on this by Microsoft. However, after some tweaking, it's very possible to use different themes or visual styles in Vista. If this is done, the default GUI of Firefox 3 will break (not majorly, but a little bit). Screenshot: http://img117.imageshack.us/img117/5977/firefox2ej6.jpg (note the non-rounded favicon sections highlighted in red, and the dividing lines highlighted in green). I know this is unofficial and obviously unsupported by Microsoft (and Mozilla) but I thought I'd bring it up. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Unofficially change vista's theme (http://www.tweakvista.com/Article39144.aspx) and restart Firefox.
Actual Results:  
The default GUI will break slightly.

Expected Results:  
Nothing.

I realise seeing as this is not official, it may not be high on your list of priorities, but you might want to have a look at it anyway.
