I have my browser set to accept cookies, but ask me every time whether I want to accept a cookie or not. More often than not, even if I'm quick to accept the cookie, the page will remain unloaded, and I have to hit reload for the page to appear. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set cookie pref to "Ask me every time"
2. Go to a site that sets one or more cookies
3. Accept the cookie 
Actual Results:  
After accepting the cookie, the browser seems to stop loading any parts of the page - the browser window remains white, the status bar still says "Loading xyz.com", and never actually finishes loading.

Expected Results:  
Page should have continued/completed loading.
