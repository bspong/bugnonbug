Options > Privacy > Download Manager History:
"Remove files from the Download Manager: [ Upon successful download | When
Firefox exits | Manually ]"

Options > Privacy > Cookies:
"Keep Cookies: [ until they expire | until I close Firefox | ask me every time ]"

These use different terminology for the same thing - "When Firefox exits" vs.
"until I close Firefox". They also approach the same thing from opposite angles
(how long to keep X vs. when to get rid of it).

To make the two sections more consistent, I propose the Download Manager History
section be changed to:
List files in the Download Manager: [ until they are successfully downloaded |
until I close Firefox | until I remove them manually ]

This section should be changed rather than Cookies because there's no obvious
"Remove cookies..." equivalent for "ask me every time" (the current wording's a
bit dodgy anyway; using "remove cookies" would make it worse).

I suggest "list" instead of "keep" because the files themselves aren't actually
kept in the Download Manager - the tech-illiterate could be confused by this.
