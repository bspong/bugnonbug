Make nsINavHistoryResultViewObserver only for nsINavHistoryResultTreeViewer
The current generic result viewer interface has addViewObserver and removeViewObserver which takes a nsINavHistoryResultViewObserver interface. However, this observer interface is very much specific to tree views. This observer stuff should be moved to the nsINavHistoryResultTreeViewer interface.

This should require almost no code changes since the tree viewer inmplements both of these interfaces.
