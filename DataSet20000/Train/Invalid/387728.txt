When I set browser.tabs.tabMinWidth to either 1 or 0, I expect that tabs will scroll only when they are less than 0 or 1 pixels wide (i.e. never -- I'm trying to disable the feature). 

Instead, when I set browser.tabs.tabMinWidth to either 1 or 0, the tabs start to scroll off the side of the screen once I open up 20 windows or so (when the tabs are about 40 pixels wide). 

I quit and restarted firefox after changing the setting. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. about:config and set browser.tabs.tabMinWidth to 0
2. Restart Firefox.
3. Open a bunch of tabs. On my screen, "a bunch" is about 20 or 25. 

Actual Results:  
Tabs scroll off the side of the screen, so that only 20 tabs are visible at once.

Expected Results:  
All 25 tabs should have been displayed, with each one being very skinny.
