Received advice of enquiry from an Italian member of alibaba & result contamination of the firefox URL.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4

Deleted software entirely and reloaded latest firefox, exact same problem, begins playing a message in mandarin + background music. That is immediate to open firefox not selecting any specific url.

Deleted all I can find in folders reference Firefox but same problem when download again, immediate play of message

all the best <dsshearer@gmail.com>

Seems to me Alibaba has an integrity problem.

Look forward to your advice before reporting the the Propaganda Department in Beijing

kind regards

The member message from Italy should not be the problem, suspect invasion of Alibaba!
