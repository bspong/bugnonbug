The default browser reverts back to IE6 when clicking on the Firefox icon and opening JUNO.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040626 Firefox/0.9.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040626 Firefox/0.9.1

This is after the default browser has been verified set for Firefox.  The
problem occurs from cold boot and appears to be intermittent.  I'm running the
latest updates on IE6 and WIN-2k,SP4.  Could opening JUNO impact the default
browser setting?

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start system and log on as admin, set def browser to Firefox and check operation.
2. Start system and log on as user, set def browser to Firefox and check operation.
3. Open Firefox with auto exe to JUNO and observe that IE6 might have become
default browser.

Actual Results:  
Frequently, the system reverts to IE6 as default, but only after cold boot.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should remain as default browser.
