I upgraded to the latest build of Firefox and now I cannot connect to any sites 
with it at all.  I have tried over a dozen sites and none of them load.  I get 
the message "my.yahoo.com could not be found.  Please check the name and try 
again."  The previous build worked flawlessly right up until I did 
the "upgrade."

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.enter website address in address bar
2.hit enter
3.get error message

Actual Results:  
exactly the same thing every time.  whatever site I attempt to connect to I get 
an error message that says "<blank>.com could not be found.  Please check the 
name and try again."

Expected Results:  
Loaded the site entered.
