Set network.protocol-handler.external.mailto to false and Firefox will stop handling mailto: links at all
I understand, that this might be specifics of the internal Firefox architecture, that it recognizes some it's part that handles mailto: links if webmail is used to handle them (Menu>Tools>Options>Applications>mailto: choose gmail/yahoo/etc.), but as a user I see Firefox and all it's internals as a single program.
I wanted to set mailto: protocol association in windows to use Firefox, but since the bug 678767 appeared, - there is no mailto: protocol in the list of supported protocols for Firefox program in "Default programs", so I thought that maybe I needed to set network.protocol-handler.external.mailto to false to make Firefox tell Windows that it can handle mailto: protocol.
I did so, but I didn't get what I expected, plus Firefox stopped handling mailto: links AT ALL.
