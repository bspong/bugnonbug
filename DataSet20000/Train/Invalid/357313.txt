With normal Anchor links (HTML), I can open a link in a new tab by clicking it with the middle mouse button.  With XHTML, the anchor tag has been removed and now uses other tags for this by adding the 'href' attribute to it such as <p href="http://....../index.html">text</p>.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open an XHTML 2.0 document
2. Middle click a link that uses the XHTML 2.0 format for links (<p href=..)

Actual Results:  
Selects the link and enables the scrolling feature.

Expected Results:  
Opened the link in a new tab
