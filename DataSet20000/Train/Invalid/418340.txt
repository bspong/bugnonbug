On a page served over HTTPS which doesn't have a favicon, the owner from the certificate is displayed in the green favicon box.

Reproducible: Always

1. Navigate to https://sourceforge.net/
2. Wait for it to load.
3. Look at favicon.
Actual Results:  
VA Software Corporation (US) is displayed where the favicon should be.

I'm not sure if this is a bug or a feature, but I don't like it.
