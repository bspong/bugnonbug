Links suddenly stop changing color when visited

I'm browsing a web site, say reddit for example. I click a link to go to a story and read it.  I click the Back button to go back when done.  Normally, this causes the visited link to change colour from blue to purple.  At some point in every session, this stops happening.  Links previously showing as purple remain so, but links visited after the problem starts remain blue.  Closing the browser and restarting it fixes the problem, temporarily.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse a site that contain internal links that are styled in the normal way, with unvisited links being blue and visited links being purple.
2. Keep trying links until the problem occurs (sorry).
3. Profit.
Actual Results:  
Eventually, returning to a page containing a link that was just visited shows the just-visited link as not visited.

Expected Results:  
Visited links should appear as visited.

This is new behaviour with Firefox 4.  In other words, even doing all the same things, I never saw this behaviour in Firefox 3.  In Opera, sure, but not in Firefox.
