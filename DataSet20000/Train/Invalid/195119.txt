Mozilla and Netscape ask to be your default browser if "Alert me if other
applications change these settings" is checked under System preferences. This
makes for an annoying situation when you are running all 3 browsers.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go into Preferences, Click the + next to Advanced, click System
2. Make Phoenix the default for HTML files and HTTP connections and check "Alert
me if other applications change these settings". CLick OK.
3. Close Phoenix and try running Mozilla or Netscape. They will now ask to be
your default browser.

Actual Results:  
Mozilla and Netscape will ask to be your default browser even though you made
the setting in Phoenix.

Expected Results:  
Maybe the registry key for all 3 browsers is in the same place? If so, maybe
Phoenix should change where it dumps registry keys so all 3 browsers can get along.
