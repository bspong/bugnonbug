I just upgraded to FF1.5, and have FF set as my default browser in Windows.

Now every time I try to use Google desktop search (build 0050818-en) my Windows Explorer crashes, and then Dr Watson crashes immediately after. 

Crash seems to happen as Google desktop is populating a FF tab with search results.

FF remains active, as do any other open programs, but the Windows taskbar, start menu etc locks up and becomes inoperable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. type search term into Google Desktop search panel in taskbar
2. hit return


Actual Results:  
Windows Explorer crash - this only started happening after inastall of FF1.5

Expected Results:  
FF to load desktop search results page
