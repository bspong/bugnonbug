Editing the address on tabs in 1 fast click step instead of 3 click steps.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: Firefox 1 Final

I open links in new tabs then I must modify the address on the new opened tab 
because the link is of a redirected address so I click STOP the click on the 
address the entire address is selected then click again on the middle of the 
address where I wana modify the address, then I need to click again on the 
address then drag to the begining of the address to select that portion to 
delete it, then I can click on Go or press Enter to open the webpage.
The problem is that I need to click 3 times on that address to can edit it, 
when it can be done with one single click if Firefox it will be modifyed to 
work like this:
1. When I click on middle of the address to modify it, the address should be 
selected from the begining till the point I click on it (this time select the 
address from the begining to the middle) so the next thing I can do next is to 
press Delete to erase the unwanted redirect than I can open the webpage. And 
only if I click on the end of the address the entire address from the tab 
should be selected.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Middle click on one link in a webpage to open an address in a new tab.
2. Selecting the new tab then click STOP and begin to edit the address that 
shows like this http://cz11.clickzs.com/tgp.php?
spsh&http://galleries./19/9/n/index.html
3. First 1 click on the address selects the entire addres. Second 2 click 
deselect the entire address and point the editing cursor where you wana edit 
the address. The 3 click is needed to select the address from the point you 
have click on 2 click to the begining of the address, then you can press Delete 
to edit the address then press Enter to open it.
4. This address: "http://cz11.clickzs.com/tgp.php?
spsh&http://galleries./19/9/n/index.html" shows like 
this: "http://galleries./19/9/n/index.html" after the editing process.

Actual Results:  
It needs to many point and click actions to edit the address in the address bar.

Expected Results:  
The 3 clicks could easily be packed in 1 one single click, as I mentioned 
above. When I click on the address not the entire address should be select but 
only from the begining of the address to the point I click on the addres should 
be selected so I can press then on Delete to edit the address then open it (in 
this example from the begining to the middle of the address). The entire 
address should be selected only If I click to the end of the address.
