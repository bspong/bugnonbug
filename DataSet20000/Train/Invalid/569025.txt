Apparently I'm giving up on Firefox.  My Mozilla toolbar stopped showing my "edit, view, etc" section and I have a Yahoo toolbar that, to change, I'm supposed to go to the toolbar that I haven't got.  I've been using Mozilla for years.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

The bug prevents me from being able to copy anything on the net as I cannot get to that menu item.  There is no toolbar menu.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Turn on the computer
2.Go to Mozilla Firefox.
3.Look for a menu toolbar
Actual Results:  
There is no menu toolbar and HELP says to go to the VIEW menu to make changes.  As there is no menu, there is no view


It should allow me to have a menu toolbar without having a background in computer science.
