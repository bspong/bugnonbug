Comments: 
My bank reqires me to us the Internet Explorer to log into the bank's
system, after downloading and installing some files.
My problem is Firefox "overtaking" the Internet Explorer, such that the
files I downloaded from the bank's site using the Internet Explorer had
the Firefox logo embeded on them, rather than the usual "e" logo of the
Internet Explorer. This makes all installations of these files go
through Firefox, which the Bank's software does NOT accept.
To solve this problem, I uninstalled Firefox, deleted all bank files,
and loaded & intalled them again using Internet Explorer, BUT Firefox
DID 0vertake the Internet Explorer.

PLEASE help me in this matter, and How can I delete Firefox TOTALLY from
my Windows XP, so I can access my bank account.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Delete all downloaded files AFTER unistalling them
2.Load the same files using Internet Exploere and install them
3.

Actual Results:  
My problem stems from the fact that the Bank's software does NOT accept Firefox, and requires Internet Explorer for accession.
The problem will repeat itself EVEN if when I uninstalled Firefox from my windows using Add/Remove programs option, and downloaded the same files and install them.
HOW can I TOTALLY remove Firefox from my computer ??

Expected Results:  
Can NOT access the Bank's system, and thus cannot log in.
