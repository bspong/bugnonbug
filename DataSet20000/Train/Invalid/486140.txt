Some DNS servers prevent Keyword URL
Some DNS servers, such as OpenDNS, prevent the Keyword URL.
The current value is:

http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sourceid=navclient&gfns=1&q=

But I think (I am not sure) it is deprecated. If we remove the "&gfns=1" substring, it works properly but without Feeling Lucky search. :(

We should set a new one.
