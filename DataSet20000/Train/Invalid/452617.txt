As the summary suggests, history clearing is not working correctly anymore. In fact, some old sites I went to before the upgrade are now in the pull down menu of the address bar. This is a BIG problem as sometimes I go to sites my girl would not like me too and I want to remove all traces of it. IT worked properly in 2.0 but does not work in the latest version I upgraded to yesterday. Can you fix this or tell me how to ASAP!!!
