While researching something online I was directed to http://www.lsb.state.ok.us/. I clicked on the Oklahoma Statutes & Constitution link (javascript:ChangeFrames('http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/tsrs1/os_oc.htm','menu.html')) and when I did so, Minefield quit responding and had to be forced closed.
