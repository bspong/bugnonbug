Basicly, I have a Search Keyword for google, 'g', so typing 'g firefox' would google firefox.

Often, I would like to search for a single word, so i'd highlight it then rapidly go CTRL+C (Copy), ALT+D (Address bar), "g ", CTRL+V (paste) enter (go)

Half the time, i think I do it to fast, and it just attempts to resolve www.g firefox.com intead of googling firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Happens every time if you're fast.

1. Alt D
2. "g "
3. Paste
4. Enter

Actual Results:  
i go to "www.g firefox.com"

Expected Results:  
i go to Google, having searched for firefox
