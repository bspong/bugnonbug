No access to _any_ web page !
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; InfoPath.1)
Build Identifier: 

After successfull auto-install of version 2.0.0.12, after Firefox reloads, impossible to access any webpage. IE is working, other PC on the network are working. Cold boot doesn't change anything: Mozilla doesn't access the web anymore. No firewall is in cause. My machines are clean, guaranteed, look elsewhere.
This might be due to some major incompatibility with loaded extensions, but it's a pity to loose _hours_ of work to dig into this ourself.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run 2.0.0.11 fr
2.Wait for auto-update to 2.0.0.12
3.Now all you have to do is Switch to IE
Actual Results:  
Web pages inaccessible

Expected Results:  
Display web pages
