browser ignoring tabMinWidth and tabClipWidth
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:2.0b2pre) Gecko/20100708 Minefield/4.0b2pre

First noticed with the nightly build for June 5th.  In about:config, browser.tabs.tabClipWidth and browser.tabs.tabMinWidth settings have no impact on the width of the tabs.  Have tried different values to the same effect (after restarting the browser).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use about:config to change the values of browser.tabs.tabClipWidth and browser.tabs.tabMinWidth
2. See that the tabs don't change their width.
3. Profit.
Actual Results:  
Nothing, which is the problem.  The tabs don't resize.

Expected Results:  
Up to and including the nightly build for June 4th, the tabs would resize based on the settings in browser.tabs.tabClipWidth and browser.tabs.tabMinWidth.

I typically have browser.tabs.tabClipWidth and browser.tabs.tabMinWidth set to 20 and 18 respectively (I normally have a large number of tabs open, and immediately noticed that the tabs weren't shrinking down to the size I'd set).
