Music doesn't play in firefox

I go to many sites that play music fine in Internet Explorer, but when I open the same websites in Firefox, the music doesn't play. A popup says Firefox needs a plugin, but when I click for it to search for the plugin, nothing comes up.

Everyone tells me Firefox is so much better, but it can't even play background music on websites, is this a bug or something Firefox doesn't have installed?
Please help, thank you. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://wind.shoe-box.net/iBlue.html for example
2. Press 1, 2 , or 3
3. None of the music plays in Firefox.

Actual Results:  
The music didn't play and firefox said to install a plugin that it couldn't produce to be installed.

Expected Results:  
I should be able to click on 1, 2, or 3 and hear music, just like I can in Internet Explorer...
