I downloaded Elf as a way to create pdf files. Whenever I try to open Firefox instead of the familiar screen I get Community Toolbox. I've hit "Contact Us" and detailed my problem and they say thanks and they'll get back to me soon. It has been almost five days and they haven't. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download Elf
2.Open Firefox
3.Get reported screen
Actual Results:  
It actually happens every time. I was told to download it again and there would be an uninstall feature. I tried. It isn't there. Nothing changed., I can't get to my Firefox browser

Expected Results:  
Firefox browser would open and Elf would hve disappeared forever.
