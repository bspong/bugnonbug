Clicking on link opens Firefox with location bar selected

When I click on a link (in Thunderbird - but I don't think that's relevant), a new Firefox tab opens with the URL in the location bar selected. Since I use the keyboard to page down, usually by hitting the space bar, this means a lot of frustration as I space, space again - oh, Firefox did it again! - get the mouse, click on the page, space and move down.

This began with the 2.0.0.10 download - it was working correctly earlier this week. I've seen it on two different computers (both WinXP).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on a link (in an email, for instance)
2. Look at what's selected - the newly-opened URL in the location bar

Actual Results:  
URL in location bar is selected; if I hit space, the URL is blanked and the page doesn't move down.

Expected Results:  
The page is selected (or there's no (visible) selection), so that when I hit the space bar the page moves down.
