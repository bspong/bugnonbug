When I install Leech as an extension the settings button is greyed and
unavailable.  As a result the parameters cannot be set. (It still works.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Leech from the Extensions website.
2. After restarting go to Tools->Options->Extensions->Leech
3. Try to click the settings button

Actual Results:  
The settings button is greyed out and unavailable.

Expected Results:  
Opened a dialog to set the parameters for the Extension.

The extension still works correctly, at least the "Get Entire Website From Here"
option.  It is probably still using the parameters I set earlier.  This did work
correctly in the Dec 7 build.  At that time a tree displayed. All the tree
versions I remember worked. Now its a series of windows which don't seem to work.
