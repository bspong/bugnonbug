I looked at your tutorial about Asian languages, and how they need to be on the host computer. This computer that I'm using is actually default Korean, and IE had no problem displaying all of the characters on the page. No one here that I know of has even heard of FireFox, and it's clear why: the language does not always display properly, and often substitutes ??? for some characters, but not all the time. I could have included a snapshot of the issue, but I did not see an option on your page to do so. The problem is not isolated to this one webpage. 

If IE hadn't loaded the characters properly, I would question the integrity of the webpage I was visiting, or the computer that I'm using.

Reproducible: Always
