Nightly fails to exit() correctly, leaves instance running - even in safemode

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:8.0a1) Gecko/20110720 Firefox/8.0a1
Build ID: 20110720030844

Steps to reproduce:

When I run Nightly these past 2 days it does not exit (properly). 

If I hit the red [X] in the upper right corner the Window closes instantly (and thus upon restart Tab Mix Plus thinks it crashed).

When I check Windows Task Manager it says that firefox.exe is still running and if I TRY to use WTM to terminate the Process it will not work. I must reboot to terminate the Process and be able to restart Firefox (otherwise FF says it is already running).

This does not occur with FF5 or FF6 (Aurora) and did not occur with Night (FF 8.0a1) prior to two days ago.


I fired up WinDbg and used the command-line argument "-safemode" in the Debugger's arguments section. I ran FF and made a Log.



Actual results:

It seems like it aborts rather than exits and leaves an instance of FF running that can not be terminated (even by WTM).



Expected results:

Normally FF exits (too) _slowly_ (takes a few seconds) and when not in 'safemode' the Add-on Tab Mix Plus will ask to save the Session.

FF 8 does not exit as it did more than two days ago (now the [File][Exit] does not work and the red [X] is instant. FF8 does not exit the same way as FF 5 or FF7 (Aurora) does.
