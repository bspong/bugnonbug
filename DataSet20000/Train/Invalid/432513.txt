Loading a page is quite fast, but any changes happening after a page is loaded is as slow as watching a picture slideshow.
This problem doesn't exist in ff 2

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start the browser.
2.go to http://home.arcor.de/bazonbloch/scrolltest/whyisscrollingonlinuxslowerthanonwindows.htm
3.start scrolling.
Actual Results:  
i get a beautyfull picture slideshow.
at 1920x1200 it takes 24 seconds to scroll up or down, at ~1024x786 it takes 7 seconds to scroll up or down.

Expected Results:  
schroll up or down in under 8 seconds on 1920x1200. Or in the least generate more then two screen updates per second.

The feeling I get is that the pages is rerenderd every time something happens, and no form of smart buffering/layer technique is applied.

The https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox&format=guided page also kills performance.

with firefox 3 50% of all the internet pages or more are slow, and some unbearable with viewing.
