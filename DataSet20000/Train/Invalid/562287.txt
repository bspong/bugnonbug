I prefer new windows and don't use tabs. In Preferences->Tabs the "Open new window in new tabs instead" is Unchecked. However, while clicking on Google search results, this setting is automatically checked.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Preferences->Tabs  Uncheck "Open new window in new tabs instead" 
2. Make sure the setting is saved
3. www.google.com, enter "anything", click search
4. Start clicking on the google search result links
5. Eventually, the links start to open in tabs, not windows
6. Go to Preferences->Tabs and see "Open new window in new tabs instead" is checked, even though you didn't do that.
Actual Results:  
Firefox acts as preferred

Expected Results:  
Settings autocheck

I use a Portable version from portableapps.com
