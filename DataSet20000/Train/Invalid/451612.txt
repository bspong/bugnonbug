After firefox hangs its not possible to kill the process in vistas task manager
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008072820 Firefox/3.0.1

Sometimes firefox hangs so i have to close it. After that the process remains in vistas task manager.

Therefore its not possible to open a new instance because i get the error message "firefox allready running...".

To make things even worse its not possible to exit windows normaly because it will not restart. I have to do a hardware reset the pc.
