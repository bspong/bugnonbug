While Using the Bookmarks/Manage Bookmarks Menu,
In the "New Bookmark/Schedule/Check this location for updates" option
The browser doesn't stop checking the website for updates even after the time
entered in the "To" Field has expired.

quite often,eg. any news site which keeps updating the site with the latest news.

to check for updates.
3. The browser sends alerts even after 2.00 if the site is updated after 2.00
Actual Results:  
The Browser checks for the updates and displays alerts and notifies even after
the Scheduled end time expires.
