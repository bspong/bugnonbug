Can't autoscroll in some application/xhtml+xml

I don't know what the crucial difference is, but it looks to me like some pages that come in as application/xhtml+xml do not allow autoscroll.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
This particular site has the same content on two different servers, at least for the moment.  One gives the MIME type as application/xhtml+xml, and the other gives it as text/html.  On the application/xhtml+xml site (with teh www in front), I can't autoscroll.  I did a diff of the page, and didn't see anything different except for ad links.

1. Go to http://www.techreport.com/discussions.x/13818 (note the application/xhtml+xml type. Also, it specifies the iso-8859-1 charset.)
2. try to autoscroll
3. Go to http://techreport.com/discussions.x/13818 (note the text/html type)
4. try to autoscroll; succeed
Actual Results:  
Autoscroll only works on the (no www) techreport.com site.

Expected Results:  
Autoscroll should be unaffected by this.

I don't know what the deal is with XML and autoscroll, but I know there have been other issues in the past.  On colorized XML text, middle-clicking used to make everything disappear, and I know there once was a problem with middle clicking links bringing up autoscroll instead of opening links in a new tab.
