If I use the auto-fill capability, the boxes that were "auto filled" appear on every single open Tab Window. Open a new Tab, they are not displayed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open multiple tabs
2. Go to any site that has a form
3. Use the auto-fill feature
Actual Results:  
Auto-filled fields appear on all open tabs "for ever" until the tab is closed and reopened.

Expected Results:  
Pollution does not appear on unrelated tabs.
