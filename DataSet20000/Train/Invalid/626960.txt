Provide an option to permanently hide the addon bar

When I dismiss a toolbar, and restart Firefox, I expect that toolbar to stay hidden.  The addon bar keeps coming back.  I don't know whether this is a Fx4b9 bug, or the addon bar is still in flux and this is an enhancement request, or if this is permanent UI...

(I got into the habit of hiding any status bar at the bottom of my laptop screen because it was aging poorly, and leaving the bar there actually caused screen burn-in...  Now I'm used to not needing the status bar at all.)

Ideally, I'd like the option to have a toolbar button I could add to the addressbar, similar to the Show/hide bookmarks bar button, that would show/hide the addons bar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Fx
2. Close the addon bar
3. Restart Fx
Actual Results:  
The addon bar comes back...
