Whenever I used wikipedia, I zoom the page in and then open a blue link to a new tab. The spawned tab has the same zoom setting as the parent tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go To Wikipedia
2. Type Any Search Query
3. Zoom in
4. Open any link in new tab
5. The zoom setting gets spawned along with the link
Actual Results:  
The zoom setting was spawned along with the link

Expected Results:  
The spawned tab should be set to zoom reset
