Stuck in "Save As" window after ejecting a mounted drive.

I was saving a file and decided to eject a drive, and everything kinda bugged up. The drive ejected fine, but when I'd click on folders it showed them as empty, even though they weren't. Then I would click on a folder, and it would highlight a random folder in the sidebar (see pic).

And finally when I went to try and Save the file, it wouldn't execute anything, cancel would not do anything either. But I was able to quit the browser without crashing. This was all in the "column" view if that matters.

Hope this helps somehow!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.mount a drive
2.save a file
3.eject drive in "save as" window"
4.try to navigate through folders
Actual Results:  
1. contents of folders don't show up (unless you click on another folder, then back on the original folder)
2.cannot leave "save as" window without quitting Firefox.

Expected Results:  
save the file, be able to show folder contents, not bug out, etc

I'm running two monitors, but only one Firefox window, multiple tabs open.
