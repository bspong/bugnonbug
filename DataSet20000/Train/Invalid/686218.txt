Dropdown boxes become inoperable
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:6.0.2) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.2
Build ID: 20110905174115

Steps to reproduce:

Started Firefox, then opened several tabs, never more than 5 tabs open at one time but 15 or so tabs opened then closed before the problem starts.


Actual results:

When I click on a dropdown box the list appears then closes when I try to move the mouse/cursor down the list to make a selection. I can use the arrow keys to move up and down the selection list. I can then make a selection using the enter key. It just does not work with the mouse and clicks. If I restart Firefox then functionality returns for a while.


Expected results:

When I click on a dropdown box I should be able to move the mouse down the selection list and click on a selection to make the selection.
