This is similar to  Bug 443885 but not quite.

When an incompatible extension is installed, the Add-On manager correctly identifies it as such but greys-out the Uninstall button. Registry surgery 
is required to fix the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install an extension which is incompatible using an external installer,
Microsoft updates sometimes do this (!).
2. Start FF
3. Open Add-On manager.
4. Select the incompatible Add-On.
5. Notice the uninstall button is greyed-out.
Actual Results:  
The uninstall button is disable.
The incompatible extension cannot be uninstalled.

Expected Results:  
The uninstall button is enabled.
The incompatible extension can be uninstalled.

Leave the uninstall button is enabled.
Uninstall the extension when the uninstalled button is clicked.

For bonus points:
 Firefox should popup  dialog asking if it can uninstall incomptible
 extensions when they are detected.
