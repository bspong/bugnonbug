After a crash while using MS Word and a mis-step that turned the power off, the listing of search engine in the search bar is now missing. i can not use the search bar at all to search on the internet. I used to be able to search via google, etc through the search bar. how do i restore it? i tried adding search engines from the mozilla site but it will not post! help! 

Reproducible: Didn't try
