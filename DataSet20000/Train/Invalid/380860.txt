Damn memory leaks, on many refresh's i get always memoryleaks with 50mb and more, also when i have 10tabs or more (the same problem with a better PC).

I have the standard Firebug Version 2.0.0.3 and the standard Theme,
but it is a lot more problematic with mootools/JS, memoryleaks more
then 150mb (150-250), thats crazy shi*. FF needs more memory than 
every game i saw.
