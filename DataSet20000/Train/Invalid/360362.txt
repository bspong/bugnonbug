If you move your mouse over a button, specifically a submit button in a form, and then drag on the text, it is selectable. Here's the bad part: you can drag the selected text anywhere inside the button, so you can drag and re-arrange words inside a button. Weird feature: definitely should be fixed!



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an XHTML page with a submit form inside a button that has a class='button'

The CSS for this class is
input.button
{
 border: 2px outset #900;
 font-size: 0.8em;
}

2. View the page
3. Drag over the button and then once the text is selected, try moving the selected portion of the label within the button. It will move!

Actual Results:  
Text is moveable inside a button.

Expected Results:  
Text shouldn't be moved
