I'm assuming you guys know what Bittorrent is. If you don't, it is a downloading
program. In any Bittorrent web site using microsoft IE, a file can be downloaded
just by left-clicking it. But when i use Mozilla, I get a page of mumble jumble.
i tried right-clicking it and do save-as but the file won't start downloading.
PLEASE HELP!!!
