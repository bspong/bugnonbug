Firefox 2.0.0.4 cannot connect to network
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20070219 Firefox/2.0.0.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20070219 Firefox/2.0.0.2

When firefox updated to version 2.0.0.4, I always get the message "Can't locate server". This happens with both the full version and the portable apps version. As soon as I revert to firefox version 2.0.0.2 (full version) or firefox version 2.0.0.3 (portable version), everything works fine. 
I have uninstalled and reinstalled a few times, but the same thing happens. Even edited all references to firefox/mozilla from the registry; upon reinstall of firefox (or 'automatic' update), firefox again cannot connect with the internet. 
I am able to send this as I am using version 2.0.0.2 on my dektop at present.
I hope version 2.0.0.5 comes soon!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download version 2.0.0.4
2.Try to connect to internet
3."Cannot locate server"
Actual Results:  
There is nothing special re setups. As soon as I have version 2.0.0.4 on the computer, I am unable to connect to the internet. Earlier builds such as 2.0.0.2 and 2.0.0.3 work fine.

Expected Results:  
I expect version 2.0.0.4 will connect to the internet, but it doesn't.

I do not believe the problem is related to firewall settings nor themes. There is no crash as such, it just does not connect to the internet, the earlier builds (as noted above) do so every time.
