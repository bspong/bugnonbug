Image link context menus and properties not complete for keyboard users
Env: Bon Echo 20060515 nightly build

Description:
When you right-click the mouse on a link image you get a long list of items in the context menu, and the properties dialog shows both link properties (e.g., URL)  and image properties (e.g., height, width, alt text).  If you tab to the link image and press Shift+F10 to display context menu, you get a much shorter list of menu items, and the properties dialog shows only link properties, but not image properties.

Recreate:
1. Load this URL in Firefox (Bon Echo): http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_imglink
    There will be a "+Next" button in the right pane of the window.
2. Move the mouse over the "+Next" button, and click the RIGHT MOUSE button.
    This will display the context menu.  This causes a list of about 15 items to display.
    The last item in the list is "Properties"
3. Click on the "Properties" option.  
    Note that both Link properties and Image properties (including Alternative text) are displayed.
4. Press ESC to clear the properties dialog.  
    This should leave keyboard focus on the "+Next" button.  You should see a dotted line
    around the button.
5. Press SHIFT+F10 to display the context menu using the keyboard.

 Error 1:  Note that this time, a list of only about 8 items is displayed.  The 
    missing menu items include "view image, copy image, copy image location, 
    save image as..., send image, set as desktop background, and
    block images from w3schools..."
  
6. Select Properties from the context menu.  (Press "P" to select)

 Error 2:  Not that this time, ONLY the link properties are displayed.
    The image properties are not displayed.

(Note: of course you can use any page with an image link to reproduce this bug... i.e., an image enclosed in an anchor tag containing a hyperlink, 
e.g., <a href=xxx.html> <img src=xxx.jpg... /> </a>)
