Crash when clicking on a link [@ nstidy.dll ][@ msvcrt.dll + 0x37696 - nstidy.dll + 0x173be]

Firefox crashed when I clicked on a link on the Geckozone forum
(http://www.geckozone.org/forum/). I was on a subject page (don't remember
witch), I clicked on "Geckozone : Index du Forum" to come back to the Index and
Firefox crashed. This site usually doesn't cause any trouble (and I'm very often
on this forum).

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
Hopefully not reproducible




I don't know what happened or why, but I sent a talkback : TB3799305H
I have many, many extensions (I can list them if it can help), and I use the
theme QuteRetro.

I don't know witch component to pick, so "General" seems to be good because it
was on a web page display...
