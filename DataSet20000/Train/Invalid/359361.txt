Simply to see. Just to go bookmarks / organize bookmarks, and you will have a 10x10 px, and when you open it, it is blank !

I noticed that with a one hour homemade build, with source code up-to-date on today, midnight, mozilla.org time.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Get firefox source code and build it.
2.Launch newly built firefox
3.Go to bookmarks / organize bookmarks

Actual Results:  
Blank window

Expected Results:  
Window showing bookmark manager.

No error in error console. Very strange. Could it be related to the big patch added for bug 356590 ?

I built this firefox on an up-to-date ubuntu edgy eft.
