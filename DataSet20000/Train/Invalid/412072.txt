"I wish I could only remember that URL."

I wish there was a way that Firefox was better at helping me with this. 
History in IE is by URL.
History in Opera is grouped by domain. Nice!

Wish Firefox would add this as an option in a future release.
Maybe a titles or urls radio button.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Open your Firefox browser and hit Ctrl - H.
Actual Results:  
Shows a list of Titles of web pages I have visited.

Expected Results:  
Should show URLs. or give me a choice of URLs or Titles. Just my opinion.
Or is there already a plug-in that solves this?
