In above URL example 2 is created with a CAD program. The vessel drawing shows correctly in Adobe SVG viewer. Firefox does apparently not like the <use></use> elements at the end of a large file. The elements do work in a smaller file. I also have a request, that it would be possible to zoom the SVG graphics. This would make it possible to archive and browse technical drawings like they were web pages. Keep up the good work and thanks, Rutger

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to above URL http://home.planet.nl/~boter021/
2.Select Example 2, refer to the parse error
3.Save the file on local computer
4.Remove all (+/-400) use elements, most of the drawing appears

Actual Results:  
use elements are not shown at the end of a large SVG file

Expected Results:  
I expected to see the drawing

Future request for zoom capabilities
