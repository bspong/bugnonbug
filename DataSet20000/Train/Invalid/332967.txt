Ability to sort Subscriptions (in Places) by date of post (unsorted?)

Feeds/blogs are (almost) always sorted by the date of the post, with the newest on top.

There needs to be a way in Places/Subscriptions(*) to sort the opened feed folder by the date of the post. Could the menuitem "View / Unsorted" be (mis)used for this?

(*) The word "Subscriptions" is a bit tricky to type (the "ipti" part). ;-)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Places, select Subscriptions
2. Open a feed's folder (click the + in front of its name)
3. Click on a column header (e.g., Title, Location)
4. Try to get back the original sort order.



Expected Results:  
Original sort order (by post date, descending(*)) can be restored (without closing an reopening Places and/or Firefox).

(*) With dates, is descending with the newest ("largest") date on top, or is it ascending???
