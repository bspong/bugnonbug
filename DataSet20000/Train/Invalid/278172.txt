Accidentally disabled MMS:// streaming links

The first time I clicked on a mms://  streaming link I got the firefox dialogue
box asking if I wanted to block this type of content and I accidentally clicked
YES.  I can't find out how to re-enable firefox to allow these types of links.

Please help and thank you so much!

Reproducible: Always
