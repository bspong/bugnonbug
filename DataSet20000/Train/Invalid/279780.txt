When I view the home page of this site, or any with quicktime in, the two quicktime placeholders at the top of the page just display the "Q icon

I think? this is a bug. 
I've tried workarounds, also I have not found during searching, any mention of
bugs related to this. 
But then as a(my) woman would say "It's not shouting, here I am, here I am!"

I do not appear to be able to view quicktime elements in any website.
I can see them with Satans browser IE 6 etc. 
I have downloaded the latest version of Quicktime, through Mozilla's link, and
this has made no difference.
I just see the placeholder "Q" icon.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
The quicktime images should be visible,and play.

I have not been using Firefox long, so I haven't F*(^ed about with any settings,
(if it aint broke don't tamper)
