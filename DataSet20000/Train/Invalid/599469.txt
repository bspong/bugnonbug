I am a regular user of the Blocksite 0.7.1.1 add-on. Unfortunately I have just made things very difficult for myself because I accidentally typed something in the amend password field instead of another and now my old BlockSite password does not work and I cannot create another one without logging in with the existing one. Please help me as I need Blocksite for my own personal mental health.

Reproducible: Always
