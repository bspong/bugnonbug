Opera profile import doesn't handle character sets correctly
STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Create a bookmark in Opera that uses high characters such as U+263A.
2. Import the profile into Firefox.

EXPECTED RESULTS
Bookmark name should be as you entered it in Opera.

ACTUAL RESULTS
Bytes that form part of UTF-8 characters in Opera's configuration file
are interpreted as ISO-8859-1 characters.
