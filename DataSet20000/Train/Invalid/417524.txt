Gentoo Linux - Need additional dependancy for ALSA sound to properly work
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080212 Firefox/2.0.0.12

Default installation of Firefox in Gentoo attempts (Near as I can tell) to use OSS for all sound.  If the KDE system is configured with ARTs, with ALSA, by default, sound will not work in Firefox if it's playing elsewhere, or sound will not work elsewhere when playing in Firefox..

I noted that the mozilla-launcher is designed to use aoss when it's installed, and it works PERFECTLY when it is..  Therefore, I merely wished to suggest that media-libs/alsa-oss be added to the dependancy cache if the Gentoo user has ALSA and/or ARTS USE flags set.

I'm here because I greatly stand behind your product, and I was told that your team determined dependancies for Gentoo's Portage..  If this is mistaken, then I apologize for taking up your time..

Basically, it's a convenience thing.  One dependancy added would save a lot of Gentoo users a lot of headache in getting their sound to function properly. =)
