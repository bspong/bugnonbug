Supposing I have not accessed a bookmark in a really long time. But it has been tagged, now if I enter the tag into the location bar the bookmarked page does not show up. However this does not happen with all the tags for that book-marked page. Eg if a page has the tags, mobile and telephone. When I type mobile, the page does not show up, but telephone gives me the page.

This may be because the number of pages i have visited in the past have 'mobile' keyword a lot and the location bar only displays limited number of links. However, pages which match the keyword 'telephone' are not many so the bookmarked page shows up.

The location bar should ALWAYS show your bookmarked pages, no matter how OLD they are. but this does not seem to be the defining behavior

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Tag a really old bookmark as google using the bookmark library window.
2.Save the bookmark and the tag (it is done by default)
3.type google in the location bar, lots of history pages show up, but the page tagged google which is a bookmark does not show up
Actual Results:  
The bookmarked page did not show up

Expected Results:  
Showed the bookmark tagged as google
