FF Crashes daily & Crash report shows no cause
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build ID: 20110615151330

Steps to reproduce:

I was typing a message in a comment section at LinkedIn.com


Actual results:

As I was typing, the browser kept hanging and fading in and out. It finally crashed. Ever since the last FF upgrade this has been an issue. Usually cannot go more than 8 or 10 hours before a crash


Expected results:

It should have let me type my message into the LinkedIn form.
