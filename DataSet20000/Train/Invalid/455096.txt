After giving a fullscreen Youtube video focus, then exiting fullscreen mode, you get failures:
* You can no longer press the ALT key to activate menus for any Firefox window (other applications can activate menus fine)
* You can no longer Scroll using the scroll area on a Synaptics touchpad in _any application_, including Firefox.

Sometimes, after a while, the problem will suddenly correct itself, then the ALT key and Synaptics scrolling work again.

Also, restarting syntpenh.exe always makes the touchpad work again, even if the ALT key still fails.

I don't know whether the fault is in Firefox, Flash, or the Synaptics Touchpad driver.  But giving a fullscreen youtube video focus, then exiting fullscreen mode definitely triggers the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a Youtube video in full screen
2. Click to give the video focus
3. Exit full screen mode with escape
4. Click anywhere inside the Firefox window outside the flash plugin area
5. Try to press ALT or scroll with a Synaptics touchpad

This is reproducible almost every time, if it doesn't trigger the bug, I can try it again, and get it to happen.
Actual Results:  
ALT key fails to activate menus inside firefox
Touchpad scroll area fails to scroll in any application

Expected Results:  
Alt key and touchpad scroll should still work.
