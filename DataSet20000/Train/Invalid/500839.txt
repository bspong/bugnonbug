Not sure what's going on. The only site I go to are clean sites. I know because I have installed the McAfee SiteAdvisor. Fire Fox crashes. All I am doing is surfing and it will crash. Sorry that's all I know.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.No hard to reproduce this issue it will happen every time I connect to the internet.
2.No special step taken. 
3.As far as reproducing the issue I never know when it's going to happen. It's always at a different site. 
Actual Results:  
I submit the crash report. What else can I do. 

Expected Results:  
All I want is a browser that works. That is one that does not crash.

I wish I knew more about how these things worked. But to tell you the truth I don't have the time to learn about them now. I have a 91 year old mother that has had TIA's  and requires all lot of my time.
