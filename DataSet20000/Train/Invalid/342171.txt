Seemingly absurd url works

While messing around with encryption things using php's mcrypt() functionality I entered the result of encryption into the url bar. The ways in which I arrived at the string entered are not important as they are separate events. The string entered is "Êƒü-|JûE¶3Ö£E9/Žjp^2/P¿_­e‹â¡" (without the quotes). 

When one types carriage return, it comes up with a download box from a site called http://www.localhikes.com.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type Êƒü-|JûE¶3Ö£E9/Žjp^2/P¿_­e‹â¡ in the address bar
2. Submit
3. You may wish to download and inspect this file. For obvious reasons, i haven't

Actual Results:  
Download box opens, file from localhikes.com, from seemingly invalid url

Expected Results:  
Error in syntax, page not found...

Using default theme, a couple of tabs open, no proxy, firewall / antivirus active. Everything as usuall. I imagine it's something to do with the way in which the browser validates/changes entries to the url bar; this url can't exist, surely.
