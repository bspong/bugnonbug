Tools>Start Private Browsing Mode on Mac OS X (Snow Leopard 10.6.4) Firefox 4 beta 5, works, but to Stop Private browsing, the menu has a typo and still says "Start Private Browsing Mode" - clicking it of course stops the mode, but that obviously should say stop. Only seems to be Mac (Windows XP Firefox 4 Beta 5 was fine - not confirmed on Linux). Screen shot of it in action:

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Tools> Start Private Browsing in Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.4
2. Now in Private Browsing mode - click Tools> Menu, you will see that it still says Start Private Browsing, despite already being in the private browsing mode
Actual Results:  
Typo exists, when in Private Browsing Mode in Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.4 and Firefox 4 Beta 5, under the Tools menu, it says "Start PRivate Browsing"

Expected Results:  
It should say Stop Private Browsing, when already in Private Browsing Mode
