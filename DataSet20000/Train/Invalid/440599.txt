invalid html causes innerHTML and DOM manipulating to not work properly

I made a bookmarklet for geocaching, just to find a particular link (leading to an online map) on the page and embed it in an iframe.

The link is in a SPAN element with ID attribute set, so I extract the link from document.getElementById('span_id').innerHTML. This worked in Firefox 2, works in IE and Opera, but not in Firefox 3.

I found that the page html is invalid, validator shows several hundreds errors, but this is caused by one missing  </A> closing tag. So if it hadn't worked in FF2, I would never consider this a Firefox bug.
I extracted the crucial part of the html to reproduce the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Save this code as ab.html:

<p>
  <a href='aaa'>aaa</li> <!--missing /a before /li-->
</p>
<p>
  <span id="span_id">
    <a href="bbb">bbb</a>
  </span>
</p>


2. Open the ab.html in Firefox 3 and paste this to address bar (and press Enter):
javascript:alert(document.getElementById('span_id').innerHTML)

Actual Results:  
Alert window will pop up, showing that innerHTML is empty.

Expected Results:  
The pop up window should contain this:
<a href="bbb">bbb</a>

My further investigation with Web Developer Toolbar showed that the generated source is

<p>
  <a href="aaa">aaa
</a></p>
<p>
<a href="aaa">  <span id="span_id">
    </span></a><a href="bbb">bbb</a>
  
</p>

So the span is really empty. Now I am not sure if this is correct way of dealing with broken html and I am just making a fool of myself. Sorry if this is a duplicate report.
