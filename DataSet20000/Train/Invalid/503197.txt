Just started today, 7/8/09, no other changes to system. Went to TVguide.com for tv listing information. Pulled up listings for one block of time, tried to arrow to the next block of time and got the following message: strValue120strAction:ArrowClick inside a box with an "ok" button inside it. At the top of the box it says, "The page at http://www.tvguide.com says:" then the message. Can't move until the "okay" is clicked.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to www.tvguide.com
2.Select what's on tv
3.Arrow to the left or right
Actual Results:  
No special steps. It just started tonight. No other system components or software have been changed since last time I used the site, which was last night. Appears to do it every time. Opened a new session and it does it in that one, too. 

Expected Results:  
Same thing. box pops up and you have to click the "ok" before you can move.

NOT popped up the little box. I have also started getting an occasional box that asks me if I'm sure I want to navigate away from whatever page I happen to be on. Happens at random times. I don't like this new version.
