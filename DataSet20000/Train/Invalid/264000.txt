When selecting a bookmark from the bookmark manager and hitting the rename key
(a rotated '|<', right next to the right command key), Firefox opens the
bookmark link instead of editing either bookmark name or URL.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bookmarks -> Manage Bookmarks...
2. Select (single click) a bookmark (not a folder) from the right pane
3. Hit the "rename" (|<) key

Actual Results:  
The bookmark opened in a Firefox window

Expected Results:  
The bookmark name or URL should become editable "in place"
