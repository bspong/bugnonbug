image onloads trigger more than amount of images on page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.6) Gecko/20100625 Firefox/3.6.6

If I have 10 images, each with an onload event that increments a counter, the counter equals (much) more than the amount of images on the page. 

It is working correctly in 3.6.3, IE8 and Chrome.

In the example I provided, the alert shows the current tally of loaded images on the left, versus total images on page.

In any other version or browser, the tally maxes out at the amount of images, as expected. In FF 3.6.6 it goes well beyond.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Female models
2. Click on a model to view portfolio
3. Let the images load and take not of the alerted amounts
