wrong positioning of <div> when floating next to few other floating <div>s

I a page where there are few <div> floating on one side (using style="float:right; clear:right" for example) trying to add another <div> that will float next to them (without the "clear") the new <div> appears in the same vertical position as the last <div> instead being placed in the same level with the top one.

See in the example page - why does the gray box so low? why doesn't it in the same height as the text to the left or the red box to the right... 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
create a page like this one -
<div style="width:200px; height:200px; background:red; float:right; clear:right;"></div>
<div style="width:200px; height:200px; background:blue; float:right; clear:right;"></div>
<div style="width:200px; height:200px; background:green; float:right; clear:right;"></div>
<div style="width:200px; height:200px; background:yellow; float:right; clear:right;"></div>
<div style="width:200px; height:300px; background:#cccccc; float:right;"></div>

Actual Results:  
the gray <div> appears in the same vertical position as the yellow one

Expected Results:  
the gray <div> should appears in the same vertical position as the red one - on top
