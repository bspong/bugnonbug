Follow the url. I know it's a poor example, but I don't have the resources to
make the spoofing more elaborate (think outside that example regarding this).

A spoofed site can have an <object> tag fetching data from a real site. Let's
use something besides citibank as the url shows to. Let's say it was called
dinsey.com, and that was fetching the html from disney.com. Well, with the
domains looking very similar, the average person might miss the domain spoofing.
So they're browsing along, and all of a sudden see something called
"Newest-Disney-Dinosaur-Desktop.exe" and think "wow, I should try this." Well,
being on the spoofed site and thinking they're on the real site (because
everything but the domain is 100% alike), they'll download it and run it,
finding out their computer just got screwed over.

The example I linked to is a poor attempt at this because of my lack of
resources, but if someone wanted to pull this off, it'd be quite possible. All
they'd need to do is make a domain that is extremely similar to the real domain,
use <object> to fetch the real data from the real site to make the spoof look
real, and then let javascript redirect that page to a download, without the
average person ever knowing they're potentially about to download a virus.

Poor example linked to, I know, sorry, but think outside of the box on this one
and you'll see this needs to be addressed.
