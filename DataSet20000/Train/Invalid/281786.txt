When navigating to my work timesheet page which is restricted access, Firefox
fails to align correctly and display everything.  IE
6.0.2800.1106.xpsp2.040919-1003 displays correctly.  I have screen shots in lieu
of you going to the site as it's restricted.  How can I get those screen shots
to you?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to the site
2. Failure occurs
3.

Actual Results:  
Webpage, which I suspect is built with tables, fails to format correctly and
some information never becomes visible.

Expected Results:  
Table should appear for entry of information by me in blocks for hours worked, etc.

  I am authorized to use the site in question as are all employees.  Those who
are not employees or otherwise specifically authorized may not access the site.
 I have screen shots to send depicting Firefox display of website and IE
display.  Tell me where to send them for your use as access is restricted.

Thanks,

Susan
