Incorrect certificate analysis with system time in the past
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1
Build Identifier: Firefox/3.0.1

Every time I log onto a new site I am told the certificate is invalid even when it isn't.  Happened on bugzilla, by the way.  With particular sites I must repeat this step several times.  
Then when firefox blocks content there is no way to unblock it.  I find this in particular with sites where one has to type in distorted letters to confirm one is not spam (sorry don't know what they're called).  craigslist is an example.  Sometimes if there is an option it is not activated.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go through the posting process on craiglist real estate for sale, by broker, dc.
2.Fill in ad description, continue to acceptance terms, continue to validation page 
3.only continue button - no distorted security letters
Actual Results:  
No security letters so when I hit continue nothing happens

Expected Results:  
Nothing

Happens on other websites where there is security such as my real estate firms forms site.
