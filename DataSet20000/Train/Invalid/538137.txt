Stabillity update 3.5.7. is really an INSTABILITY update;

Error notifications: can't open firefox cause it's still running
I have to manually kill the firefox.exe*32 (CPU load up to 70%) process after using Firefox (aLmost every time)

De-installing 3.5.7. and reinstalling 3.5.6 made the problems ever greater: errors all over the place and browsing became completely impossible.

Had to do a total system restore (luckily I make backups every week)......and deselect 'firefox' in de options/general/update-menu to be safe.

Other users on a tech-forum I visit have the same problems. This is bad.
