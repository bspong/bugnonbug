Javascript performace regression from Firefox 3.5.5 to 3.5.6

Load facebook home page. Scroll to the bottom, this triggers a script that loads more older posts. This script blocks firefox, pegs one core with 100% CPU usage for about 3 - 5 seconds (8 core Mac Pro 2.8 GHz) with busy cursor. 

I believe this was introduced with firefox 3.5.6, and it does not happen in Windows version of Firefox 3.5.6 either, with all the same extensions and default firefox theme in either case.

Reproducible: Always




This is with default firefox theme and following extensions:

Adblock Plus
Firebug 1.4.5
Google Toolbar 6.1.20091119M
It's All Text 1.3.1
Tab Mix Plus 0.3.8.2
Web Developer 1.1.8

Note that Firebug and web developer extensions are disabled and the problem is still reproducible.
