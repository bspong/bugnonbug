When I visit www.msn.com and www.uk.msn.com and open any link on this webpage in a new tab by middle clicking the mouse button, Firefox opens the link in the current tab. I have noticed this problem for many years. It did happen with some other webpages but I can't recall those. This problem does not occur on any other webpages apart from those mentioned. Please don't give me the "did you customize your keyboard keys/mouse" or "did I customise Firefox etc...". The answer is no I didn't. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit www.msn.com.
2. Press the middle mouse button to open links in new tab.
3. Watch as Firefox annoyingly opens the links in the current tab.
Actual Results:  
Firefox annoyingly opens the links in the current tab.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should happily open the links in the new tab.

Tested on the latest developer builds, same problem is present.
