A few days ago, I opened up an e-mail at  my Yahoo in box. As it was opening, it was shut down and I received a message from Firefox that it was opening, it could not be completed (or something like that). The next time I turned on my computer, my home page now has not two, but three items in the second frame the top bar. 1) Getting started, 2) Latest headlines and the new 3) Super Hot Pornstar. If you hit the Go button on it, it connects you to: http://www.thecockfreaks.com/flexiblepositions/20080729k/index.html

I have tried to look into my cookies to check things out, but I can not find the cookies anymore. My system still works OK, and it asks me if I want to accept cookies from sites when I open them. The sites I use most often are secure sites and the cookies from them must be somewhere. But I can’t find them. Anything I open that I don’t usually use, I choose “Allow for session” or “Deny”.

I can not find how to get rid of this problem. I have downloaded, from Monzilla, the same Firefox browser I have now (2.0.0.16). The download does not fix the problem or give me a clean window without the Super Hot Pornstar button.

Is my problem something that is internal with the Macintosh hard drive, or do you feel it is in the Browser?

My hardware overview is:

  Machine Name:	Power Mac G4 (AGP graphics)
  Machine Model:	PowerMac3,1
  CPU Type:	PowerPC G4  (2.9)
  Number Of CPUs:	1
  CPU Speed:	450 MHz
  L2 Cache (per CPU):	1 MB
  Memory:	384 MB
  Bus Speed:	100 MHz
  Boot ROM Version:	4.2.8f1

Is there any way you can direct me on how to solve this problem or how to find the cookies? Is their anymore information I can supply you with? Have you experienced a problem like this before. 

I have taken a picture of the window with Grab, and will try to attach it to this e-mail.
