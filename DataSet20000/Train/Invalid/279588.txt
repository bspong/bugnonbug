Having a page consisting of three frames (named "oben", "links" and "haupt"),
where the left frame ("links") contains links. All links are referred with an
a-tag using "haupt" as target. All works fine. One of the links links to
"http://www.wuppertal.de". After opening this link for the first time,
"www.wuppertal.de" appears in the "haupt"-frame. After that, all other links
available in the "left"-frame won't open in "haupt"-frame any more, but in a
newly opened window. Reloading the page does not solve the problem. After
closing Firefox and restarting it, all works fine again, until
"www.wuppertal.de" has been displayed in the "haupt"-frame, whereafter the
problem occurs again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See above.
Actual Results:  
See above.

Expected Results:  
Linked pages should be opened in the "haupt"-frame instead in a new window.
