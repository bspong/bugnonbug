Pronunciation icons absent in Firefox 4.0 for dictionary site

It's a simple bug to explain. Open http://www.thefreedictionary.com/, type any word in the dictionary to search in Firefox 3.6.*. It shows two 'Flag' icons, which when pressed pronounce the word for you(In American and British accents respectively). Same is the case in Chrome. Open the same link in Firefox 4.0, it doesn't show those icons so we cannot hear the words. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Same as above. 
Actual Results:  
Don't see pronunciation icons in Firefox 4.0

Expected Results:  
Should see pronunciation icons.
