My Internet connection was broken (several times) without warning - it could not be restored without rebooting - the tray icons indicated connection - but it did not exist, ipconfig was not available, Outlook wouldn't work, nor would IE8.

Solution: I downgraded to 3.5 - all seems OK 

Reproducible: Always
