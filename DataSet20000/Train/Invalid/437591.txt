HP Credential Manager Incompatibility
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-GB; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

I use HP Credential Manager to automate logins to websites using my inbuilt fingerprint scanner. In order to do this, the software detects which application or website uses a login and I enter and confirm it. Since the release of FF3RC1 the HP software no longer detects individual webpages and instead just sees FF as being a single application.

Hopefully you can help as my security software is essential to my computer use.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to website with log-in screen. e.g. Facebook
2.Enter details
3.Credential Manager pop-up asks for confirmation of details for Mozilla Firefox and not for webpage used
Actual Results:  
Credential manager inputs details stored for only one username on every log in site.

Expected Results:  
Multiple accounts should be stored.
