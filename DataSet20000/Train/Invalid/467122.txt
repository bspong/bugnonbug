Unless i am mistaking, SVGs should work in firefox 3.0.4, but this website, that only works with SVGs doesn't think they are supported.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. just go to "http://www.stupidterminal.com/phun/PhunScripter.html" or any other svg enabled website in firefox, on mac Os 10.5.5
Actual Results:  
The website doesn't think that SVG are enabled, or they just won't display.

Expected Results:  
Displayed the SVGs
