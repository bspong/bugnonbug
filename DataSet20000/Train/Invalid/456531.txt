Icons in the bookmarks menu need padding on the right side

Bookmarks menu in Firefox 3 and native, 500%

Current there is only 1 pixel of padding on the right side of icons.  Since the native menus are also misaligned (too much padding as opposed to too little), how about we just match the padding on the left side, and have 4 pixels on either side of the icon.
