Feedview relies on non-chrome JavaScript (Feedview is broken when javascript is disabled)

Feedview cannot work on any feeds unless that site is somehow whitelisted to
allow JavaScript.  NoScript allows you to white-list, but Feedview still
requires JS enabled on any site that has an RSS feed that can be viewed with
Feedview.  Basically, we should be able to use Feedview without worrying about a
website's security options for JavaScript.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Disable JavaScript
2. View a feed with Feedview

Actual Results:  
You can only see the headers to the news stories, the sliding bar does nothing,
and clicking the headers simply takes you back to where the feed points to for
that entry.

Expected Results:  
Feedview should work on any site regardless of JavaScript options.  I'd suggest
some sort of chrome:// usage similar to how Sage views scripts.  The URL can
still be shown in the toolbar as the link to the feed, but the actual Feedview
JS should be contained within the chrome:// URIs.  If it already does this, then
there might be some compatibility issues going on with NoScript and Firefox in
which JavaScript functionality that would normally seem dependent on the browser
itself (e.g. bookmarklets) does not work when disabling JavaScript for normal
websites.
