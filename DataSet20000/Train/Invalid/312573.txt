Google Images - No image shown, only blue frame.

When I go into Google and ask for Images, only the blue frame comes up, no
image.  The words are below it as are the sized but the image is blank.  There
is no problem with Google search in general.  Just images.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enter the net via Foxfire
2.Type search criteria into Google
3.click Images
4.Search images
5. Blue boxes come up that should contain images.
6. Boxes are blank.
7. 

Actual Results:  
I get a page of results but the boxes that should hold the images are blank. 
The writing beneath each one is there but no image.

Expected Results:  
Produced a page (or more) of images that result from the search I entered in Google.

I downloaded Foxfire again and got no change in the Google Image problem.
I can get into Google Images through Explorer but I prefer to use Mozilla.

About the comment below on severity:  I chose the most correct answer but I
don't WANT to stop using Mozilla.  Just thought you'd want to know.
