Autosport is a motorsport site that adds new articles everyday.  After opening autosport website, reading and returning to homepage, I close Firefox, shut down PC. Next day, on reopening firefox, the Autosport homepage is in the state it was previously.  "Refreshing" the page does not change it even though updates have occured to the page (I have another browser open which has newer details - the other browser does refresh correctly so I don't believe it is the website).  I have only noticed this with Firefox 3.5.2

Reproducible: Always

2.shutdown pc
3.After allowing sufficient time for new articles to be added to autosport homepage (for me that was next day), start PC and reopen firefox - autosport should automatically appear with data as it was previously
4. click refresh icon
Actual Results:  
Page "refreshes" but there is no change to the information on the page

Latest page should appear

I have just closed the autosport tab and reopened the site and it still has the out of date information.  Did the same again but waited a while before reopening - latest information has now appeared
