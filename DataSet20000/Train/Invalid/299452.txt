Hi, there are times (more than normal) in the new 1.04 firefox,
that this error"cant initialize memory stream" comes up and 
firefox doesnt open, i have to restart my computer MS win 2000
a number of times to get it right, 
im a web developer, and im hooked on firefox,
wrking on IE is a pain now, ....so i was hoping this be fixed
restarting takes tooo much time.
and also firefox takes up too much memory, and CPU space,...!!!
so cant opening anything else when firfox is on is like going having a cup of
coffee and the other application is sure to open till then

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.no idea this problem seems to have a mind of its own,
2.i think its one of those error handlers that does not have the end programming
done. so "F3" the line "initialize" in the code ull get there :)
3.

Actual Results:  
alert box and when u hit ok firefox doesnt open

Expected Results:  
some thing like restart and handle the error or report bug on its own...no idea
