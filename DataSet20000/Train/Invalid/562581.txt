Java applets are not loading in firefox version 3.6.3 it was working well with version 3.0.1, I have also ensured that the java plugin is installed and it is enabled.
I encounted this problem when using Ibm rational clearquest page.

1.Access a web page which has java applets

3.

This issue happened with all the default configuration of firefox. The java applets just stopped working after i upgraded from 3.0.1 to 3.6.3
