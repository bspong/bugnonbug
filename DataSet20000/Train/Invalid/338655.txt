unknown script causes hang with stop script dialog

When using the trunk build normally, sometimes, there is a hang for a moment, then a beep or two, then the stop script dialog comes up.  I don't know why, but it comes up for no reason whatsoever.  It may have been a js error, but just in case, here is the latest error I copied from the JavaScript console:'

Error: Components.classes['@mozilla.org/uriloader/content-handler;1?type=application/x-maf'] has no properties
