Using Firefox 2.0.0.16

Average memory footprint is around 1.1 GB. Unbelievably, it was 1.8GB today.
Has any latest patches in this Firefox version caused this high memory usage?
It screws up everything. It mainly occurs when opening new tabs.

Would appreciate if someone could take a look into this issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use Firefox 2.0.0.16. Open a couple of Firefox windows, and in them 2-3 tabs in each window.
2.Do normal work. In sometime, try opening a new tab.

Browser hangs.
Look at the memory usage in task manager. Its high enough.

Expected Results:  
Memory usage should not be this high!! New tabs can be opened easily, which is one of the most attractive features of Firefox browser
