First time installs should use blank or migrated start page when installer option is unchecked.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Perform a clean installation of FF 1.0RC2 (installer version, no old profiles).
2. Uncheck "use Firefox Start as my home page" on the installation wizard dialog.
3. Let FF start and check actual home page.

expected result : home page is blank (or maybe the migrated home page from IE)

actual result : home page is the Firefox Start page.
