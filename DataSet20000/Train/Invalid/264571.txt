new items created above currently selected item, instead of below
This is a bug that's been filed before, but there was an attempted fix.  The
patch that'll be attached here is the bandaid that will ship with 1.0, that will
bring things back to the previously broken state -- bookmarks will be created
above the currently selected item, instead of below.

The reason for this is that we use the RDF Container InsertElementAt interface
here -- which, when given an index to insert at that's already occcupied, shifts
the old element forward, instead of putting this item after it.  This is a
bummer.  I tried to do some magic where the index was pre-incremented, but
InsertElementAt bails if you pass it an index that's greater than the number of
items in the container.   In either case, we have to know the item's exact
index, so that we can undo.  It's a huge pain in the ass.
