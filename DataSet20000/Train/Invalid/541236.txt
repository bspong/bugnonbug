SSL Fail to Work
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 GTB6
Build Identifier: Firefox 3.6

I've just upgraded to Firefox 3.6.
But I cannot visit some sites when using HTTPS/SSL.
After hard digging, I rollback to version 3.5.7 which works perfectly.
I tested on MacOSX and Windows and on both Firefox 3.6 FAILS ...
All the browsers (Internet Explorer 8 / Safari 4) work on accessing this URL: https://www.unix-world.org but Firefox 3.6 fails.
It shows like a connection loop. After a long wait (1 minute) shows: connection reset message.
Please note that on www.unix-world.org, only HIGH:MEDIUM SSL chipers are allowed and also have excluded SSLV2.
When I connect with Firefox 3.5.7, it shows CAMELIA-256 chiper.
With Firefox 3.6, I cannt see.
I use some applications under www.unix-world.org since 2 years ago.
Firefox 2.x, 3.0, 3.5.1 - 3.5.7 all worked perfectly (nothing changed since then).
Also now, Firefox 3.5.3 (Linux) and 3.5.7 (Mac & Windows) work PERFECT.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Access the https://www.unix-world.org [NOT WORK]
2. Downgrade to 3.5.7 Works
3. Try Other Browsers: Opera, Safari, Internet Explorer (works)
Actual Results:  
Website Load in all browsers (Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari, Firefox 2.0 - 3.0 - 3.5.3 - 3.7)
Website does NOT LOAD IN Firefox 3.6.

Expected Results:  
If website works in all other browsers includding Firefox 3.5.7, it should work also in 3.6.
I feel like is a SSL negotiation bug somewhere.
