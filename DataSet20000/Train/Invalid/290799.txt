Great difficulty logging on to any URL.even this one.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.3
Build Identifier: Same with Firefox/1.0.1;Firefox1.0.2; Firefox/1.0.3

All versions have difficulty logging on to most URL's even this one. I try with
IE and it goes to site immediately I revert back to firefox and it either hangs
or says unavailable or try again. There is definitely something wrong in this
department. I like Firefox except for this hang-up and must be corrected quickly
or I and a few others I know who suffer the same problem revert back to the
dreaded MS IE. I am using ADSL and tghis is a real pain.

Trying to send this report it came up with site could not be found I will keep
on pressing until it does

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type in Url
2.Press search
3.Can't find even to log on to Google. If I tray about ten-twenty times I
eventually get through. I am not alone in this problem, I have three friends who
have given up because of this problem. It took twenty four attempts to raise
this site, yet I got on with IE in one,



Expected Results:  
Logged on to site

If this isn't fixed by the end of this week I will go back to IE or Opera which
was my alternative browser as I hate Microsoft and Netscape.
