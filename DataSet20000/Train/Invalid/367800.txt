doc.location.href wrong when opening in a new tab

I haven't switched to 2.0 due to compatability issues with some extensions I have.  However, users of my app say that it happens in 2.0 as well.

I have an extension that uses:
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', myFunc, true);

and then a function:
function myFunc() {
   	var doc = window._content.document;
	alert(doc.location.href);
}

If I open a link in the current window or a new window, the correct doc.location.href (the page I navigated to) is displayed.

If I open in a new tab, doc.location.href incorrectly contains the location of the referrer page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Follow things outlined in details.
Actual Results:  
The doc.location.href for the referring page is shown.

Expected Results:  
The doc.location.href for the current page is shown.
