New installation of Firefox 1.5.0.7, the program window does not open, though task manager states program is running.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.5.0.7 (new installation in Windows XP pro SP2) program window does not open

After a fresh installation of Firefox 1.5.0.7 (AMD 2500+ computer, Windows XP pro SP2, 1GB RAM), when offered the opportunity to start the program, the program window does not open.  When double-clicking the program icon, the program window does not open.  After rebooting the computer and double-clicking the Firefox icon, the program window does not open.  In ALL cases of trying to start the program I open the task manager to verify that the program is in fact running, and it is...but there is NO program window showing.  Currently, the program is uninstalled.  I have not attempted to load a previous version of Firefox because I cannot locate one to download and install.

Reproducible: Always
