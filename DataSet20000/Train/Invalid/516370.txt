Firefox 3.5 always sets cookies on https Websites as "Encrypted connections only"

When I'm on a https page and the page ssets a normal Cookie "for any type of sessions"

see the corresponding "Live http headers" order from the website :
"Set-Cookie: language=de; Domain=.post.ch; Max-Age=31449600; Path="/"; Version=1; HttpOnly"

Firefox 3.5 sets a secure cookie (Firefox 3.0.7 didn't, it wrote a normal "for any type of session" cookie)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. clear cash + cookies
2. navigate to a https page who sets a "non secure" cookie (I can't give the example because it needs a password)
3. 
Actual Results:  
Look in the cookies : it's "secure" i.e. for "encrypted connections only"

(I've had a look on it with the add-on "Live http headers" where I can see that the page sends the request right)

Expected Results:  
The cookie should be written like with Firefox 3.0.7 : "for any type of session" and not only for "Encrypted".
