The old Firefox 1.0.6 worked perfect. When you click compose or reply it would
move the cursor into the reply box so you could just begin typing.  This new
version it does not.

Also when you click Bookmarks, right click any entry and select Delete the
bookmarks menu is not re-selectable right away. When you delete and go to click
Bookmarks again to select another entry (either to go to that bookmark or to
delete another) you click it, and it highlights as if it is going to drop down,
but does not. Then you click bookmarks again, and it unhighlights as if it was
closed.  Third time you click it, it will work fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
