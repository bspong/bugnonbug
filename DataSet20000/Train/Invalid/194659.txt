mouse movements leads to unexpected events (new windows opening/moving forward and backwards)

I tend to mess w/ the mouse a lot, call it a nervous habit, primarily
highlighting and unhighlighting text, clicking randomly (not on hypertext
links), etc.

I've noticed that quiet frequently this leads to new blank windows opening
spontanously, or the browser moving back a few web pages, etc.

Also highlighting on text stays "lit" despite left clicking elsewhere on page
away from the highlit portion... this should deslect the highlighted text, but
it doesn't.

So, without the built in popup blocker and the tabbed browsing, I'd already be
gone as a user based on these highly annoying anomalies.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. highlight some text, try to deselect the highlight by left clicking elsewhere
in the page, not on other text or hypertext links, and the prior passage will
remain lit... 
2. !clue how to reproduce the page opening/forward/backwards anomalie... but
does lead to me losing text I've typed in frequently--enough to drive me back
into using opera 7, even though it won't work w/ A LOT of web pages... sigh
3.



Expected Results:  
dehighlited text/not skipped around like a crack head (stay still page! Take my
mouse clicking punishment without fleeing to a new blank window or regressing to
an old, previously viewed page!
