Using the Azureus Bittorrent client makes Firefox unable to connect to any web site
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

When I start up the Azureus Bittorrent client, and then try to use Firefox to access a website, Firefox with indefinitely become stuck at "Looking up www.google.com..." This is not a crash, all other aspects of Firefox work (menus, preferences, etc.)

Exiting Azureus does not help and restarting Firefox does not help. I do not belieive that Azureus is affecting the network connection because Internet Explorer and Thunderbird work without problems. (And the problem is forcing me to use Internet Explorer on a daily basis)

The only thing that fixes the problem is rebooting my computer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Azureus
2. Open Firefox
3.

Actual Results:  
Firefox will not load the website (or apparently even successfully connect to it)

Expected Results:  
Loading the website

I run several extensions, Talkback, Mouse Gestures, Adblock, PDF Download, del.icio.us, and Flashblock. Disabling them does not help.
