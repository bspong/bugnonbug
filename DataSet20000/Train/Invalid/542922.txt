Installing add-on (attached) means no sidebar content (including bookmarks/history) is displayed
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; Tablet PC 2.0)

Installing the attached add-on (by adding a file in the extensions folder pointing the minimal add-on source) results in;

* the add-on sidebar is empty (hotkey cntl-M)
* the bookmark sidebar is empty (even on opening/closing several times)
* the history sidebar is empty (even on opening/closing several times)

Removing the add-on and restarting FF restores access to the bookmark/history sidebars.

Whilst the add-on is installed, no errors are displayed to the console and/or error console (with console^2 installed)

BTW If the current release of the add-on (from property-bee.com/downloads/2.0.6.1/property-bee.xpi) is installed over the test case, the sidebar remains blank, even tho I have tested 2.0.6.1 with FF3.6 and know it works as expected)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a blank profile, verify bookmark & history sidebars display

2. Quit FF, unzip attached and copy the {da8bd68d-8e90-41cd-8345-a71b294e72e6} file to {profile}/extenstions and update the path within to point to the source

3. Start FF, bookmarks, history and add-on sidebar (control M) are all blank

4. Browse chrome://property-bee/content/ui/sidebar.xul and the sidebar xul is loaded in the tab correctly without errors.

5. Uninstall the add-on, and restart FF - the bookmark/history sidebars now contain info again
Actual Results:  
See above

Expected Results:  
Bookmark/history and add-on sidebars should all display correctly when opened.

I believe 
* the XUL (and associated files) are correct as it opens without error via the chrome:// url
* incase of an id clash I've tried renaming all id="xx"'s in the XUL to id="yy_xx" without any affect.
* I've cut the XUL down to a minimal <window></window> and it still occurs.

Its not just a case of the add-on sidebar not opening, but its affecting the bookmark/history sidebars, so raising as a bug in FF
