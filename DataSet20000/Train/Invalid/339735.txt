Improve UI for adding search engines detected from <link rel...>
The red magnifying glass when a <link rel...> OpenSearch engine is found in a <link rel...> tag on a page is both too subtle and misleading.

At a minimum, the drop-down triangle should be red rather than the magnifying glass, since that's what you click to see the "Add Engine" menu item.  Even better, some more obvious (but not too intrusive) UI notification should be added instead.  Change the drop-down triangle to a big red + sign?  Change the background color of the whole searchbox?
