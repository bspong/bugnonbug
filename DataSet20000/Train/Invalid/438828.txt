When site is shown, clicking on either upper or side menu links does not open new content. Page just gets reloaded.
Also, switching from this tab to another and back forces reload of page.

There are also a bunch of other sites with the same problem, but many of them are password-protected (ACEProject bug tracking system, for example)

Does work in 2.x and IE 6.
