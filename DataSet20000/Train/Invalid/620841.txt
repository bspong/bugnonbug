Page navigation and other shortcut keys don't work

For quite a while now, many of the shortcut keys have stopped working in the Firefox nightlies on Linux. All page navigation keys have stopped working (arrows, page up/down, home/end, etc.), as have focus-switching keys (tab/shift+tab) and the copy shortcut (ctrl+v for paste is ok).

Firefox does seem to be picking up the keys, as evidenced by tab closing the auto-complete pop-up in a form entry, but not actually focusing the next widget.

Pages also can still react to these keys, so Google Reader's shortcut keys (including the arrow keys) work correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Go to any page that requires scrolling and try to use the keyboard to scroll. Alternatively, go to any page that has multiple form entries and try to tab between them.
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens, or at most, auto-complete pop-ups disappear.

Expected Results:  
I would expect these keys to work, as they have in previous versions of Firefox.

I've tried disabling all extensions, to no avail.
