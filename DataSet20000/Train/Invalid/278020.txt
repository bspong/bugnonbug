  At the end of 1/10/2004 I left my computer on. Coming back the next morning
the homepage was reset to Google and all boomarks were gone. The browser
appeared as it did when first installed without any of my set preferences. No
updates or changes were made to the browser. Even the default theme was in use
instead of Safer Fox
  Possible security problem? My system is protected by a router firewall as well
as F-Secure firewall and the latest updates to F-Secure anti-virus.

Reproducible: Didn't try
