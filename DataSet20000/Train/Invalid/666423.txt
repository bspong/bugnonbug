Typing alias into URL bar now redirects to unexpected domain

Before I upgraded to Firefox 5.0 I used to be able to type the alias ("mylc") of my internally hosted web server into the URL bar and it would resolve correctly.  Now when I type "mylc" into the URL bar it redirects me to www.mylc.com.  Firefox 4.0 and below work fine, it's only Firefox 5.0 that is causing this issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup DNS alias for internal web server
2. Type alias into url bar
3.

Actual Results:  
Redirects to incorrect domain www.<alias>.com

Expected Results:  
Should've redirected to the resolved domain for the "mylc" alias
