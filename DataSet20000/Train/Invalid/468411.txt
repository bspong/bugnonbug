I had 34 RSS feeds in Firefox 2.  No version of 3 (I have tried it to 3.0.4) yet loads new news, even if I delete and re-subscribe to feeds (or at least they stop again within a day--I checked that many had new news.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Uninstall Firefox 2.0.0.x (but its directories in your home directory stay.)
2. Install or compile Firefox 3 - 3.0.4
3. Try to use RSS--it will not update.
Actual Results:  
Use RSS, and upgrade from Firefox 2 to 3 binary or source. (keep your mozilla/firefox home directories.)

Expected Results:  
I could not read new RSS news with the 1st Firefox 3.  Then I tried it with every new version, sometimes reinstalling.

updated RSS.
