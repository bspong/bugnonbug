<EMBED> tag not defined in XHTML spec

This is not a bug per se, but rather a failure to adhere to W3C standards. Many bugs have been reported involving plugins, but no one seems to have mentioned the fact that the EMBED tag is not defined in the XHTML standard in the first place. Consequently, any page which includes the EMBED tag fails validation. Unfortunately, Firefox will not render a plugin at all when only the OBJECT tag is used. This is disappointing in an otherwise outstanding browser that is loudly touted as being standards compliant.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Submit the URI of any page containing an EMBED tag to the W3C Markup Validator.
2. Read the results.

Actual Results:  
The pages failed XHTML validation.

Expected Results:  
The software should implement the XHTML standard correctly by supporting the OBJECT tag for plugins.
