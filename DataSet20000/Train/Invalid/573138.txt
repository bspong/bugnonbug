h# elements spaced with line-height instead of margin/padding
When I encounter a (for example) H1 element that runs to a second line, there is a very large vertical gap between them.  My guess is that the internal default stylesheet alters line-height for these elements.  It should, instead, increase the top/bottom margin and/or padding.  Doing so would preserve the inter-line spacing correctly, while still keeping adjacent elements away.
