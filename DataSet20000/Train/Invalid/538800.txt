Under tool-options-tabs the "When I open a link in a new tab, switch to it immediately" options is not checked.

However, when I right click a link and click "open link in a new tab", the browser switches to the new tab. If I check it, I get the same behavior

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the option window (Tools menu)
2. Select tabs, and make sure When I open a link in a new tab, switch to it immediately" is not checked
3. Click OK
4. Go to any web page with a link. 
5. Right click a link and select "open link in a new tab"

Actual Results:  
The browser shows the new open tab

Expected Results:  
The new tab should open in background, and keep the focus on the current tab

This bug occurs on my Vista x64 px.
On another PC running XP (same FF version) doesn't happen.
