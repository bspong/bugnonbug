After loading your stupid toolbar, a URL link was changed.

I stupidly added your chrome 'darkside' toolbar and it switched my latest Yahoo email url attachment to the most previous, which was totally inappropriate to the letter.  This is a woman I am dating and want to marry.

Fix it.  NOW. 

Reproducible: Didn't try

Actual Results:  
This has happened only once, but it's a bad thing.

Expected Results:  
Don't get cute with me.  

It should not have changed the URL on my email from one YouTube video to another.

I have always trusted you guys, and this really pisses me off, since the woman in recipient of the email is my fiancée, and one sent video gives a very different message from the other.

FIX IT or expect a big lawsuit.
