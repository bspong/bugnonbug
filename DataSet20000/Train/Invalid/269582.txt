There are no "OK" or "Cancel" buttons in my Options UI, and so I am unable to
save any changes I make (since clicking on the X closes the window without
saving settings).  It seems to be a problem related to Tabbrowser Preferences
(version 0.9.97), since the bug goes away when I uninstall or disable this
extension.  I am using Firefox 1.0 (the official release, not PR or RC1/RC2)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have Tabbrowser Preferences installed and enabled.
2.Open the Options dialog with Tools>Options.
3.

Actual Results:  
I am missing the "OK" and "Cancel" buttons in the Options window.

Expected Results:  
The "OK" and "Cancel" buttons should appear at the bottom of the Options dialog.
