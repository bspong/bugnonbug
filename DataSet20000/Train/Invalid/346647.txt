Click on Print to access print version of the page. Page loads but nothing is visible. Same thing happens in IE and Opera, so it may be an evangelism thing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to page
2.Click print to get print version of page
3.

Actual Results:  
Print version of page does not appear, so no printing is possible.

Expected Results:  
Recieve print version of page so it can be read or printed out.

As noted, may be evangelism as Opera 8.54 and IE 6 are both doing the same thing. Still, this is the first time I have ever seen this bug. Looking at source, it appears to be calling a url where the print version is. However, the browser does not receive a 404 or File Not Found when the browser apparently goes to this page. The page loads, but it is blank. Furthermore, there is nothing in the source either. May just be idiotic web coding, I have no idea.
