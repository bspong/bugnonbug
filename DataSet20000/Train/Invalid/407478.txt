The DVD drive and CD drive have disappeared from the "My Computer" devices with removable storage.  this occurred after installing Fire4fox 2.0.0.7 onto the XP operating system.  Tried 'System Restore' option on WinXP with no success. Occasionally the two devices will reappear, and when I checked them with the 'Device Manager', it was indicated that both burners were functioning. When the DVD/CD device reappeared I put a blank CD in the device to burn some data onto it.  The system crashed with the message of "MACHINE CHECK EXCEPTION' and several technical info codes, which I wrote down.  I was not able to find a source for what those codes meant. I tried returning to the Mozilla browser before @.0.0.7, but still could not retrieve DVD and CD burners.
Checked the "event Viewer" in administrative Tools and a number warnings and code red events appear to have happened, but don't know what a lot of that stuff means.  
Also, Linux which is on a partition, is now stuck at the "checking battery" line of uploading.
Checked OS with antivirus and sbybot, and there were a couple of things which had to be removed to the "chest", but no malware appears at this time.
