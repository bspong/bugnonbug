Support javascript in search plugins

I write searchplugins for my organization. There are few weblinks wherein i 
need to append a ':' between the user value and input name. For example 
field=par:user. I hope this example is clear. `field' is the input name, 
`user' is the value passed and `par' is an identifier. If few basic javascripts 
are allowed this would be of great help.
