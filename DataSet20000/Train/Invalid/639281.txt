Received "Prop Res DLL not loaded" when trying to print PDF to Lexmark Z55. Firefox crashes as can't get rid of error without end task. Managed to work around error by using Microsoft fix, adding printer driver folder to system variables. not longer happens able to print. Wasn't getting any print errors with firefox 3.6.

Reproducible: Always




able to work around error with another fix
