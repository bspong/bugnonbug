Hi, this morning i opened
http://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?product=evolution. This page is huge and
took some time and a lot of memory too load, that's OK. Then i closed its tab. I
kept browsing for 30minutes (on various websites) but mozilla never returned
memory to the system.

7745 benoit    15   0  418m 250m  16m S  0.0 49.8   5:09.97 firefox-bin

Number of entries: 	540
Maximum storage size: 	21504 KiB
Storage in use: 	20843 KiB
Inactive storage: 	15476 KiB

Moreover, firefox memory pages were not swapped, so my system was lacking free
memory. I had to restart firefox to get my memory back.

May be firefox is not able to return memory to the system, but i would have
expect unused memory to be swapped...

Before restarting firefox, i re-opened the huge webpage.

Then i closed the tab, opened a new tab, browsed a few pages (for 5 minutes).

Again, i re-opened the huge webpage and closed it
