Popups for user-initiated keypress events are blocked

If you want to use Google Reader without having set an exception for pop-ups on google.com, posts cannot be opened in a new window/tab. The action is initiated by a user and shouldn't be blocked.

Steps:
1. Open http://www.google.com/reader/ and login
2. Subscribe to at least one feed
3. Open the feed and select a post
4. Press 'v' to open the full story

With step 4 you will notice that the creation of the new window/tab is blocked. An alert is displayed and the pop-up blocker notification bar appears. Here the alert message from Google Reader itself:

"Grrr! A popup blocker may be preventing Google Reader from opening the page. If you have a popup blocker, try disabling it to open the window."

As Marco pointed out, he was probably also able to see that a while ago while using gmail chat.
