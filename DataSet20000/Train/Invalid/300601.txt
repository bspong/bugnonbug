If a page has an empty stylesheet href (<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
href="" />), the current page is downloaded again, and used as a css file.
OK, this is an error in the html file, and the href is used as a relative link
to the current location (except when it begins with http://, etc.), but an empty
string could also mean: "no css file, please".
And if the page does some server side functions, it could be a bad thing to load
it two times.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create an html file with <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="" /> in
the head
2. view it

Actual Results:  
the page is downloaded two times, the second as the stylesheet file

Expected Results:  
the file should not load again as the stylesheet file (no css files should load)
