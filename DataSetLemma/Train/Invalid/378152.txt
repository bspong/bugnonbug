digest authentication against (squid) proxy re-prompts for password needlessly

I'm not 100 % sure whether this is a bug in Firefox or in squid, but since IE6 (seems to) work correctly I'm going to assume (for the moment) that it's a bug in FF. Basically, my squid proxy is configured to allow all requests, except google.co.za to pas through without authentication being required, however, you must be authenticated to access google.co.za (test setup). Now, the first time I try to access www.google.co.za it correctly prompt me for credentials, however, when the given nonce_max_duration expires I'm re-prompted for authentication details, even though the cached credential (or cached H(A1) value - depending on what FF actually caches) should work just fine.

These are the header (using tcpdump + wireshark) that I see:

This is obviously fine, no credential provided, access rejected, FF is provided with realm and nonce value and can now prompt for username/password, after which this conversation take place:

Great! We retrieved our webpage. Very nice, we can now browse, for a while at least, at which time this happens:

At this point FF against prompt for username/password. I suspect that it may actually be squid that is in the wrong here, it should probably set stale=true?

Point being that IE6 work and FF doesn't. So I'd recommend the following action, we have credentials, so since the nonce that got sumitted differs from the new one in the challenge, we can first retry with the new nonce, and if that fails again - prompt for new credentials. Basically this put credential in a binary state "confirmed" or "tentative". When initially prompted they go into tentative, they get submitted, if we get OK they are confirmed, else they get discarded and obviously re-prompted. if confirmed credential fail, they go into tentative and retried with the new nonce value, handling a previously.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
Get prompted every 10 minute for credential even though they haven't changed.

Expected Results:
To only be prompted the first time, or when the credential really doe fail.

The relevant part of my squid config:

auth_param digest program /usr/libexec/squid/digest_pw_auth /tmp/digest_hashes
auth_param digest child 1
auth_param digest concurrency 0
auth_param digest nonce_garbage_interval 5 minute
auth_param digest nonce_max_duration 10 minute
auth_param digest nonce_max_count 50
auth_param digest nonce_strictness off
auth_param digest check_nonce_count on
auth_param digest post_workaround off
auth_param digest realm proxy
