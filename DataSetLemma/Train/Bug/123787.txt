Mozilla crash when launched from a NFS mounted volume [@PrefNameBuffer::FreeAllBuffers]
From Bugzilla Helper:
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.12; Mac_PowerPC)
BuildID: 2002020411

Will launch from a local HFS+ volume, but if I try to launch it from my home
directory (which is NFS mounted) mozilla crashes.

If tried to track the problem further down, below is a gdb Session excerpt.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. mount the disc image
2. copy the distribution to a NFS mounted volume
3. launch mozilla via the finder or the terminal

Actual Results: The browser start up, show an empty splash screen
and then exit with no reason given.

Expected Results: Should start up correctly

Might go together with Bug #122484 or Bug #104954
