About half of the UI/events randomly stop working
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:43.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/43.0
Build ID: 20151216131022

Steps to reproduce:

I'm unable to find a way to reproduce, it looks completely random. But when it happens, it lasts for a while (even between kill/restart of firefox) and then the problem disappear as it came. It basically happens randomly while browsing websites.

I have absolutely no idea how to debug this in a meaningful way, but since it happens often, I can likely provide any requested additional information.

Note: I'm using Linux, issue is reproducible with intel and nvidia drivers, and was also reproducible with firefox 42 (and maybe earlier) which were using gtk2.


Actual results:

Sometimes, the scroll becomes extremely slow: that is, several seconds (3 to 6 I'd say) for one mouse scroll wheel event to be effective. But Firefox is *not* lagging: htop shows no CPU usage, and I can actually scroll smoothly by grabbing the scroll with the mouse. Only the wheel seems to have this effect.

But that's not the only that breaks: I can't right click anywhere anymore, and many buttons such as the ones in the menu bar are not reacting at all. Though, I can switch tab instantly and the of Firefox seems to react relatively fine. It's just that more than half of the UI becomes unusable. The "smart bar" doesn't look smart anymore either but is actually working. The webpages are also reactive.

What should I be looking for?

Note: I tried disabling smooth scrolling and hw acceleration but it doesn't change the problem at all.
