Steps to reproduce:

I have a website in Intranet which uses iframes. All pages inside iframes use jquery 1.11.1.


Actual results:

When page is loaded from the parent, I'm having console errors such as "ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined" or "ReferenceError: $ is not defined". This is an intermittent issue and would seem to be related to the cacheing mechanism. (Succeeding page loads produces error in any or all of the iframe sources). Loading the actual page inside the iframes does not exhibit the errors. This results in Bootstrap framework, Datatables and other javascript plugins not working properly. I even tried using head.js to load jquery first but got "ReferenceError: head is not defined" instead.


Expected results:

There was no problem loading the pages (iframes) in FF31 and below. Now in FF32, When I disable cacheing (Never remember history) or "Disable Cache *" under Developer Tools, the page (with iframes) loads without any problem.
