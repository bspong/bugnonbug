Currently when you have a proxy server set which needs a password, firefox 
prompts you to save the password and subsequently pre-fills it - great - 
expected, wanted.

But when it you first start it up and it finds updates for add ons the 
remembered information module is not used ... be good to use that in this 
case too.

Can send screen shots if more explanation is required.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. set up a proxy which needs a password, set browser to remember password
2. add a test add on via a web site u control - does not need to do anything just hello world
3. update add on 
4. close browser (or maybe first this then step 3)
5. restart browser should want to go to to the web, will ask you for credentials but remembered credentials will not be there.
Actual Results:  
remembered credentials will not be there

Expected Results:  
remembered credentials should be there in all cases even when starting up and no main window is up, browser is updating add ons in the background. maybe it should update after main window comes up when there is a proxy and then prompt to restart to enable add on changes
