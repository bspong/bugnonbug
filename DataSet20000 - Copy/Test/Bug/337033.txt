All graphics at etrade.com are invisible, unless I right-click and select "View Image".  When I highlight the entire page by dragging the mouse, I can see a "shadow" where the graphic is supposed to appear.  NOTE: I do not have Flash Player, but I doubt this is the problem because the images are ordinary GIFs.  





Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Go to etrade.com. 
Actual Results:  
I see this:

If I drag the mouse over the entire surface, i.e. select all, I see this (the highlighting appears gray because I captured it from another application; it's actually navy blue):

Expected Results:  
The graphic that should have been present in the highlighted square (just like every other GIF on the entire site):

This has happened for as long as I can remember, back to Mozilla.  My friend has WindowsXP with Flash Player 7, and it doesn't have the problem (same version of Firefox), but I don't know if those differences actually matter.
