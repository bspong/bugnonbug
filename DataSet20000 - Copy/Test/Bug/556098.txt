Well, In the last days I've noticed problems loading images display on orkut. Mozilla Firefox (tested on other browsers and had no problem) is having problem in loading the images display the profiles of users. I've the version 3.6.2 of Firefox installed on my Windows 7 x86. I've been communicating that is not just me with this problem, users known firefox I also reported this same problem. We were unable to view some images display orkut. Appearing both in the contact list, as in the scrapbook, also lists of statements. Sometimes pictures are exchanged, some users appear with the image of others. Check it please!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the orkut home page;
2.check the images of your contacts in: Contact List, Scrapbook list, and statements list. 
3.You see that some images not appear, other is exchanged, with others user's image!
Actual Results:  
Some users appear without image. Some users appear with others users image.

Expected Results:  
Some algorithm is blocking to load some user image. I don´t now much about the source-code mozilla. But, It need to check, because this occurs after I get the last update (3.6 to 3.6.2)

This bug need a excepcional attention because the number of orkut user linked in mozilla firefox.
