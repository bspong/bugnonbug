When opening a local file an additional toolbox window appears

when opening a page hosted on my local computer by pressing the "preview in firefox" button in Adobe Dreamweaver CS3, Firefox will occasionally create an additional toolbox styled window. The window will have a title bar labeled with the page name and a white content area about 200 x 50 pixels that you cannot close/interact with. However if you close the file you are viewing(in my case i am opening .html files) the window disappears. This does not happen in the current stable release(3.6.8) that i am also running on this computer.

This may or may not be a Firefox issue but an Adobe issue instead.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open an html file in Adobe Dreamweaver CS3
2.Press the Preview in Firefox Button
3.Look at the top left of your desktop screen to see the white box.
Actual Results:  
the white box appears and the only way i can close it is by closing the document in Firefox.

Expected Results:  
The white box would not appear in the first place. it doesn't seem to serve any purpose.

I am using the default theme, tabs on top.
I have the alpha build of firebug installed (1.6X.0b1).
