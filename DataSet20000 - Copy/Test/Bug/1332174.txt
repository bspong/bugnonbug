Location Bar Search Terms Containing Slashes Not Redirected to Search After NXDOMAIN

Steps to reproduce:

Type a search term containing a forward slash into the location bar, e.g. "test/search" or "Apache/2.2.3 (Red Hat)" without quotes.

Search suggestions in location bar is disabled, as default.


Actual results:

The preview dropdown shows "Search with <Default Provider>" as if it is going to send the typed text as a search query, but when I press enter, it redirects to my ISP's DNS error page, implying that the typed query was incorrectly interpreted and sent as a DNS request instead of a search query.

What is also odd is that this behaviour seems inconsistent; "testdomain/search" was correctly sent as a search when I tested it, but a keyboard mash followed by "/search" was sent as a DNS request.


Expected results:

The typed entries should have been sent to the search engine as a query, not parsed as a domain to be resolved by DNS.

Also, the action listed in the preview dropdown when typing in the location bar should always match the action that is actually being performed when input is entered.
