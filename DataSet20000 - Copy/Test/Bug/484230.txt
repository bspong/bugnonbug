In this URL, there is a problem with the Persits component, so the image doesnt show. As per spec, for the standards people, if the image cannot be shown, then the ALT text is supposed to be shown right? That is not showing here. Why? Is it because the IMG SRC is a asp file and not a image file type?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to URL
2. Try to find item image
3. ALT text missing. Item image cant load because of server component problem
Actual Results:  
ALT text doesnt show if image is missing or cant be loaded 

Expected Results:  
ALT text to show. IE7 shows the ALT text with the symbol for the missing image.

Now before getting hit by people here, I am not saying because IE7 shows this as expected, Firefox should show also. But one needs to compare how other major browsers are handling the same thing.

You need to be fast in verifying this particualr problem, because I will be replacing the server component to get the image to show.
