When dragging and dropping a dynamically created image (php script), filename is wrong.

If you try and save an image that was generated by a .php file, with the proper
headers to tell the browser the filename:

Pragma: cache
Content-type: image/jpeg
Content-Disposition: inline; filename="test.jpg"
Cache-control: private

... then the filename in the save as dialog box will indeed be "test.jpg".
However, if you drag this image and drop it in another window, it will think
that the name of the image is the name of the .php file, not the content of the
content-disposition header. I have created a page to show this, which I'll
outline in steps to reproduce.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. goto http://jobe.ca/~jobe/rot/
2. click and drag the image to a Windows Explorer window

Actual Results:  
See that the filename saved in windows explorer is "img.php". However, if you
right click and save the file instead, it will try to save as test.jpg, so I
know the header is working.

Expected Results:  
The file should have been saved as test.jpg, not img.php
