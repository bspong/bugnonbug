Sorry, I have been slow to report this, but now it's just plain annoying these days...

When opening a new browser window after authenticating against a password protected website (in the original web browser window); the bookmarks in the Bookmarks Toolbar in the 2nd browser window do not appear.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. launch Firefox
2. authenticate against a password protected site (LDAP, AD, etc...) (HINT: accessing a password protected file directory will make this happen with ease)
3. after authentication, open a 2nd browser window
4. (BUG) verify that the bookmarks in the Bookmarks Toolbar do not appear
5. quit Firefox
6. relaunch Firefox
7. open a 2nd browser window again and verify that step 4 does not occur
Actual Results:  
when authenticating against a password protected website, etc... when opening a 2nd browser window, the bookmarks in the Bookmarks Toolbar do not appear.

Expected Results:  
Bookmarks in the Bookmarks toolbar should always appear.
