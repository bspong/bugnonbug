Location bar loses keystrokes while trying to autocomplete

I just loaded up FF3.  I discovered the unfortunate location bar change - I understand what the FF team is trying to do, and I have no problem with that.  I just wish I could use it!

I realize that I now need to type more characters to get the URL I want, because the new location bar prefers to put unrelated items at the top of its autocompletion.  I'm a pretty fast typist, and the FF team has determined that I really want it this way, so I'll deal with it.

What I can't deal with is that it loses keystrokes!  While it's busy finding me autocompletions I don't want, it's losing my keystrokes and making me go back and correct things.  That's unacceptable.  If you're going to make me type out the entire URL, at least let me type it the first time.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I go to type something like "google.com/calendar/render"
2. I end up with "googe.com/caendar/render"



Expected Results:  
I expect that what I type makes it into the location bar!

This new autocomplete is way slower than FF2, and I suspect it's so busy hunting for things I don't want, it forgets to check the event queue.
