Textarea captures mouse (begins selecting text) when clicking its label

When clicking on the right of a textarea that is 'inside' or 'over' its label (due to CSS) and maybe in other cases, the mouse is trapped by the textarea. I mean, you click on the blank area next to the textarea, then you move your mouse over the default text in the textarea and here you can see that the text is being selected when the mouse gets over it, just like if you press the mouse button. When the text is selected, you may want to delete it, but you can't because of this bug: you'll have to click another time in the textarea to 'release' the mouse and get the expected behaviour.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the page on the given URL :)
2. Click in the gray area, on the right of the textarea (some pixels up from the 'browse button')
3. Move the mouse over the text in the textarea
Actual Results:  
If you did it the right way (the buggy way), you should see that moving the mouse over the text selects it, and in a strange way (mouse trap)

Expected Results:  
We expect a click in a blank area of a form doesn't have any effect.

It seems that this is linked to the fact that the textarea is *over* its own label. This can be easily viewed using the Web Developper addon for firefox
