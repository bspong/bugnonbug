Various stability / response-time and other problems

Here's a list of some of the events/problems I continue to have :

1. FF is sometimes unreponsive - freezes for maybe 1-2 seconds between links
2. FF sometimes crashes ( 5 times so far ) - reports send to Mozilla
3. Closing FF often does not close the process
4. Memory usage still high - usually over 100MB
5. After "first" loading FF, and after loading a "second" page/link, the BACK-ARROW remains inactive , i.e. as if the current page was the "first" page to have been loaded
6. Sometimes this (5) effect appears during a longer session, i.e. not only on the first page
7. the 100% cpu-time problem seems to have abated - at least I haven't noticed it since the last troubles some weeks ago

Reproducible: Sometimes




I have Win2K SP4 installed.
The previous FF verions worked fine - but since updating to 1.5.0.1, the above small irritations have appeared !

What happens most of the time is that between links ( loading a new page ), FF more often than not appears to "freeze" - and only frees itself once the new page is near completion !
All instances of FF freeze by the way - not just the one where the new page was loaded !

I have Symantec Antivirus running and Sygate Persoanl Firewall.
A few plugins are installed - but have also tried removing them to see if the situation gets better - to no effect ! ..and therefore reinstakked them again.

The problem is not critical but spoils the pleasure of using an excellent product !

Cheers
