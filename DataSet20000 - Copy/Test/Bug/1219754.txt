Search engine results in the location bar hurt awesomebar's usability for finding visited pages
Before search suggestions, I used to rely on the awesome bar for finding pages I had visited before quite heavily by typing a few words inside it, and the visited page used to be usually listed in one of the 12 entries.

Now, when I do the same thing, I always get one entry in there saying "Search with Yahoo", and usually a few search suggestions, and I typically don't get more than 5-6 history entries, so most of the 12 entries in the awesome bar auto complete lose their value to me.  (The exact numbers are hard to pin down since the behavior seems to be different every single time, even when typing the exact same words.  I can't really tell what the underlying algorithm is.)

As a result, I find myself more and more often using the History sidebar (something that I haven't used in years!) but that's really not the same since it doesn't take frecency into account.  You can either sort by date or most visited but not by frecency.

As a result of all of this, I can't really find many visited pages, so the awesomebar's original functionality seems to go away with search suggestions.

Perhaps we can go back to showing 12 results from your history, and any search suggestions would be shown additionally?
