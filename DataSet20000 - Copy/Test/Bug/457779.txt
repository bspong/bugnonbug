Javascript fails to load when pressing enter with cursor in URL bar.  Clicking refresh button or Cmd+R both load javascript successfully.

I am using javascript to create tabbed navigation within a single page.  When I go to the page listed above I can click between tabs successfully.  If I use the keyboard shortcut 'cmd+R' or click the browser refresh button I can click through the tabs successfully.  When I put my cursor in the URL bar and press enter to refresh the javascript fails to execute and I cannot click through the tabs.  Clicking the browser refresh or 'cmd+r' shortcut solves the problem.  The link I have included is a stripped down version of the original and validates as Strict XHTML.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.richcontent.tv/test/jsPage/index.php (tabs work can be clicked on)
2. Place you cursor in the URL bar and press enter.
3. Tabs no longer work
Actual Results:  
You will not be able to click on the tabs to change the data on screen

Expected Results:  
You should be able to click on the tabs available and change the info on the screen

I thought this was possibly related to an extension (I run firebug 1.2.1, and Delicious Bookmarks 2.0.104) but I disabled all everything and was still getting the same issue.
