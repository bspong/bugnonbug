When the browser crashes and restarts with about:sessionrestore and you click the "restore tabs' button twice (because of system lag, accident, etc.) it reloads all tabs twice.  For me this has always been creating two duplicate windows full of 20 or so tabs.  It seems very unlikely that this behavior would ever

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get about:sessionrestore screen
2. Click restore button twice
Actual Results:  
All tabs open up twice.

Expected Results:  
All tabs should open up once or give you a warning that you are about to open all of your tabs twice (since steps to reproduce would be overwhelmingly accidental).

This is between minor and trivial.  It has been a minor annoyance twice.  In some sense it could be seen as a 'feature' given more options to the user but if this is the case I recommend a dialog box of some sort asking "are you sure you want to restore the same session twice?" just like we have for when you open all 40 tabs in a folder on the bookmarks toolbar.
