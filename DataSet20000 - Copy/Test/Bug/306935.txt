Firefox not only opens AOL, it crashes when it does. Needs to be shut down and reopened.

There is no site inparticular that causes firefox to do this. I can be on a site
and all of a sudden, AOL starts up. Firefox continues to be in an "active" mode
but any pages that are loading stop and say "done" in the status bar and any new
pages that I attempt to load say "done" immediately in the status bar.I can't
even use Firefox now. It crashes at least once every 5 minutes. This only
started happening a week or two ago. (Today is 9/2/05)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just start surfin'.
2.It might do it after one page, it might do it after 10 pages, but it will happen.
3.

Actual Results:  
AOL sign-on screen comes up on the screen over the site I am currently on.

Expected Results:  
Surfing in Firefox shouldn't open AOL. That however, is not the main problem.
The problem is that when this does happen, Firefox crashes.

This happens with any theme. I have used Firefox with 5 different themes.
