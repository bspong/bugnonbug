This site has given me problems since day one. I always have to open VPC and
then use the site to get anything done. When registering at the site I couldn't
input my birthdate because it wouldn't open the "calendar" on the site. Now my
birthdate shows on the order page but it seems like Firefox (and IE for Mac,
Opera, Netscape, and iCab) can't go beyond that because I keep getting a "You
must be 21 years of age to order from us. Please select your birthdate from the
calendar." error. I'm thinking this could just be some bad coding on the sites
part (ie. limiting use to Windows PCs only). If so is there a work around? If
not, I think I have a loooong email to send these people.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in
2. Select order
3. Click check out
4. Click continue on next page (which is the URL I submitted)

Actual Results:  
I can go no further

Taken me to a page showing my order and payment options.
