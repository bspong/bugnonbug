Element Properties dialog with long data: URL locks up Win2k

When an image that has been included inline as an object is above a certain size
threshhold, bringing up the Element Properties dialog box (right click and
select Properties from the context menu) causes the entire system to hang. A
slightly smaller image does not cause this to happen. As far as I can tell, the
threshhold above which this occurs is somewhere around 48KB.

It appears that since the data attribute of the object tag is used as the
"location" of the element, more than 48K of data causes a buffer to overflow
when the location is displayed in the Element Properties dialog. The Media tab
of the Page Info is similarly affected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load http://jon.x13designs.com/firefox_crash.html
2. Right click on the second image (the one with the geometric shapes).
3. Select Properties from the context menu.


Actual Results:  
The Element Properties dialog pops up, but without any controls rendered. At
this point, the entire system is completely locked up.

Expected Results:  
The Element Properties dialog should open.

I am marking this a security problem since it appears that the problem is a
buffer overflow.
