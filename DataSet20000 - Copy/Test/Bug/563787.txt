when firefox connects to the internet via a router with splash screen it holds this splash in cache for the opened page for the whole windows session. so whenever you want to get a page for the first time after u connected the router and the splash screen appears. u wont get this page any time u try for the whole windows session. u get all the time the splash page or a mix of these adresses.

the browser should update the link at least when u press the reload button. maybee it can check the cache in the background for new versions of the page and set a sign that the cached page will not be used anymore
