the notification button on Windows 8.

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0
Build ID: 20130903030201

On the latest Nightly 26.0a1, the notification button is missing.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox 26.0a1 with a new profile.
2. Navigate to http://mixedpuppy.github.io/socialapi-demo/
3. Click on the Activate The Demo Provider.

Expected results:
The notification button is placed on the URL bar between the "Share This Page" button and the "Demo Social Service" button. Clicking the button allows you to share data on your computer for off-line
mode and to share your location.

Actual results:
The notification button is missing on Windows 8 (please see the attached screenshot for more details).
On Mac OS X and Ubuntu 13.04 - a Geolocation button is placed on the URL bar between the "Share This Page" button and the "Demo Social Service" button and there is no indication of the notification: This website (http://mixedpuppy.github.io) is asking to store data on your computer for off-line use. The button is also different, as if the option to allow sharing data on your computer was already selected.

Notes:
The issue is not reproducible on Firefox 24 beta 8 nor on the latest Aurora 25.0a2.
