'return false' in onClick does not prevent new/empty tab/window if target is named.

Although nothing should happen after a 'return false' in onClick in a [a href=..
onClick=..] appears, there is still an additional tab/window opened IF there is
a named target in [a href=.. onClick=.. target='sometarget']

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a simple page "mypage.html"
2. Create a second page which includes:
<a href="mypage.html" target="sometargetwin"
onClick="window.open('mypage.html','mywin','width=300,height=300');return
false;">mypage with and without javascript</a>
3. Click on Link with JavaScript enabled.

Actual Results:  
A new 300x300 window with "mypage.html" is opened AND a new tab/window with
"mypage.html" as well! Same effect if you set target="mywin".

Expected Results:  
Only the 300x300 window with "mypage.html" should open, nothing else, as there
is return false!

If you don't use target=... everything works fine and as expected, like this:
<a href="mypage.html"
onClick="window.open('mypage.html','mywin','width=300,height=300');return
false;">mypage with and without javascript</a>
