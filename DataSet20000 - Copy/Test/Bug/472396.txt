Private browsing is saving form data in certain cases (e.g. Gmail subject in compose)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1b2pre) Gecko/20081125 Firefox/3.0

Private browsing for some unexplained reason seems to be saving form data in select cases. I can see it in Gmail's subject field when composing then sending an email. There may be more forms where this happens but I'm unsure at the moment.

Checking the formhistory.sqlite with a utility afterward, the subject form entry in the db is retained.

Also I was wondering where does the cache, history, and form history get written to while in the mode? In sqlite temp tables then dumped at end of session? Because I thought it would hard only to write to memory for the entire duration of private browsing, since its causes very slow surfing when the cache memory pref is turned off by comparison. I know cookies are saved [I think in the original cookies.sqlite] but dumped after the session. And downloads are saved only in memory according to sdwilsh.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Compose an email in Gmail (haven't tried other webmails)
2. Include a subject then send
3. Close and reopen Firefox, then compose another message and check subject field's form history dropdown
