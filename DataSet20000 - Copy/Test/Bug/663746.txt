Change Scratchpad shortcut key to something other than F4
I'm using current Aurora 6.0a2 and have accidentally opened the new Scratchpad by bumping the F4 button multiple times already, and I'm not the only one. See bug 657303 for a request to at least make this easier to close by using Esc or F4 again. Closing with Esc is all well and good, but I think moving the shortcut key to something else would be a good idea.

There are very few F-keys that have standard functions across multiple applications and platforms: F1 is usually help (Firefox dropped this a while ago), F3 is usually find next, and F5 is refresh. My newer laptop has tiny close together F-keys and I barely even have a gap between F4 & F5. The general trend in many cases is to treat them as an afterthought and just cram them in there. I rather exclusively use F5 to refresh and quite often use F3 when searching text. The new Scratchpad shortcut of F4 is right in the middle where it's in the worse possible place for accidental hits. Additionally, I wouldn't be surprised if someone out there accidentally held ctrl or alt when pressing this shortcut and closed the tab or window as a result. I know picking keyboard shortcuts is always a mess, but I'm sorry to say that in my opinion this is a really problematic choice.

No other dev tool has been granted the priority to get its own F-key and honestly I would've given the new console one rather than the Scratchpad (though quite nifty it is). F7, F8, & F9 are all much better places if you want to stick this and/or other dev tool up here (assuming one of those isn't taken by something else on some platform). I think the best practice is to avoid putting anything next to any other F-key that will get high traffic.
