i have a textfield that uses the special symbol  &#9552; as a default value.

it appears invisible in the textfield when viewed on a mac.

it works fine on the PC platform but not mac!



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  http://edwardsmark.com/test.html

3.
Actual Results:  
i included a picture on the webpage how it looks on a regular FF.  when ran on a mac the special symbol does not appear in the textfield box.

Expected Results:  
i would expect this page to look the same on a mac vs a regular pc.


the special symbol   &#9552;  looks like a 'long' equal sign.  as you can see from my page:

http://edwardsmark.com/test.html

the special symbol appears just fine (pc or mac) except when used inside a textfield box.

here is the html:

<form id="form1" name="form1" method="post" action=""> 
 <input  class="evalErrorSoundsTime1DivNormalClass" value="&#9552;"  readonly="true" disable="false"  type="text" /><br />
 <input   class="evalErrorSoundsTime1DivReplClass"   value="&#9552;"  readonly="false" disable="true"  type="text"  />
</form> 
<p>displayed value:"&#9552;"</p>
