Firefox forces GConf to run in non-GNOME environment
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041013 Firefox/0.10.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041013 Firefox/0.10.1

I am using Firefox 0.10.1 on Xfce desktop. Although the GNOME is installed on
the machine, I am not using it and do not have any user GNOME configuration
files. When run, official gtk2+xft build of Firefox forces GConf to run, which
creates a host of GNOME directory trees (although of course there is nothing
useful there).
This (bad) behavior cannot be disabled at runtime, nor with build configuration.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to Xfce session
2. Remove stale .gconf* crap
3. Run Firefox

Actual Results:  
.gconf* and .gnome* directory trees (5 altogether) are recreated.

Expected Results:  
Run without sourcing GNOME configuration.

Additional digging around in the source revealed that libgconf-2.so is
dynamically loaded at runtime if found, regardless of whether gconf is actually
running or not, and even ignoring MOZ_ENABLE_GCONF build flag. This happens in
two places - extensions/pref/system-pref/src/gconf/nsSystemPrefService.cpp and
uriloader/exthandler/unix/nsGNOMERegistry.cpp.

Since I don't care about GNOME that much anyway, I just disabled the offending
library loads in my local build. However, smarter GConf check would be a good
thing to have, so as to remove unnecessary runtime dependency on GNOME.

Suggested solution: Check if GConf is actually running before trying to load the
libraries. Do not even try if MOZ_ENABLE_GCONF is disabled.
