Rerequesting page on broken src

When there is an element with a src-attribute which is empty, Firefox requests the current page in order to get a target for the element.

So if you have a script which does an order or something and you have an <img src=""> on your site, Firefox will request the page again, maybe causing to place the order twice.

Of course you could avoid placing these empty tags, but what is if you have no influence over that particular content?

This problem also shows up when using Adblock Plus. Imagine having a <script> with a src which is blocked by ABP. The src-Tag is now interpreted as empty, so Firefox requests my page again.

I can't understand what the idea behind this "feature" is. You have a page foo.html with an <img src="">. Why should rerequesting the foo.html for the img-Tag magically turn the html-file into an image?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Write a small sample script writing a random number into a file
2. Embed a <img src=""> in this script
3. Call the script in Firefox
Actual Results:  
You will have two numbers written into your file, not one as expected

Expected Results:  
There should be only one number in the file
