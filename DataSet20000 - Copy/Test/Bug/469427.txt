Different behavior & CPU usage in V3.1B2; shockwave hogs CPU

I use the http://au.answers.yahoo.com site quite a lot, and frequently do cut & paste operations. Using the 3.1b2 version, pages generally load without hogging the CPU as much as before (yay!), but I noticed some curious behavior. If you highlight some text then right-click to copy it to the clipboard, it takes a very long time for the menu to pop up. When it does come up, clicking on copy does not always result in copying to the clipboard. They are currently displaying ads that play using Shockwave. I disabled the shockwave plugin, and the ads were replaced by animated GIFs and the strange copy behavior disappeared. I realize that this is probably more of a shockwave hogging issue, but it definitely works differently in the beta than it did in 3.0

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enable Shockwave
2.Surf to any specific question page on http://au.answers.yahoo.com or likely anybody that is using flash display. On this site, it happens only at the single question display level; flash is not used on the higher level menus/lists
3.
Actual Results:  
Flash displays just fine; some keyboard operations slow to a crawl 

Expected Results:  
Displaying flash should not affect simple keyboard operations

I have temporarily resolved the problem by leaving shockwave disabled and continue to test the V3.1B2 version. I never really thought that much of flash in the first place; it has always been a hog.
