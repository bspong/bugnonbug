after updating from 1.5 to 2.0.0.7 the URL bar expands to the height of 3 regular-sized toolbars. i have tried to research why this happens and even went into the about:config page to see if it's a setting in there but there is none i can find. it may be a problem with my previous theme. (i sent an error report about that also)
