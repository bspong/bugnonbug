Holding Ctrl and repeatedly pressing F4 causes address-dropdown behavior without selecting the address bar.

When multiple tabs are open, ctrl-f4 closes the active tab and makes the next tab active.  Pressing and holding ctrl while repeatedly pressing f4 closes tabs in sequence, until one tab chooses to drop down the address bar (showing recently entered addresses) instead of closing.  Address bar is not selected (escape key does not close the address dropdown), and ctrl-f4 does not close the active tab until the address dropdown is removed, so to continue keyboard navigation the keystrokes alt-D then escape are needed (to close the dropdown) and then ctrl-f4 can continue to close tabs.  

Seen on Fx 2.0.0.0 and 2.0.0.1, Windows XP Pro SP 2, Windows Vista, and Ubuntu.  

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open multiple tabs.  
2.Press and hold ctrl key.  
3.Repeatedly press f4 key.  
Actual Results:  
Eventually an f4 keypress will generate the address bar dropdown (expected behavior of F4 key when the address bar is active, but not expected behavior when ctrl-f4 is pressed).  

Expected Results:  
Tabs should be closed.  

Dropdown seems to be occur more easily on large pages.
