Let widgets know when they're in a toolbar or the menu panel, and what the appropriate anchor is.
Blair first mentioned this in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=865926#c2, and I'll paste his comment here:

My general idea there was to provide APIs for widgets/add-ons, so its easier to do the right thing - which is probably better suited for a separate (related) bug. 

Was thinking that CustomizableUI could set some attributes on widgets when they're placed in an area or when they're moved into the overflow panel. Something like:
* customizableui-areatype - can be toolbar, panel, overflow
* customizableui-anchorid - ID of the anchor, or empty

And CustomizableUI could have some APIs to help out, something like:
* CustomizableUI.openWidgetPanel(aWidgetNode)
* CustomizableUI.isWidgetInOverflow(aWidgetId)

(I find its generally useful to set both declarative metadata, and provide methods to get the same info - it better covers use cases we haven't thought of, which is often an issue add-on authors hit.)

I think being too smart with the overflow stuff is going to land us in hot water - there's just far too many edge cases. I'd rather we had a solid solution that worked good enough, even if the UX of some add-ons isn't ideal - and just help add-ons adapt to the new world order (by providing easy to use APIs and some tech evangelism).

This sounds like a fine idea to me.
