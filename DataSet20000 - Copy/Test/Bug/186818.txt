Phoenix is not able to completely send the document to be printed to the
printer-- usually "print progress" indicator (which pops up after I click Ok in
the print dialog box)stops part way through and hangs.  Happens mostly on longer
documents. 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Equipment used is a HP Deskjet 842c printer; Go to any webpage, select print
from file menu. Click "Ok" to print. 
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
'Preparing to Print' Progress bar froze at a certain percentage (31% often, 80
percent sometimes). No printing occurs, not even to the stated percentage.
Windows printer dialog box under status says that it's spooling. If I click
cancel and then try to print again, I get a "Printer not Available" error. When
I quit the browser window the printer kicks in and I get the 31% or 80% of the
documents pages printed out. 

Expected Results:  
Should have printed normally. 

Printing is normal in all other software including Mozilla 1.0
