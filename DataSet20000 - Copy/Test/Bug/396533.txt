Dynamic images in AJAX do not update, cached image displayed
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: FF2

Source in Php with MySQL.
A default image is loaded in a <div> tag at logon, name & id = "test.jpg".
Client selects various images options (borders, colours, width etc).
The test image is reworked on server through PhP, then sent as a request response to the client.
Image is not updated: FF selects the image in the local cache.
None of the codes such as the followings work.  Work with other browsers.
<?php
header("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate");
session_cache_limiter( 'nocache' );
header("Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate");
header("Expires: Fri, 14 Sep 2007 05:00:00 GMT");
header("ETag: PUB" . time());
header("Last-Modified: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s", time()-1) . " GMT");
header("Expires: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s", time()) . " GMT");
header("Pragma: no-cache");
header("Cache-Control: max-age=0, s-maxage=0, no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate");
session_cache_limiter("nocache");

Only solution found is to change the image name between each trial, such as:
test1.jpg, test2.jpg ... etc.  In this case, the cache grows forever, leading to other problems.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit www.skytargets.com, web-designs, sample MTM-FRAMES and experimente.
2. Now works also with FF: implemented solution of different names.
3. Download the old code (will try to upload it today)
Actual Results:  
no refresh of the dynamically modified image.
A similar result occurs if you loop to display a random image every x seconds, using the same image name.
