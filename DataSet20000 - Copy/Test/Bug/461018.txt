Page load fails when surfing through sites. I must manually refresh 10 times before the page loads even in safe mode.

When I'm surfing around on the internet, I'll click a link or try and get to a webpage and the status loads it, but nothing is displayed but white nothingness.  I manually refresh and it does the same thing.  I have to refresh about 10 times every other webpage to get it to come up.  There is no particular website but it does do it a lot on facebook.  And of course sometimes when refreshing, it has to resend the information again so I have posted some comments on facebook about three times.  Thank goodness it didn't do it on ebay.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Always happens on nearly any website.  Just try and load any page.
Actual Results:  
If it randomly decides to do it, that status bar will show load progress, and it will transfer information as shown in the stauts bar.  The icon in the tab will appear with the name of the page, but no page is loaded.

Expected Results:  
It should have loaded the whole page.
