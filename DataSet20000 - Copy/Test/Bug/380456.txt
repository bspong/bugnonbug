"window names" for window.open / target are not global (multiple windows can have the same name)

Window names do not seem to be universal, but instead are only recognized by the original opening window and its children.

Example:

sites a, b and c all have links to one another (each link opening the respective site in a window of the same name.  If site a is open and the user opens both sites b and c and then tries to open site b from site c, two site b windows (both with the name "b") will now exist: the one originally opened by site a and the one opened from site c.

Expected behaviour: the site b opened from site c should have open ed in the existing window named "b" which was opened from site a.

Note: this is happened across sites (different hosts).  I have not checked to see if the behaviour is identical within a site.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a site A with links to two other sites.  These links use javascript window.open() to open other sites in uniquely named windows (B & C).
2. Click on one of the links to open site B in window B.
3. Click on the other link to open site C in window C.
4. Site C has a link which uses javascript window.open to open site B in window B.  click on this link.  
Actual Results:  
A seconds instance of site B will now be opened.  There will now be two windows both named "B".

Expected Results:  
The link should have caused site B to open in the existing window B.

It looks like windows are only aware of the names of their children and their children's children in a tree hierarchy (one way down).  They have no awareness of windows opened by their parent or other windows.  

Again, this may be a specifically cross-site (different host) problem.

this problem does NOt occur with any other browser (safari, IE6, IE7).
