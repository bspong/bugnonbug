I have 'Remember what I enter in forms and search bar' turned on, and when I go to Google and search multiple times, on subsequent searches, I have difficulty modifying what is in the search field.  This is affected by the key sequence or the direction of the mouse after I hightlight a word to replace.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn on Remember what I've typed in Forms option
2. Go to Google, and type in 3 or more words into the search box
3. Click Search
4. In the Search box, double click on one of the first words to highlight it, then drag the mouse down out of the way.  At this point, the suggestion box should appear, and the last searched value is now displayed.
5. Type a new word to replace the highlighted one, and hit tab.
Actual Results:  
After all of this, the search box reverts to the last saved value even though I've typed new words

Expected Results:  
The new words should show in my search.
