i have been unable to determine when netflix sets itself to Allow in Exceptions without permission even though i have DISABLED all cookies from setting. it even lists itself in the Exceptions as Allow even though i have deleted this permission repeatedly. the only place that i can think that would even be a suspect would be the scrapbook extension but this extension is only designed to save a copy of a web page which i had done with netflix terms of use http://www.netflix.com/TermsOfUse. this cookie permission is also set repeatedly even after i have been to netflix website only once. i hope this is as explicit as possible. the only other possible cause that i can think of is when i scrapbook copy one of my yahoo mails that contains a link to netflix. well if that is possible these guys are good. it is quite obvious that whenever i use firefox that netflix is tracking my surfing habits without my consent. i have never had any trouble with this before. by the way the only exceptions that i have consented (allow) to place cookies is yahoo mail.
i have currently decided to delete the Allow permission and added netflix as Block permission in the Exceptions area. i also use the latest version from portable firefox on my laptop which allows me to keep all of the firefox components in one trackable location. and much easier to backup. when i upgrade i just cut and paste the profile folder into the latest version which i just did a few days ago.
