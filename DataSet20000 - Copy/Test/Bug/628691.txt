Error accessing a tt-rss server in FF4b9
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0b9) Gecko/20110121 Firefox/4.0b9

I've seen https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=610236 , but that's a couple of months old and the error message isn't the same as mine; it's worth bearing in mind, though.

I run an instance of tt-rss on my web server for my own use, tt-rss 1.5.0. http://tt-rss.org/redmine . It's basically an RSS feed reader web application. Trying to log in to the server last night and this morning, it just gives me this error message:

Exception: Error, Could not load 'dijit.layout.TabContainer'; last tried '../dijit/layout/TabContainer.js'
Function: init()
Location: dojo.js:14

dojo/dijit is some javascript function library. I checked that TabContainer.js exists on the server and has sane attributes (root/root, 664). There's no errors in the Apache logs.

Key point: I can log in just fine if I run Midori on the exact same machine, or if I run Firefox 3.6 from the laptop next door. (Haven't tried FF 3.6 on this system yet, but I can). So it seems to be a Firefox issue. tt-rss punted me to Mozilla, with a note saying 'don't report bugs with beta browsers', so here I am.

I can give the server / login details to an interested developer by email if it will help debug; there's nothing secret in there, just RSS feeds, but I don't want to post the details here to avoid anyone thrashing my server or anything.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the tt-rss login page
2. Login
3.
Actual Results:  
Error message

Expected Results:  
tt-rss works
