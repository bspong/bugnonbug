random missing/hidden words or blocks of text on pages

I've noticed individual words as well as entire blocks of text missing in pages.  At first I thought it was poor editing, then after quite a few instances decided it was not.  If I cut and paste the problem area into a text editor, the missing text is relieved.  A Google search shows a similar problem a few years ago in the 3.x branch, but in that problem it appears that highlighting the text on the page would make it appear. Now, it does not, although it is clearly there as cut and paste captures it.

The missing word thing happens quite often on a lot of sites including google searches, slashdot, reddit and techdirt, among others, although I don't recall missing whole blocks other than on techdirt.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load web page
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Notice seemingly random words missing throughout the page.

Expected Results:  
All text visible.

I've also noticed that reloading the page, visiting it later or, in the case of a Google search, typing in the same search phrase will result in the same word or block missing.  The word is replaced with a blank space

I've also reported this on the ubuntu buglist as Bug 779364.
