IF RADIO LINK http://www.streamaudio.com/stations/asx/WSB_AM.asx STOPS STREAMING THEN MY FIREFOX CLOSES DOWN ????

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. SET UP A WINDOWS SCHEDULE TASK TO LAUNCH FIREFOX JUST BEFORE STEP #2. ELSE THERE WILL BE A WINDOWS ERROR OF CANNOT FIND 
"http://www.streamaudio.com/stations/asx/WSB_AM.asx"

2. SET UP A WINDOWS SCHEDULE TASK TO LAUNCH AT A GIVEN TIME FRAME TO A STREAMING URL EXAMPLE: http://www.streamaudio.com/stations/asx/WSB_AM.asx

3. IF STREAMING STOPS LONG ENOUGH THEN FIREFOX WILL CLOSE DOWN!!!!
Actual Results:  
LISTENED TO RADIO STREAM A WHILE THEN STREAM STOPS ABOUT TEN MINUTES LATER FIREFOX CLOSES DOWN.

Expected Results:  
FIREFOX TO REMAIN RUNNING REGARDLESS WHETHER THERE A STREAM PRESENT OR NOT!

FIREFOX SHOULD HAVE REMAINED RUNNING!!!  I DO NOT KNOW IF WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER NOW BEING EMBEDED HAS ANY THING TO DO WITH THIS PROBLEM OR NOT BUT MIGHT??
