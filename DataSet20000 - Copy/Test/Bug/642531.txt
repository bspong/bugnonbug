local files that link to remote XPIs don't show the "installation not allowed" prompt
Issue

Any addon, including older versions, can be prompted for installation to the user by referencing the addon via an iframe.

Example:
<iframe src="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/105368/f1_by_mozilla_labs-0.7.3-fx.xpi?src=version-history"></iframe>

If the iframe is loaded via a file from the local machine (e.g. file:///Users/mcoates/Desktop/test.html) then the addon will automatically download and prompt the user for installation via the addon chrome message.

If the iframe is loaded via any website then Firefox will display a message "Firefox prevented this site from asking you to install software on your computer" along with an override option.

Root cause:
The addon xpi files to include the x-frame-options : deny header. However, testing showed that this header is not recognized when the iframe src is referring to a file download. 



Recommended Remediation:

The largest concern is forcing a user to download a vulnerable addon. One solution is to modify the message within the chrome and provide a large warning that the addon being downloaded is not the most up to date version.

We also may need to file a separate bug to identify if the x-frame-options header is failing in this scenario.
