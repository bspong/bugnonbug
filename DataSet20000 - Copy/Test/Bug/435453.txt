Please add option to turn off certification on broken sites rather than display "add an exception" dialog

A lot of sites have broken certificates (e.g. the cert is registered for "domain.com" rather than "www.domain.com"; expired; etc.).  The new "add an exception" dialog takes numerous additional clicks to display content on these sites.  However in most cases I have seen, when this dialog appears the site content certification turns out to not be that important for most users (it's just some bulletin board, not a banking site).  In fact high-security sites are much less likely to have a certificate problem, because they care about their certs more.

It would be great if Mozilla could have an option to just turn off certification if there is a problem with the cert.  Maybe this sounds like a very bad idea from a security point of view :) , but users that don't care about certification on most sites can "opt-in" to manually check that certs have been verified as valid on sites they care about, e.g. banking sites, rather than having the browser force a cert check on lots more sites where they don't care about.  (In that sense this would be a power user feature.)
