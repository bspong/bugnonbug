after an upgrade of all extensions, the back button's history is once again showing only a dot and blank space below that - a pixel or 2 per history item, no text.  

No helpful errors show in the JS console.
This time the first window opened is fine, but the second window is broken.

This has happened too often for me to keep solving it by wiping out a 50-90ext setup and reinstalling one by one to discover the culprit.

The one uninstall actually shown to fix this so far: 

needlesearch

however, needlesearch works with some extensions

I hope that all victims of this will
