Update start page to a Firebird specific page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.2b) Gecko/20021029 Phoenix/0.4

I previoously had Netscape 7.0 installed.

Just now, I installed Mozilla 1.2.1, then I installed Phoenix 0.4.
When Phoenix comes up, the start page indicates I have an old version
of Mozilla and suggests I download and install 1.2.1.  But I just
installed it prior to installing Phoenix.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just start Phoenix with the default start page.

Actual Results:  
When Phoenix comes up, the start page indicates I have an old version
of Mozilla and suggests I download and install 1.2.1.  But I just
installed it prior to installing Phoenix.


When I installed Mozilla 1.2.1, I specified my own choice for the installation
directory.

Since Phoenix doesn't appear to have an installer, I unzipped it into a
directory and then created a shortcut to the phoenix.exe file (on my desktop.)

Is it possible Phoenix is trying to use the version of Mozilla installed when I
installed Netscape 7.0???  How does Phoenix decide where to find Mozilla???
