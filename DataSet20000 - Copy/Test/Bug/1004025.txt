Move themes/*/devtools/font-inspector.css into themes/shared/devtools/font-inspector.css
As part of the process of DRYing up our CSS, we should move the font-inspector CSS file into the shared folder.

The main steps for merging these files into one are:

1) Make sure there aren't any differences between the windows/linux/osx versions of the files.  You can use a diffing tool for this, or just look at them:

  diff browser/themes/linux/devtools/font-inspector.css browser/themes/osx/devtools/font-inspector.css
  diff browser/themes/linux/devtools/font-inspector.css browser/themes/windows/devtools/font-inspector.css

2) If there are no changes, then all we need to do is make a new file called browser/themes/shared/devtools/font-inspector.css, and copy the contents of one of the other files into it.  If there are changes, we will need to navigate them individually and decide if they should be kept or not.  We can keep them with preprocessor directives if needed.

3) Delete browser/themes/linux/devtools/font-inspector.css, browser/themes/windows/devtools/font-inspector.css, browser/themes/osx/devtools/font-inspector.css

4) Modify browser/themes/*/jar.mn to replace (devtools/font-inspector.css) with (../shared/devtools/font-inspector.css).  Note that the windows/jar.mn file has two places that need to change.
