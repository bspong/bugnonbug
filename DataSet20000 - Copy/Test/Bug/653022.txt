Youtube (flash) and Netflix (silverlight) videos skip and stutter when plugin is out-of-process

Moving Adobe Flash and Silverlight out of process sounds like a good idea in principle.  Flash is crashy and leaky, and we prefer not to take down the whole browser when something bad happens.  However, when it comes to performance, this still needs a lot of work.

I'm using Nightly, and playing youtube and netflix videos.  On a Core 2 Duo, 2.4GHz, but with Nightly, it seems to not have enough horsepower to pay videos without interruption.  Every few seconds, there's a gap in the audio and a brief freeze in the video.  (After a while, it gets to be REALLY annoying.)

I've also noticed that when playing youtube videos, both the browser and the OOP container are each using at least 30% CPU.  That seems like an awful lot of CPU overhead.  What is it doing?  Pushing video pixels through a UNIX socket?  I can see why the container would use a lot CPU time, because it's running Flash.  But what is the browser doing?  As I see it, it should pass a window handle off to the container and then sit there doing nothing while the video plays.

With earlier Mozilla nightlies (e.g. Minefield), I've tried disabling the OOP container, and all the problems clear up.  The browser uses WAY less CPU, and there are no interruptions in the video or audio.

And even despite the CPU overhead, this is a dual-core, and any other web pages I ever have open are static content with only as much Javascript as what gmail needs.  There's really no good reason why the players should be acting like the machine is too slow to play the video.

[And yes, I have tried using an alternate profile.  I usually take it a step further and try it in a guest account on a different machine.  Same problem.]
