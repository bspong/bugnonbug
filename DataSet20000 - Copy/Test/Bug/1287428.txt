Re-up or make immortal the FX_SANITIZE timing probes expiring in FF50
Thirteen Sanitize probes [1] will expire in FF50 which is real soon now.

Conversation with :mak on IRC suggests that we probably want to keep these as insurance against regressions in these timings (which could result in bad shutdown experiences)

The choice is whether we want to try and argue that these deserve to be "expires_in_version: never" or if these should only be re-upped for another X versions (X=5? 10?) to see if they actually _do_ catch regressions.
