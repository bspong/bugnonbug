<meta name="referrer"> is ignored for navigations from the context menu and via a middle-click
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.38 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=news&mref=origin .
Middle-click on "Creating reality: How TV news distorts events" from ERIC to open the link in a new tab.
On the ERIC page, open the console and type document.referrer to see HTTP Referer.

2. Repeat 1, but left-click on the ERIC page to open it in the same tab, not a new tab.

3. Repeat 1, but from plain HTTP - http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=news&mref=origin .


Actual results:

1. document.referrer is empty - incorrect, HTTPS -> HTTP in a new tab ignores meta referrer.
2. document.referrer = "https://scholar.google.com" - correct, HTTPS -> HTTP in the same tab respects meta referrer.
3. document.referrer = "http://scholar.google.com" - correct, HTTP -> HTTP in a new tab respects meta referrer.


Expected results:

1-2. document.referrer = "https://scholar.google.com".
3. document.referrer = "http://scholar.google.com".

Basically, it appears that the meta referrer implementation in Bug 704320 is incomplete.  When the source page is HTTPS, following a link to an HTTP page in the same tab respects meta referrer, but opening a link in a new tab does not.  Both cases respect meta-referrer when the source page is plain HTTP.

(Ditto for mref=unsafe-url - this is respected from HTTPS in the same tab, but not in a new tab.)
