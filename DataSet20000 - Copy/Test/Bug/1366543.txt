prefill address bar with highlighted text

Steps to reproduce:

Often times a user reads on a web page something s/he would like to know more about, so:
1. s/he highlights few (key)words s/he thinks make for a good web search
2. s/he presses ctrl+C to copy the highlighted (key)words
3. s/he presses ctrl+T to open a new tab
4. s/he presses ctrl+V to copy the (key)words in the address bar
5. s/he presses enter.

Wouldn't it be awesome if instead a user only needed to perform these steps:
1. s/he highlights few (key)words s/he thinks make for a good web search
3. s/he presses ctrl+T to open a new tab

NOTE #1: the (key)words highlighted in step 1 appear pre-highlighted in the address bar of the newly opened tab.

3. s/he presses enter.

NOTE #2: because after pressing ctrl+T the (key)words appear pre-highlighted in the address bar, if s/he decides to search for something other than those (key)words, s/he can simply start typing something else, like s/he usually does after opening a new tab.

Since this:
  highlight => ctrl+C => ctrl+T => ctrl-V => enter
happens often, the new sequence:
  highlight => ctrl+T => enter
would greatly speed up what is possibly the most common usage pattern that users follow while browsing.

This is an enhancement bug, so there is no problem per-se: just a wish-for new behavior.
