Hang when trying to download a file

Since the latest Firefox update (Firefox 3.6.6) I am not able to download any files. I do NOT use a download manager.

When trying to download a file, the download window opens and as soon as I click the save button (in German: Speichern), I do not get any response and Firefox crashes.
Then I am not even able to close down Firefox or restart it. I have to completely shutdown and restart my computer with Windows task manager or "Process Explorer" (from www.sysinternals.com )
When starting Firefox again after restarting the computer, my previous session is not saved anymore. In my download folder are instead of the rar file I intended to download, two files containing 0 Bytes:
- Examplefile.rar
- Examplefile.zip.part

Everything worked fine with the former version (Firefox 3.6.5). 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on a download link
2. Download window showing the download folder on my computer opens
3. Click on the button to save the file to the download folder

~~~ CRASH ~~~

Actual Results:  
Firefox gives no response and crashes. I cannot close down or restart Firefox, I am forced to shut down and restart my computer. After computer restart, my previous Firefox session is not saved, and the file I intended to download, has not been downloaded.

Expected Results:  
It should have downloaded a certain file.

I have "Zone Alarm Security Suite" running (firewall, anti virus and anti spyware), and also "Trojan Remover" ( from www.simplysup.com ).

Before this bug occurred, the only program I had changed, was Firefox with the update to version 3.6.6

I am not receiving a message telling me in which module Firefox crashed. Maybe I could look this up, by I don't know how to. Please let me know how it is possible for me to find out the module, in case you need this information too.

How can I download files for the meantime. I really need to on a daily basis.
