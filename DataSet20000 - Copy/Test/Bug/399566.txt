Bookmarks and History menus open slower than other menus every time
2007-10-11-04 linux trunk nightly (and others, not sure when it regressed)

With my places.sqlite file, the bookmarks and history menus open slowly, taking noticeably longer than the rest of the menus.

This does not happen in a clean profile. However, if I export my bookmarks to a bookmarks.html, then remove all traces of bookmarks and history from a clean profile, then import the bookmarks.html into the clean profile, the clean profile demonstrates the same slowness.

I do not have a lot of bookmarks--105 to be exact. Nor are they complexly structured--they're at most 2 folders deep.

Bug 385036 is similar, but says it only happens the first time the menu is opened. This happens to me every time the menu is opened.

I'd rather not attach my bookmarks file to bugzilla for eternity, but I would be fine emailing it to an individual. Boris, in bug 385036 you offered to look into it if someone gave you a testcase, is that offer still open? Anyone else with a bugzilla track record would be okay, too. Alternatively, I could try to minimize it to see if it's a specific bookmark causing the problem, but I'm pretty busy so I might not have time for a while.
