although i saw various leak/crash reports i  assume many are related to this one.

The problem is simple and i can not believe it has not been addressed: 

Firefox starts allocating memory since it starts and as you browse web pages and never seem to release most of it. it grows in size so quickly that it passes 100M in less than an hour.... ( i do not have any plugins enabled).

I tested this for a long time on various machines including: VISTA x64, XP64, XP32 and all have the same problem... 



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start firefox
2. open task manager and notice firefox size
3. load a web page and notice the memory allocatio
4. shift-reload the web page several times noticing the firefox memory size in task manager
5. you will notice firefox increasing in size and never releasing the memory it allocates.
6. you can also surf theweba little keepingan eye onfirefox's memory size.. in my case the size went from 23M to 69M just by opening yahoo home page + the pages it took to file this report
Actual Results:  
firefox keeps increasing in size

Expected Results:  
Firefox will quickly reach an outrageous size it passes 100M in less than an hour of normal browsing.
