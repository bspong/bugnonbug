On my personal webpage I am using the new HTML5 <header> element to display the website title. I give the element a blue background, but the color is not painted across the entire element. Instead, it only paints the a small area on the left side. The page renders correctly on both Safari and Google Chrome. I have reproduced this bug on Firefox builds on both my own Linux computer and a Macintosh computer in one of my University's computer labs. When I use a <div> element instead of a <header> element in my HTML, the css is applied correctly. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://zhehaomao.com in Google Chrome or Safari, notice how the <header> element at the top is painted blue across the entire screen.
2. Go to http://zhehaomao.com in Firefox, note how the <header> element is only painted in a small sliver on the left.
3. Scrape the HTML and CSS from the site. Change the <header> element to a <div> element. Notice how now the CSS is applied correctly.
