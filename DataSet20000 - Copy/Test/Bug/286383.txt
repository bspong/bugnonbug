One of the main problem with bookmarks is to maintain them up-to-date.
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8648 proposes an interactive way to
update bookmarks when accessing a page.

A sanitize console that tests all your bookmarks to see:
(1)if the site has moved
(2)if the site is no more available
would be a nice feature. 

I see the following funtionality.
In the bookmark manager you have a button called sanitize (this terminology is
probably not the best one). When you press the button, all your bookmarks are
tested.
A progress dialog show you the amount of bookmarks tested.
Parallel testing startegy is required to avoid the effect of the timeout on a
site not found event.
When the test is over, bookmarks with state (1) and (2) are displayed in a pane,
sorted state (1) before and state (2) after. 
For all the bookmarks in state (1) you have a counter associated that shows the
number of successive tries that failed to access the site. You also have a day
counter that shows the number of days elapsed since the first failed try among
the last successive failed try chunk.

For all the bookmarks in state (2) you have the old and the new URLs displayed.
Probably, displaying the old and new site title would be a good idea too.
Indeed, when your site moves, it is likely that the title will remain the same.
But, when you are redirected to a generic provider web page (that gets back a
domain name) the title will change.

Then you can individually update the bookmarks, by right clicking on them, our
you can define preferences to perform an automatic sanitize. Preferences can be:
-Automatically update bookmarks in state (1):
  *always
  *with more that n failed try
  *that failed for more than n days
-Automatically update bookmarks in state (2) 
  *always
  *when the site title remained the same
  *when the domain of the site did not changed

Reproducible: Always
