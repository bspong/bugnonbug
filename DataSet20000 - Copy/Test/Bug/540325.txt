Flash objects don't autoplay if server uses Content-encoding: gzip

If the webserver sends the SWF flash object using Content-encoding: gzip, then the flash player will not autoplay the object. The object can be played by right-clicking the empty space and selecting "Play", so this indicates that the SWF is received intact. It suggests to me that an end-of-data signal is not properly passed to the flash plugin.

When the webserver sends the SWF object uncompressed, the object starts autoplaying just fine.

I have set up a demonstration, with two identical HTML snippets loading the same flash object, except that one disables my webserver's gzip compression.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Visit link listed above

Actual Results:  
First flash object does not autoplay, but second does. The first object can be started manually by right-clicking the gray area and selecting "Play".

Expected Results:  
Server using "Content-encoding: gzip" should not produce visible artifacts on final page presentation.

Latest Flash plugin 10.0 r42. Reproducible in Mac OS X and Linux versions.
