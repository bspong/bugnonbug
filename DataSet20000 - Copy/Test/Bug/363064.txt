Adobe Reader 8 Produces Unexpected Behavior in Firefox 2.0

I installed Adobe Reader 8.  After installing the program and browsing the web, whenever I encountered a href tag pointing to a pdf file (see example url provided), clicking on the link just downloaded the pdf to my desktop (no download notification, no save dialog, the new tab would flash for a second then close).  My setting are configured to open in a new tab.  I tried all of the options in Tools->Options->Downloads and couldn't get the pdf's to open in a new tab.

I uninstalled Adobe Reader 8 and rolled back to Adobe Professional 7.0.8.  Tried the same links again in Firefox, the expected behavior worked, clicking on href's to pdf's opened the pdf in a new tab.

Everything works fine in IE7.  Clicking on PDF's with Adobe 8 installed opened the PDF in a new browser window.

I'm guessing that this is an Adobe issue, just thought you should be aware of the issue that we are experiencing.
