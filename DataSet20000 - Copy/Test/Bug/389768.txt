Switching Between Mozilla Products Alters Focus controls such that some keys no longer function (home/end keys don't work, arrow keys cease to function, copy/paste doesn't work, etc.) and text dependent menu options no longer exist (Copy/Paste/etc.)

Switching between Mozilla products does something strange to the focus controls.

If I've highlighted some text, I no longer have access to the Copy, Search Google For, Select All, or View Selection Source options.  The context sensitive menu acts as if I've just clicked anywhere else on the page.

Delete and other keys work.  I can type inside text boxes, but I can't navigate inside them.

Text areas seem to act differently.  Sometimes the text area reacts even though the cursor is in another textbox on the page/application.  Sometimes one text area reacts even though the cursor is in another text area.  This is especially annoying when I want to paste text in one text area and it appears in another.

Sometimes, if I highlight text on a page and move the mouse, any text areas between the highlighted HTML text and the current position of the mouse appear highlighted.

Occasionally this behavior shows up when I just switch to another tab.

Resizing the browser or hitting F7 and turning caret browsing off appears to remove the bug temporarily.

If I click into a textbox, then switch to the other Firefox, then switch back to the original one, clicking inside the address bar or another textbox, changes I make appear in the original textbox, even though I clicked a new one.

This bug has reappeared and disappeared several times during the writing of this bug report.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open a firefox window
2.  Use Firefox to visit a web site
3.  Switch focus to another application in the Mozilla Suite (another open firefox or thunderbird)
.  Go back to original Firefox
4.  Now, for all text boxes (including the address bar and search bar, and also
any embedded in a web page) the home, end, arrow, backspace, copy, paste, etc.
keys and functions don't work.
Actual Results:  
Arrow/Home/End keys do not work in textboxes, the address bar, or the search bar.

Copy/Paste/"Search Google for" menu options do not show up in context-sensitive menus when highlighting text on a web page.

Expected Results:  
The keys in question should have functioned.  The expected menu options should exist.  Paste should paste into the text area or textbox where I have clicked the mouse pointer and indicated where I want focus.  Highlighting text should just stay on the highlighted text and not start highlighting intervening text areas.

The following bugs appear to be this same behavior and should probably all be grouped under one bug for tracking:
