Firefox becomes unresponsive when finishing rendering a webpage
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.3) Gecko/20060326 Firefox/1.5.0.3 (Debian-1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.3-2)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.3) Gecko/20060326 Firefox/1.5.0.3 (Debian-1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.3-2)

Open a webpage in a background tab, then when this webpage is getting rendered you cannot do anything in Firefox, i.e. it almost stalls for around a second or two. I'm using a ziproxy proxy server which compresses text data on the fly using gzip algorithm.

Here's the list of active extensions which I currently use:
Adblock Filterset.G Updater
Adblock Plus 0.5.11.4
Cache Fixer 1.0
Extended Link Properties 1.2.3
FireFTP 0.94.3
NoScript 1.1.4.1
PrefButtons 0.3.4
Stop-or-Reload Button 0.2
Work Offline 1.2

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open enough large and complex webpage in a background tab
2. Try scrolling the currently active tab (with smooth scrolling turned on) - when the background tab gets downloaded and rendered - you cannot simply scroll the active tab and CPU usage climbs up to 100% for a while


Expected Results:  
Real working multithreading with no lags in browser responsiveness when it's doing some background tasks

Tested and proved to be a bug in Firefox 2RC1.
