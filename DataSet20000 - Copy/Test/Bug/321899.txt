After a lot of tests (as you can see here : http://www.geckozone.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=32084) on FF 1.0.7 and 1.5, with or without extensions, With old or new profil, with some others tests as stop use of history and memory cache in "about:config", and a lot of others... We find that, in all cases, FF consumes TOO MUCH memory and NEVER unloads it
We known that a particularity of FF is to be able to manage the memory, and it's a good thing on less powerful PC, but with more powerful PC it's the chaos !! More of 500mb used in my case, and lot of people in the same case of me... When we have 512mb or 1gb of memory, and little of programs running, FF takes all that it can ! But the biggest problem is that from 200mb, FF lags a lot... with your system that is to force FF to unload memory only when Windows or a program need it, so our windows or programs never force FF to unload itself because there is a lot of free memory... We can only see that when FF is more than 200mb used and if we load a big game (that need a lot of ressources) FF unloads itself... but only in this case, and it's not very practical to load a game to have a FF that doesn't lag any more... To close and to re-open it is faster...

After a lot or research we have find a key in "about:config" : config.trim_on_minimize that force FF to unload itself at every minimize... it's already a good thing but if we don't think to minimize it, the used-memory always grown up, grown up, grown up.... and, morevover, FF grows up very very quicklier after a minimize and maximize ( 2 pages visited and FF can already return to 100mb whereas at this first start we need more of 20 pages to arrive at 100mb) so this key isn't so effective....

So we think it's very interesting to add a Key the "about:config" to force FF to unload its non-used memory that it keeps, every 5, 10 minutes (programable in the about:config) or when FF exceeds 60, 80mb of used-memory (for example)... this key should make the same thing that config.trim_on_minimize but automaticaly, at the good time... and not when it's too late!

But we have been surprised to see that FF consumed so memory, and we think finding an other problem : in the "about:cache", after a lot of hours of internet, we all see that the "Storage in use" is higher than the "Maximum storage size" ( I see it three times higher) and even if it isn't activate (that is totally illogical) so we think that this "bug" is one of the principal reason to this memory-consumed....
After a test, we see that when we block JPG (*.jpg in adblock+) the storage in use is never higher the max... so there is also a problem with the JPG .... moreover, the memory-used of FF is much less significant when JPG are blocked... and my "record" (570mb!! ) was doing when I research wallpapers (so a lot of tabs open/close/open with bigs jpg...) 

Sorry to talk about 2 bugs in the same time, but both are lied and make consumed too memory to FF...
We need that you corrige the problem with the JPG but, even if it will be corrected, we need a way to stop FF to keep non-used memory so that FF won't be able to lag....

Thank you to listen us and sorry for the errors (I'm not very good in english) 
I don't find the report of this bug in your database, it appears that you don't consider it as a bug but as a fonctionality.... it's maybe right but in  a lot of case this "fonctionnality" is very bad and we need to stop it... without forget this bug on the jpg...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.to go on internet a long time
2.to go on another web sites (another web sites have jpg files)
3.FF start to lag...
4.I look at the task manager and FF uses more than 200mb of memory... 570mb for my worse case

and it appears with all more powerfuls PC , with a lot of free memory...
