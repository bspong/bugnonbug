when I try to 'create and print' it defaults to Internet Explorer, which I don't use
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

I can open American Greetings and Blue Mountain websites (I actually have a
short-cut on my desktop to their 'create and print' tab) and log in.  However,
when I find a card I want to use in 'Create and Print', it reverts to Internet
Explorer and my Internet Explorer is not working so I can't use the feature.  I
use Zone Alarm Pro firewall, and their latest update caused issues with I/E. 
That is one reason I switched to Mozilla Firefox - but a friend had told me how
good Mozilla is, and I agree.....I just need to get this problem fixed ASAP! 
Thanks!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open www.AmericanGreetings.com or www.Bluemountain.com
2.Click on 'Create and print' tab
3.Locate card I wish to make
4.Click on 'personalize and print' tab at top of page

Actual Results:  
It tries to open Internet Explorer for the Create and Print stage.  My Internet
Explorer is not working, so I get an error page 'cannot find server'.

Expected Results:  
It should have opened the chosen card in a separate window so I can customize
and print it.

I can go to AOL and use their search bar and it works fine.  Once I click on
'Personalize and Print', it opens another smaller window containing the card.
From there, I can change wording, add text, graphics and pictures, and print my
final product.  Why does Mozilla Firefox try to go through Internet Explorer
rather than just going directly to the create and print site?  Here is what is
showing in the search bar on the card I just clicked on:

When I click on the 'Personalize and Print bar, this is what appears:
