Using Windows XP 64 bit and Deer Park Alpha 2:

When visiting a site that uses Javascruipt, Deer Park Alpha 2 does not display Javascript at all.  It shows as an arrow inside a circle, and you hit the arrow and nothing hapens.  At the site noted, http://www.msicomputer.com./, this means you are unable to access the rest of the site.

In Firefox, which is a 32 bit application, Javascript displays properly if you hit the arrow inside the circle, and you can see the displays and use any links that are provided.  

It is necessary to use Firefox in sites where Deer Park Alpha 2 does not work.

One thing o note is that Firefox has the Noscript extention installed, and it seems to leak over into Deer Park because the preferences are kept in the same place.  Is there a way to seperate the preferences of the two browsers so I can perform more accurate tests?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://www.msicomputer.com./
2.Click the arrow inside the bottom circle.
3.Watch as youb are presented with absolutely nothing!
Actual Results:  
No Javascript content was visible

Expected Results:  
In Firefox 32 bit, you get graphics with links.  I expected the same.

Computer is MSI K8N Master 2-FAR board with two dual core Opteron 270 processors (four processor cores in all).  8 GB of memory. 

Installed programs include Photoshop CS2 (the reason for the machine's existance),  Wacom tablet 64 bit drivers, EMC Retrospect backup software (I live right by their headquarters), MailWasher Pro, Avast 64 bit antivirus, the Windows firewall (no 64 bit Zone Alarm yet), NVidia RAID manager, TweakUI 64 bit.  Plus a few other odds and ends.

Where did this last entry come from, "-disable-javaxpcom" and how do I get rid of it?
