YouTube site is slow when logged in with an "original" YouTube account

Steps to reproduce:

I have a YouTube account that I did not totally merge with my Google+ account (that is, it exists as a separate channel from my Google+ account).  This account has many, many subscriptions.  I signed into this YouTube account on the YouTube site.


Actual results:

YouTube causes Firefox to slowly load each page.  Sometimes crash, but mostly be unresponsive for long periods of time.  Videos will load and play, but when the window is moved or I click outside of the video player, Firefox becomes unresponsive, only eventually giving control back.


Expected results:

Firefox should not stall.  Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge do not stall.  Nor does the account stall on my cell phone or tablet (though other issues exist on those platforms).

Firefox does not stall, however, when no account is signed in or when my Google+ account (that is, where the username is my Google+ identity) is signed in.  I'm investigating whether or not this has to do with the content of the account by moving subscriptions to the functioning account.
