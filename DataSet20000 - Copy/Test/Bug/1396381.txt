empty value for app.support.baseURL redirects users to dubious websites instead of Firefox Help
This issue was discovered by a user in the German speaking Firefox support forum. For whatever reason the user didn't have any value in app.support.baseURL, it was an empty string.

STR:

1. set app.support.baseURL to an empty string
2. go to Help > Firefox Help
3. another example: with unsigned add-ons installed open the add-on manager and click the "learn more" link.
4. another example: with an legacy add-on installed open the add-on manager and click the legacy add-on badge.

Actual:

In step 2 Firefox opens www.firefox-help.com. In Step 3 Firefox opens www.unsigned-addons.com. In step 4 Firefox opens www.webextensions.com/.

These are all registered domains and have the potential to be abused because these domains are not under Mozilla's control!

Expected:

Mozilla can't control all domains on the world so if app.support.baseURL is changed to another domain Mozilla can't really protect the users. But at least Firefox should handle the empty string case better. Firefox should not try to interpret the IDs (or whatever this is [1],[2]) like "firefox-help" as domain names if the base url is empty.
