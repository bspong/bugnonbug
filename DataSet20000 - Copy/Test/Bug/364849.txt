Firefox stopped connecting to any website after a patch upgrade on 19/20/21st Dec '06

Firefox was working fine till the date mentioned above. On this day, a patch was automatically installed and Firefox was restarted. On restart, Firefox wouldnt connect to any website. Absolutely none. IE 7, Netscape 8 and Opera 9 could connect to the same websites at the same time, but Firefox couldnt. Uninstalling and re-installing did not help. Neither did reverting to old versions of Firefox. Starting Firefox in Safe mode did not work either. I have gone through FAQs, discussion forums and tweaking Anti Virus, Zone Alarms, Firewalls etc and the recommendations there do not help.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. On a Windows XP Home (HP Pavillion dv2020ca laptop running AMD Turion 64 X2 Mobile Processor) have a Firefox installation prior to 2.0.0.1 - may be 1.5.
2. Install the latest patch released 19/20/21st and let Firefox restart.


Actual Results:  
1. On Restart, firefox fails to connect to any website.
2. Revert to any previous version, and even they cannot connect.

          connection.

    *   If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure
          that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have continued to connect to websites as usual.
