I have two Philips DVD players: model DVP5992/37 and model DVP3040/37.

On site www.philips.com/support I was in the support section trying to download software /
firmware updates. Files 
DVP5992_37_FUS_AEN.ZIP and 
DVP3040_37_FUS_AEN.ZIP.
When I clicked "I accept" to the EULA, I could not save the file. When I clicked to "unzip the
file to" Firefox abended. 

This happened each time I tried.
