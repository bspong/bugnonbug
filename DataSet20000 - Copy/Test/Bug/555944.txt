The processor begins to overload - the fan is working faster than normal - memory amounts jump and down around 275-300, processor usage around 80-90%.

The theme becomes transparent and all menus are / become invisible (with only the outline of the menu boz/shadow visible.

Only thing to do is close down and not log into facebook.

This message was logged in the error console - don't know if it helps:
