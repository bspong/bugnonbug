Every time I go to http://tw.yahoo.com Firefox consumes about 100% CPU and is extremely slow
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; FreeBSD i386; en-US; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20080122 Firefox/2.0.0.11
Build Identifier: Gentoo with 2.6.19 kernel, Firefox version 2.0.0.11

Subject says it all.

I can add that when this site is open after moving Firefox window repaint takes 10-30 secs. Scrollbar also takes 10-30 secs to move. Same with any buttons/links.

CPU usage stays around 100% for a long while, maybe forever as long as this site is open.

Once I close this site CPU usage goes down to normal.

Another observation is that average Chinese/Taiwanese site surges in CPU usage when it's first open much more than average English site.
Maybe this is because of more complex character set? But does it really have to be slower? Maybe Firefox'es font rendering isn't optimized enough?
This may or may not be related to the original problem.

Another observation is that on my FreeBSD-7.0 box I don't observe this kind of problem at all with any Chinese/Taiwanese sites with the same version of Firefox.

Linux box showing a problem has Intel Celeron CPU 1.13GHz.
