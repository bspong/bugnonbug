I am reporting 2 bugs.
Since today I am not able to directly get a window popup as I click on the proper link of my bank. The new window is listed in the "Window" menu and as I click on the item, it is displayed. But not automatically

Moreover after adding one or few (number not reproducible but smaller than 5)
bookmarks I am not able to use the "right" button of my mouse anymore (the appropriate menu does not show up) and I am not getting the popup window that asks me to save the bookmark or not. This time the "window" is listed in the Window menu, but if I click on the choosen item, the window does not get displayed.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. try to add bookmarks
2. at a certain point one of the links, just get added to my bookmarks but I am not asked about
3. I am not able to add anything, not to "copy" the link in copy buffer
Actual Results:  
not able to add items to bookmarks, not able to use the "right" button of the mose to choose actions, need to restard firefox to cure the problem
