Clicking images closes browser with no crash report

Intermittent issue, several image link examples from many web pages, but Google image search is typical.

If an image is clicked to select it, the browser often closes (all browser windows if several are open) with no crash message or report. Relaunch usually restores the session, bug is repeated.

Of particular note, if a right click is used instead of a left click, and "open in new tab" is selected, the link works without issue.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse for images in Google (other image links do this too in other sites)
2. Left click an image to select it
3. Browser closes without crash report
4. Try again, use right click/open in new tab...no problem
Actual Results:  
Browser closes without a crash report on left clicks navigating from an image, like those on Google's image search (but many other image links from other pages). Problem is not always, but frequently does this.

Expected Results:  
Expect the link to navigate to a new page of the selected image.

I'm using XP x64 with SP2 and current Microsoft updates applied. Issue appeared to my notice first in earlier 3.6.x versions of Firefox - never noticed it in prior versions.

Also tried this in a VM of Vista and Windows 7 (VMWare - I'm a developer, several OS installations for various application development, research and testing) - the problem seems to occur in 32bit OS versions and 64 bit versions, haven't been able to reproduce the bug in Linux (Ubuntu, 32 bit), but as the issue is intermittent I can't say that's evidence it doesn't happen there.
