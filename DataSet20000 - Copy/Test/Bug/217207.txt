Page does not redirect (using javascript) when history has previous URLs in it
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030728 Mozilla Firebird/0.6.1 StumbleUpon/1.8

Clicking on a link that takes me to the URL above does not redirect to the
specified URL. Note this page DOES redirect when there is no history i.e. it is
a fresh tab or window but if there were previous URLs visited in that window or
tab then it won't redirect. 

The error in the javascript console is: 
Error: history has no properties

The script on the page at the above URL is:
<script language="javascript">
<!--
	if (history.length >= 2)
	{
		history.go(-1);
	} 
	else
	{
		window.location.href = 'http://itpapers.zdnet.com/webcasts/';
	} 
//-->
</script>

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Paste the URL into a window or tab that has visited previous URLs
2. Paste the URL into a window or tab that has visited NO previous URLs


Actual Results:  
Step 1. WILL NOT redirect as specified in the javascript
Step 2. WILL redirect as specified in the javascript

Expected Results:  
Mozilla should have redirected instantly to the URL specified in the javascript
