After installing update to newest version, Firefox will not start.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; Media Center PC 4.0)
Build Identifier: Firefox 3.0.10

See summary.  This has ocurred with every update of Firefox version.  This time, updated to version 3.0.10 and Firefox would not start.  Firefox would not start if I right clicked and choose "open."  It ceased to work.  This has ocurred twice upon updating to most recent version.  The first time I uninstalled and started over with success.  This time, with the 3.0.10 version, uninstall and re-install didn't work at all.  When I used Internet Explorer and sought support through Mozilla website, my entire system crashed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install a new version of Firefox
2.Try to start Firefox
3.Nothing happens, repeat and get frustrated. Try to go to Mozilla website support and have your system crash.  Kick laptop out of window (just kidding).
Actual Results:  
See #3 above (except the part about kicking laptop).  

Expected Results:  
Cursed loudly.  After system crashed I hard booted and lucky me, the laptop came back ok... went ot Mozilla website and downloaded OLDER version which I knew worked (3.0.6 or .7).

The newest version should have started and worked properly.  Currently I am running the previous version and am uncertain if I should download 3.0.10 again.  All that cursing was a strain.
I don't know enough about computers to tell you anything about a build config or module or anything.
