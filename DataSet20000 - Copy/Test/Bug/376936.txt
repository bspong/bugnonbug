2.0.0.3 slow with gmail.com, has error message after extension load, locks on tab switch with gmail if Add-on script running or gmail loading

Not sure where this comes from but File/Exit shows ReferenceError: FireFoxClosing not defined.

1) When I change to a different mailbox in gmail.com, up to a 3 second wait occurs before it paints.  Not before now.
2) Switching tabs when a gmail load or activity on the Addons dropdown is occurring causes a lock delay until these finish.
3) On at least one occassion after loading and executing the restart it failed to do so, and came back with another AddOn windows with the restart message which in turn failed to do so.  File/Exit was required to clear.

Not sure of these are all related; no time to debug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the extensions I  have
2.  Run a find update button or a gmail change of mailbox button
3.  try to switch tabs (gmail/Inbox and gmail/Spam
Actual Results:  
Severe delay in switching tabs until the actions started complete; more correctly delay to _finish_ such until the actions complete:  sometimes part of the way through and THEN a slowdown or pause.  May be MS Windows menu/subcontext panels code causing the problem.

Expected Results:  
Should move quickly and surely to the next tab; and quickly execute that code.  

I would suggest that whatever action the mouse clicks on should probably have its thread pumped to the top of the heap in priority, whatever the actual "bug" is.  More than that would be an enhancement (specifying prioritization among actions to subsume resources (such as CPU time) next.
