Text not rendered at all; changing base font size reveals missing text

In Firefox 2.0.0.1 running on Mac OS X 10.4.8 I'm getting text rendering errors.  Simply by changing the base font seems to reveal the missing text.  Safari does not show this same problem.  This might related to another issue I have where characters seem to be overlapping each other, like the character pixel width is not correctly being calculated.

I have taken a few screen shots to show the difference:

- default Firefox font size:

- smaller font size:

- same page in Safari:

I checked the page in Firefox on WinXP and there is no problem in WinXP.

Thanks!
