If you type something in a text box, or something is already typed. And the
amount of text has passed the box size, so the text box has a scroll bar. When
you try to highlight it, when you get to the end, it jumps out of the text box,
and goes to the bottom of the page, or top depending on which direction you came
from (certain types it will not jump to the end, just start scrolling regularly
through the page. This then locks the mouse our from being able to click on the
scroll bar on the side, to scroll back up and fix it. It also makes the scroll
wheel on the mouse not work. To fix it, you scroll the main page up with the
keyboard, and fix the highlighted area.
