multiple operating system processes are not supported
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7

multiple processes are not very well handled. 

i.e.:
- on a terminal server, the same user can open more than one connection
  mozilla-firebird complains about "profile already in use".
- if mozilla and mozilla firebird are run in parallel it
  complains about "profile already in use"
- testing web-sites requiring user login is difficult.
  sometimes you want to be able to login with two users at
  the same time, it would be nice to fire up two firebirds
  (i.e. operating system processes) to log in as two different
  users.

if we want to have that features, we have to use internet explorer currently ...


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click on icon on desktop
2. firebird starts one operating system process
3. click another time on desktop icon
4. firebird does "open new window" instead of starting
   another operating system process




Expected Results:  
1. clicking on icon on desktop starts a new operating system process.
2. "open new window" does not start a new operating system process,
   just a new bowser window opens.
