Switching between monitors causes firefox to keep a small window to remain after exiting

I have a laptop on which I connect a monitor at home. The monitor replaces the laptop screen. (No dual screen or extended desktop). This monitor has a higher resolution then the laptop screen.

If firefox is running while doing that a very small window appears ON TOP. It is  236px in width and 1px in height and it is entirely filled with the color #9C967B. The position of this window is either top left of my screen or on the bottom right of the old screen resolution.

When all windows of firefox are closed, this window remains and the firefox process keeps running. Running firefox again causes this process to be reused. firefox.exe has to be closed by the task manager to get rid of this bug.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox and navigate to a website
2. Attach a monitor with a different resolution, but keep operating under single window.
3. The tiny window appears somewhere and is on top of every application
4. Exit all windows of firefox
Actual Results:  
Firefox keeps running

Expected Results:  
Firefox closes and no window should remain behind
