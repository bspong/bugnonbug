Firefox blocks and cannot be launched anymore.

On a website relying on popups for its operation, if you click on a link which
uses a popup without enabling popups for this site, Firefox blocks. If you close
Firefox (system x button), a process remains active and does not allow to launch
Firefox again.

An experienced user may know how to kill the remaining process, but a normal
user should not be expected to go into task manager to solve this problem.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.operadeparis.fr, DO NOT ENABLE POPUPS. Scroll down and click on
"LES SPECTACLES EN VENTE". Firefox blocks. Mouse has no response within Firefox
Window.
2. Close Firefox with System 'x' button. 
3. Click on desktop Firefox icon to restart Firefox.

Same problem with other sites operating similarly.


Actual Results:  
Profile is in use and Firefox cannot be launched. 
Must open Task Manager and kill subsisting Firefox task.


Expected Results:  
When you close Firefox, you should be able to launch it again normally - e.g.
from desktop icon.

Standard install.
No themes.
