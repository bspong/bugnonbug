Session Restore Broken

The session restore feature is broken. This problem seems to be tied to the fact that the "Home Page:" is not set by default.

If a user selects "Show my windows and tabs from last time" on a fresh install without setting the home page, then the session restore will not work.

If you set a "Home Page:" then everything works as expected and the previous session is restored on startup.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
On a fresh installation of firefox 2.0 
1. go to menu Edit->Preferences
2. select "Main" section
3. on the "When Firefox starts:" select "show my windows and tabs from last time"
4. load a few pages in tabs
5. File->Quit
6. restart firefox

NOTE: On a default install, "Home Page" setting in preferences is blank/empty.
Actual Results:  
Firefox opens with a blank page

Expected Results:  
Firefox should restore the previous session (tabs and windows)

The work-around is simply to set the "Home Page" (on the "Main" section of preferences) to something rather than leaving it blank.

Since you're restoring sessions on startup, there's no point in setting a "Home Page" at all, since you never actually load it (outside of using the "Home" button or similar).
