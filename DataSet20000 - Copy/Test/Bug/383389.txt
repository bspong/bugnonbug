first page from link in thunderbird is NOT added to history (back button broken)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20070515 Firefox/2.0.0.4

When I click on a hyperlink in a Thunderbird e-mail, the first page (the one called directly from the link) is NOT added to history... and consequently, the "back button" is DISABLED after clicking on any link from that original page.

So, if I click on a(n automatically-generated) hyperlink in Thunderbird--e.g., www.test.com/page1.htm--that page shows up just fine in Firefox (and the "back button" is disabled, as it should be).  However, if I click on a LINK on that page (e.g., a link to www.test.com/page2.htm), that page (page2.htm) shows up in Firefox, but THE "BACK BUTTON" IS STILL DISABLED, and the calling page (page1.htm) does NOT show up in the browser's history.  Very annoying (at best!!).

P.S. - Possibly(?????) related to bug #368366, but I'm not sure.  (If that's the case--even given the rhetoric about why it "shouldn't be fixed"--SOMETHING about it needs to be fixed!)

Reproducible: Always

1. click on a hyperlink in the body of the text of a Thunderbird e-mail message
