GIF's stop animating and page stops loading untill you start moving your mouse

After having Firefox open for a few hours it will stop loading pages and animating GIF's.
For example:  If you click a link to go to another page, the page will only appear if you continue to move your mouse.  Once you stop moving your mouse, it pause.  Even if the page is half way through loading or if a GIF still has a few more frames to go.
This also effects pages that auto-refresh.
This happens on all the computers I use.
You can still close it.  But, if you check the task manager in XP, firefox.exe is still running.  Once you terminate that and start Firefox again, its back to normal.
Hope that makes sense.  Good luck
