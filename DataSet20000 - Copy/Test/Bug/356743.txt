firefox poorly handles multiple plugins for a mime-type

* Short Description:
If there is more than one plugin for a MIME-type installed, Firefox doesn't always correctly inform the user which plugin will be used.

There is a forum discussion on this issue: http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=474607
There is an existing bugzilla report (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19118) that lists related issues of the Plugin Manager, but that bug is listed as an enhancement, and seems to be stuck in limbo.  I believe my bug is addressing a more specific defect.

* Longer Description:
(Also read the forum link above)
Basically, in my test, I have 2 plugins that handle TIF images (MIME types: image/tiff, image/x-tiff).  The 2 plugins are Quicktime Plugin 7.1 (npqtplugin7.dll) and AlternaTIFF (npzzatif.dll).

The "about:plugins" page shows both plugins as "Enabled=Yes" for these MIME types.  This causes minor confusion.

The main problem is that the Profile Manager (titled: Download Actions) does not always list the correct action.  On one computer I have, it was correct.  On another computer I have, it said "Open with AlternaTIFF", but in fact, Firefox used Quicktime to open it.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Quicktime such that a plugin is enabled to open TIF images.
2. Install AlternaTIFF (http://www.alternatiff.com/)
3. See both plugins listed in "about:plugins"
4. See which plugin is listed in "Download Actions"
5. Download a test TIF image (e.g. http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/fax/QSTA00.TIF)
6. See if the plugin list in "Download Actions" was the plugin used to view the image.
7. If the correct plugin was used, try to disable, then re-enable Quicktime support of TIF images (in Quicktime: go to Edit > Preferences > QT Prefs > Browser: click MIME Settings)
8. repeat from step 4.

Actual Results:  
In some cases, the plugin listed in "Download Actions" in not the plugin that Firefox actually uses.

Expected Results:  
The plugin the Firefox uses should match the one listed in "Download Actions"
