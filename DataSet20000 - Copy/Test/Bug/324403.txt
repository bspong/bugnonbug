Encryption for Greek in hotmail, logout from hotmail, javascript problem.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; el; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

Mozilla cannot log me out of my hotmail, everytime i click "sign out", it displays a page that says that it cannot sign me out, it only logs me out when i type www.hotmail.com again. Also in the same mailbox, Greek letters cannot be shown, everytime i press encoding --> Greek to view Greek letters, however, i have chosen Greek to be my first language but it never is. 
Another thing is that in another page, when the mouse is over a certain button, a list of things appear (it happens when using explorer), but with firefox when i point the mouse to the button, nothing happens. Also, while in the same webpage, when scrolling up/down with explorer (that's the only example that i have)a small window follows you (a converter to be precise), in firefox you can see the converter, but when you scroll down the converter does not follow you. Is there something i can do with all the problems that i mentioned? 
Thank you in advance.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
It happens everytime, no special steps or actions to take. Maybe i have something wrong in my settings which i tried but i did not find. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you again.
