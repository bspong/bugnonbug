Mozilla firebird attempts to connect to a network alias for /Users when firebird is launched
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

during migration to a new mac, I copied the 
~/Library/phoenix directory to the new machine 
to preserve all passwords, bookmarks and cookies.

When I launch firebird on the new machine, it
displays the connect to server dialog asking me 
to connect to an AFP mount on my old machine.
If I enter my password the dialog dissapears but
the erver is not connected and Firebird then 
displays a dialog indicating a broken profile.

If I mount my /Users directory via the Connect To
menu before launching Firebird, then everything 
is OK.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Mount old /Users via AFP
2. Copy /Users/userid/Library/phoenix to ~/Library/phoenix on new machine
3. Start Firebird on new system 
4. Change all preference folders for cache, downloads, etc 
   to the point to folders on the new machine including 
   going through about:config and changing any paths that
   refer to /Users or any volume on the old system
5. Shutdown Firebird
6. Disconnect /Users
7. Start Firebird on new system

Actual Results:  
connect to server dialog displayed

Expected Results:  
There should not be any hidden preferences that contain an alias.
