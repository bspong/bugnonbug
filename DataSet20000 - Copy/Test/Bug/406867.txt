Browser does not refresh favicons even though URL has changed. Continues to display previous favicon in browser bar, tabs, and bookmarks.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11

Whenever I change to a new site within a tab, the favicon does not change. It keeps the previous favicon instead of refreshing/updating itself to the new one. For example:

Example 1: Open browser and go to home page (http://online.wsj.com/home/us). In same browser tab, go to google mail (http://mail.google.com). Browser takes me to google mail but the favicon belongs to Wall Street Journal. 

Example 2: Open a new tab within the same browser session. Go to home page. (http://online.wsj.com/home/us). Attempt to visit another web site (http://www.symantec.com/). Browser still keeps WSJ icon even though Symantec has its own favicon. 

Example 3: Open a new tab within the same browser session. Go to google mail (http://mail.google.com). Browser takes me to google mail with the google mail favicon. In same tab, go to yahoo mail (http://mail.yahoo.com) and login with your yahoo account. The favicon displayed is gmail not yahoo mail. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

Example 2: Open a new tab within the same browser session. Go to home page. (http://online.wsj.com/home/us). Attempt to visit another web site (http://www.symantec.com/). Browser still keeps WSJ icon even though Symantec has its own favicon. 

Example 3: Open a new tab within the same browser session. Go to google mail (http://mail.google.com). Browser takes me to google mail with the google mail favicon. In same tab, go to yahoo mail (http://mail.yahoo.com) and login with your yahoo account. The favicon displayed is gmail not yahoo mail. 



Expected Results:  
Browser should display the appropriate favicon not the previously visited site's favicon.
