Download Manager breaks shutdown sanitization, forcing sanitization at startup instead
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:12.0a1) Gecko/20111222 Firefox/12.0a1
Build ID: 20111222031055

Steps to reproduce:

1. Install Nightly version 12.0a1; the regression happened on the same day as the version bump from 11 to 12.
2. Start Nightly with a fresh profile.
3. Open preferences, privacy tab. Select Nightly will: Use custom settings for history.
4. Check "Clear history when Nightly closes", then click the settings button for this option.
5. Select only "When I quit Nightly, it should automatically clear all: Cookies".
6. Restart Nightly. 


Actual results:

The Flash plugin was loaded on browser startup (plugin-container.exe is running immediately after browser startup, even when using about:blank for homepage).


Expected results:

The Flash plugin should be instructed to clear LSOs at browser shutdown, not at startup, and only if the plugin has been loaded in the current browser session.

The pushlog for the regression is:

The most likely cause of the observed change would seem to be:
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/b121a045b451

The comments in bug 709262 don't mention Flash or cookies, so I suspect this change was unintentional.
