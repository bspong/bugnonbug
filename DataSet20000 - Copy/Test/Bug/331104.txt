Tabbed browser children should appear between the tabbar and tabpanels. Currently they are placed below the panels, which doesn't make sense to me. They can be easily put there already by just placing them below the tabbrowser. The only reason I can think they might need to be below it might have something to do with content vs. presentation. This is inherantly a presentation problem though, and the current XBL model doesn't really allow for separation of the two. As such, putting them between the two allows for the most flexibility in design. It also allows (with some modifications to Custom Toolbars) the nav bar to finally be moved below the tab bar where it belongs.
