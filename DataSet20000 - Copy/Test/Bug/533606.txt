Browser Startup hangs some tabs for minutes.

Whenever we start FF (Since version 3.x i think) some of the Tabs hang with the little spinners showing only.  Refresh does little or nothing.  Network activity is nill.  It takes too much time to load all the Tabs whether ~10 or ~50 tabs, it does not care which Tabs, it appears random which Tabs and how many, usually ~10%-15% of them won't load on StartUp.

I cannot figure out why no one has reported this issue since it has been happening since version 3.  Our users run Tabbed Browsing and use the Global password feature.  If it is extension related we have not noticed.

It is like it runs out of resources, we have over 3GB RAM per system, and it happens on all installs for every user we have - so that's about 40 differing configs.  It appears to effect only a small portion of the Tabs, but it is really annoying as it takes literally several minutes to finally load those Tabs so normal browsing can start.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start up in Tabbed Browsing.
2.Have about 15-60 Tabs.
3.Wait until all Tab spinners stop.

Actual Results:  
4.Takes too much time.
5.Network activity stops for minutes.

Expected Results:  
4.Takes less time.
5.Network activity never stops till ALL Tabs are loaded.

Since we see this every time we install FF3 on WinXP SP3 (maybe SP2 did this too, we forget...) we have a hard time understanding why this has not been fixed.  It is one of the reasons we're looking into a different browser to use, but honestly every browser has defects like this.  We're investing FF3 atm so we're reporting this to see if it can be patched and allow us to enjoy FF3.
