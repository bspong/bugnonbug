Bookmarks can be moved around the bookmark menu by dragging and dropping the items with the mouse.  A small black horizontal bar will show the target place where the bookmark will be placed.  The bookmarks can even be dragged into submenus.  In this new version of beta 3, it seems like the drag-and-drop to submenu interface has changed, to be less usable.  Unless the mouse is navigated directly along the name of the submenu, then the entire Bookmarks menu is closed.  Seems to me that previous versions were more flexible in how the mouse to entered the submenu, without closing the whole menu.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Bookmarks menu, with mouse.
2.Click and hold one of the existing bookmarks.
3.Hover mouse over a submenu, in the Bookmarks menu.
4.Attempt to move the dragged bookmark into the submenu.
Actual Results:  
Bookmark menu closes.  User still has bookmark selected in mouse cursor.

Expected Results:  
Bookmark menu and submenu should remain open, to allow user to move the bookmark.
