If I use Seb's Firebird Web Installer that creates registry entries for Mozilla 
Firebird, or if I use the registry file provided by 
http://plugindoc.mozdev.org/phoenix.html, initially Firebird works fine.  
However, if and when I install the latest version of Macromedia Flash 6 which 
recognizes Mozilla Firebird, I'll re-open Mozilla Firebird, only to have some 
very strange effects.  The most obvious changes are that Mozilla Firebird is 
now using the "Classic theme," and there are extra toolbars... Help, and QA.  
Also, if you try doing anything, absolutely nothing works.

So, to sum it all up, installing Flash with Mozilla Firebird using the proper 
registry keys makes Mozilla Firebird completely and utterly useless.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use the registry file provided by http://plugindoc.mozdev.org/phoenix.html
2. Use the latest Macromedia Flash installer to install Firebird Flash plug-in.

Actual Results:  
Mozilla Firebird becomes utterly useless each and every time opened after 
completing the above steps, switched to "Classic" theme, and has extra toolbars 
such as QA and Help.

Expected Results:  
Mozilla Firebird should have had Flash correctly installed, and loaded up as 
normal.
