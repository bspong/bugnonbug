When logged into a site that requires a username and password and has a timed session expiration. The session will expire after a few minutes or seconds even when it is not supposed to for a longer period of time. User must then go back to login page and login again. Will happen multiple times in a row and on many different web sites.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to most sites that require user authorization and that has a timed session expiration.
2.After logging into the site, after surfing or just letting a small period of time (seconds or minutes) a box will popup telling that the site expires after a set number of minutes (ex. 30min) and you have been logged out.

Actual Results:  
Get logged out after a few minutes or seconds even when the set period of time for being automatically logged out has not passed.

Expected Results:  
Should stay logged into the site until the set time period for session expiration

This problem occurs in both secure and non secure web sites. (ebay, online bank accounts, facebook, myspace, ect)
