No-show after installed Inkscape which uses X11

I had to get a new copy of Inkscape after I got my new Mac. I had some trouble getting it to open SVG files earlier versions had created. I looked around at X11, and later filed a trouble report with Inkscape's creators. One of the things I did was to use Firefox to open some of the SVG files that Inkscape could not open. After that point, whenever I opened Firefox the top bar would appear but I could not open a new window on screen.  I tried reinstalling from the original DMG, which was still on my hard drive. (I first deleted the old app.)  The problem was not fixed. I re-downloaded the stable version, which works.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Restart computer.
2.Double-click on the app in the Applications folder.
3.Wait forever for a window to show up.
Actual Results:  
The top line -- what you would get if you were to close all windows -- appears on-screen. Nothing can be done to get a window to appear. 

Expected Results:  
Typing in a URL, or doing anything that normally would make a website show up in a window should bring up a visible window.

I can see the top line on-screen, but no window. I can see the Mozilla icon on the Mac's normal display bar for operating software at the bottom of the screen. Control-mouseclick gives me a way to turn the Firefox app off.

I didn't write things down when I was trying to get Firefox to operate correctly.
