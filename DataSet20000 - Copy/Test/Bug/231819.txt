Mozilla Firebird crashes when I visit one of the comments on sidhe.org
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

In Dan Sugalski's web site Squawks of the Parrot [1] there is an article about 
character encodings [2] with a comments link [3].  When I click on the 
comments link, Mozilla Firebird crashes (and offers to mail a report to 
Microsoft).  When I copy the link and visit in a window, it similarly crashes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Mozilla Firebird
2. Visit http://www.sidhe.org/~dan/blog/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=294
3. Observe crash

Actual Results:  
I have tried debugging MozillaFirebird.exe.  The crash seems to be:

    Unhandled exception at 0x006b2441 in MozillaFirebird.exe: 
    0xC0000005: Access violation reading location 0x00a9a4cd.

I don't have source code so can't go any further... 

Expected Results:  
White text on grey ground with comments about character-encoding headaches in 
Parrot.

I saved the page in question and the disc copy was viewable in Mozilla 
Firebird (didn't crash), but missing the CSS.  I emended the style-sheet URL 
(changing the double slash in blog//styles-site.css to a single slash), and it 
displayed as expected.
