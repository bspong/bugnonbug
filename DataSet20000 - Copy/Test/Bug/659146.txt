cf. below

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Spotify Open (https://www.spotify.com/get-spotify/go/open)
2. Launch Spotify
3. Close FF. Verify that the process terminates.
4. In Spotify's title bar, you will see a counter of the remaining time you have playing music (less than 10 hours). Click on that line/button. A drop-down list will appear.
5. Click on "Upgrade or learn more". It's supposed to show you the following web page: https://www.spotify.com/<YOUR_COUNTRY>/get-spotify/go/premium/?utm_source=spotify&utm_medium=messagebar&utm_campaign=upgrade_product
6. If FF is your default browser, it will be launched. The process runs, but the browser window does not appear.

Actual Results:  
firefox.exe is started, but the browser window does not appear

Expected Results:  
The browser window is opened. An extra tab is opened, displaying the web page https://www.spotify.com/<YOUR_COUNTRY>/get-spotify/go/premium/?utm_source=spotify&utm_medium=messagebar&utm_campaign=upgrade_product
