Our new permission prompts are practically modal! Make them "passive confirmation UI" again.

One suggestion for what a shrinking prompt might look like.

I like our recent redesign of permissions for many reasons, but they're practically modal, which is bad.

(While perhaps not technically modal, they're so big they're impractical to ignore, to the point where continuing to operate the page underneath is a real challenge, so come on, they're modal.)

I can't say it better than roc in his excellent 2011 blog [1] which I hope everyone has read many times, where he says:

  "Long ago we learned that modal requests --- interrupting the application with a warning, and forcing the user to OK/Cancel before proceeding any further --- was ineffective for security, because users quickly learn to OK such warnings without even reading them. An alternative approach is "passive confirmation UI": for example, UI appears requesting a permission, but the user can ignore it and continue using the application, so users who don't read the message are less likely to grant permission by default. Firefox's geolocation permission UI is a good example of this."

Our new UX has lost this spirit in its design, which I'll paraphrase as "Here, user! Here's some additional functionality you can turn on for this site whenever you want, if you want, or not, whatevs." It offered the user a richer (optional!) experience in exchange for trusting this site with more of their stuff, with enticement, not pressure. The not-having-to-answer part was intrinsic in this power dynamic between user and site.

Because make no mistake, this is a PITA for web developers, but users - individuals - come first in the w3c "Priority of Constituencies" for the web [1], and the Mozilla manifesto [3].

The reason we dropped this was that our *implementation* of "passive confimation UI", which roc referred to in 2011, was flawed in two regards:

 1. People thought the prompt was gone when it went away.
 2. Web developers expected some form of notification from what looked like dismissal.

These were UX challenges we could have solved, and still can solve, to avoid what are effectively modal dialogs. As proof of that (and only that) I offer up a mockup screenshot of what I'll call the "shrinking permission prompt" could look like.

It solves (1) by never fully going away, it just shrinks enough to let users continue their work if they indicate lack of interest.

It solves (2) by not falsely implying dismissal.

Modal dialogs also exacerbate permission spamming, so let's bring back Firefox's traditional defense against this (which frankly the redesign has made worse). There changes to the API are needed for this.
