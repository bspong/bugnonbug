Highlight all causes highlighted text in input fields to become read-only

When "Highlight all" is selected for a search term, any text in user editable fields (ie. textbox) will become read-only while the rest of the text remains editable. It is also not possible to position the cursor on highlighted text by using point-and-click.

By contrast, when "Highlight all" is *not* selected, but a bit of text *is* highlighted because it is the next item, it remains editable and the cursor can be placed on the text.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any webpage with text input fields. (ie. google.com)
2. Type a word into the text field.
3. Use CTRL-F to find that word.
4. Select the "Highlight all" button in the search panel.
5. Try to click the highlighted text in the input field.
6. Try to edit the highlighted text in the input field.


Expected Results:  
I would expect the text to remain editable whether highlight all is selected or not. When only one item is highlighted this is the behaviour. If the highlighted item changes it is preferable to cancel the highlighting.
