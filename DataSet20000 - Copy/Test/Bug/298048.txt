vertical scroll bar improperly formed (down arrow missing)

I am not sure how to classify this, sorry if I get it wrong

The firefox window has a scroll bar on the RHS which (as is normal in such apps)
has a moveable inner bar which can be dragged with the mouse, and should have
two buttons with up and down arrows (as for example this little box does). 
Firefox only displays the up-arrow button. This bug has been in Firefox since
version 1.0. 
My Mac desktop is configured to show both buttons at the bottom of the scroll
bar. Changing the system preferences to display arrows at top and bottom of
windows moves the button to the top but does not prduce a down button. 

If I follow my usual habit, which is to use the mouse instead, and 'hold' the
moveable bar by clicking on it without release, moving the mouse to scroll the
window - in effect, using the mouse like a scroll wheel - then as long as I have
the mouse button depressed, the Firefox (as reported by Activity Monitor) is
using ~97% of my CPU cycles. This is perhaps not exactly a bug, but it is highly
aberrant behavior. Running on my laptop, it quickly causes the entire computer
to become too hot to comfortably hold and the fan to switch on, which is highly
disruptive to nomal use. No other Mac app I have used behaves in a similar way.

This happens while running on OS X v.10.4 both on a G4 powerbok and on a
dual-processor G3 desktop. The same behavior was observed with older versions of
Firefox and with previous versions of OS X. When running on the dual-processor
G3, both processors appear to be affected in the same way.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a Firefox window displaying text larger than the window
2.Place the mouse over the scroll insert in the side-bar, and press the mouse button
3.Keep the mouse button depressed until the Powerbook burns your leg. 



Expected Results:  
1. The sidebar should display the scroll up and down buttons correctly
2. Holding the mouse in any position anywhere in the application window should
not  hog over 90% of the system cycles, under any circumstances.
