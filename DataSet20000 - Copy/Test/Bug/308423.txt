collapsible file dialog hides directory view unnecessarily, by default

Firefox 1.5b1 has a file save dialog (presumably fileopen etc as well) that on
linux with new gnome or gtk libraries (presumably -- for I find this behaviour
on an upto date linux installation, but not in which I have /only/ installed the
new firefox), has a collapsible file dialog with no directory view by default. 
This means, for half the time I want to save something, I have to make an extra
mouse click, forcing me to take my hand off the keyboard.

I can appreciate that people want to make firefox and/or gnome/gtk more friendly
to beginners, but I wouldn't mind them thinking about us poor experienced users
too, who like to keep our RSI to a minimum.  I personally see very little
benefit in this case of hiding the directory view, as new users will be
interested in that sort of thing as well.

Perhaps the best solution, if this collapsible view /must/ be included, is to
remember what it was last set to (and of course, save this setting over
sessions).  If I last pressed "expand", then I want it to be expanded next time
too...  Or at least have it as an about:config setting.
