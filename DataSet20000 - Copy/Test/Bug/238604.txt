The connection between the JavaScript check box and the Advanced button for
JavaScript is not clear. 

The Advanced button appears in a box with a Java and JavaScript check boxes. One
could assume to find advanced Java options when you click the Advanced button
but there are only advanced JavaScript options. The large amount white space
between the end of the JavaScript check box and the Advanced button contributes
to this problem.

Solutions
1) change the grouping box for Java and JavaScript
   i) combine Java and Java script box with load images box     
      or
   ii) separate grouping box boxes for Java and JavaScript
      or
   iii) Merge JavaScript with the Load Images box leaving Java in its own box
or
2) Move the Advanced button to the left, closer to the end of the JavaScript
check box text. 
or
3) Create some text that bridges the gap between the JavaScript text box and the
Advanced button.
