I have a suckerfish nav - that goes over everything in FF - except windows real media - - apparently this is a common problem. Are there plans to fix this - Windows has its' own - which of course only works for IE.x

for example this works in IE <param>

there is nothing for FF

obviously the solution I need would require nothing to be downloaded on the browsers part

you can see an example of what I am talking about her:

(notice in FF the dropdown goes "under" the windows media.

thanks

and there is flash there and the drop goes over it...
but there is a windows media, absolutely positioned file that goes over it for windows media (right click and you will see this it true)
hope this clears up what the actual problem is.
