Highlight awesome bar matches instead of modifying their weight and decoration

I think that changing the weight of the matches is wrong, because it changes how the text is presented, making it move every time you press a key.

Underline is just ugly.

We already highlight stuff when using incremental search, in the Find bar; so I used the same behavior in the address bar.

You can give it a quick try setting your userChrome.css to:

@namespace url("http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul");
@namespace html url("http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml");

html|*.ac-emphasize-text
{
	background:		#38D878 !important;
	color:			white !important;
	font-weight:		normal !important;
	text-decoration:	none !important
}

richlistitem.autocomplete-richlistitem:hover html|*.ac-emphasize-text
{
	background:		transparent !important
}

Note that this is buggy. Most notably, neither :focus or :active matches the selected result entry, so I used hover to show you how I'd display the selected result. I use no highlighting there because, if the user went to that entry, is highly unlikely he/she won't now what the entry was for.

Also, a bug exist if you move the cursor to the first entry and type anything in the address bar: the matches look white. This is because the :focis/:active problem.

Please note that this implementation is a live mock-up and no hard-coded color should EVER be used.

Reproducible: Always
