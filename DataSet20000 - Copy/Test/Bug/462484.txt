Devs,

    I cannot expand my bookmarks in the left pane of the organize bookmarks tool anymore? The only place the actual bookmarks are visible is on the right side of the window making it nearly IMPOSSIBLE to organize bookmarks and totally IMPOSSIBLE to check for duplicates in different folders by expanding one of the left and one on the right like normal. This is a major MAJOR bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Select Organize Bookmarks
2.Try and expand folders to display books in left half of window
3.Like trying to shovel water with a pitchfork
Actual Results:  
Impossible to see any bookmarks in left window pane, only folders. Impossible to expand all folders an bookmarks in the right pane as well. Attempting to expand folder in the right causes the right view to change focus to only the folder you try to expand and the rest of the Bookmarks Menu tree disappears.

Expected Results:  
Should be able to expand/collapse all folders and *bookmarks* in both the right and left windows halves so you can see the bookmarks contained in multiple folders at the same time like you have been able to since the dawn of time (or at least since NCSA Mosaic)

It looks like we are backing up. Organizing bookmarks is nearly impossible with this bug. Just as bad as that damn save to pdf dialog where you can't select an old file to overwrite. Please fix both of these shortcomings. Thanks.
