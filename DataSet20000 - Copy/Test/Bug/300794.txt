Sites like google.com and mozilla.org seem to be working as expected - I have
middle-click on a link opening a new tab in the background. 

However, http://freshmeat.net/ seems to be behaving erratically. If you
middle-click on the title of a new release, or on any of the links in the top of
the page - i.e. the part that looks like:

Thu, Jul 14th 	home | browse | articles | contact | chat | submit | faq |
newsletter | about | stats | scoop 	10:28 PDT

no new tab is opened. Left-clicking on the same link works fine. 

Middle-clicking on the author underneath the project title works fine.

There seems to be a related discussion on this forum seeing the same issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://freshmeat.net/
2. Middle click on the "browse" link at the top of the page
(this should open a new tab to http://freshmeat.net/browse/)

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
Browse page should have opened in a new tab.

I do have various extensions on this browser.
