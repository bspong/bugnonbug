I am the author of the page at this url and have attempted to allow the user to make multiple independent uploads to our server. The page uses Javascript.

Uploads are sent via a form post and the target is an (invisible) "iframe" within the main page. When the upload starts, a simultaneous monitoring channel is established with the server using an XmlHttpRequest. This provides feedback to the user based upon the size of the uploading file as it arrives.

The problem arises when 3 or more uploads are in progress simultaneously and manifests itself in 2 ways:

1. the XmlHttpRequest's hang. I have attempted to solve this by checking after a suitable time (12 seconds) that new a XmlHttpRequest has connected; if not I make a Javascript window.stop() call and re-submit the form in question.

2. this causes the uploads to re-commence but the upload speed drops significantly until the uploads are proceeding at less than 1kbps.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. upload multiple large files to http://www.snapmad.com/order.php?page=0
2. watch uploads stop, connections being re-reset
3. 
Actual Results:  
upload speeds drop to very low levels

Expected Results:  
I expected the available bandwidth to be share between the various uploads.

I can provide uncompressed Javascript code if that would be useful
