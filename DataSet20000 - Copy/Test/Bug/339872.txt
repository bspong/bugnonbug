when there is only one anti-phishing provider, use a label, instead of a disabled menulist
when there is only one anti-phishing provide, use a label, instead of a disabled menulist

I'm really liking the anti-phishing / safe browsing feature, but I have a question with the pref UI.

If there is only one provider, why are we showing a disabled menulist, with one item?

To make things look better, what about doing this:

if there is only one provider, hide the disabled menulist and change the second radio button label text to be "By asking Google".  We'd accomplish this by adding another property like:

and then getting the provider name and using that to format and set the label text.

we could add something like:

safeBrowsingRemoteFormat=By asking %S

to mozilla/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/preferences/preferences.properties

The logic for hiding the menulist and setting the label would be done in browser/components/preferences/advanced.js, I think.

Note, we would still need the exiting menulist and the existing dtd entry:

<!ENTITY safeBrowsingRemote.label       "By asking:">

in mozilla/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/preferences/advanced.dtd as they would be used when we have multiple remote providers.

I'll attach a screen shot of the UI as it is now, and how it could look when there is one provider.
