Firefox shuts down right after typing the URL I want to go to and clicking "Go" or "enter"

I have used Firefox for a while now without problems. But today it began to shut down every time I started to use it. I open the browser, types an URL adress and click "GO" - then a message saying "runtime error" appears and the browser shots down. I can send the report to Microsoft and the say the problem poccurs in Mozilla firefox. It doesn't matter what adress I want to go to - it shuts down no matter what. 
I have downloaded and installed it again and again, but that doesn't help either.
So now I can't use the browser anymore. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the browser
2.Type an URL or click a link on my startpage (QXL.dk) or any other site
3.Message appears saying "runtime error" and telling me the program will be shut down 
Actual Results:  
Mozilla Firefox closes.

Expected Results:  
Continued to work as normal - for surfing the internet

I haven't downloaded anything from Microsoft or anywhere else.It hust started to do what it does without warning.
