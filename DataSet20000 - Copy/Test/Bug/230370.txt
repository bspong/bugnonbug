Properties dialog box appears unexpectedly when inserting bookmark separator

When adding a bookmark separator, either by using the File | New Separator menu
item, or by clicking New Separator in the Bookmarks Manager toolbar, a
Properties dialog box appears unexpectedly.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
 1. Open the Bookmarks Manager window by choosing Manage Bookmarks in
    the Bookmarks menu.

 2. (Optional) Click on a bookmark item where the separator is to be
    inserted in its place. 

 3. Click on New Separator, or choose New Separator from the File
    menu.
Actual Results:  
The Properties dialog box for the bookmark separator appears.

Expected Results:  
The bookmark separator should appear immediately, without any request for user
input; such is the behaviour in Mozilla.  No dialog box should be expected nor
displayed, as suggested by the absence of the ellipsis in the "New Separator"
command.

A name for a bookmark separator is optional.  As consistent with the behaviour
in Mozilla, the user should not have to be prompted for the name associated with
the separator when it is being inserted.
