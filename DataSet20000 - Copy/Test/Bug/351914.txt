Unable to open multiple HTML commandline arguments.

When researching a project, I create a stash of html files of interest on my harddrive.  I used to be able to open them by simply doing this:

firefox *.html

This however, fails as of more or less your last two builds, and it is a feature I really miss.  It can open one file fine without any side issues, but more than one, and only the first entry gets opened, and the following message is given in the commandline window:

/opt/firefox/mozilla-xremote-client: Error: Failed to send command: 500 command not parseable
Browser doesn't understand command

Thanks for your effort in maintaining a great browser!


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open up the commandline of your choice (I usually use Konsole).
2.Change to a directory with multiple HTML files in it.
3.Type firefox *.html

Actual Results:  
/opt/firefox/mozilla-xremote-client: Error: Failed to send command: 500 command not parseable
Browser doesn't understand command

Expected Results:  
It should please open up all the HTML files in new tabs as it did previously.
