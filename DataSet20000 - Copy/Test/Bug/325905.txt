Customer enters our web site to make a payment online at www.flatironcredit.com/checkbyweb/paymentf.htm. They fill out info and click submit to process. Info does not get processed. After the submit button is hit we receive email about a new payment and customer receives email confirmation. None of this is happening now. This worked until a few weeks ago.
