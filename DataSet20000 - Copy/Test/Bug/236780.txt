Using the CSS style "letter-spacing" misrenders, showing only the first word of each line effected.

Applying the CSS style "letter-spacing" to a an element such as DIV or P
displays only the first word in each line of text within that element.  The
other words can be revealed by highlighting them with the mouse.  On short pages
(which don't get a vertical scrollbar), this seems to occur only when the window
is not maximized.

On various sites, such as the one linked to in this bug report, scrolling with
the scroll bar or via keyboard keys will render the text properly, but scrolling
with the wheel of a wheel mouse will cause the rendering error.  Switching to
another tab or window and back also shows the rendering error.

I've tried this in quirks mode and standards mode, as HTML and as XHTML, and I
continue to get the same visual error of all text after the first work disappearing.
