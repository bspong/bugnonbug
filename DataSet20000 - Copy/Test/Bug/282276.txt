Firefox hangs when URL address is a single word
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Firefox will hang if you accidentally type a single word (no dots) the in
address bar/field and then hit 'Enter'.

It hangs reliably. Try typing 'abc' and then hit enter.

I notice this a lot because I sometimes forget the .com etc, or I accidentally
enter my search word in the address field and not the google field.

Very frustrating because when you have Windows kill Firefox it kills *all*
instances of Firefox. This is very annoying.

BTW, I am using Firefox from behind a Firewall and Proxy at work all day long.
However I think it also happens when I am at home and hence not behind a
firewall and proxy.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type 'abc' in the address bar
2. Hit enter
3. Watch it hang

Actual Results:  
I waited and waited and waited and eventually killed the browser from the
Windows Task List which then unfortunately killed all opened Firefox browsers.

Expected Results:  
1. Not Hung, or 
2. Allowed me to stop the request, or
3. Gone and search google for the word.
