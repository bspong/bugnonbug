Opens original multiple tabs every time

After downloading and installing 1.5.0.3 on 2 Dell laptops (Inspiron and XPS), every time Firefox is opened, the original tabs that were open when I shut down this version the first time reappear every time I open Firefox.  Same on both computers.  Yet if Firefox is not open and I click on a URL in an e-mail, Firefox opens afresh with only the selected URL, no additional tabs.

(Both PCs are running XP SP2 with the latest Patch Tuesday updates.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox from an icon or firefox.exe from Explorer to produce the tabs that were open when I shut down Firefox immediately after installing 1.5.0.3.
2. Open Firefox by clicking on a URL in an e-mail with Firefox closed to produce expected behavior.
3.

Actual Results:  
1. The same tabs that were open when I shut down Firefox the first time after downloading 1.5.0.3.
2. Normal behavior.

Expected Results:  
Home page, no addiitonal tabs open

It should have just opened to the Home screen, one tab only.
