When address bar gains focus firefox closes
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)

Upon gaining focus, the address bar location bar somehow closes firefox. There is no crash reported so I am unable to include that here.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open firefox
2.tab to or shift tab to location bar
3.once bar gains focus, firefox closes, leaving no trace of itself.
Actual Results:  
firefox closes leaving no crash log or report of any kind to indicate why it is doing this

Expected Results:  
i should have been able to navigate to the bar, erase text, and reenter text of a new place. it used to work like this.

First, i'm using papps version of firefox, though i understand the only real difference here is how it is launched, there's nothing special in firefox papps version itself. second, i'm having to use the jaws screen reader package. this shouldn't be an issue, it should work with firefox just fine. third, I'm having to use pcreservation, a client based session scheduler for library patrons. Don't think this would have anything to do with it, though jaws sometimes has issues with it, so thought i'd mention it.
