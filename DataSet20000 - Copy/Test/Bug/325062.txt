Site does not display anything because browser.cache.memory.enable is set to false

site www.paypay.com does not display: only a blank screen shows.

re-starting Firefox does not affect problem.

This <i>might</i> be OK if IE did not properly display the site.

Downloading site using IE, then loading resullting file, results in proper display.... 

...so this side does not seem to rely on some IE only specification (one might assume)

(I've marked this as major feature since displaying pages seems to be important to some people :)

suggestion: problem in HTTP protocol?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. type www.paypay.com into location field at top of browser.
2. click "go" or press "return"
3. observe a blank page

Actual Results:  
uh... maybe remember to start Firefox first?

Expected Results:  
blank screen (filling this out is getting a bit repetative)

[an error message of the sort "Can't access page contents because...." might be a bit better.]

Displayed the site as viewed with IE... if behaving like an inferior product can be considered proper results :)
