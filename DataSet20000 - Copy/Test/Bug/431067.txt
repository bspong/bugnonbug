Contextual Menu Has Wrong Options and Location

The contextual menu brought up by right-clicking is broken in text entry boxes such as the one I'm typing in now. Depending on the HTML, the level of brokenness varies. The easiest example to reproduce is the spell checker. On bugzilla, if I right-click on a word the spell checker considers misspelled, the contextual menu will pop up in the right place, but will contain no spelling options. On other sites, such as the dirtyimpreza.com forum (SFW, it's an offroad car site), right-clicking on a misspelled word will result in the contextual menu appearing at some random point on the screen, still not containing spelling suggestions.

However, the misplacement of the contextual menu happens even if you aren't trying to correct a misspelled word.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a forum the browser doesn't like such as dirtyimpreza.com
2. Try to type a post into the reply box for a thread
3. Misspell a word, notice the red underlining
4. Right click on misspelled word
Actual Results:  
1. Contextual menu appears at the very top of the screen with variable horizontal positioning
2. Contextual menu doesn't contain items relevant in that context (such as spelling suggestions).

Expected Results:  
1. Contextual menu should appear aligned to click point
2. Contextual menu should contain items relevant to current context

Prior versions of Firefox didn't do this, so this is a regression.  Builds of Ff from about a month ago didn't do this, but did have a different problem with contextual menus. That bug has been resolved. Did resolving that bug cause this regression?
