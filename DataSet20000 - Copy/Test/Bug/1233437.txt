Steps to reproduce:

Navigate to google.com, gmail.com, or youtube.com


Actual results:

First I want to mention all problems below are intermittent and don't always happen. I have already tried starting firefox in safe mode and this does not fix it. I have also tried doing a refresh of firefox and this also does not fix it. Here are the problems:

On google.com: Page loads as expected except Google logo is missing entirely. If I perform a search then in the top left corner of the screen where the logo or doodle should appear just text comes up. For example today instead of the logo there is a text link that says "Celebrating Ludwig van Beethoven's 245th Year Doodle". If I right click on the link and select view image a blank white page loads with no image.

On youtube or gmail.com: Again the youtube or gmail logos don't load and additionally some buttons such as the search button to the right of the youtube search bar don't show any text. It is just a blank grey square. The happens to a number of buttons in gmail also. Finally sometimes youtube video thumbnails load fine, but sometimes they are just a tiny black horizontal line. If I ctrl-F5 to refresh the page usually the thumbnails load properly after the refresh.

I have included a PDF with screen shots of all issues except gmail because at the moment gmail is working properly. If it starts to not load button icons I will update this bug with an image.


Expected results:

All pictures, thumbnails, and logos should load on every page.
