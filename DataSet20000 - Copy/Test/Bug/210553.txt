Problems launching external links from other applications when Firebird is default browser, XML parsing error (Error "No XBL binding for browser" appears when trying to launch from Eudora, snak, etc.)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030623 Mozilla Firebird/0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030623 Mozilla Firebird/0.6

While this bug is listed in Bugzilla for Mozilla at large, I feel I should
report the bug because it's been my unfortunate experience that Firebird is
significantly more "willing" to throw this error and is therefore considerably
less usable. I have used both Mozilla and Firebird, and unfortunately the
problem happens just about every single time with Firebird.

The exact problem is that when setting Firebird as the system default browser in
the Internet preferences pane (I'm using Mac OS X 10.2.6) and
double-command-clicking on URLs in Snak, an IRC client, or when using Eudora,
which is set to use Contents/MacOS/MozillaFirebird-bin as the browser to launch,
I get the nasty top-left-of-screen "error launching browser: no XBL binding for
window". Sometimes, I can't even click OK on the dialog box to make it go away
and have to quit (command-Q) the browser to make it go.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set Firebird to the default browser as described above in Details
2. Use application built-in URL launching to try to load any URL
3. Error appears

Actual Results:  
Error dialog box appears complaining of no XBL binding for browser, with
hard-to-remove error dialog box sometimes, and certainly never the requested
browser window

Expected Results:  
Launched the URL in a browser window
