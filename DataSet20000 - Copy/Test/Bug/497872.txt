Will not stay logged in on any sites after leaving the site and going back.

I cannot get it to remember that I have been logged into a site at any time. I have to log in each and every time even if I haven't closed the browser but have just closed the tab instead. I upgraded from firefox 3.0 to this beta one yesterday and have noticed the problem since then. It hasn't given me a promt for remembering the passwords on these particular sites as they were ones I visited daily and had the previous version set to remember them. I am not sure if it remembers new sites or not as I haven't tried that. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on the site from bookmarks.(yahoo mail, reflexive arcade forum index page, facebook are the 3 I know of for sure)
2.Will have to log in everytime even tho I have checked to stay logged in.
3.It only stays logged in while I am actually on the site, once I leave it and come back I have to log in once again.
Actual Results:  
I described that all above

Expected Results:  
It should have kept me logged in after leaving the site as I had clicked on 1)for yahoo mail it is stay logged in for 2 weeks, for reflexive it is stay logged in each and every time you access the page as is it for facebook. I should not have to continually log into sites that previous versions of firefox had already been working fine with.
