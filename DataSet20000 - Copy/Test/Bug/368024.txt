When you attempt to connect to a ftp server Firefox uses the login anonymous first even if a username and password is given when prompted.  Some servers disconnect after the first failed login.  Firefox does not notice that the connection was dropped and tried to send a new login however it goes no where and never times out.

This issue is easily reproduced using zFTPServer that has NO zFTPServer (a free ftp server application).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Login to the sample URL using the username/password provided in a followup message
2.  Note that it doesn't go anywhere

This is more easily noticed if you are running the server locally where you can see the logs.
Actual Results:  
FTP connection stalls and never completes

Expected Results:  
FTP connects successfully.

This issue is specific to servers that drop the connection after the first failed connection.  This isn't zFTPServer specific and can apply to any server that is setup that way.
