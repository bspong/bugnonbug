Name field of bookmarks saved via "Bookmark All Tabs" is empty when loading the tab is deferred
+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #446171 +++

If "Bookmarks - Bookmark All Tabs..." is applied to several tabs, the particular bookmarks do not get any page title. Part of the URL is shown in the bookmarks folder instead.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open several tabs
2. Open http://www.mozilla.org/community/
3. Set tabs to only load when selected after startup (deferred tab loading).
4. Restart Firefox and see the titles for all the tabs are present even before loading them.
5. Select "Bookmarks => Bookmark All Tabs..."
6. Enter a Folder name, e.g., "foo"
7. Select "Bookmarks => foo"
Actual Results:  
In the subfolder "foo" of the bookmark folder, the corresponding bookmark to http://www.mozilla.org/community/ appears not as "Mozilla Community" but as "http://www.mozilla.org/community/" instead.

Expected Results:  
I expect Firefox to fill in the page title ("Mozilla Community" in the example) into the name field of each particular bookmark generated by "Bookmark All Tabs..." since the title is already present on the tabs themselves.
