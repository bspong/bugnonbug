Only popup windows but not tabs of a re-restoreing of session got restored after a 2second power failure (=2nd restore session).
I had some tabs opened and after a windows shutdown (firefox was open during shutdown) firefox asked me if I want to restore the session (I said yes :)). Sofar so good all tabs were restored. I did not close any tabs but opened new tabs. Inside of this tabs I opened several popups. I had a power failure and I had to restart my computer. I started firefox again and restored the session. Everything was restored (popups, tabs from the first crash) but not the tabs which I opened after the first restoring.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open some tabs in a browser
2. Produce somehow a crash of firefox (pull the plug?)
3. Restore the session
4. Open new tabs -> Open popups in a window (via the context menu)
5. Pull the plug from your computer :)
6. Restart again
7. Open firefox and restore the session. 
Popups and the tabs from session of step 2 are restored but not the tabs from step 4 :(



Expected Results:  
Every tabs should be restored as the popups
