There is no easy way to download the product from the products' own page!!! 
This is a major usability snafu.  The only one I found was under "Other systems
and languages".  Never mind that this was the first in a list, so "other" made
no sense -- "DOWNLOAD NOW" should be easy to find.  Really easy.  Stupifyingly easy.

I hope I've made my point.  Please don't backlash against me -- backlash against
the problem.  Make it easy for folks to *start* using the product, or they will
never find out how easy the product is to use.  It's about the "out of the box"
experiences, as the Apple usability folks would say.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/
2. Search for "download"
3. Notice that none of these are links.
4. Search around.
5. Become frustrated that all the hype has no easily findable links to a
download of the product.


Actual Results:  
Frustration, leading to loss of credibility in the otherwise well founded
marketing hype about a product that I'm actually interested in using, and have
started promoting.

Expected Results:  
Read the hype!

Decide to make the switch.

Hit the big "Download & Install" button.

Have it work.
