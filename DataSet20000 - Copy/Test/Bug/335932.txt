While in cPanel, none of the images load, and it takes over 2 minutes to see anything on the page.

I would give a URL, but you need a username and password to access cPanel, after the page starts loading, almost all of the images don't load, and when I click "view image", it says it's corrupted. However, it works in IE 6, IE 7, and Firefox 1.5. It doesn't work in this trunk build or 2.0a1

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get a cPanel account (I don't know where, mine is with a Post to Host Forum, e2utalk.com, so if you want to make 30 posts and try, you can.)
2. Log in to cPanel at e2u.cc/cpanel
3. Almost no images load properly

Actual Results:  
I said all I can say above...almost no images load while in cPanel at E2U, I don't have a cPanel account anywhere else, so I couldn't tell you if it's like that everywhere, but I would think it would.

Expected Results:  
The images should load perfectly with no errors in under 10 secs on my 10mbps Cable internet conenction

I was using the default theme, no extensions except for Talkback and DOM Inspector, I have tried reinstalling, and in safe mode, nothing helped, I consider this a major bug because it may force the thousands (or maybe more) web developers that use cPanel, to switch to IE or Opera
