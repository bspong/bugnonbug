FireFox does NOT remember what application to open downloads with

each time I download an attachment via FireFox it asks what app to use to open it. I select the app, it downloads and opens. I go into prefs and check that the apps are correctly selected - .pps = PowerPoint, .mwv - Quicktime/Flip4Mac - WMV player. This is a consistent problem - if I download two .pps in a row I have to go through the app selection process each time. The only advantage is that the selection window is already opened to the right one.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In FoxFire, accessing my email
2. Find email with attachment, select to download
3. Go through the 'opening app' selection process
4. FireFox downloads the attachment
Actual Results:  
FireFox downloads the attachment
the attachement opens and runs in the correct (selected) app.
FireFox forgets the app for each type of download.

Expected Results:  
FireFox should 'remember' the app selected for each type of attachment - .pps = PowerPoint, etc., as it is set in the Prefs section.
