Bookmarks toolbar after bookmarks import (from JSON, or HTML file) doesn't contain saved icons (*.ico).
Moreover, when any of bookmark is updated and icon appears on toolbar, after Firefox restart it's lost again.
Checked on Linux Mandiva 32-bit, Windows 7 64-bit.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Collect some bookmarks into Bookmars Toolbar. 
2.Make sure all of them have own icons (*.ico) on left side (it's enough to wait until site is loaded fully)
3.Make a copy of your Bookmarks (Import/Export -> Make a backup).
4.Delete all of the bookmarks (I've reinstalled the system)
5.Restore saved bookmarks (Import/Export -> Restore from JSON file).
6.Look at Bookmarks Toolbar again - there are just default BLUE FLOWER icons at each of bookmark.
7.ONLY DO AFTER IMPORT: refresh some pages from Bookmarks Toolbar to get *ico files appeared on Bookmarks Toolbar.
8. ONLY DO AFTER 7: restart browser and see how the icons dissapeared.
Actual Results:  
1. Bookmarks toolbar after bookmarks import doesn't contain saved icons (*.ico)
2. After import - even when you reload some pages from Bookmarks Toolbar - icons are stored just temporarily and don't show after restart.

Expected Results:  
1. Saved icons (*.ico) should be stored in JSON file.
2. Bookmars Toolbar should contain icon pictures (*.ico) after (1) import Bookmarks AND (2) refreshing some pages AND (3) browser restart.
