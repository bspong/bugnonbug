Update certificates are checked even if app.update.url.override is set in Thunderbird >= 10.0.7esr
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1229.94 Safari/537.4

Steps to reproduce:

We push out our own updates of Thunderbird by setting app.update.url.override to our own url. This has worked fine up to version 10.0.7esr. Now when a user tries to update to 10.0.8esr, no update is found even though we have made 10.0.8esr available for the users.


Actual results:

In the error log, the following is shown:
Error: Expected certificate attribute 'issuerName' value incorrect, expected: 'OU=Equifax Secure Certificate Authority,O=Equifax,C=US', got: '<our certificate provider>'.
Source File: resource://gre/modules/CertUtils.jsm
Line: 103
Error: Expected certificate attribute 'commonName' value incorrect, expected: 'aus3.mozilla.org', got: '<our certificate name>'.
Source File: resource://gre/modules/CertUtils.jsm
Line: 103
Error: Certificate checks failed. See previous errors for details.
Source File: resource://gre/modules/CertUtils.jsm
Line: 106

Apparently, version 10.0.7esr (and newer) checks the app.update.certs.x.commonName and app.update.certs.x.issuerName event though app.update.url.override is set.



Expected results:

The certificate checks should have been skipped since app.update.url.override is set.
This was the case in all versions we have tried including 10.0.6esr.
