User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:27.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/27.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140214013806

Steps to reproduce:

Leaving Firefox open for a reasonable period of time (generally over an hour) with multiple tabs open (from 5-20+). Issue occurs whether or not Firefox should actively be doing things and whether or not and whether or not I'm currently in the Firefox window. Multiple windows being open seems to make the problem worse.

Happens on ArchLinux with 4GB RAM, i3 CPU. Desktop environment does not make a difference and running time varies. Limits are configured for PIDs and memory but don't appear to make a difference when within sane limits.


Actual results:

Firefox spawns a massive number of threads, causing the system to grind to a halt. It appears that the issue becomes a problem slowly and if caught fast enough Firefox can be terminated and restarted which fixes the problem. If left alone, the system locks up completely and needs to be forcibly rebooted.


Expected results:

Firefox should be able to be left up for any reasonable amount of time without spawning enough threads to grind the system to a halt.
