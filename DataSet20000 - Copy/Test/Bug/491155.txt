I have a table with style "border-collapse: collapse". For this table I have two different TR classes. 
class A: slim bordered, gray backgrounded 
class B: strong bordered, red backgrounded

When I load a html document in which one specific TR has the strong-bordering class and the other ones are slim-bordered then everything is fine. If I want to give the strong-bordering class to an other TR by javascript then this TR gets the red background but will not get strong border. 

Actually, now I have two TRs with the same css rule but they look different. 

If I hard-code the strong-border className to both of the TRs before loading the html, then everything is fine, i.e. both of them are red and strong-bordered.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load the html file (attached soon), see the one specific row with red background and strong border
2. click the link 
Actual Results:  
Two rows of the table have red background but only the original row has strong border, the latter one has not. 

Expected Results:  
I think if I attach a className dynamically then it should look the same as when I load it from statical html document. That is, I think both rows should have strong border.

In Opera it works the same as in Firefox. (Suspicious...)
In MSIE7 it works as I expected (Even more suspicious... Maybe I am wrong?:))

If the table is not border-collapsed then everything works fine: by clicking the link both rows will become strong-bordered.
