strace of firefox

Description of problem:
Firefox crashes as soon as a menu is clicked or anything is right-clicked.
Error that comes up on stderr is

shm_open() failed: Permission denied
Assertion 'pthread_mutex_unlock(&m->mutex) == 0' failed at pulsecore/mutex-posix.c:108, function pa_mutex_unlock(). Aborting.
/usr/lib/firefox-3.6/run-mozilla.sh: line 131:  2928 Aborted                 "$prog" ${1+"$@"}

as is the strace log.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
firefox-3.6.3-4.fc13.armv5tel

How reproducible:
Every time.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install firefox-3.6.3-4.fc13.armv5tel from F13 arm koji repository.
2. Run firefox.
3. Click on any menu or right click a link.

Actual results:
Crash.

Additional info:
Previous version of Firefox from F12 (firefox-3.5.4-1.fc12.armv5tel) is much
more stable (it's at least usable enough to post this bug report with).

Have an additional reference point - the F13 Firefox (3.6.3) works OK on my
sheeva plug (remote X output).

The crashing is on the Toshiba AC100. So it is possible that the crashing is
related to something specific on the AC100 setup, possibly it's broken audio
drivers causing some weird interraction with pulseaudio, as per the error
message in the previous attachment.
