A "Stop Loading All Tabs" button when Firefox loads "last time's" tabs, please.

For when restarting Firefox with the "show my windows and tabs from last time" startup option turned on, and the previous session contained a lot of tabs (but not enough to trigger the "Loading all tabs may slow Firefox down" warning), a "Stop Loading All Tabs" option/button would be really nice.

This may be an "editable threshold for triggering the 'too many tabs' alert" request, which would also then apply to the situation of loading a large group of "Bookmark All Tabs" folder, but I really would like to see: a startup bookmark folder view of the tabs in question, with something like an "open all" or "open selected", perhaps even with a "don't ask me again" option.

The problem (and especially important for either metered or bandwidth-challenged connections) is reloading a lot of pages with graphics, embedded audio and video, when you really only want one specific page.  (Later you could easily hit the reload button for any particular page you want to see again.)

When you want one page only, it takes a long time to load with lots of other pages loading simultaneously, and right now you have to manually focus on each page and then hit the "stop loading" button for that page, repeat for next page... etc.

(I've long retired from anything that actually resembled coding, but I hope this sounds like a relatively simple tweak.)

Thank folks, you're doing a great job!
