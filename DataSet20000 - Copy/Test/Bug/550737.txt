Applications which use Direct3D overlays cause various issues on 3.7a with D2D enabled

In the attached screenshot, I'm using Mumble's overlay (top) (http://mumble.sourceforge.net/) and FRAPS (lower right); both programs attach an overlay to programs that acquire accelerated surfaces (generally, games). Mumble displays a list of people in a channel, and FRAPS displays your current framerate.

With those on, when I scroll up and down the page, I get "ghosted" portions of the overlays that aren't repainted, and it generally ruins the entire effect of the page. The D2D acceleration is nice, but it is completely unusable with this kind of conflict.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start up Mumble (ensure Overlay is on) or FRAPS
2. Open Firefox 3.72a with D2D acceleration on 
3. Scroll up and down a page
Actual Results:  
I get "ghosted" portions of the overlay copied up and down the page, making it unreadable.

Expected Results:  
Ideally, the overlays should not appear. If they must appear, they should not ghost up and down the page, instead remaining in a static location as they would with any other similarly accelerated software (Flash fullscreen mode, Sony Vegas' video preview, Windows Media Player).
