Update Manager fails to connect if extension updates pending

If there are extensions installed and/or updated, in the state where they are waiting for Firefox to be restarted in order to apply the update/installation, the "Check For Updates" dialogue either fails to connect or continuously claims to be connecting to the update server.

Restarting firefox and applying said installs/updates resolves the issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install a new extension, or download an update.
2. Do not restart firefox when prompted by the extension manager.
3. Run 'Check For Updates' to search for a firefox update.
Actual Results:  
The 'check for updates' dialogue first said I was not connected to the internet, then simply continued saying it was "connecting to update server..." until I manually closed (5+ minutes).

Restarted and update manager worked.  Downloaded new extension and reproduced.

Expected Results:  
'check for updates' finds an update/alerts me I have newest version.

Applying the extension updates resolves the problem.  Was able to reproduce by downloading another new extension.
