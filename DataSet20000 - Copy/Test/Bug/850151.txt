select field: adding and removing fields causes bug
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_7_5) AppleWebKit/537.22 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/25.0.1364.160 Safari/537.22

Steps to reproduce:

I have a UI for users to select custom fields that they need on their form. Essentially I have to multi-select fields(A and B), one containing the pool of all options, and the other containing the ones they need.
There is an add button and a remove button. When the user highlights some options in A and clicks "add", the highlighted options are, through jQuery, removed from A and appended to B, and vice versa for "remove".
When the form is submitted, we make sure all the options of B are selected using jQuery.attr method.


Actual results:

We developed this on Chrome, and it worked fine in all cases. But our clients use Firefox, and encountered a bug.
In only one of the use cases, something weird was happening:
Step 1: Highlight some options in A
Step 2: Click "Add". Highlighted options removed from A and appended to B
Step 3: Highlight some option (not all) in B, and click "Remove". Selected fields are moved from B to A.
Step 4: Submit. This is where Chrome works without issue, but Firefox causes problems. Firefox fails to highlight any of the new fields in B, and as a result no new fields are added, i.e., it only highlights the fields that were already there.


Expected results:

On submit, all the options on the select field should have been highlighted.
