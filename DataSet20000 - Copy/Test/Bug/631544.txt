*** REGRESSION ***  Cannot access Printer Properties within Crossword Flash application (worked with the 2/2/11 Nightly)

I cannot go into the printer Properties in the crossword program above (enter crossword, click "Print" in between Options and Solve) to change the settings.  Other items on this screen also don't work, such as trying to change the printer or clicking Cancel (doesn't work).  I was able to print a puzzle on this site yesterday with the 2/2/11 Nightly build (you need to print the puzzle using the app and NOT the Minefield main printer command, as you will not get all the clues printed).  Clicking OKAY to try to print ALSO doesn't work.  Only way to close this screen is by clicking the [X].

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Cannot print crossword (REGRESSION).  Worked with 2/2/11 morning Nightly build (before 10:00 AM Eastern time).

Expected Results:  
I was able to print the crossword yesterday and now cannot with the new build.  Another site I print, which also uses Flash, doesn't work as well (http://www.patsajakgames.com/games/psgcc_online.html).
