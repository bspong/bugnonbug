[e10s] Menu popups aren't rendered in Remote XUL
When using a Remote XUL page in an e10s tab, menu popups don't appear. Using the inspector in the dev tools suggests they're present, but not visible. They work fine when opened in a non-e10s window.

Steps to Reproduce:

1) Add the "Remote XUL Manager" add-on to Firefox and open its preferences pane.
2) Use the Add button to whitelist https://developer.mozilla.org
3) View one of the XUL menu examples in the XUL tutorial. Examples are:

https://developer.mozilla.org/samples/xultu/examples/ex_menubar_1.xul
https://developer.mozilla.org/samples/xultu/examples/ex_advmenu_1.xul

4) Note that the menu itself is visible, but the popup is not.
5) Optionally open the developer tools to confirm that the relevant elements are highlighted when moving the mouse over the invisible menu popup.



Note on Remote XUL:
Although I appreciate that Remote XUL is well and truly deprecated, we have an intranet application that runs to over 150,000 lines of code based on the technology. We plan to migrate to HTML once Web Components are available, but until then we're stuck with Remote XUL. The examples listed above demonstrate the issue without the need to whitelist an arbitrary domain, but the problem does occur in our real application in exactly the same way.
