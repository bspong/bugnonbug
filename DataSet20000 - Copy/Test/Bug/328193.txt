Tab focus ring / outline not always complete - chrome elements interfere with outline
Just a minor polish bug, but I'm surprised it hasn't been reported before...

In the Mac trunk builds, if you focus a tab so that the blue focus ring / outline appears, sometimes the ring is only partially drawn (or perhaps partially hidden?).

Sometimes it's only one side of the focus ring that is missing, sometimes it's one side and the top. I'll attach a screenshot next, to illustrate.

Sometimes you can reproduce this simply by switching between tabs. But at worst, this method seems to only produce a missing side to the focus outline.

A much more reliable method is to first put the mouse focus on a text box within a page. As expected, the tab focus outline disappears with the focus change. Then click on the tab again to focus it. Or click twice on another tab to focus that. The blue focus ring should appear around the tab, but you should notice that the top and one side of it are missing.

Mousing over tabs or bookmark toolbar buttons that are next to the missing focus outline restore the adjacent section of it.

This bug started between the 20050627 and 20050628 builds. I assume it's a result of the fix for bug 298799.
