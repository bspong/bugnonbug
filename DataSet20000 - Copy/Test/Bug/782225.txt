Can't load nor open pages like google reader, gsp.rp, code.google.com
Build ID : 14.0.1, 15.0b4, 17.0a1 (latest 08/12/2012)

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open Firefox 
2. Open new tab -> write reader in URL -> enter -> first suggestion in google search is Google Reader : www.google.com/reader
2. Open gsp.ro -> after page loads try to pan, choose article, open new tab

Expected result:
- page google reader (www.google.com/reader) should be displayed
- you should be able to load articles or pan pages like gsp.ro

Actual result: 
-> After choosing first suggestion Google Reader : www.google.com/reader  the browser freezes and gets in non responsive state - undetermined time 
-- you need to force close either through process manager or x close button - force close.
-- at restore - you don't get reader page in the session restore list
-> Page gsp.ro load and after it the browser freezes - same behavior as above. 

Note:
- I also tried the followings but nothing helped:
--> set spdy on false in about:config
--> enetr save mode
--> disable harware acceleration
--> set to false all network.http in about:config
--> Here is a screencast of the workflow on my desktop
--> delete all profile related data

- Everything was working fine till this morning   
- Everything works fine in Chrome Browser
- I can access this pages from other work station with same outside IP
