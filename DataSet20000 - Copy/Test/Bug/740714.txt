flash video continues to play audio after page exit

Steps to reproduce:

search for video (song) at Youtube. click on a video, page starts to load, before 'song' starts to play hit back arrow or link to another page.


Actual results:

the audio from the original page that was exited before play started, starts to play and as I've left that page, there is no way to stop it. It will continue to end of 'song' (video) and if it is a page that is a 'play list' it will continue on with the list. Reload any page does not stop it. Going back to the page does not stop it. 
It Only happens when the page is exited either by back arrow or link to elsewhere, before audio (video) starts that it does this.
It's been happening about 6 to 10 days of updates on Aurora 13.0a2, running on openSuSE 12.1 Linux 3.1.9-1.4-desktop and KDE 4.7.2 release 5 ( both fully updated), flash ver. 11.1.102.63


Expected results:

either the (video) audio portion, should never start playing or it should time out, run out if it had started to cache, as soon as it 'realizes' the page changed. 
I do not have a fast enough connection that the whole song could be cached in such a short time (2-5 secs) and No way a whole play list. 

I am connected med. signal via wlan which is connected to Netgear AP, to 10 mb/s bay-synoptics hub, to smoothwall linux router (no proxy, but iptables), to comcast cable modem...
