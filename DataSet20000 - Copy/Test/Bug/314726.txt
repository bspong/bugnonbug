Using Microsoft "Add or remove programs" applet I uninstalled Firefox 1.5 beta 2 (all OK)
Using Microsoft "Add or remove programs" applet I installed Firefox 1.5 RC 1
At the start a message is displayed reporting that Firefox 1.5 BETA 2 is being installed and not the release candidate!  I thought I had picked the wrong set up file and so I checked and I hadn't made a mistake.
Installation otherwise fine.
I had already installed this on another PC (Win2K SP4) and didn't spot the message and so I do not know where or not this is specific to Win XP SP2.
Hope I've followed all the bug reporting rules - apologies if I've made a mistake - keep up the good work.
