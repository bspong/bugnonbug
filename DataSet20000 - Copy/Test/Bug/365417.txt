Firefox crashes when opening an account after logging in on gmail.
User-Agent:       Opera/9.10 (X11; Linux i686; U; en)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; da; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061208 Firefox/2.0.0.1

1. Open Firefox
2. Go to www.gmail.com. The page opens normally.
3. Log in on a mail account.
4. Firefox first shows an empty page with a message: "Reading", which is normal.
5. Gmails inbox is displayed, showing the content of the inbox normally.
6. Firefox crashes after a few seconds.

Traceback:
[vidarjb@dhcppc5 ~]$ firefox
The program 'Gecko' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)'.
  (Details: serial 119 error_code 8 request_code 145 minor_code 3)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)

The system: Mandriva 2007 Free edition, running IceWM. 

I run Firefox 2.0 on 2 systems, both running Mandriva 2007, the one running IceWM, crashes Firefox, but on the other one, that runs Gnome and 3d desktop with Xgl, Firefox don't crash.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 2.0.0.1 on a Mandriva 2007 system, running IceWM
2. Navigate to www.gmail.com
3. Log in to a gmail account, and wait for Firefox to list the inbox
Actual Results:  
Mozilla crashes with the following trace:
The error was 'BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)'.
  (Details: serial 119 error_code 8 request_code 145 minor_code 3)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;

   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)


Expected Results:  
It was expected to show the gmail inbox, xo I could read my mails
