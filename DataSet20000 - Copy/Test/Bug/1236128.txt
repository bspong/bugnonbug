"Search HTML" in browser toolbox counts elements from other frames (<window>s)
(Based on bug 1228675 comment 3)

STR that works for 44- and 45:
1. Open firefox;   make sure you have only 1 window opened;   make sure remote debugging is enabled
2. Open N more windows
3. In the last opened window open Browser Toolbox -> Inspector,   scroll markup to the bottom
4. Type "#search-container" without quotes in the search field,   press Enter N+1 times

Result:       Markup just scrolls up by 1 page the tirst N times you press Enter.
              When you press enter N+1th time, the correct node is selected in markup-view.
              If you're using ff45+, then search field displays "k of N+1" (found nodes)

Expectations: The correct node should be selected after the 1st press of Enter key
              On ff45+ search field should display "1 of 1"

Notes:
 I think it's "Devtools: Framework" bug, since I don't see this behavior in Inspector
  when I inspect normal frames on a web page. Maybe I haven't tried hard enough.
 Also, I still see that "scroll 1 page to the top when node can't be selected"-behavior. I thought
  it was fixed in bug 1184525, but it wasn't. Probably it's a good idea to fix that behavior once
  and for all, because there still may be other cases when the next found node can't be selected.
