Whenever I try to download a gadget for Windows Sidebar from the Microsoft page http://gallery.microsoft.com/vista/SideBar.aspx, everything works normally until a small window pops up asking if i want to install the gadget. When I click "install", the window disappears and nothing happens. When I check the list of installed gadgets, the gadget i tried to download does not show up. When I try to download gadgets using IE 8, after I click install, more windows pop up and I am able to add the gadget to the sidebar. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the website http://gallery.microsoft.com/vista/SideBar.aspx
2. Try to download any gadget; click on the link that says download. 
3. A window should pop up with the options "install" and "don't install". Click "install". 

Actual Results:  
The small window disappears and nothing else happens. 

Expected Results:  
More windows should have come up asking whether I want to open or save something. When I click open, another window should come up asking if I want to install the gadget. When I click yes, the gadget appears in my sidebar and list of installed gadgets.
