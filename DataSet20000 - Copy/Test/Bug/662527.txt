Opening "Troubleshooting Information" page hangs *computer* for nearly one minute.

Opening "Troubleshooting Information" in FF results in:

1. Nothing unusual for a few seconds.
2. CPU fan stops, indicating CPU use zero. Current window and controls, taskbar, etc. all become unresponsive. Keyboard LEDs cannot be toggled.
3. A few seconds after that, the mouse pointer freezes.
4. For roughly 40 seconds, the attached router shows network activity and so does the light on the NIC at the back; the drive activity light is on solid (no flickering at all) and an ear to the case reveals drive access noises.
5. Recovery is abrupt: everything starts working again, and FF pops up a notice saying that a script on the page is unresponsive.

This obviously should be *physically impossible* under a protected-mode operating system such as Vista, but somehow you've managed it anyway. In fact it's even less clear how this can happen at low-to-zero CPU use. The obvious method (give a couple of threads Realtime priority and have them busy-hang) would max out the CPU instead. To have it happen at zero CPU seems to require complicity from an OS or driver bug that results in some systemwide lock being held for an unreasonable amount of time.

Remarkably, I had a number-crunching background process running when this happened and even that stopped. It doesn't touch anything except main memory and CPU in mid-job -- no I/O whatsoever, other than to print to a command prompt console. This would not have been trying to acquire DirectX surfaces or things like that, in other words.

I'm classing this as critical rather than major even though the hang spontaneously resolves after a minute or so, on the grounds that a lot of users will reach for the power switch much sooner than 60 seconds after a hang so complete as to include the mouse pointer freezing. This will obviously tend to cause data loss and crash absolutely everything, including Firefox.
