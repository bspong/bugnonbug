For the Google search plugin, change country-specific TLD URLs to www.google.com
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.3) Gecko/20060426 Firefox/1.5.0.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.3) Gecko/20060426 Firefox/1.5.0.3

Across Firefox builds for different locales, the Google search plugin currently uses a variety of URLs for search. Some of the search URLs are www.google.com while others are country-specific top-level domains such as www.google.bg.

During a recent Fx 1.5.0.3 build exercise for Google CJKT distributiosn (where Google is the default search instead of Yahoo), it was discovered that Google wants to have all searches going to www.google.com instead of the country-specific TLD.

Concerns were raised about whether they really wanted traffic from say Taiwan to be going to www.google.com and potentially crossing the Pacific on every search but apparently they have implmented some sort of global DNS load balancing solution as well as IP detection for routing to the nearest server.

In particular, all locale builds should be checked but according to a cursory glance, the following is a preliminary list from Axel Hecht of country-specific TLD routing locales that need changing:

Here is the official Google request for making this change.

Basil,

Our feeling is that the best implementation is to send the traffic to www.google.com across the board.  I wanted to check with others on our team before changing the original bits, and we have confirmed that this is the best practice.  If you are so able, please update the existing locales to send traffic to google.com.

Send any questions or concerns my way.

Thanks,

Patrick
