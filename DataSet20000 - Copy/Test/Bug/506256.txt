Can't access bookmarks

I made an update yesterday including firefox, and after the the update I restart firefox as asked. When restarted, it worked up til this this morning, since where:
- I don't see my bookmarks, all them have desperate, 
- All the icons ("next","previous","refresh", etc...... ) are deactivated; when a web page is opened, it's really opened but I don't see the address in the address bar,
- I can not access to my web server locally, since I'm not connected to internet or have activated "Travailler hors connexion" at the file menu, while I can access to it with another browser like Konqueror.
- My browser seems still searching the web site, since the page is already 
opened.
- The addresses I access to are not kept in the address bar.
This is few details I can give to you, hopefully you could help me troubleshooting and fix this bug on my sytem.
I didn't get to reinstall firefox cause I thought it could lead to the lost of my pages bookmarked, which are very important for me.

Thank a lot for excusing my english language , and helping me

I'm waiting eventually for your propositions inside my mailbox.

Best regards!

Eugene.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I closed firefox and restart the apllication, and get the same things
2. I restart the machine and no change
3. I try "sudo apt-get update", always no change.
Actual Results:  
No change, I have the same problem I described above, since the morning. 

Expected Results:  
No change, My bookmark is still empty, the tool bar is still deactivated and the address of the web site still doesn't appear in the address bar.
The addresses I access to are not kept in the address bar.

I can specify any thing at this level, cause the bug instantly appeared ; I was using my browser with the same configuration since this morning. I just know that I made updates yesterday, including Firefox updates. But after updates, I restart the browser as recommended and continue using it, since this morning when the bug appeared, after I started my computer.
