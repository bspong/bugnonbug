search suggestions behave badly when suggestion URL requires http authentication

Steps to reproduce:

For our Intranet we have an internal search engine that we added to Fx using an opensearchdescription+xml tag. The search engine has autocomplete enabled using an application/x-suggestions+json inside the search description.
The search engine + the suggestion URL are both behind a single HTTP Basic Auth challenge.
Example URL's:
Basic Auth Realm: https://office.domain.name/quickscan/
Search description: https://office.domain.name/quickscan/qs-search.xml
Search Engine: https://office.domain.name/quickscan/?domain=<searchTerms>
Auto complete URL: https://office.domain.name/quickscan/qs-complete.cgi?domain={searchTerms}



Actual results:

Whenever a user tries to use the search box for the first time in a new Fx session, after typing a partial word they get an HTTP Basic Auth popup. When they submit this (Either with fresh information, or saved credentials), and continue typing, they get another popup for the same HTTP Basic Auth realm, and this continues untill the user finishes typing.
Once they submit the search query and a window opens to display the search result, a final HTTP Basic Auth popup appears, and only once that one is submitted will Fx save the credentials to the session. From this point on all partial searches use the password that's saved


Expected results:

If a user gets a popup for a partial complete, Fx should save the submitted credentials and use that for any future (partial) searches.
