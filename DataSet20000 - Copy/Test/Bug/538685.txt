Windows Media PLayer Plug-in Dynamic Link Library (3.0.2.629) Doesn't Display Media Properly

If you go to the above mentioned link (http://www.cityoftacoma.org/Page.aspx?hid=9263) and try to view the January 5, 2010 Tacoma City Council Meeting media link the pop-up window showing the media player will open but the media will not start.  It will try to start but then fail.  The play button will be grayed out but will be available again after about 10-20 seconds.  If you press the play button to force play the video, nothing happens.  Also, when you click on the links to the right such as the one titled "Public Comment" it will not bring those videos up either.  I tested the plugin using the plugin test site (http://plugindoc.mozdev.org/testpages/wmp11.html) and the media will not play.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Browse to the link provided (http://www.cityoftacoma.org/Page.aspx?hid=9263)
3.Click on the "January 5, 2010 Tacoma City Council Meeting" link to attempt to view the video in question
Actual Results:  
The media does not stream automatically.  Manually attempting to play the media fails.  Other media does not open as well.

Expected Results:  
The media should begin playing seconds after the media window is opened.

Confirmed in Windows XP SP3 32-bit and Windows 7 32-bit.
