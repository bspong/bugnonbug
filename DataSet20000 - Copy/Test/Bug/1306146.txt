Firefox handles relative sourceRoot in source maps incorrectly
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:49.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/49.0

Steps to reproduce:

When a source map contains sourceRoot which represents a relative path, Firefox handles the sources paths incorrectly.

Example requires 3 files (2 if the source map is inlined):
1) Source file (http://example.com/foo/source/script.js)
2) File generated based on the source (http://example.com/foo/bundle.js)
3) Source map (http://example.com/foo/bundle.map)

Notice that the source file is located in a folder named `source` relative to the bundle.

The source map looks like this:
```
{"sources":["script.js"], "sourceRoot":"source", ...}
```

Here's a plunkr: https://plnkr.co/edit/ESu37NSP6Hs3xLxl9NLt?p=preview (Launch the preview in a separate window to reproduce the results.)


Actual results:

Instead of listing `http://example.com/foo/source/script.js` in the sources, dev tools show `http://example.com/source/script.js` - notice that `/foo` is missing, hence the URL is not correct.

(If the source map doesn't contain sourcesContent this will result in 404 when dev tools will try to load the file.)


Expected results:

According to the spec (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit#heading=h.75yo6yoyk7x5):
> If the sources are not absolute URLs after prepending of the “sourceRoot”, the sources are resolved relative to the SourceMap (like resolving script src in a html document).

In this example the resulting source should be `http://example.com/foo/` + `source` + `script.js` = `http://example.com/foo/source/script.js`

I've confirmed that Chrome, IE11 and Edge work correctly in this case.

When sourceRoot is omitted (or empty) and the source is specified as `source/script.js` the issue is not reproducible and devtools work correctly
