Running Ubuntu 9 with compiz fusion. Site chrashes after http://www.sbs6.nl/web/show/id=687439/langid=43 is entered in the URL. The first minute it's ok but after the advertisement has played the browser chrashes.
After this Firefox manages to restore the tab's when you start it up again. But only after the advertisement has played then it chrashes again. THe third start up it warns about the unrecoverablity of it all and you can deselect the above URL,
