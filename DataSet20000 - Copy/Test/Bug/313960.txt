Loading pages in tabbed browsing sometimes causes other tabs to execute current URL.

Let's say you have two tabs open and the first is at a site which uses server-side code to make it so that you only ever see one URL.  The second tab contains any standard page and you're currently browsing through pages of a site.  Upon loading or reloading pages in this second tab, if you click over to the first tab, you'll witness it reloading, or so it would seem.  The page goes back to the home page because the URL is for the home page of that site and not for the page you were just visiting.  This has limited to no repeatability except that it's happened to me dozens of times since I upgraded to 1.5 Beta 2.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1a.Open a site that uses one URL for all pages (www.domain.com is the URL no matter what).
1b.Browse the site a little so you're off the home page.
2.Open another tab in the same window and browse any site.  Load pages, reload pages.
3.Check the first tab to see if you're still on the page you browsed to or if you're on the home page for that site.

Actual Results:  
It's a rather annoying but often unnoticed problem since not many sites use one URL for every page, but the result is being sent to the URL in the address bar, whatever that is.

Expected Results:  
It should have just not executed the URL in the address bar.  My guess is that this may be some sort of cross-over due to new tab features, but I have no idea how the classes are structured, so that's a real shot in the dark.

I would guess that if my suspicions are true, you would be able to do something more interesting:  follow the steps above, but before creating the second tab, type in a different URL and don't hit enter.  The page won't load unless you tell it to or else if this bug works the way I think it does.

I don't have any specific settings that I can think of except that I have set the tab preferences so that I always have a tab bar even if there's just one tab.
