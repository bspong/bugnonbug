History is useful to find pages you consulted some times ago. However, when you
browse a site, the title of each page is often the same. The history results in
tens of links with the same title and no way to know which page is relevant to you. 

Also, when you browse the Web, you can go through a very large number of sites
and do not remember at all the title/name/URL of the site. You simply remember
some keywords related to the content of the page (e.g. firefox, block, image for
http://adblock.mozdev.org/)

A very nice functionnality would be to have an automatic indexing (as performed
by a web crawler) of the history. When you access a web page, it is added to the
history and automatically indexed for future search. When you do a fast history
search, the search is performed on the title, and also of the index database.

This bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=126621 presents a solution
based on caches for mozilla. However, this solution has many drawbacks
(limitation in the number of pages cached, solution slower than a keyword
indexing, cache can be flushed, etc.)
