randomly slow startup of new windows launched from other apps

Sometimes when clicking/activating an http url in another program with Firefox set as the default browser, the new window containing the clicked link takes a long time to open -- 20 or 30 seconds. During this time, the program in which I clicked the URL itself blocks until the Firefox window opens.

This happens regardless of whether Firefox is already running or not. If Firefox is already running, the existing Firefox windows behave correctly (they are not blocked). Only the launching app is blocked.

This is inconsistent, happening perhaps between 1 in 5 and 1 in 20 times that I launch links from other applications. I have seen this occur from multiple other applications: email, RSS reader, chat programs.

This is under Windows XP.

I do not see anything like this happening launching programs other than Firefox.

Firefox is not slow opening to open directly, nor is it slow to open new windows from within Firefox e.g. using "open in new window".

Reproducible: Sometimes
