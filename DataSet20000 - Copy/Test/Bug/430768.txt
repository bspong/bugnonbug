If I open the bookmark Library (Ctrl+Shift+B) and I delete all bookmarks (except the default folders with "Delete" option disabled), then the arrow down at the right of the address bar shows garbage text instead of the recent sites or links I visited.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run installer and install the program (v3beta5) with all the default options.
2. Go to Tools->Options->Main and set show a blank page at startup.
3. Go to Tools->Options->Privacy and disable the "Keep history..." option.
4. Open the bookmarks library by clicking Ctrl+Shift+B
5. Delete all bookmarks that firefox allow to delete.
6. Clear all private data.
7. Restart firefox.
8. Start navigation (google.com, make a search, click on results, ect).
Actual Results:  
The arrow down at the right of the address bar (address bar history) shows 3 lines of garbage text when I click on it.

Expected Results:  
The arrow down should show what I have entered in the address bar or links I clicked.
