bus error crash on using "Open File..." menu item

Using FF2.0cvs (checkout from 2006-07-11, but has been happening for a while), everything works fine except when I use the menu command File > Open File... (or ctrl-o).  At that point, FF crashes with 

/sw/lib/firefox2/run-mozilla.sh: line 424: 25336 Bus error               "$prog" ${1+"$@"}

in the terminal from which firefox was run.  The following appears in the Console:

Jul 12 10:31:23 hs14chang3 crashdump: Unable to determine CPSProcessSerNum pid: 25504 name: firefox-bin
Jul 12 10:31:23 hs14chang3 crashdump: Started writing crash report to: /Users/nieder/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/firefox-bin.crash.log
Jul 12 10:31:23 hs14chang3 crashdump: Finished writing crash report to: /Users/nieder/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/firefox-bin.crash.log

The crash log will be attached.

Things to note: I'm building a GTK2/X11 version of FF on Mac OS X for the Fink project which I've been successfully using since 0.10 up to and including 1.5.0.4.  This crash only happens with a 2.0cvs build.  The first time I select the menu item, nothing happens and I can continue browsing, loading new pages, opening the Add-ons manager, etc.  If I select the menu a second time, the browser hangs for 1 second and crashes with the above errors.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. run firefox
2. select File > Open File... twice
3. watch it crash and burn
