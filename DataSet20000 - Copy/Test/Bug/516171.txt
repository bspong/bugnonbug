I get a blank page when I go from "log in" to "inbox" on Comcast, Smartzone.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When I'm logged in at; "http://www.comcast.net/smartzone/", and click the email button, it goes to; "http://smartzone.mail.comcast.net/service/preauth?account=mjellis&by=name&timestamp=1252774437836&expires=1252796037836&preauth=6c200bb81485fa967035d0ef9d2c69de37fc00fb&redirectURL=%2Fzimbra%2Fmail", but the page is blank. I get in from IE but the address is; "http://sz0127.wc.mail.comcast.net/zimbra/mail#2". If I paste this address into Firefox, it jumps to the blank page address above. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to Comcast.net homepage.
2.Log in.
3.Click on email button.
Actual Results:  
It goes to http://sz0127.wc.mail.comcast.net/zimbra/mail#2 but immediately switches to http://smartzone.mail.comcast.net/service/preauth?account=mjellis&by=name&timestamp=1252774437836&expires=1252796037836&preauth=6c200bb81485fa967035d0ef9d2c69de37fc00fb&redirectURL=%2Fzimbra%2Fmail, a blank page

Expected Results:  
It should stayed at http://sz0127.wc.mail.comcast.net/zimbra/mail#2, and showed me my smartzone inbox.

This started about a week ago. I assumed it was a problem with Comcast so I didn't think to try IE till today, when IE worked, I thought it must be Firefox.
