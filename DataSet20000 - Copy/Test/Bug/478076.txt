When I open an item description to edit, Firefox seems to mix up standard and HTML. Pictures that should display as code ( ie http: www.shenanigansvintage.com/ebay/8675a.jpg ). I then change the jpg # ( ie 8675a ) and the new pictures load fine. Now, the pictures appear open and are un editable. In the same vein, I noticed my finished descriptions show my break marks <br>.  Before yelling at Ebay I opened an old version of Netscape I had on board. It worked :-) and I am using it ONLY for listing until I can figure this out. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.In Ebay, choose any item I have for sale and hit "sell similar item "
2.New page opens for editing of item , I cut paste new verbal descritption
3. below verbal I have code for pictures to load off my server ( see above )
4. It allows edit of written description but code is replaced with open pictures
