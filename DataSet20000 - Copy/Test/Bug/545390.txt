3.6 Firefox - Enabled Tools/Options/Content Exceptions buttons don't launch their dialog
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6

After setting the "block pop-up windows" checkbox, and then clicking the enabled "Exceptions..." button in the Options/Content tab does not launch its dialog. It's almost as if the dialog is itself being blocked.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Drill down to the Tools/Options/Content (or the Security) tab.
2. Set a checkbox associated with a button labeled "Exceptions..."
3. Click on that associated button.
Actual Results:  
The button depresses but no resulting dialog is launched.

Expected Results:  
A dialog to open allowing exceptions to be entered.

This happened immediately after I installed FireFox 3.6. I went to my web e-mail application and when attempting to click on an embedded link in the e-mail message, a new Help dialog was launched indicating that the site was being blocked as well as providing the steps needed to add the site as an exception.
I have tried it many times in different scenarios with the same results.
