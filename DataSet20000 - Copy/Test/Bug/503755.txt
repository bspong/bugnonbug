I have a number of Dell Powerconnect switches which use an HTTP GUI for administration.  What I've found is that if Private Browsing is turned off, it's impossible to log in to them - entering the correct username and password just results in an infinite loop of being given the login page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure Private Browsing is turned OFF in Firefox and that the switch is configured to allow HTTP admnstration.
2. Attempt to log in to the switch using known-good credentials.  Note that you're stuck in an infinite loop of being returned to the login page.
3. Turn Private Browsing on.
4. Try logging in to the switch again.  Note that this time it actually worked.
Actual Results:  
Infinite loop of being stuck at the switch's login page.

Expected Results:  
Should have been able to log directly into the switch's administrative GUI.

This bug may also affect the Powerconnect 2716 and 2724 switches as they're the same family, although I don't have any available to test with at the moment.

Checked for this behaviour under Firefox 3.5 on XP Pro (x86): does not appear to happen.
