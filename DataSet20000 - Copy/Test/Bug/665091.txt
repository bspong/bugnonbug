Using Firefox to view webmail (Gmail in this case).  If the email contains a MS Word document created on a Mac (cut and pasted into the email) the email is truncated (different places on different docs).  Problem is new to this release.  

 Also tested with:
-Firefox version 2.0.0.1
-IE9 version 9.0.8112.16421
-Safari version 5.0.5
-Google Chrome version unknown

The four listed above all rendered the email properly. If the MS Word document is created on a Windows machine, then cut and pasted into an email, instead of using a Mac, the email will display properly using Firefox version 4.0.1

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a MS Word document on Mac using different fonts and character sizes. Fill at least one full 8.5 x 11 page.
2.Using Gmail's webmail, cut and paste the entire document into an email.
3.Send email to another Gmail account.
4.Using Firefox 4.0.1 view the email received at the destination.
5.In order to view the entire email be sure to click on the "View entire message" as a page of text will be clipped.


Actual Results:  
clicked on "View entire message" and more text was displyed, but the document was incomplete.

Expected Results:  
Should have seen entire document

Render the entire document (email with cut and pasted MS Word document included.
