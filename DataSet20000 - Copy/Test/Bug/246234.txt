All of Firefox becomes incredibly slow when one tab or window is loading a large webpage
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

When loading a large webpage, for example one with several hundred table
entries, all tabs and windows in Firefox become incredibly slow. This includes
an unacceptable lag in entering text into a text box. While I'm loading a
webpage like http://www.fencingofficials.org/Ratings/Referee%20Rating%20List.htm
in one tab, I cannot effectively enter text or do anything for that matter in
another tab or window with any degree of speed.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any website with a text box (ex. www.google.com) and let it fully load
2. Open http://www.fencingofficials.org/Ratings/Referee%20Rating%20List.htm in
another tab
3. Switch to the tab with Google and attempt to enter text

Actual Results:  
A little under a second lag for entering each character. Plus, overall slowness
in switching between tabs and windows.

Expected Results:  
While a webpage is loading in one tab or window, the other tabs and windows
should not be affected.
