newest version of firefox crashes very frequently or does not start up
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla 2.0.0.1

I downloaded 2.0.0.1 recently and ever since then Firefox has been unstable and crashes at least every hour.  This problem doesn't involve a particular website, nor a particular button or function (example: sometimes it crashes if left idle, sometimes it crashes if I use the bookmarks, etc.)  When I say it crashes I mean that the windows message comes up saying "Firefox encountered an error and had to close... report this error?" It seemed like there was some data corruption when I installed it, so I re-installed the latest version, but to no avail.  In addition to the crashes (and maybe this is related), sometimes when I try to open firefox nothing happens even after waiting 15 or 20 minutes, and then when I look into my computers proccess (ctrl+alt+del-Processes), I see that firefox.exe is running, although no window has opened. Rebooting the computer will then allow firefox to start. I wish I could be more specific, but that's all I've been able to gather after watching it for a few weeks.

default theme, no problems with firefox 1.5   I use lots of tabs when I browse, so maybe that's related?
