I click on a link and am taken to a dead end; OK with Safari and OK with Firefox for the PC

I click on a link and am taken to a dead end.  Then go back to an earlier page, enter the code (like a password)and I'm taken again to a page that asks me to certify that I've read the rules, then click to go to next page and I'm back at the dead end.  Their system is supposed to recognize that I've certified that I read the rules and not make me do it again.  Safari for MAC works OK; IE for MAC works OK, Mozilla for MAC works OK, Firefox for PC is OK.  So it's a problem only with Firefox for the MAC.  I've had this problem before.  If someone will work on this I'll give them the 'password', which I can do legitimately.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to the web site, click on page that takes me to where I enter the password, get take to page where I certify that I agree with the rules.  click on Accept 
2.  Am taken to a dead end page.
3.

Actual Results:  
End up at the 'deadend' page every time.

Expected Results:  
Should have taken me to the correct page, without going through the page to Accept their rules.

Doesn't crash, just goes to the wrong page.  I also had this problem with ExpertFlyer.com but that had a 'secret' password so I didn't report the bug.  This one has a password that I'm willing to give to the person who works on it.  The only workaround is to go to another browser.
