Sound fails in Flash9 while playing embedded videos after a KDE taskbar notification while using --artsd flag
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

Using Gentoo Linux, binary ebuild of firefox 2.0 (prebuilt, no monkey business)
Flash version is 9.0 d55

After starting firefox with the --artsd flag, video playback at www.crunchyroll.com works normally, with sound working as it should. However, upon a taskbar notification in KDE or a message reciept notification from Kopete (Basically, anything that steals focus and isn't a full-blown window), even those that do not produce sound, sound in any flash application fails to play and all embedded videos (tested on YouTube, Google Video and the aforementioned Crunchyroll) pause after about five seconds of playback. Dragging the slider resumes playback, but only for five seconds at a time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start firefox with the --artsd switch
2.Run Kopete or some other application that notifies with pop-up notifications
3.Go to www.crunchyroll.com and begin playing something
4.Have an assistant send you a message to an account you are logged into with Kopete, or otherwise trigger a notification



Expected Results:  
Sound playback should continue uninterrupted, and playback should not pause.

I am unsure as to whether this is a problem with the interface between the Flash9 plugin and firefox or a problem with the plugin itself. I have not attempted to duplicate this without the --artsd switch, as I don't really want to spend an inordinate amount of time rearranging my sound configuration. I look forward to any insight you may have.
