After selecting this site for radar images for Australian States, it has not display the usual map of Australia or the various radar locations which represent the states and which also serve as links to radar images. Those links still work because when you run the curser over the map they are highlighted by a popup indicator showing the specific city/radar location and still allow you to click on the link. 
This bug may be linked to the compose, reply problem with the Australian version of Yahoo Mail, where the text box for composing the message does not appear. I have experienced both these bugs at the same time. Neither of these problems are experiened when using Internet Explorer and have only occurred with the last 2 Firefox downloads.
