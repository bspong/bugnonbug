Myspace returns a blank page and "done" status when advancing through pages or logging in.

This began about two weeks ago. At first, I noticed that when I am logged into Myspace and wish to browse my high school's alumni or another list of users spanning several pages, clicking "next" leads to a blank page. The browser reports "done [loading]" at the bottom. This problem is constant and Firefox updates have not addressed it. Recently, in addition to multiple page reports not loading correctly, when I attempt to log in, I also receive a blank page. Revisiting Myspace.com reports that I successfully signed on, but I cannot actually do anything, as when I click on "home," I get (surprise) a blank page.

Every now and then, I'm able to work around this by re-entering Myspace.com and clicking "home," but not always (or even usually). 

I can open Myspace just fine in IE6, but I don't use IE6 for a reason, and I'd love to keep it that way. Thanks...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter URL "Myspace.com"
2. Enter user login info, click submit.
3. Receive blank page.

(AND/OR)

1. When logged into Myspace, click "search."
2. Enter search criteria returning multiple pages of results and click "search."
3. Click next to view next batch of results. Blank page is returned.
Actual Results:  
"Blank page" is the common theme. 

Expected Results:  
Firefox has always been fine with opening pages in Myspace. I've not had these "blank page" issues until recently. 

In general, I noticed this bug after installing one of the newer updates to Firefox 2.0. Not sure which one, but the problem was slow to reach its current state. At first, it was an "every now and then" issue. Now, it is predictable in nature.
