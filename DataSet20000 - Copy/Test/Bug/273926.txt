Can't change location in fullscreen mode when location bar is moved to different toolbar

I have my location bar moved to the Menubar (File | Edit | etc..)
In fullscreen mode, the menubar gets hidden, as it should.
Since the location bar is hidden, I would expect Ctrl+L to open the Open
Location dialog.  It doesn't.  I assume that is highlights the contents of the
location bar, which is not hidden in full screen mode. 

Off-topic - I'd love to have the toolbars auto-hide in fullscreen mode...  other
posts have been made about this.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click View > Toolbars > Customize...
2.Drag the Location bar from the Navigation Toolbar to the Menubar
3.Click "Done" in the Customize Window - return to browsing.
4.Press F11 or Click View > Full Screen
5.Press Ctrl+L

Actual Results:  
Nothing visible happens 
(Assumedly, the contents of the location bar are selected, though the menubar
and location bar are hidden)

Expected Results:  
Since the location bar is not visible, the Open Location dialog should appear

I don't have any kiosk-related extensions.  I tried "Almost Full Screen", but I
uninstalled it.
