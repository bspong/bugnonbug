The customized toolbar settings don't work anymore after browser restart

When I do a right click on the toolbar I can customize the look of the toolbar. I prefer the view where only symbols are shown. When I restart the browser I always get the symbol and text view. When I open the customize dialog the Symbols only item is selected. So I have to reselect it to get it working again. I have to repeat this after every browser restart.

To be more specific. This setting still works for Firefox symbols such as Forward, Backward, Refresh and so on. It does not work for any third party plugins, such as webdeveloper toolbar, Zend studio toolbar or adblock toolbar. So I don' know if it is a Firefox bug or a plugin bug. If you have any plugins where you think it should work, please let me know. I'll try them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right click on toolbars
2. Open customize dialog
3. Select Symbols only view
4. Restart the browser
Actual Results:  
The selected symbol view is not working anymore (switching back to symbols and text)

Expected Results:  
Still having the symbol view in place.
