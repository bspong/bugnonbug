When the Toolbar is changed (Added or removed) on specific websites, the main browser window does not redraw height.

I prefer a single bar on firefox, and when going about setting it that way i noticed this bug.
i dont know what page i was viewing when it happened, but i hav reproduced it on www.ogame.org so I am not entirely sure if its truely a firefox bug or perhapse the way it handles some sort of data on the page. However i do know that it can be reproduced.
my reproduction took place this way: When i added a bar, it pushed the entire screen below what it normally should have been. I tried something else afterwords. I closed firefox with those 2 toolbars enabled, then opened them, viewed that page, and removed both toolbars. The bottom of the page scooted upwards, leaving a big empty grey area. 
The page i linked, i showed an example with screenshots.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to a page that has the specific (unkwown) such as www.ogame.org
2. add a toolbar or two. 
3. close the browser. 
4. reopen.
5. go to that same page.
6. remove the toolbars.
Actual Results:  
on step 2 you will see the bottom of the page scoot out of sight.
on step 6 you will see the bottom of the page scoot upwards, leaving a big blank area.

Expected Results:  
Redrawn the bottom of the page to conform to the actual size of the window.

only extra information is that i KNOW it can be reproduced at www.ogame.org though i am sure there are many sites out there that can do the same.
