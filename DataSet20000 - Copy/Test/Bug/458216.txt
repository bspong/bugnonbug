If you use Windows Explorer in Windows Vista x86 to retrieve a file off an FTP server that requires a login and password (entered into the Explorer address bar as ftp://name:pass@IP.Address.Goes.Here), and accidentally drag the file from the Explorer window over the Firefox window (don't ask me how I managed this, but I did), the cursor changes to an arrow with a dotted box by its base.  Then the file disappears; no download prompt appears and I cannot locate the file on my hard drive.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open an FTP connection in Windows Explorer
2. Open Firefox
3. Drag a file off the FTP server and over Firefox's window
4. The file will disappear both from the FTP server and the machine you are doing the drag-drop operation on
Actual Results:  
The file disappears from both machines.  Full-disk searches including system, hidden and non-indexed files (the first file I lost had a very unique extension, ".3DM") failed to find the file anywhere.

Expected Results:  
Download prompt from Firefox (to download the file you dragged off the FTP server onto its window).
