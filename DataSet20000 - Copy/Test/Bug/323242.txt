I sent this message to yahoo mail customer service:

Any particular reason attaching a 52kb
document to an email requires 5 attempts
and 15 minutes of time ???

This happened a week ago and again last
night !!

They responded: Firstly, In order to have the best experience in Yahoo! Mail, you will 
need a JavaScript enabled browser. Depending on the operating system 
(OS) and browser version you're currently using, you may be able to 
upgrade to a newer browser version with JavaScript. Yahoo! Mail is not 
compatible with MSNTV (WebTV).

The two most popular JavaScript Enabled web browsers are Netscape and 
Internet Explorer. Both are available as free downloads on the Web.

Don't plan on going back to IE, hope you can fix this in your next build !!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.compose an email on yahoo mail.
2.attempt to add small doc (microsoft word from xp office pro)
3.open browse window to select file from my computer & click add attachment.
working window seems to hang, as in its working but nothing happens, even after several minutes. hit refresh, get repost data message, same cycle starts all over again. fifth try seems to be the charm ??

Actual Results:  
above

Expected Results:  
attach doc in less then 20 seconds !
