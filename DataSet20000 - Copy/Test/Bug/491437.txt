When opening a Yahoo Plus email with an attachment, the attachment does not show, unless you close email and open it again.

When opening a Yahoo Plus email with an attachment, FireFox does not display the email correctly, and the area directly under the address headers of the email that shows the attachment, and allows you to click on it in order to download, does not appear. If one closes that email, and then immediately opens it again, the attachment is visible, and can be downloaded. This is 100% repeatable. It does not happen when accessing my Yahoo Plus email with IE. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a Yahoo Plus email that has an attachment.
2. Unable to "see" the attached file, therefore, unable to click on it and download it. 
3. Close the email, reopen it, and then you can "see" the attachment, click on it, and open it.
Actual Results:  
One first opening Yahoo Plus email with attachment, the attachment file is not visable.

Expected Results:  
Attachement should be visable first time email is opened, not just after second time it is opened.

The lack of visability happens on the first opening of the email about 35% to 50% of the time. 100% of the time the attachment is visable after the second opening of the email.
