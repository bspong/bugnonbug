Page is not redisplayed when typing [End] key (no repaint after scrolling suddenly)

When I type the [End] key with the URL above, the page is not always redisplayed, and sometimes redisplayed after a few seconds.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the above URL.
2. Make sure the page has the focus (e.g. click on it).
3. Type [End].
Actual Results:  
The scroll bar moves to the bottom as expected (showing that the event has been taken into account), but the displayed page does not change: I still have the top of the document.

Expected Results:  
The bottom of the document should be displayed.

This bug doesn't always occur: the bottom of the document is sometimes displayed immediately. It is sometimes displayed after a few seconds. When I scroll upwards, the new lines are correctly displayed (but the old ones are just shifted downwards -- not surprising).
I couldn't reproduce this bug on any other HTML document. Quitting and restarting Firefox didn't make the bug disappear.
