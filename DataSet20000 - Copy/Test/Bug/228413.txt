changing png file association causes firebird to prompt for default browser
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6b) Gecko/20031208 Firebird/0.7+

If I change the PNG file type association to use XP's image viewer via Tools ->
Folder Options -> File Types -> (select png) -> Advanced -> (select open) -> Edit,
when I next startup Firebird, it asks if I want to make it my default browser
when it already is my default browser.

The quick workaround is to have it stop checking at every startup by checking
the checkbox in the prompt, but I think the bug here is that Firebird should not
consider PNG, JPG, GIF, and other image file associations in determining whether
it is the current default browser. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have PNG files associated with XP's image viewer (shimgvw)
2. Install Firebird, choosing for it to be default browser
3. Close Firebird.
4. Change PNG file association back to XP image viewer
5. Start Firebird.


Actual Results:  
Firebird asks if you want it to be default browser even though it already is
associated with htm/html files and http/https urls (only PNG association was
changed)

Expected Results:  
Firebird should have loaded without prompting about being the default browser.
