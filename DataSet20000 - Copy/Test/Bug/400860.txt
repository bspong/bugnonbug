After installing Firefox 2.0.0.8 on Vista, with NO PREVIOUS VERSION of Firefox installed, Firefox would not launch.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506; InfoPath.2)
Build Identifier: http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/products/download.html?product=firefox-2.0.0.8&os=win&lang=en-US

I got a new computer with Vista Business.  Seeing that Firefox was not installed, I downloaded and installed the latest version of Firefox, 2.0.0.8.  Firefox would not launch after it was finished.  I uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times.  I tried letting it through the windows firewall, compatibility mode, and run as administrator; still no go.

I then installed an older version I Firefox, 2.0.0.3, and it worked fine.  I updated it to the latest, and it worked fine.  It seems that it only wouldn't launch when there was no previous version installed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.On Vista Business uninstall Firefox.
2.Download and Install version 2.0.0.8 from http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/
3.Try to open Firefox.
Actual Results:  
I have only tried this on one Vista Business machine, a Fujitsu E8410 (Lifebook Series (Build:  7ERIVW0)and Firefox 2.0.0.8 failed to open everytime after installation when there was no previous version of Firefox installed.

I then installed a previous version, 2.0.0.3, and it worked.  I then updated to version 2.0.0.8, and it worked.

Expected Results:  
Firefox worked.  I figured that it would because my Vista desktop computer worked when it updated.

The software should not have required me to have a previous version of Firefox in order to work.  If someone is downloading Firefox for the first time, this will be a very bad first impression.
