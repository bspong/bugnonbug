I'm attempting to create a clickable email page in order to use the browser email function to contact several people.  I've coded three separate emails in the same page but each link opens an email window addressed to the last email address coded... that is, I have three separate contacts; 1, 2, and 3; and have coded a separate link for each.  The problem is that no matter which one I click, the window that opens is addressed to number three.

This does not happen in IE- each link opens a window addressed to the intended recipient

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Code several mailto links on the same page and save
2.Open that page in FF
3.Click any one of the mailto links
Actual Results:  
An email window opens addressed to the final contact no matter which link is clicked.  If I want to have an email page to contact Tom, Dick, Harry, and Bob- and I have Bob listed as the last link in the list, no matter which recipient I click, the window is addressed to Bob.  When I omit that option the target recipient becomes the new last address.

Expected Results:  
When I click Tom, I should get a window addressed to Tom.  Likewise for Dick, Harry, and Bob.

Email clients are notorious targets for viruses and worms.  This is supposed to work around that- to enable me disable Outlook Express.
