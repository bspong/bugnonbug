Local bookmarks imported from IE disappear from personal toolbar
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

I installed Firefox 2.0 fresh (not really fresh, but after uninstalling previous versions and removing the profile), and chose to import bookmarks from IE.

This worked generally OK, but local bookmarks, i.e. those pointing to a file on the local disk, were not imported to the personal toolbar.

Example:

I have a bookmark called "J2SE 5.0 Javadoc" pointing to "D:\Java\SDK\j2sdk1.5.0\docs\api\index.html". This one is not copied to Firefox.

I think this is due to IE, which stores a bookmark in plain windows style ("D:\...") when dragged to the "personal toolbar", as opposed to the URL style ("file:///D:/..."), which is used when a bookmark is stored using the menu.

Still, Firefox should handle such links gracefully (possibly converting them), instead of tacitly dropping them. 

This is with a German Windows XP, IE 6.0 and the German variant of Firefox 2.0.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have IE 6.0 installed with local bookmarks created by dragging to the personal toolbar
2. Install Firefox 2.0
3. Choose to import bookmarks from IE

Actual Results:  
Local bookmarks are missing

Expected Results:  
Local bookmarks should be imported, possibly converted to canonical style

Even though the bug is originally on the side of IE, it spoils the experience of a migration to Firefox and thus should be fixed here.
