Address bar is not updated immediately when switching tabs

There is a delay in updating the URL listed in the address bar when switching tabs.  (only noticeable when Firefox is under strain, such as when multiple rows of tabs are open)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a hundred tabs or so. (enough to slow down Firefox a bit)
2. Select a tab, then ctrl+tab to the next one.
3. Observe the address bar. The URL is not updated for the new current tab until after a delay.
4. If you click the go button during this delay it will go to the currently shown URL.  In other words, this isn't just superficial.
Actual Results:  
There is a delay after switching tabs before updating the address bar.

Expected Results:  
The address bar should be updated with the current tab's URL before loading its page.

This sounds minor, but it can cause other issues. My primary example, is when I open a large number of tabs quickly and have to occasionally click the go button for a few tabs to force it to load a few images it may have timed out loading, due to excessive load. When loading up quite a few tabs at once, on a laptop that likes to overheat and slow down, the address bar updating delay can be rather long. More than once I have accidentally gone to the previously open tab's URL because of this bug.
