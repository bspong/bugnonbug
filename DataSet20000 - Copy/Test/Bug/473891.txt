Typed URLs do not load in location bar until user switches to a new tab
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5

When I type a URL in the address bar and press enter, the icon swirls as if it is loading the page, but nothing actually happens.  Then when I create a new tab or switch to a different tab, Firefox suddenly tries loading the page.

This bug sounds related to Bug 452218, as the symptoms and solutions are similar, but recreating the problem is different, and to Bug 440538.

I have reproduced the problem in Safe Mode and Normal Mode, with and without administrator rights using DropMyRights in Firefox 3.0.5.  I removed Firefox from my firewall list and have confirmed that Firefox does not try to access the internet until I switch tabs (so nothing is really happening, not that my internet connection is slow).

The typed URL does not seem to matter.  That is to say, the problem occurs when typing "http://www.mozilla.com" or just "www.mozilla.com."

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox 3.0.5 (no special setup)
2. Type a URL in the address bar and press enter.
3. Page will not load, but icon on left will swirl.
4. Open a new tab (either Ctrl-T, using a bookmark, etc.) (switching to a different tab also causes the page to load).
5. The page with the typed URL will now load.



The problem reproduces in Safe Mode with the default theme, so it seems to be a Firefox 3 issue, not a faulty extension.
