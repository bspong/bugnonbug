proto handler dialog needs a11y love

Screen Shot of Mac UI

The Application selector is still missing icons for each application, and when it first runs it comes up too small such that the OK and Cancel buttons are trimmed off.

The dialog is resizable, yes, but it should first appear to be the proper size.

Also (judging from the DOM Inspector), it appears that we are missing an Access Key for the "Remember this selection" checkbox.

Should this be three bugs, or can both these things be tracked here?

== Steps to Reproduce ==
1. Open Minefield.
2. Click on this link: webcal://info.vassar.edu/calendar/calendars/campuscalendar.ics
3. Note the state of the application selector dialog.

== Expected Behaviors ==
* There are icons for the Applications (at least default icons at this point)
* The dialog is the proper size
* Proper Access keys are included for all parts of the dialog (looks like they are used everywhere else, except the "Remember this" checkbox).

== Actual ==
* Neither of these ar true.

If we are going to publicize our handler-test.mozilla.org website, and invite more people to experience this dialog, then I think we should really try to fix these issues for M9.
