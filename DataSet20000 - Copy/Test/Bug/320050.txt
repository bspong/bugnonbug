Whenever a ticket is purchased from etix.com you must print the ticket off. When you print the ticket, it prints half of the ticket on the first page and the second half on the second page even though there is plenty of space to print it on the first page. I used safari and it printed it as normal. I also printed it off fine using internet explorer on a windows machine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to www.etix.com
2.purchase a ticket to a concert
3.print the ticket you just purchased.

Actual Results:  
It prints only the part that says etix at the top of the page on the left side, and the whole right side prints fine on the first page. The second page prints the rest of the ticket on the left side, and it has a blank space on the right side. It then prints the etix bottom part that says "Print at home ticket." If you hold the the first page up over the second page, they fit perfectly together.

Expected Results:  
It should have printed the whole ticket on the first page along with the etix logo that is on the top left and the pictures of a printer on the right hand side. I tried it with safari and it printed as it should and also with internet explorer on a windows machine and it printed fine. It might print the last part of the ticket that says "Print at home ticket" on the second page, but you can have it not print the second page since that is not necessary. With Firefox 1.5 if you have it not print the second page, it won't print the part of the ticket with the barcode, which you need.
