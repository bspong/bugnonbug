Attempt to prevent massive data loss with new Clear Recent History interface
The new Clear Recent History window was designed to be a counter part of private browsing, but in reverse, where the user selects a small amount of time (like an hour or 2) that they want to clear.

However, this dialog box is very similar in name, menu position, and appeared functionality to the previous "Clear Private Data" that some users leveraged to regularly destroy everything that the browser had ever collected.

The user's of the previous interface will likely want to be able to continue to regularly clear everything that the browser has collected manually, however this creates a significant potential problem for new users:

1) user gets a used computer and clears all of the data in Firefox
2) user uses Firefox for three months
3) user attempts to clear the last few hours of browsing, but accidentally deletes three months worth of data because the pref stuck to "everything" from step 1.

One way to try to make both sets of users happy would be to detect that more than a week or two (or some other larger threshold) of history is about to be destroyed, we add an additional confirmation.  This allows users of the previous dialog to have a somewhat similar interface (since they use the interface faster than the threshold we set), and helps to reduce the number of users who accidentally nuke their browser when they were actually just trying to clear a few hours.

Another option would be to expire the pref sticking after a certain amount of time.  This is more unconventional, but would avoid us having to show a modal confirmation dialog.  The downside is that users may occasionally feel that the interface is non-deterministic.
