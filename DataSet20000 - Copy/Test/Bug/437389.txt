Location field takes input but doesn't activate

This bug appears to happen randomly (noticed it a few times), but it seems happen after firefox has been running for an extended period/had a lot of tabs.

Somehow, the location field suddenly stops working. You can type text in it, but nothing happens when you press enter. It doesn't matter if you use the location field in an "old" tab or start a new one. However, bookmarks and links still work.

There is, however, a "workaround". If you start a new window (CTRL-N), that location field works as normal. But all tabs in the "old" window have the nonresponsive location field.

Failing that, you could just kill firefox and start it up again.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open new tab (CTRL-T)
2. Go to location field, type in any valid URI
3. Press enter.
Actual Results:  
Nothing.

Expected Results:  
Should have loaded the URI.
