Random behaviour with frames containing links to /.*servlet.*/ URLs

The situation is a bit complex but quite often encoutered. The bug is related to the use of URLs containing the string 'servlet' in the href attribute of links, embedded in pages that are part of a frameset.

The browser just does not open the linked page, instead it acts randomly - resizing the current frame is the default behaviour, but I have seen complete browser freeze too.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the example URL ( http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/api/ )
2. Click on the link reading "javax.servlet" in the top-left frame
Actual Results:  
The bottom frame is resized and the page is not loaded

Expected Results:  
The page listing the classes in package "javax.servlet" should be loaded in the bottom-left frame.

Surprisingly, the bug only happens when browsing a site deployed on a servlet container, such as Apache Tomcat or Sun ONE Enterprise Server; opening the pages locally from the filesystem works transparently.

The problem is that once encountered, the bug hampers the browser's behaviour until it is restarted.
