Everytime when I start Firefox the Search Bar(see URL) maximize.
So that I can't see much Bookmarks in this bar. Only about 1 or 2.
Only when I go to the settings, therefor right clicking on the toolbar, and chose costumize. After closing it without changing anything the Search Bar minimize so that a maximum of bookmarks are show up.
This problem appears at any window size and fullscreen.
I already tried:
Search the problem on google.
Search at the settings.
Trying to reinstall firefox.

2.Look at the Bookmarks-toolbar while the search bar is included in it.

It should only make the search bar so big as its usefull and not so huge that its pushing out the bookmarks.
