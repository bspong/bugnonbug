Poor file associations for XHTML

Firefox is excellent for XHTML. We all know this.

When looking at a problem in IE 6.0 were a file saved as *.xhtml or *.xht loads
fine when served from a network(MIME type set to text/html) but not
locally(stored on my C:\ drive for example). I investigated to see where MIME
types are configured in WinXP(to see if I can get them loading locally in IE,
more experimental then anything else).

After a bit of looking around and much confusion I think I worked out how it
works. And since you guys support XHTML properly at mozilla and actually listen
to the community when they speak try to help, I thought Id post a possible
bug/feature.

Loading "regedit" the folder HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT contains from what I can see
three types of information

1. File type associations(MIME and Application + lots of other stuff!). These
are stored in folders beginnning with a full stop "."
2. Application that can be used is file type associations(as above in 1.). These
are stored in named folders.
3. MIME information. See HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME.

From what I can see Firefox dosnt put much in the registry. It puts its some
application keys in
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\FirefoxHTML
and adds the following new file type associations
.xhtml
.xht

This should be tweaked I feel. Im no expert though so its up to you guys to
decide what you want to do if you do anything(I hope you do as this could be a
point for concern as more apps begin to handle XHTML) or even can do anything.

Heres some suggestions below. But Im sure there is other small things that I
missed that also might need setting to ensure FF works happily along side other
apps that support application/xhtml+xml and avoid problems that might arise in
unexpected cases.

1. Have FF setup a MIME type for XHTML in the registry.
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\application/xhtml+xml
2. Perhaps add a "PerceivedType" key set to "text" for HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.xhtml
and HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.xht like there is for .html so we can right click edit
XHTML files in our favorite text editors.
3. "Content Type" set to "application/xhtml+xml" key in both
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.xhtml and HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.xht
