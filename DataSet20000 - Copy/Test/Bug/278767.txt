Focussing away from then back on to Firefox causes a crash

When browsing just about any URL for an extended period - even this very page -
if I focus on other tasks (such as email) for a while, then re-focus onto
FireFox, the page locks up as if it's trying to re-draw, then generates a crash.
 Unfortunately our company firewall settings are such that the Mozilla Quality
Feedback agent can't talk through the firewall.

It puts up an application error that I haven't managed (or remembered) to catch yet.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a page - any page will do.
2.Perform other tasks on the PC for a while.
3.Bring FireFox into focus - click on the titlebar, alt-tab to it, click on part
of the page, whatever.

Actual Results:  
Empty Windows frame displayed, then a crash notification.

Expected Results:  
Displayed the page.

Running the default themee.

I've loaded a few extensions as well.  Quite a few, in fact.

I've also re-installed FireFox, but I haven't had time to see whether it crashes.
