Remote debugger panel onReady: TypeError: this.debuggee is undefined
While following examples, such as [1], I end up with an error in an addon which extends the devtools.
The problem is the following [2]:

JPM [error]   Message: TypeError: this.debuggee is undefined
  Stack:
    JitPanel<.onReady@resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource://jit-dev-tools/lib/jit-panel.js:75:5
emitOnObject@resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource://gre/modules/commonjs/sdk/event/core.js:112:9
emit@resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource://gre/modules/commonjs/sdk/event/core.js:89:38
onStateChange@resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource://gre/modules/commonjs/dev/panel.js:70:3


The code of the Panel is available on github [3].  The problem can be reproduce with the addons [4], by opening the dev-tools in a new window, and then switching to the Jit panel while the devtools are in the new window.

By default, I would think that I am not using the API correctly, but in the example provided in [1], I do not see much differences compared to the code which is in the repository.  Do we have any guarantee that onReady is called after the setup function?
