I've got these animations working in Safari/Chrome, and have correct vendor prefixes for all the css. I'm using Jquery add / remove class events to trigger the animations, and I can see in firebug that the classes are changing when I expect them to, but the animations only fire once and then just default to making the panel disappear /reappear without animation.

I apologize if it's bad etiquette to post a stackoverflow post on here -- I'm pretty stumped on this one and suspect it may be a firefox issue with the Jquery add and remove methods.  


Actual results:

the issue is the animation fires the first time, but never again, and just defaults to making the panel disappear and reappear.

Expected results:

the animation should fire every time I call the togglePanel function, as it does in Safari / Chrome
