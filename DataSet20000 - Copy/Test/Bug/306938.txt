Making a searchplugin *.src unreadable and doing a search crashes Firefox
Making a searchplugin *.src unreadable and doing a search crashes Firefox

If you edit for example your google.src file and happen to change the
permissions so that some user on your system can not read the file, this makes
Firefox crash for that user when they try to use the search engine from the
toolbar search box.

Nowadays even Microsoft people tell you to run as non-admin on your windows box.
And there are plenty of web pages out there that tell you how to edit your
google.src file. Given these two you can easily run into the same issue I did:

I have installed Firefox as admin, but run as normal user. I decided to edit my
google.src file, and used Emacs to edit it (as admin). Now whenever I tried to
use the search, I'd get browser crash. That happened even when running as admin,
which seemed weird. But then I noticed that something had changed in the file
permissions:

-rwx------+ 1 Administrator None 1076 Jul 16 05:41 google.gif
-rwx------  1 Administrator None  720 Sep  3 00:19 google.src

Notice there is no '+' on google.src. I don't have Windows professional to check
what the actual '+' means here, and I am not sure what other tool to use and
don't especially fancy writing a program to try and figure that out using
Windows APIs.

As a workaround I changed the permissions to:

-rwxr-----  1 Administrator None  720 Sep  3 00:19 google.src
