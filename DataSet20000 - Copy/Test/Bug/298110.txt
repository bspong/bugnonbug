Every time i open firefox, i am unable to see the sliders on either side of the
main window either horizontally or vertically.  They appear as gray borders
only.  I cannot at any time tell where the slider is currently located in order
to move the webpage up, down, left or right.  Also, I do not have arrows at the
bottom or top of the slider or either side.

I'm sorry if this is a duplicate, but I spent half my morning looking at all the
help resources.  I did find a similiar problem, but you didn't list how to fix
it...just that is was fixed.  It's hard to manuver your help resources if you
are not technically inclined.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open Firefox in Mac OS X
2.  (This did not reproduce on my friends G4, however).
3.

Actual Results:  
Did not see scrolling sliders either horizontally or vertically.  Did remove
program and re-install.  Still not seeing the sliders or the arrows on my G3.

Expected Results:  
I should be able to see the scrolling sliders horizontally and vertically and
the arrows.

I am running Tiger on a Mac G3 ibook.  This happened also when I was running
Panther.
