When I veiw the cookies (Tools > Options > Privacy > Cookies > View Cookies),
and I select a cookie it displays information (such as name, content, domain,
etc.). However, a policy doesn't show up on any of the cookies. It just says
"Policy:" I can see the policy elsewhere, but if I look at the same cookie here
it doesn't say anything! 

This seems to have used to work with an older version, now I'm using the latest
nightly build. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Tools > Options > Privacy > Cookies and select "Enable Cookies" and
also select "From the originating web site only"
2.Go to a bunch of websites that you know put cookies that have a policy into
your computer. 
3.Now click on Tools > Options > Privacy > Cookies > 
4.Select a cookie. Look at the information about it, and look at the place where
it says "Policy:" 

Actual Results:  
Nothing appeared next to where it said "Policy:", even on cookies that do have a
policy. 

Expected Results:  
On cookies that have a policy it should display "Policy: [Policy of cookie here]"
