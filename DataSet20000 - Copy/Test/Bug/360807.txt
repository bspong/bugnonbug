Sudden onset of SOFT GIF image rendering under Firefox v1.5.0.8 AND Firefox v2.0; Images render very unsharp.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

Using Firefox (either version cited in summary) produces the SAME image rendering issue. Switching to the IE rendering engine in the same Firefox release(s) reveal HIGHLY SHARP GIF image renderings off the same URL's cited (and many many others, as well.)

This issue has a VERY recent onset, leading me to believe (at first) that I had inadvertantly changed a default rendering parameter, but re-installing the browser from scratch has produced no change whatever in the result.

I have also acquired a different video driver and installed it to ascertain whether or not it was the contributing culprit, to no avail. Neither old driver nor NEW driver produce any differences in the rendering of GIF images in Firefox versions 1.5.0.8 and 2.0



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.pick any url with gif images present on the page
2.log on using Firefox v1.5.0.9 or Firefox v2.0
3.Compare the rendering of gif images under Firefox to gif image rendering of the same content using the embedded IE rendering engine in the Firefox browsers.

Actual Results:  
No special setup or particularly hard to reproduce step by step instructions exist or are necessary. This just happens, and I can't figure out why.

Expected Results:  
I expect sharp GIF rendering (which is what I used to get up until about a week ago), but what I'm getting is really soft and patchy looking image renderings under Firefox. (Which used to be WAAAAY better than Internet Explorer in this (and every other) department.)

Rendered the images sharply.
