Accessibility check for the Downloads panel feature
We'd like to get an accessibility check on the feature, possibly soon-ish since we are plannin to leave it enabled for Firefox 20.

Some changes are currently in inbound and not yet merged to central, so if possible, I'd suggest to use an opt build from inbound, or an opt build from central after the _next_ merge (I expect it to happen soon, basically when Bug 828247 weill be marked fixed).

There are a couple things I must point out though:

1. We are planning to make the panel (opened by the downloads button) a mouse-only target for version 20. Currently it supports some keyboard interaction but it's bogus and we are not sure we can come up with the right handling for this release, so we plan to remove all keyboard interaction (focus and focusring) in bug 819428. (see also https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=819428#c53). Keyboard interaction would be reintroduces in next version, once we have a final decision on the design part. How bad would be that?

2. Our main target for accessibility and screen readers is the Library Downloads view, not the panel. Indeed CTRL+J and Downloads open that view. We'd like to get an overview of that view and know if there's any showstopper we should absolutely fix now.

3. it will always be possible to disable the feature setting browser.download.useToolkitUI that reverts to the old manager.
