HW setup: PC [dual monitor :-)], Solaris [single monitor :-(]. Using one keyboard and mouse by using Synergy. PC is server and Solaris is client.

Firefox is on PC only. PC is running XP SP2 and Solaris is 5.9 with latest patches.

While reading a page or doing something else on the Solaris side the selected window will randomly switch to a different one. This happens regardless of whether or not the keyboard and mouse are on the PC side (virtual) or Solaris side (virtual).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use HW as described above.
2.Open up multiple windows (currently I have 22 open). Please do not laugh. :-) I normally have up to 40+ open. It is just a slow day today.
3. Work as normal, switching will happen. It may not happen immediately, but it will happen.
Actual Results:  
Windows randomly switching from active to inactive (some replacing the current one I am typing in.

Expected Results:  
No automatic random switching. If I am typing on this page, I expect the focus to be this window, not a window 10 back.

While semi amusing when working on Solaris side, it is none the less very distracting from my work. When working on PC side, it is even worse. :-(

The longer it happens, the more aggravating it becomes.
