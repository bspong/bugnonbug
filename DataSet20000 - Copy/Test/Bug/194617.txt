forgets basic authorisation login if you login in two different directories on the same server
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.3b) Gecko/20030223 Phoenix/0.5

I dont have this problem with the Phoenix 0.5 milestone, but it has been present
in every nightly binary i've tried so far. Note that i only have this problem
when the two directories are on the same server, i have no problem being logged
in on two different servers at the same time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I have an apache with two directories protected by different .htaccess files
with different htpasswd files for authorization
2. I login to the first directory in tab number 1
3. I login to the second directory in tab number 2, at this point phoenix
'forgets' i'm logged in to the directory in tab nr 1

Actual Results:  
When refreshing or clicking a link in tab number 1, phoenix seems to forget to
re-send the authorisation headers, and thus prompts me for a password. I should
also note that the first time i entered the password, it presented me the list
of previously remembered passwords, but after logging in to the second directory
and refreshing, i didnt get the list.

Expected Results:  
It should have re-sent the authorization headers with the http request, keeping
me logged in in both directories.
