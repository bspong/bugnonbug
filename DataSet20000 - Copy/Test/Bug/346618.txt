7/29 received task bar notification for upgrade, clicked on it, permanently corrupted Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)
Build Identifier: 

After receiving 'upgrade notification' supposedly from firefox I clicked on it and it ended firefox and numerous attempts install again after uninstalling have failed to produce an operable browser.
  I was using 1.0.7 as previous attempts to download 1.5 failed - but I had no problems with 1.0.7 and was happy with it - until yesterday.
  When I re-download 1.07 the same thing happens every time - when I click on the firefox icon or try to acces from other parts of my computer all that happens is a small box appears in upper left quadrant of screen saying:
<Window  id="main-window"
^
If I click on this window -nothing.
If I try to open another firefox browser while window is present, the window will change by adding to the box:
         <key id="key_open Help>
---------^
If I try to open firefox in safe mode this box appears:
<dialog id="prefDialog"
^
Most of rest of computer seems to be working but every time I try to acess "BELARC ADVISOR" from the desktop same thing happens as with firefox.
A few other icons I clicked on {ie. camera programs} still seem to be working.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install firefox {1.5 or 1.0.7} {will not operate}
2. Uninstall firefox
3. Re-install firefox {I have done about 5 times with each firefox version}

Actual Results:  
NO problem untill I clicked on an upgrade button which appeared yesterday morning Saturday 7/29/06 - the end of firefox browser on my computer.

Expected Results:  
Already explained above.
