Rendering problem - words starting with R get broken in two

I've seen this on three different sites now, all involving links with a word starting in "R" which get rendered with excess white space.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start FF
2. Goto http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.0b5/releasenotes/
3. Look at the LHS links (What's New, System Requirements, ...)
Actual Results:  
At the default zoom level, with FF maximized on Windows XP 1289x1024, this is rendered more like:

    * What's New
    * System R       equirements
    * Downloading
    * Installing
    * Uninstalling
    * Extensions and Themes
    * Known Issues
    * Troubleshooting
    * FAQ
    * Other
      R           esources
      and Links

i.e. The words starting with "R" appear to have extra white space inserted.  Perhaps this is related to hyphenation?

Expected Results:  
Expect to see the following rendered:

    * What's New
    * System Requirements
    * Downloading
    * Installing
    * Uninstalling
    * Extensions and Themes
    * Known Issues
    * Troubleshooting
    * FAQ
    * Other Resources and Links


Zooming in (CNTL+PLUS) or out (CNTL+MINUS) fixes the layout.  Highlighting the text and copying doesn't show any extra characters (e.g. spaces).
