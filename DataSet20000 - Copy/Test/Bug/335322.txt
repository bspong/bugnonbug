Hi: Iam running thsi Firefox ofr few years without any problems ,but for the last month i expiriencing moore and moore  instances of  Hang browesr [Not responding].i didnt install any new software i run XP Pro ,3.6Ghz P4 processor 1Gb memory 128 mb ATI radeon video 160 seagate SATA hdd.is the system specs.10 month old.
Ok then i try to kil the browser by closing X ,no respond, then Task manger ,i see 2 instances  in Aplications but i have 1 open ,then in processes just 1 firefox.exe,and trying to end it  it will not respond, the small windows end proces
so i try to shut down or restrat Pc for mtask manager  ,it tryes to kil the browser but goes in cirlces that smal window ,and not able ot ,so i press main buton on PC [HP Compaq bussines PC],goes to the screen shuting down windows now  and hangs there indefinetl;y until i press ahgian main buton ,then it shut down. Then i restart Pc, and all is fine for few days.
I read similar troubles here just litle diferent then mine. i dont get this troulbe with any apps on my Pc, 
So what could be? i called HP ,they say not suporting  third party software , do a restore of Windows, etc.
I like verry much  this Firefox  and redcomend it to lots of friends and they dont have this problem.
Please let menow what else to do? ,i did removed and reinstaled  Firefox few times, adn let it update itself  shen pops up new update version.
