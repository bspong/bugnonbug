Long bookmark menu shown too short
1. New profile, start firefox
2. Maximize firefox window
3. Make a new folder on the bookmarks toolbar. Add as many bookmarks to it as is required to make it overflow.
4. Click on the bookmark folder. Notice it reaches the bottom of the screen.
5. Resize Firefox so it is half the height of your screen. Move firefox so the bottom of the browser touches the bottom of your screen. (So firefox's menubar is roughly in the vertical middle of your screen)
6. Click on the bookmark folder. Notice it is half-height (either extending upwards or downwards, it doesn't matter).
7. Maximize the browser window
8. Click on the bookmark folder.

Expected:
Bookmark folder reaches the bottom of the screen like it did in step 4

Actual:
Bookmark folder is displayed as the same height as it was in step 6.
