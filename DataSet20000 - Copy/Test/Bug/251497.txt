fails to actually reload/refresh local files after changes to file
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040628 Firefox/0.9.1

If a local file is loaded from the disk, Firefox will not pick up on changes
made to that file.  Clicking the refresh button will not cause firefox to load
the new state of the file.  Closing the window, spawning a new window, and
opening the file again will not cause Firefox to load the new state of the file.
 Quitting Firefox, relaunching Firefox, and reopening the file will not cause
Firefox to load the new state of the file. This makes Firefox unable to be used
for local development.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a local file
2.Make a change to the local file
3.Click the refresh button
4.Close/reopen the file
5.Stop/Relaunch Firefox

Actual Results:  
The state of the file as rendered by Firefox is the state of the file when first
opened by Firefox

Expected Results:  
The state of the file as rendered by Firefox should reflect the actual state of
the file the last time it was refreshed.

Please fix this quickly as it prevents Firefox from being used for local
development.
