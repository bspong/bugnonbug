Firefox crashes upon exit every time since the newest update

Every since the last update of firefox to 3.6.10, when I exit or close firefox, the crash reporter pops up & tells me firefox has crashed. I have submitted the report numerous times. I have followed the directions on how to fix crashes and nothing has helped. Obviously a lot of people are having the same problem after searching on forums. People are even going so far as to uninstall firefox and switch to Chrome. PLEASE fix this problem. Like I stated, it only started happening after the last update of firefox. I've disabled all extensions and plugins and it still crashes. Thanks, Linda

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. simply use firefox to browse
2. after exiting or closing the browser the crash report pops up EVERY TIME
3.
Actual Results:  
I have disabled every extension and every plug in and it still crashes upon exit 

Expected Results:  
the same thing happens, the firefox crash reporter pops up upon exit

firefox should close properly without crashing every time upon exit. I use the firefox default theme, windows XP sp3, fully patched.
