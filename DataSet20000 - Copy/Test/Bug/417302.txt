animated robot favicon

In the spirit of the Firefox 3 firstrun pages, I would like to permanently commemorate the noble deeds of the robot community in their fight for an open web. The proposed format for this is an about:robots page that will change the favicons for all open and future tabs in the current browser session to the blinking robot favicon.

Courtesy of beltzner, the suggested interaction is:
- User types about:robots
- about:config/netError styled page with a large robot graphic and tagline will appear
- all current favicons will change to the animated robot favicon
- there will be a button, and clicking it will undo the favicon changes and close the tab (note: what if this is the only page open?)

Suggested strings for the tagline:
"We have come to visit you with peace and goodwill!" (beltzner; The Day The Earth Stood Still)
"Robots are taking over!" (jslater; random)
"Welcome Humans! I am ready for you" (pkim)
"0.68 seconds sir. For an android, that is nearly an eternity" (pkim)
"I know you and Frank were planning to disconnect me, and I'm afraid that's something I cannot allow to happen" (pkim)

Suggested strings for the button text:
"Gort! Klaatu barada nikto!" (beltzner; The Day The Earth Stood Still; used to stop the robot Gort from destroying the earth)

Other suggestions for the tagline and button are welcome, but we need to decide on this quickly.

jslater will be working on the graphic in the same style as the existing firstrun ones, and any direction/ideas for it are welcome.

In order to make beta4, we will need to move quickly on this important recognition of robotic generosity.
