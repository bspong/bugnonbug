Without warning Firefox has over-written all of my saved Safari (OSX 10.3.9) files
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/312.8 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/312.5
Build Identifier: Firefox 

Firefox has overwritten all of my saved Safari files.  when I have tried to open one of these, the file is either incomplete, i.e. links do not work, links are missing, key info is missing and often the file opened looks "choppy".  It looks like it has been cut up and not put together properly.  I can't use the files now and some of them are very important.  Can I still keep Firefox for a browser and NOT have it over write my Safari files.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click on file icon
2.file opens but is not completely useable
3. over written file is incomplete; information has been omitted

Actual Results:  
see above

Expected Results:  
same as I indicated above; the files seem corrupted by Firefox

Firefox should have saved the files created in Firefox and not overwrite my saved Safari files.  Please tell me what to do to use my Safari files in the form they were saved.  I am not a tech wizard, which I'm sure you can see, but I like Firefox a lot.  I just would like to access my saved files in the form and format they were created in.  If you can help me I would be very appreciative.  Thank You much.
