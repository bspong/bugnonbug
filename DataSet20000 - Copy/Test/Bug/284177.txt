This has been present since the beta versions of Firefox. I can click on any
video link with Safari and it downloads a smil file to the desktop and then
starts RealPlayer and starts the video. The smil file is deleted when I quit Safari.

If I click on the same link with Firefox it gives me the choice to download a
cfm file or select an application. RealPlayer can not play the cfm file either
by double clicking on the downloaded file or if selected to act on the file type
in the Firefox pop up window.

I have removed RealPlayer and reinstalled it, I have reset it and enabled all
file types it is capable of viewing. I have tried deleting all file types
associated with RealPlayer in Firefox and then reinstalling. None of this helps.

Firefox for Windows 2000 works fine as well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on video link on Patriots web page.


Actual Results:  
cfm file downloaded instead of playing video file with RealPlayer. If RealPlayer
selected as application RealPlayer tries to download software assiciated with
cfm and fails.

Expected Results:  
RealPlayer should start and video file should play in it.
