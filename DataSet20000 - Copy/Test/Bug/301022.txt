non-cachable content is cached for some seconds

I have the following php code on the web server:

---------------------------------------
<?php
	// Date in the past
	header("Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT");

	// always modified
	header("Last-Modified: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s") . " GMT");

	// HTTP/1.1
	header("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate");
	header("Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0", false);

	// HTTP/1.0
	header("Pragma: no-cache");

	session_start();
	print( "Counter: ". ( $_SESSION[ "counter" ] ++ ) );
	
	$self = $_SERVER[ "PHP_SELF" ];
	sleep(1);
	print "<hr><a href=\"$self\">reload</a>";
?>
---------------------------------------

Calling this script, it is printing
- the actual value of a counter and 
- a "reload" link. 
Clicking the link should reload the content by an incremented value of the
counter. The header commands say not to cache the content because it is varying. 

I start to increment the value by repeatedly clicking the reload link.
Unfortunatelly it is reloading only one time per about three seconds, in the
cases of the remaining "reload" clicks the content is not refreshed. 

The web server log is saying that the client request is not arriving in these
missing cases. The sleep(1) helps to realize a real loading because it takes a
little time. In the missing cases the (unchanged) content (with the old counter
value) is redisplayed at once. This says too that the browser does not reload it
from the server. 



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the page at the URL above
2. Try to click the "reload" link several times (about one click per second)
3. Experience that some "reload" requests are missing and the counter is not
increasing every time.

Actual Results:  
I experienced that some "reload" requests were missing and the counter was not
increasing in these cases.

Expected Results:  
It should not re-get the content from it's cache but it should re-fetch it from
the server and displaying the new value after each reloading.

1.
If I remember right then it was working in the earlier (1.0.4) version of Firefox.

2.
My browser.cache.check_doc_frequency value is 3.

3.
Under Microsft Internet Explorer 6.0 it works fine.

4.
Under several other browsers it is working fine.

5.
A non-expert user has no idea why is not refreshing the content of his chat site
or whatever else. That's why I think this is an important bug a should be fixed
immediately. 

6. 
I am very angry because of this silly bug. It required a lot of time for me to
find it out where the problem is.
