Scratchpad Inspect should show non-objects in inspector, not comments
(A bit of a lenghty introduction. This is a usability bug, so it requires some context and explanations.)

Context: I've only used Scratchpad a few times, mostly treating it as a JavaScript console with multiline input (which the console in Fx devtools doesn’t have). After using it maybe a dozen times over the course of a few weeks, and not really getting how it works exactly, I finally figured out one thing (among several) that puzzled me and made it harder for me to understand what Scratchpad is and how it works, and to feel confident in using it.

Namely: The “Inspect” feature doesn’t work as advertised (in the intro comment). Half of the time it does exactly the same thing as the “Display” feature.

This is how the Inspect and Display features are advertised:
> 2. Inspect to bring up an Object Inspector on the result (Cmd-I), or,
> 3. Display to insert the result in a comment after the selection. (Cmd-L)

Inspect -> Object Inspector. Display -> comment. Got it.
But it doesn’t work that way.

Here’s how the “Inspect” feature actually works:

- Code that returns an object -> Inspector
- Code that returns an array -> Inspector
- Code that returns a function -> Inspector
- Code that returns a string -> COMMENT (like Display)
- Code that returns undefined or null -> COMMENT (like Display)
- Code that returns a number or NaN -> COMMENT (like Display)
- Code that yields an exception -> COMMENT (like Display)

Half the use cases of “inspecting something” or even more (accounting for a lot of syntax errors and other exceptions, bad selections, etc.) will not do what Scratchpad says “Inspect” is for.

I suspect that a lot of confusion ensues, and that it’s one of the top 5 issues that make adoption of Scratchpad harder.

How to fix this one:
Inspect should always show results in the Object Inspector pane. Even if the results are NOT objects. The point here is that the behavior of “Inspect” should be predictable, and always show the end result in the same location.
