some plugins hang out or very slow firefox when new window open..

1.in options is set "new sites open in new tabs" - smth like that 
2.

eg. im using several plugins, eg. DownloadStatusbar, when i have open 20+ tabs (sometimes even 10+ tabs) i sill sometimes open links in new window (even if i dont want, but site script force to open in new window - but i need to view this site - it's not a spyware or advertising) AND im downloading files by DownloadStatusbar firefox hangs or is very slow when he switch status of downloading files from first windows (with 10+ or 20+ tabs) to window whichwas open by forcing script... 
well the truth is some other plugins do same thing when switching to another active window, i cant tell exaclty which they are but i often have this with DownloadStatusbar...


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.install DownloadStatusbar
2.download some big file/s to view whats going on
3.open new window (ctrl+n) and make it acive (click on it)
4.you will probably see two windows with firefox but only in active you will see downloading files by DownloadStatusbar


Expected Results:  
i think about making an option in firefox that force entered/marked/installed plugins to work only in first or last open window (maybe tab if such plugin require it)
i also think it's hard to tell every plugins developers to put in their plugins options pane, such similar option, so i write this specially to firefox developers...

sorry for my bad english, please write an answear so i can see someone was reading this... thanks ;)
