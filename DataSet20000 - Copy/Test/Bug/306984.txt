string "url(paper.png) scroll;" in page from W3C shows broken-image instead of typed text, works in IE, Netscape 8
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; Media Center PC 3.1)

I updated to Firefox 1.0.6, and was looking up some CSS specs at 
http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/colors.html#propdef-background-attachment, and I 
found where the source is:
------------------
<pre>
body {
  background: white url(paper.png) scroll; /* for all UAs */
  background: white url(ledger.png) fixed; /* for UAs that do fixed 
backgrounds */
}
</pre>
---------------- it displays in Firefox as:--------------------
body {
  [broken-image-symbol]) scroll; /* for all UAs */
  [broken-image-symbol]) fixed; /* for UAs that do fixed backgrounds */
}
-----------------
I tested it under IE 6.x, Netscape 8.0.3.3 and they work correctly.

apparently the statement is being interpreted as a style sheet instead of a 
text string to display, and since there is no local file of that name, it 
displays a broken-image or broken-link instead.  I've noticed it before, but 
never chased it down to see what it was, so it was probably doing it back in 
Firefox 1.0.4

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox.
2. type: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/colors.html#propdef-background-attachment 
into location input area
3. type return. or press GO button

Actual Results:  
I see broken image or broken link images in place of the characters prior to 
the ')' in a 'background: <color> url("someurl") scroll; statement.

Expected Results:  
It should have simply displayed the text:

..... with the keyword 'fixed'. For example:

body {
  background: white url(paper.png) scroll; /* for all UAs */
  background: white url(ledger.png) fixed; /* for UAs that do fixed 
backgrounds */
}

See the section on .....


I have created a PNG image of trimmed screenshots from Firefox, IE, Netscape 
and the "show source" window of that URL.  You can download it from:
http://www.baptistanet.com/ff_tb/img/busted-image.png
It is pretty large so it will probably need to be displayed in Psp or some 
other graphix tool.  The image will remain at that location until you inform 
me that it is no longer needed there.

There needs to be another level for severity between minor and trivial.
It isn't something that is major, it's trivial but there isn't a workaround, 
and should be fixed if you find the problem is in the code and not just 
something that I am seeing locally here.

I only had one other Firefox install that I could compare against, and that is 
a 1.0rc2 on a Win2K platform, and that one works correctly.  I did search for 
an existing entry but didn't find any matches, so that might indicate it is 
just my install that is bad.
