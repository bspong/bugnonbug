OCSP client requires presence of optional AlgorithmIdentifier.parameter field
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060508 Firefox/1.5.0.4

OCSP requests and responses identify the certificate being validated using
hashes of the certificate issuer's name and public key, plus the
certificate's serial number. To ensure interoperability, the identifier
includes an AlgorithmIdentifier structure specifying the hash algorithm used
to hash the issuer name and key.

The AlgorithmIdentifier structure has an OPTIONAL field for algorithm
parameters. This field is not used when identifying standard hash algorithms
such as SHA-1. Unfortunately, an ambiguity in the standard allows for two
different encodings of this "empty" parameter field. In the first encoding,
the field is omitted entirely. In the second encoding, the field is
populated with the ASN.1 type NULL.

The two encodings have identical meaning and the difference in encoding has
been a source of difficulty for many applications. RFC 3370, which defines
algorithms for use in the Cryptographic Message Syntax, states the following
in section 2.1, which describes SHA-1:

   The correct encoding is to omit the parameters field; however,
   implementations MUST also handle a SHA-1 AlgorithmIdentifier
   parameters field which contains a NULL.

   The AlgorithmIdentifier parameters field is OPTIONAL.  If present,
   the parameters field MUST contain a NULL.  Implementations MUST
   accept SHA-1 AlgorithmIdentifiers with absent parameters.
   Implementations MUST accept SHA-1 AlgorithmIdentifiers with NULL
   parameters.  Implementations SHOULD generate SHA-1
   AlgorithmIdentifiers with absent parameters.

While this description is presented in the context of CMS, the
AlgorithmIdentifier structure is used throughout various PKIX RFCs and
I believe this guidance is sound for all uses of
AlgorithmIdentifier, including OCSP.

The current Mozilla/Firefox OCSP client is incorrectly requiring that
the parameters field be encoded as NULL when it should accept
either encoding. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Unfortunately, reproducing the problem requires hitting a server that does not include the optional parameter.  Many public servers do include the NULL parameter.

When Firefox has OCSP turned on and hits a server that leaves off the parameter, it reports "unknown certificate" and refuses to proceed with the page.  If the parameter is added to the response, everything works fine.
