Possible bug in ranking of url bar results
See http://tech.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=577139&threshold=1&commentsort=3&mode=thread&pid=23701343#23704335

The relevant part is:

  Uh, no it doesn't. How long do I have to wait for this to magically happen?
  Because it's been several weeks now, visiting that particular site several
  times a day (& /. only every few days), and it steadfastly refuses to move
  from the 3rd position on the list.

  Note that, as I mentioned in another reply, this isn't the only case where
  this happens. Currently, typing "sl" for me brings up "qut.edu.au" first,
  "www.visibledust.com" second, then "slashdot.org". At worst, that's WTF
  terrirory - at best, it's like FF3 has decided "OK, I know enough, I'm not
  going to learn and adapt anymore", and just sticks with its chosen ordering
  whether the user wants that or not.

The original post in question here was <http://tech.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=577139&threshold=1&commentsort=3&mode=thread&cid=23699609>:

  Sorry to the lovers of it, but when typing 'as' consistently brings up
  slashdot.org and youtube.com as the first 2 choices before a URL actually
  starting with those 2 letters (like ask.metafilter.com - and yes, before you
  ask, all 3 are in my history and bookmarks)

Further info from <http://tech.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=577139&threshold=1&commentsort=3&mode=thread&pid=23704753#23707061>:

  Type "as", get:

   1. slashdot.org - bookmarked
   2. youtube.com (page title "YouTube - Broadcast Yourself") - not bookmarked
   3. ask.metafilter.com - bookmarked


  Another example - type "sl", get:

   1. qut.edu.au (page title "QUT | Queensland University of Technology,
      Brisbane Australia") - not bookmarked
   2. www.visibledust.com (page title "VisibleDust - DSLR Camera Sensor
      Cleaning") - not bookmarked
   3. slashdot.org - bookmarked

  Note that this has occurred, with variations, for me on 4 different machines
  (2 x OS X, 1 x WinXP, 1 x Vista), in all FF3 versions since b2, and across
  multiple new profiles.
