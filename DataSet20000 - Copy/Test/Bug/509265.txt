Attempts repeated downloads of an infected file, and triggers nonstop virus warnings

I believe this is a brute force attack site, under the guise of someone trying to peddle security software.  (In part due to bad grammar)

It pops up a warning that the computer is vulnerable to attack, and that I should click OK to scan it.

I close it (X out of the dialog)

It then starts triggering many virus warnings, and opens many download windows for "Install.exe"

It pretends to be a Windows Defender implementation, and shows a view of My Computer, with the correct HardDrive partitions, and states in red under each of them a number with the words "Infected" or "Infected Files" under them.

When the page is closed, all virus warnings stop as well as download attempts.

this seriously bogs down the browser, and more.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to this page: http://windows.sranoscan.info/25/030wLGBzLGBzL==
2.When it pops up the dialog, [X] out of it.
3.Wait for the attempted downloads to start, along with the virus warnings in the Cache folder, under the "AppData" directory, or equivalent for the version of windows being used. 
Actual Results:  
The site kept on trying to download the executable Install.Exe, and these warnings kept coming up:

Virus or unwanted program 'TR/Dropper.Gen [trojan]'
detected in file 'C:\Users\Jestin Larson\AppData\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\2xtk84zf.default\Cache\ECB1272Cd01.
Action performed: Deny access

Expected Results:  
I would have assumed there would have been a protection, to prevent whatever method they use for this scare tactic to work.

I use Avira AntiVir (Latest Update)
