WindowShade X doesn't work on some windows.

WindowShade X is a Mac OS X add-on (specifically, a "haxie" by Unsanity; http://www.unsanity.com/).  It allows windows to be "minimized" in assorted ways.
I use it, by double-clicking the drag bar, to hide the rest of the window.

This worked reliably in Ff2, but in Ff3 I'm finding that some windows do not close up as expected.  The yellow button at the upper-left-hand corner of the window blinks (showing a "minus sign, FWIW), but nothing else happens.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install WindowShade X and Firefox 3.0 on Mac OS X (10.5.2)
2. Open up some Firefox windows.
3. Try WindowShading them until you get one that fails.

I'm sorry I don't have a reliable way to cause the problem.



WindowShade X does not modify either Mac OS X or the applications.  Rather, it works by sending certain signals to the operating system.  Given that I haven't changed either the OS or WSX, this problem must be related to the manner in which Firefox deals with the OS (eg Window Manager).
