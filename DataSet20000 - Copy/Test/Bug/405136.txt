Graphical corruption (glitches) on redraw / selection after using CTL+ / CTL- to change font size (scale).

When using the control-plus and control-minus shortcuts to increase / decrease page font sizes, Firefox 3.0 Beta 1 tends to fail to correctly redraw the page. It looks OK (and scaled up) initially, but when one scrolls or selects text the display tends to "break up" or "tear". See attached screenshot.

Note that my system has a 115 dpi display, and is configured as such in Vista'a display control panel. The rest of firefox, however, is fine with this, and so is page display most of the time.

The issue has never been observed without scaling the page.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a page that can't be rendered in the viewport all at once.
2. Use Control+ to scale the page up a couple of steps
3. Select some text in the page
Actual Results:  
Sometimes the selection simply won't go where the on-screen text says it should, instead triggering a redraw of the same text at an offset as if the page had been scrolled/rearranged but no update of the screen had been made. See screenshot.

Scrolling may draw the wrong part of the page at the newly visible edge due to similar issues.

Expected Results:  
No graphical glitches; selection should highlight what's already there, and the part of the page made newly visible from scrolling should be contiguous with what was already on screen.

Forcing a redraw with (eg) page up then page down resolves the graphical issues.

Vista 32 bit (clean install; Business). 115 dpi display, set to 115 dpi in Vista display control panel. Upgraded from Firefox 2.0 . No minimum font size or custom fonts set in Firefox prefs.
