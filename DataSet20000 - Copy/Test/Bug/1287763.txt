[10.10+] update remaining OS X textbox focus styling
+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1084598 +++

Some text fields still have the pre-Yosemite glowy effect, and those should get the flatter, different blue. See bug 1084598 for examples - generally this will boil down to adding media-queried copies of these styles and updating the box-shadow appropriately. Alternatively, it /may/ be possible to use CSS variables to make the whole thing slightly less repetitive, but because of the wide range of selectors I'm not entirely sure if that's feasible in the general case.

A list:

the "edit bookmark" panel input boxes: http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/65bed54efcce67cf04a890f7fe253ccdfa6befdc/browser/themes/osx/browser.css#2096
