I can download the .exe file correctly using IE6, but FireFox3 does not work
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4

the contents of ftp://ftp.spss.com/pub/web/drivers/sdap/datadirect/OA/win32/localodbc/ is a .exe file which downloads properly with IE6 but Firefox just sees it as a link that cannot be activated. More web pages than ever work with Firefox, but here is an example of non-functionality that I hope can be corrected in future releases.

Thanks,
Bob

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.click on ftp://ftp.spss.com/pub/web/drivers/sdap/datadirect/OA/win32/localodbc/
2.click on the link that is found on that page
3. it simply shows an empty folder rather than invoking a download/activation menu
4. the link that is found on the page in step 1. does not allow for 'save target as' right click command, but rather 'save link as' which says that the .exe file is not being properly recognized?
Actual Results:  
above is self explanatory

Expected Results:  
do the steps above from IE and you will see that the .exe file is easily invoked (or downloaded.)

enabled downloading of the .exe file.
