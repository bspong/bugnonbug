Firefox freezes after about 15 minutes into watching a movie or watching anything on youtube
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:6.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0
Build ID: 20110811165603

Steps to reproduce:

Watched any video or surf any page on the internet.


Actual results:

The firefox browser 5.0 freezes after so many minutes about 15 minutes into watching a movie or watching anything on youtube it freezes occasionally within 3 minutes apart. ONLY the firefox broswer is doing this nothing on my system freezes only the browser!


Expected results:

Well it should play the video don't you think? 
I have unistalled firefox and then installed it different times and still run into the freezing bug. My laptop is NEW out of the box, and after i unistalled firefox I had installed google chrome to see if the broswer was the problem and sadly it was your browser causing the mishap. I then unistalled google chrome and installed firefox back and and the same problem happened, and it has happened ever since the stupid update from firefox 3.1 version to the new 5.

And NO i will not do anything as in fix my file on my NEW laptop when ALL browsers are working but FIREFOX. It's sad that i have to switch to google chrome or IE 9 now, I have been using firefox for many years, and now this is happening , I believe Firefox should fix the problem before moving on to developing another browser version, or else firefox will eventually die, no one wants a browser that does NOT work!
