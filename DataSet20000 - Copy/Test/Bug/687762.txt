Firefoz 6.0.1 & 6.0.2 freezing
Running on an XP with SP3 and 2 Gb RAM, Firefox often freezes completely. This is not a crash but a 'freeze', caused by a very heavy load on CPU time, memory and swap file size. Because Firefox completely takes over the system, everything else in Windows runs very slow, too.

I have used Sysinternal's Process Monitor to look into it briefly. Also, by unloading anti-virus and firewall I have verified that the problem is not related to them. The very few add-ins I have, seem well-behaved and I do not suspect them to be the cause of the trouble.

These are the symptoms I have noted so far:

1. Lots of disk activity; seems to be connected to item #3.

2. Firefox' CPU load rises to a constant 97 - 100 %. ProcMon typically lists status as Firefox "Not responding". 

3. Swap file has increased to maximum allowed size. Typically, 2 Gb (my swap file maximum) may be in use during the freeze. Terminating Firefox IMMEDIATELY brings the swap file down to normal size (about 250 - 300 Mb) and the system becomes responsive again.

4. The freeze may happen several times a day. It usually happens when system goes to sleep or wakes up from sleep but may also suddenly happen during normal use. 

5. Special case: A few times, CPU load may be much lower. Still, disk activity and swap file size is as described above.

6. Closing Firefox (clicking the 'X' in the upper right window corner) and restarting it after a freeze sometimes seems to cause the new instance of Firefox to inherit the freeze problem from the previous session.

7. The only safe way to 'unfreeze' it properly seems to be to terminate the process (by using ProcMon or Task manager) and restart Firefox. 

Theory: Firefox seems to get stuck in an eternal loop of constantly shuffling around large chunks of information between the program/memory and the swap file, or within the swap file itself. Maybe there could be a problem between Firefox and Windows regarding the swapping? Or some Firefox housekeeping that gets into a loop?

Security: This is probably not a security problem in itself. However, since Firefox eats up system resources during the freeze, could it affect the anti-virus and firewall protection as well? A lot of users are reporting the freeze on the support forum; if it affects security, too, it could be more serious than "just" a complete freeze several times a day..

I would be very grateful if you would please look into this as soon as possible.
