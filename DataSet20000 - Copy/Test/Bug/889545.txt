restart previously loaded pages fail to display
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:25.0) Gecko/20130702 Firefox/25.0 (Nightly/Aurora)

Steps to reproduce:

as of today's update (2013-07-02), on restart or quite, start, all, but the first page (tab) fails to display anything.


Actual results:

After starting FF and choosing Restore Session, Only the first page 'loads' or displays its content. All other previously viewed tabs display a blank white page, Even if I Reload or click in navigation bar and hit enter. The page acts as if it's 'going', but again, nothing is displayed, blank white page.
The only pages that display are 'New Tabs' with an address not on a Tab from Restored Session and the 'first' page from the Restored Session.
I've Quite and Started FF and have Restarted my openSuSE 12.3 / KDE 4.10.4/5 Dell Latitude with 4 GB RAM, 500 GB hdd, 128MB video and I have the same issue as of today's update


Expected results:

on Restore Session, previously viewed tabs should load from cache or at least, reload from website on tab focus (activation) of tab. At worst, on 'reload' of page or address > enter action should reload as new...
I can reproduce this over again as of today's update.
Also, media stream in background cuts out too often.
