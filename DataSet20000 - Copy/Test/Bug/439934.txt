Addon list scrolls only one step down even if there are several addons listed in the Update Addons screen at startup after Firefox update
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

When Firefox starts up after update, currently installed addons are checked for compatibility with the updated version. The list of incompatible addons is listed and the user is presented an option of 'Check Now' or 'Do Not Check' for updates.

The problem is this -> If several addons are listed, a vertical scrollbar is provided. However this scrollbar can move only one step down. It cannot be dragged more than one step.

If I try to click on one of the addons listed, and press the down arrow key, the next addon is highlighted. Pressing the down arrow key again, the next further addon is highlighted. When the highlighted addon is beyond the current display area, the scrollbar does not automatically move down.

Observed when Firefox starts for the first time after installation/upgrading from Firefox 2.0.0.14. This same problem would probably occur when the next update for 3.0 is released.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 2.0.0.14
2. Install more than 10 addons which are compatible with 2.0.0.14
3. Uninstall Firefox 2.0.0.14
4. Install Firefox 3.0
5. Post-install, upon first run of Firefox, the list of addons is presented which are currently incompatible with 3.0 with the option of checking for updates now
6. Since there are more than 10 addons listed, note that there is a vertical scrollbar to scroll down
7. Left-click and hold the scrollbar and drag it down
Actual Results:  
Observe that the scrollbar cannot be dragged more than one step down.

Expected Results:  
The scrollbar should have scrolled all the way to the bottom of the list as long as I drag it down.
