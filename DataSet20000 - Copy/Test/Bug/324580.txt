1) must force quit all the time to get out; 2)embedded links when viewing email don't work
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/417.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/417.8
Build Identifier: firefox 1.0.6

  
I have a G4 iBook (Macintosh) and I'm running Tiger (MacOS X.4).  I use 
Firefox as my web browser, and use it to connect to my yahoo account 
(not as an email client).  I'm running Firefox 1.0.6, which I have 
downloaded twice but it has not helped.
 
 When I open an email that has a hyperlink within in, the hyperlink 
doesn't work.  Likewise, when I'm composing an email with a link in it, 
the link is not recognized and the recipient will not receive the data 
as a link that is clickable.
 
 The odd thing is that this did work before I installed the Fasterfox 
and No Script extensions.  I found at first that No Script caused my 
regular web links to stop working, so I uninstalled it.  That worked.  
Today I uninstalled Fasterfox hoping that it would fix the link 
problem, but to no avail.
 
 Another problem is that I have to Force Quit to get out of Firefox. 
When I choose Quit, it just sits there.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open Firefox
2.open my email program
3.voila!

Actual Results:  
Don't know if it is replicable, my friends don't have this problem, only me!

Expected Results:  
I've even downloaded the newest version of Firefox (1.5) and the links still don't work.  I also still have to force quit too.
