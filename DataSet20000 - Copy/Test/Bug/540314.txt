Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0

I open firefox browser window. I enter URL - my yahoo mail, AIO online for online class, any URL will do. I hit enter key or press arrow key and page freezes. The cursor does not move, nothing on the page is active, buttons dont work, but I can change the URL but then problem starts over again. Firefox was just automatically updated yesterday or day before yesterday. And that is when problem started. I never had problem with this browser before and was happy to not use Explorer anymore. I am now back to explorer so I can go online and work or take class, check mail, etc. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. in Mozilla 5.0 enter "facebook.com" in URL field. Page freezes immediately.
2. enter email and pwd - but it will take a few seconds before fields become active. 
3. logout. page freezes. Cannot make new entry in URL field. It behaves as if field is inactive. Page is still frozen. Yesterday I had several pages open at same time. The page I was in froze. I used task manager to hard close it and firefox crashed.
Actual Results:  
As above. Page froze.

Expected Results:  
I should be able to enter a new URL, click a button or do anything else on an active page. 

As above. I did not have any problem whatsoever with previous version. This started happening when I was automatically upgraded to mozilla 5.0. The other day a pop-up appeared saying that mozilla installed updates and system would shut down. I had no choice to postpone the shut down. It just did in the middle of what I was doing. Since that happened, I've had problems with this new version 5.0 ever since. I am running windows xp o/s on an HP elitebook 8530p. I have 4gb ram. I work with several browser windows open and Photoshop oftentimes and it has never been a problem until now. Thanks in advance for your help.
