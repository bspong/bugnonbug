Bookmarks toolbar folder created twice after import

An empty bookmarks file only features the folder 'Bookmarks toolbar folder'
This folder is not deletable.
After an import of previous exported bookmarks (where this folder is already
included), the 'Bookmarks toolbar folder' appears twice.
The first folder remains empty.
The new folder, with the same name, has the bookmarks.
They should have merged both.
The bookmarks present in the exported version appear in the second folder.
I suppose they are not taken into account because no bookmark appears on the
bookmarks toolbar of my browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add some bookmarks, both in the normal folder and the 'Bookmarks toolbar folder'.
2. Export these.
3. Delete all bookmarks (notice how the 'Bookmarks toolbar folder' can be erased)
4. Import your exported bookmarks again
5. Notice how you have two 'Bookmarks toolbar folder's.
   You'll have no visible bookmarks in your browser's bookmarks toolbar because
they are all in the second folder.


Expected Results:  
The links from the two 'Bookmarks toolbar folder' should have merged.
