Firefox hangs and will no longer respond on some sites using java script.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 Firefox/3.6.8 FireTorrent/2.0.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

This behavior is demonstrated on all six of my machines since the last two updates.  I have updated java to no effect.  My Win7 machine has NOT been updated and works FINE.  IE works FINE.  This BUG has ONLY manifested itself with these updates and on every machine updated including the Vista machine.

I have narrowed it down to websites with some java apps however this is my impression and certainly NOT imperial.  

I am using a java based chat app on my forum, however i can no longer use Firefox since the last two updates.  IE loads the app and works well.  Firefox loads about 3/4ths of the app according to the status bar and then hangs Firefox totally.  

Some sites use java for presentation, those sites hang Firefox.

If this is not resolved i will be forced to abandon Firefox.  I have gone through all your help files and find nothing helpful that resolves the issue.  I mention this so you know i have taken many steps before reporting this bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to forum and start the chat java chat app.
2.  Go to website with java display.
3.  
Actual Results:  
Firefox hangs - the cursor goes in sleep mode except for a mouse over the X (close window button of Firefox) which then eventually shuts down Firefox and ends in the Microsoft OS alert box that a program crashed and asks if i wish to send a report to MS or not.

Expected Results:  
My expectation would be that the applications load and run as they once did before the last two Firefox updates.  In the case of the chat app, the application should have configured and ran the chat window.

In the case of the other sites, well depends, one of them is displaying a little animation which hangs Firefox, run from a java script.

I have tried updating Java by the way - this did not help.
