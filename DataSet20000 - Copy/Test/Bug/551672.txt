javascript hangs when waiting too long to print a page

When you print a page an you don't press the "print" button for a certain amount of time, firefox will popup a "Warning: script doesn't react" (translated from Dutch: "Waarschuwing: script reageert niet" - window.
Becaus the javascript has focus it's not possible to close the printing dialogue, nor the javascript dialogue.
I think this appies to a built-in script: 
/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/modules/NetworkPrioritizer.js:175

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any page
2. Choose Archive>Print or press CMD+P
3. Wait till the script pops up
Actual Results:  
Javascript "Continue" or "Stop script" dialogue opens. Printing as well as the javascript-dialogue can't be closed.

Expected Results:  
Don't show the box. It should wait till the user acts

I am not able to reproduce the error on Windows XP.
To stop firefox I have to do so via "Force Stop" (CMD+ALT+ESC)
