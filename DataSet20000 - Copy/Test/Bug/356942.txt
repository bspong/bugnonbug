Second-level right click menus use primary monitor's screen bottom position instead of relative positioning

This bug appears when using multiple monitors.  If the secondary monitor is placed above or below the primary monitor, second-level right click menus exhibit strange behavior.  

For ease of duplicating this bug, a very large secondary contextual menu is suggested.  I have been using Web Search Pro Extension's right-click search feature.  It's menu displays a long list of search engines -- enough space to easily show a discrepancy.

NOTE: This bug only appears when the secondary display has been moved from being horizontally equal in "altitude" to the primary monitor.  The secondary monitor's position can be changed in WinXP by entering [Control Panel -> Display -> Settings] and click-dragging the secondary monitor up or down.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter multi-monitor mode with the secondary monitor placed above or below horizontal position of the primary monitor.
2. Place the Firefox window on the secondary monitor
3. Right click at various "altitudes" (vertical positions)

Actual Results:  
Best results are achieved with a large second-level right click menu.  

The right-click menu appears as it should; however, if the right-click menu gets too far "south", any second-level menus will appear very small or not appear at all at the extreme bottom of the screen.  If the second monitor is placed "below" the primary monitor, then the result is the opposite -- the second-level menu appears far above where it should.

Expected Results:  
All menus should be placed in relation to one another (which seems to work properly), but also in relation to the VISIBLE AREA on screen, NOT in relation to the primary monitor's screen bottom.
