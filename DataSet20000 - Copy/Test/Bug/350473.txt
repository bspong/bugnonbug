Problem With Firefox, Couldn't Click on other Tabs or do anything else after I closed One Tab
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6

What happened was, at first, I had three tabs opened (Gmail, Myspace, AZ Lyrics). I closed the tab saying "AZ Lyrics". After I closed it, the Mozilla Firefox window  showed a tan/brown screen. So I clicked on a tab saying "Myspace", but it didn't do anything. It was still the tan/brown screen. So I clicked on the "Gmail" tab, and it still showed a tan/brown screen. So I typed in a URL of a website, and I pressed the "Go" button, nothing happened. I pressed it multiple times, and it still showed the tan/brown screen. I clicked on the tabs I had opened a couple more times, and it was still the tan/brown screen. So I decided to close Firefox and restart the program. But when I clicked on Firefox from my desktop and in my program folder, it wouldn't open, no matter how many times I tried. Why did all of this happen? Is this a program crash?
