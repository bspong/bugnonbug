Infinite spinner with print edit + shutdownhang
e10s enabled.
Install Print Edit https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/print-edit/
(Optional) Still happens without, install various others to add slowness, ublock, privacy badger, greasemonkey, stylish etc.)
(Optional, recommended) Customise -> Move Print Preview to toolbar.
Visit web page (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/ one I found most likely to trigger but http://www.theguardian.com/uk also triggered it, likely others too.)
As soon as content first appears (i.e. not fully loaded),
Click Print Preview. (Print Edit seems not to trigger it.)
Chrome switches correctly.
Content shows spinner and never stops (Not the bug if spinner stops and page displays.)
CPU constantly active.
Close print preview and spinner remains on the page.
New tabs function but noticeably bad.
Closing Firefox gives a crash with various shutdownhang signatures.

Regression range 2016-09-17 good, 2016-09-18 bad. exception stopped run going into inbound.

Most likely regressed by: bug 1279086

Print Edit developer added to CC, I think fix probably more likely to be change in Firefox but developer with knowledge of code better at determining.
