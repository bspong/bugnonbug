Alt+D and Ctrl+Enter behaving incorrectly

I've posted bug #235040 (Uncloseable Sidebar - Showing up automatically)
After it, these two are additional problems that I'm having

** NOTE **
**********
I'm having these problems WHILE the Sidebar is still open.
I've NOT tried to close the Sidebar by --
    1)  Go into "View" menu to activate any sidebar  ---\
                                                         |-- Bug #235040
    2)  Try closing the Sidebar again                ---/



Problem #1
----------
     I press  Alt+D to get into the "Address Bar"
Instead of transfering the focus into the "Address Bar",
the "Open Location" dialog window is opening up.
     This might not be a bug, BUT my usual intuition about
pressing "Alt + D" is to get into the Address bar, and
NOT opening the "Open Location" dialog window.

     **HOWEVER**, after I close the Sidebar (Bug #235040),
the Alt+D was working fine again by transferring the caret
into the Address bar.


Problem #2
----------
     Since, I can't use the Keyboard to get into the
Address Bar, I click inside the Address Bar.

     I type in an URL with the  "www" and ".com", and
I press  Ctrl + ENTER.  NOTHING happens...

     This is definitely a bug I guess.


%% NOTE %%
I tried re-installing the Firefox 0.8 AGAIN after
having trouble with all these problems and the Bug #235040.
It did NOT solve these problems :-((

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Problem #1
----------
1. Press Alt + D to get into the Address Bar
2. The Caret wouldn't go into the Address Bar, but instead
   opens the "Open Location" dialog window.
3. Close the Sidebar (Bug #235040) and press Alt+D again
4. Then, it works fine

Problem #2
----------
1. Press Ctrl + ENTER while caret is in the Address bar
   while the Sidebar is still open (Bug #235040)
2. The URL wouldn't change into  www.<what_ever>.com
3. Close the Sidebar (Bug #235040), and press Ctrl + ENTER
4. It still would NOT work


Expected Results:  
Problem #1
----------
Alt + D should transfer focus into the address bar
and NOT open the "Open Location" dialog window.

Problem #2
----------
Ctrl + ENTER should prepend "www" and append ".com"
in the address bar.
