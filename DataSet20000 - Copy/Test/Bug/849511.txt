On session resume with master password and certificate authenticated pages, no pages will load until master password entered, sometimes multiple times
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:21.0) Gecko/20130308 Firefox/21.0
Build ID: 20130308042013

Steps to reproduce:

1. Enable "Show my windows and tabs from last time" (session restore)
2. Enable "Use a master password" (I assume this is related)
3. Sign in to one or more websites using certificate-based authentication. I signed in to cacert.org and startssl.com.
4. Close Firefox with File>Exit
5. Restart Firefox
6. After all windows and tabs are restored, notice that networking seems to be disabled. I cannot load or reload any pages.
7. Close Firefox (File>Exit)
8. After windows close, I find "Password Required" (title) prompts that ask "Please enter the master password for the FIPS 140 Cryptographic, Key and".
9. Respond to several of those prompts (4 or more) until Firefox finally is completely closed.
10. Restart Firefox.
11. Finally discover two "Password required prompts hidden behind some of the visible browser windows.
12. Enter my master password at both prompts.
13. Notice this did not sign me in to either certificate-authorized website.
14. Notice that I CAN now browse the internet.

Last verified in Aurora 21.0a2 (2013-03-08) on Windows 7.


Actual results:

I could not browse the internet until entering my master password twice at prompts that were hidden behind other Firefox windows.
I could not exit Firefox until responding to those prompts, either.


Expected results:

Internet browsing should have worked unobstructed, since full interactivity with Firefox windows was enabled.
If my master password was required, I should have received one prompt, and it should have been visible (possibly displayed on top after all Firefox windows had been restored).
