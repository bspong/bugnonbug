Different dialog when closing multiple tabs if other window is open

If I close a window with multiple tabs, it prompts me "Do you want Firefox to save your tabs..." with a "Save and Quit", a "Quit" and a "Cancel" button.

However, if I have another Firefox window open, it prompts me "You are about to close..." with a "Close tabs" and a "Cancel" button.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open FF twice, second time with two tabs.  Close the second instance
2. Open FF once, with two tabs.  Close FF

Actual Results:  
The dialogs are different for the same action

Expected Results:  
The dialogs should be the same

First of all, this is a usability problem - many users will not realize why the dialogs are different.  For me, I cannot quickly close a window with multiple tabs without looking at the screen to determine which button I should click on.  The defaults are different, and would never want to save a session.  However, I do like being able to get a warning if I try to close multiple tabs - maybe I forgot there was another tab open.

Please make it possible to disable the "Do you want Firefox to save your tabs..." type dialog, and still get a warning when closing multiple tabs.  Or I would appreciate if someone could point me to the correct about:config entry to tweak.
