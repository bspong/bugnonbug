In Firefox 3.6b4, when I install Adblock Plus 1.1.1 and start the browser with one of the startup tabs having blocked ads, Firefox crashes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create 64bit VirtualBox machine
2. Install 64bit Ubuntu desktop
3. Install ia32libs (& deps)
4. Download 32bit Firefox 3.6b4 from mozilla.com
5. Install adblock plus 1.1.1
6. Enable usa easylist
7. Go to www.smashingmagazine.com or some other page with ads
8. Close firefox
9. Open firefox, smashingmagazine should be the page that loads.
Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes

Expected Results:  
Firefox should open and the ads should be blocked.

I have reproduced this on my normal profile, a clean profile, and even a clean OS in a virtual machine using the steps listed above. I do not know if this happens on a 32bit installation. That could be part of the issue. I am using Ubuntu 9.10 x64. Firefox 3.6b4 32bit binaries from mozilla.com.

I ran Firefox 3.6 betas 1-3 in the same configuration with no problems.

I can upload the VM I used to reproduce this if no one else can reproduce it independently.

I originally reported the bug to the Adblock Plus forums here: https://adblockplus.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=4823&p=30698#p30698
