When I open my yahoo.com email and it contains embedded pictures in the body to
display, the pictures does not show up properly.  Instead the each pictures
display on top of one another and you only see one picture and the scroll bar to
the right is not showing up either.  If I use IE browser on www.yahoo.com web
email, I am able to view all the pictures embedded in the body of the email and
I'm able to scroll down to view the rest of the pictures .

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have someone send you an email to your yahoo email account with embedded
pictures in the body of the email message.
2. Log on to your yahoo email account and open the email that contained embedded
pictures in the body of the email message.
3.

Actual Results:  
The embedded pictures starts displaying and it overlaps each picture and the
last picture will be shown and the rest of the pictures can't be seen. The
scroll bar does not show up and you to click back to continue because the
buttons for your email is not showing up either.

Expected Results:  
It should have displayed the embedded pictures individually in the body of the
email message and the vertical scroll bar to the right should function so that
the user can view the pictures up and down.  Other email button function should
be visible to continue.

To my recollection, this problem has been happening since the release of Mozilla
Firefox.  I'm reporting this now because we are using Mozilla Firefox more often
and I don't want my users to complain about this problem and starts using IE
browser again because Firefox can't display their pictures properly on their
yahoo email.
