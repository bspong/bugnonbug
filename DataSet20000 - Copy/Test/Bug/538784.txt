The timeout for opening children tabs right next to parent is too short.

I like the new behaviour of new tabs being opened next to current tab but the time-out for additional children tabs opened right next to parent is too short.

Example: I'm browsing a shopping site, I sort some products by price. I open two interesting ones in new tabs. I pause for a bit and open another new product in new tab. This tab is open right next to parent and not to the right of last child tab. This looses track of order of tabs opened. Better behaviour would be to open all children to the right of last child of parent opened or at least make the time-out for opening children to right of parent instead to right of last child longer

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a page with multiple links
2. Open some links in new tabs with middle-click
3. Wait for a bit
4. Open aditional links.
Actual Results:  
They open next to current tab instead next to last new opened tab.
