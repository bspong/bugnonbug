Steps to reproduce:

Hi,

I had a number of customers on Firefox 28, 32 bit for Windows that were experiences massive slow downs and large black areas of their screen when pulling Firefox from the background.  To correct this, I installed 

http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/29.0b9/win32/en-US/Firefox Setup 29.0b9.exe 

Now they work perfectly, thank you!

But something happened that caused release channel confusion.  After installing 29b9 and going to "Help, About", it said that they were on the beta channel.  So far so good.  

Then "Help, About" installed a quick update and asked to reboot.  After the reboot, "Help, About" said they were on 29 with no other indication that
they were still on the "beta" channel.

But "About:config" shows them on the "beta" channel: app.update.channel;beta.

Bug: "Help, About" should have showed them still on the "beta" channel.
I have attached a screen shot of the missing "beta" channel "Help, About" (after the update and restart).  This caused a lot of confusion, until a guy over on the mozilla.support.firefox group told me to look at app.update.channel.  And, "Help, about" can not really be trusted.

Do I presume correctly that all I have to do is change app.update.channel to "release" to put them back on the normal channel?  (I know, a tech support question, but please indulge me.)

Many thanks,
