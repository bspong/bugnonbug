KB2467174 prevents Firefox from starting
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1

I had recently installed windows update KB2467174 and began getting exactly the problem described in https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/questions/812306. The process firefox.exe would appear in the Task Manager with 104k / 108k / 112k memory consumed and would not load. After Firefox fails to load, trying to start other programs such as Skype or Steam will also fail the exact same way, but a reboot will allow them to load normally provided that Firefox is not started first.

I uninstalled the update (from Programs and Features), rebooted, and the problem went away. Other than KB2467174, I have all other Windows 7 updates.

Reproducible: Didn't try


Actual Results:  
Firefox fails to load although the process firefox.exe will appear in Task Manager consuming 104k / 108k / 112k of memory.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should load normally

Other than KB2467174, I have all other Windows 7 updates at this time.
