Popup information bar uses very weak yellow, looks white on laptop screen

Some notebooks (e.g. my Dell Inspiron 8000) or LCD displays have a strong (or
not so strong) directional characteristic.
This means that the rather weakly yellow "Mozilla prevented a popup from
opening" information bar displayed at the top of the screen (below the tab row)
appears *completely* whitish on my screen when viewing it with the normal 90
degree angle.
Only if I go towards the 45 degree direction will I see it with an
attention-drawing color.

Thus I'd like to ask you to use a less problematic coloring here, e.g. going
more towards a red coloring or towards a stronger yellow:
my notebook doesn't have *any* issues with displaying the quite strongly yellow
"o" in the Google main page recognizably, for example, but the popup blocker bar
is completely white here (as is the yellowish background coloring of some parts
of the very Bugzilla bug page I'm entering now).

I thought of filing it as a Minor bug, but OTOH several times I almost (or most
likely did?? I won't *know* that one for sure, obviously...) failed to see that
it blocked an important popup, so filing as Normal instead (especially since
there probably is no easy workaround).

Thanks!
