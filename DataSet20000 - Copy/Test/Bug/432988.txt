I use Outlook Web Access for work using Web browsers and have a large number of emails and subfolders that are used to store work emails per matter.  

While basic outlook functionality is available when accessing Outlook Web Access via Firefox the complete set of folder navigation features are not available with Firefox Outlook Web Access e.g. expandable tree folders and filing which are used to navigate and file emails to specific sub folders

Details:   Compare filing and accessing emails that need to be filed or moved from the inbox in Outlook Web Access when using IE vs Firefox. 

In IE the browser replicates the outlook experience  eg in IE it is possible to access emails and subfolders directly from the expandable folder tree structure on the left handside of the screen. Emails can also be moved and filed from the inbox directly to a subfolder by dragging and dropping the email to the relevant subfolder or can be moved from subfolders to subfolders (with out requiring screen changes). 

In firefox a folders list is not accessible or expandable meaning that to file an email or access a email subfolder it is necessary to drill down through multiple screens (3-4 screens) for access to each subfolder.  This process must be reversed or restarted to access a different email subfolder.  This slows down 



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Access Outlook Web Access vie IE and create multiple subfolders (3-4 levels)
2.Move and file emails from inbox into different sub-folders and from subfolder to subfolder and expand and compress folderr tree
3.Try and do the same thing in Firefox - it is not possible
