Ever since Firefox 2.0, I've had nothing but frustration with browsing. Whether its a single tab or multiple tabs, browsing all kinds of sites from local to external will "lock up" from time to time. What I mean is that the Firefox status will show Loading but will not load and give a page cannot be found error after a long time. I can be browsing fine for a minute, then back to this problem again. Refreshing the site many times will finally get the page loaded up, but its usually half loaded with images not showing and firefox still "Loading" then "Done with errors".

1. I have Foxmarks as the only Add-on.

2. I've tried loading up the same pages simultaneously in IE 6 without any issues. 

3. Browsing with IE is not an issue.

4. There is no problem with my network connection.

5. Downgrading to Firefox 1.5.0.12 solves the problem completely.

6. Reinstalling Firefox 2.0 (with a restart after removing previous installation) does not solve the problem.

7. Firefox 2.0 is considerably more resource intensive and it takes much longer to load up opposed to Firefox 1.5. This despite the fact that I am running on a Core 2 Duo processor laptop with 2GB of ram and more than 10GB of free hdd space.

8. I do not have any other problems with the computer. There is an updated anti-virus and anti-spyware running in the background.
