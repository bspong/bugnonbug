Using Gmail to compose a message, when you type some Chinese characters in text box, if you use spaces to separate some, the cursor will be displayed across the last character. If only one space exists, the effect is not so obvious; but if there are five, the cursor will stay at the left side of the last Chinese char, just like you using <LEFT> to move the cursor. Please see attachment 1-5.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open a gmail to compose a message
2.type some chinese characters
3.then type a space
4.type some chinese characters again
5. repeat 3 and 4 again and again

Actual Results:  
the cursor will stay at wrong place

Expected Results:  
the cursor will stay at the end of the line

I think this may be caused by css renderer.

Because in common textbox, this problem does not exist.

And as the attachment 6 and 7 show, the link with css may be rendered incorrectly, but without css is correct.
