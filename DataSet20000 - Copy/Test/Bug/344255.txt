Bookmarks metadata (created/last accessed date) cannot be removed; privacy issue.

Currently, the bookmarks system keeps track of when a bookmark is created and when it was last accessed. This information cannot be removed without manually editing the bookmarks.html file, and there appears to be no way of specifying that this information NOT be saved in the future.

This may potentially be a privacy issue for some people, whom don't realize that their browsing history may also be recorded in the bookmarks metadata, in addition to the browser history records.

I propose that we have an option to turn off the saving of this information and an option to purge this data.

Reproducible: Always

3. Invite your mother-in-law over for dinner, but beforehand, purge your browser history.
4. Tell your mother-in-law that that bookmark was old and was part of a research project you did years ago.
5. You mother-in-law inspects your bookmarks metadata.
6. She finds out you visited it last night.
