Fix remaining style inspector e10s tests
I thought that these were all passing when I first opened Bug 1058875, but as it turns out there are still some failures (see https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Holly&rev=a9cc7f174c26, for instance).  Looking at errors like this (https://tbpl.mozilla.org/php/getParsedLog.php?id=47401370&tree=Holly&full=1#error0) makes me think that these are legitimate timeouts where the test is still running when it gets killed.  Also, the exact list of failing tests doesn't seem to be the same across platforms, which also makes me think it could be an issue of them just not having enough time to finish.
