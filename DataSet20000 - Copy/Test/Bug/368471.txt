If you view an image file in the browser by following the "Download" link from a DeviantArt page and then save the image it gets a number and a .html extension as a filename instead of the original filename and extension

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find an image on DeviantArt.com that is large enough that it includes a "Download" link
2. Follow the "Download" link and the image will appear in the browser window.  The URL will end in the correct filename (eg foo_by_bar.jpg)
3. Right click the image and select "Save Image As"
4. Note the filename that FireFox assigns the file in the save file dialog.
Actual Results:  
A filename like 47528283.htm will be set.  

Expected Results:  
The filename as shown in the URL should be set (eg foo_by_bar.jpg)

You can work around this by copying the filename portion of the URL and pasting it to the save file dialog, or by using "Save Page As" from the main menu, but it is nontheless an annoying bug.
