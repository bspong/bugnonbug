While loading SitePoint Forum threads (seems to be any of them), the window
stops updating; the status bar and throbber freeze.  That single window won't
ever redraw; other existing windows and newly-created windows function normally.

The window will not redraw; scrollbars are non-functional.  However you can
still create new tabs (you won't see them, but the close window dialog
accurately reports the number of tabs), switch tabs (using standard shortcuts or
clicking where the tabs would be if you could see them), go to different pages
by typing into the location bar (the current address won't be selected or
changed, but the auto-complete menu will appear), clicking links in the
Bookmarks Toolbar (the bookmarks don't respond on hover, but the menus still
appear with a click), using the Bookmarks menu, etc.

The loading cursor icon will appear when navigating to new pages, and the title
bar will update when chaning tabs, etc., but nothing else redraws.

You can even open the History sidebar and click on links (neither of which
you'll be able to see), and the page will load (but you won't be able to see it,
only the title bar changes).  You can tell when you're over a link because the
pointer changes to the hand icon.
