The combined prev/next drop menu is nice, but it has one flaw.  It works best when you are either at the first page viewed in a tab or the most recent one.  Then it shows 15 items.  Now if you have viewed, say, 100 pages in that tab and want to go back, you can go back 15 page at once, but only the first time.  After that, you are stuck with less as some of those pages are in the wrong direction.

I think that the menu should show 15 in each direction /plus/ the current page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a tab and start viewing page.  One way would be to poke around Wikipedia.
2.Wait until you have at least 30 pages that you could go back to.
3.Attempt to go back to the first page.
Actual Results:  
You will be able to go back 15 pages with the first click.  After that, you can only go back at a slower pace.

Expected Results:  
Users should be able to go back (or forwards) 15 pages at a time regardless of where they are in the tab's history.
