It looks like at least the fxos_1_0_simulator-*.xpi addons will need to be signed, possibly more. Jryans says he thinks many of the tests that use these may be disabled.

Here's the log with the failure to install:

(Ctrl-F for "signature is required but missing")

There is documentation on signing addons here:

I'm volunteering to do the signing, but the addons are already owned by a different AMO account. Here are all our options:

1. Add 'release+signaddons@mozilla.com' as a co-owner of these addons on AMO
2. Give me the signing keys of the existing owner
3. Sign them yourselves using the existing owner
4. Allow me to change the addon ids so AMO will think they are new addons
5. Disable the test(s) that use them
6. Install these as temporary addons so they don't need to be signed (I'd prefer to avoid this option for now as it likely means missing the 46 train for enforcing addons.. this can always be revisit later)
