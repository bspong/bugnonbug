Popup selections must be clicked twice when user closes main window. If the user leaves just the popups open and closes all his main windows the popup click will reopen his main window to the location it was last. The next click of the popup will open another window and navigate to the correct popup location (like it should).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Navigate to site that opens a main screen and a popup at the same time.
2.Close the main navigation window.
3.Click on one of the selections in the popup window

Actual Results:  
Main window is opened (at the url it was last) when you click on a selection in the popup.

Expected Results:  
With the main window closed and only popups open when you click on the popup it should open another window and navigate to that selection.

Found during software testing of our product. Firefox 4.0 is the only browser that encounters the problem. Previous Firefox versions work correctly, we test with multiple different browsers and Firefox 4.0 is the only place where the problem shows up. This is reproducable everytime with our popup.
