take a look at the heise.de it-news website

<http://www.heise.de/newsticker/foren/go.shtml?forum_id=81654&list=1&hs=64&e=all>
(with the discussion threads all extended on that page) and you will see in a
relatively small and narrow deerpark alpha2 browser window that the lowest line
of that page (normally reading "Copyright © 2005 Heise Zeitschriften Verlag  	
Datenschutzhinweis   Impressum   Kontakt     Hosted by Plus.line " and all  this
with a grey bar is being displayed right inside the rest of the text and
discussions.

also click on the two links to collapse and expand the discussion tree

collapse:
<http://www.heise.de/newsticker/foren/go.shtml?forum_id=81654&list=1&hs=64&c=all>

expand:
<http://www.heise.de/newsticker/foren/go.shtml?forum_id=81654&list=1&hs=64&e=all>

and see how the grey bar with the copyright and impress notes gets drawn in
wrong places all over the page....

and experiment with resizing/windowsize of deerpark alpha2 on win32,

Deer Park 1.0+
