After I browse awhile and the browser keeps using more and more system memory, it will just become totally non-responsive. No link or menu item is clickable. Eventually I can change the url address, but doesnt go to any address. Eventually when i click on the window close tab, the browser will close. Then when i try to open the browser again, i get this message box saying that 'firefox process is already started' and it wont open the browser. I then must go into processes tab and manually shut down the process then restart firefox. This always happens regardless what site I am at and happens when the browser uses up certain amount of memory. CPU usage is low for firefox during these freeze ups.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open browser
2. Open about 3 browser windows
3. firefox memory usage is around 100mb
4. happens after an hour or so of surfing.

Actual Results:  
browser will just freeze. Nothing responds on browser. I dont see a 'not-responding' message in the title bar. After awhile i can change the url address but it wont go to any address.

Expected Results:  
doesnt freeze up.
