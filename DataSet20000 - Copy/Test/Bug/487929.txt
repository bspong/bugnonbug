Boyfriend was surfing the net this am. Shut my computer when he was done and didn't do anything to it. I open it, open firefox, and 1/3 of my bookmarks are gone. Then they're all gone. Didn't update anything recently, etc

First I open firefox to see that the bottom 1/3rd of my bookmarks (about 6 of them) were missing. Then I restarted firefox and found that they were ALL gone. Checked my library, where the bottom 1/3rd are STILL gone. Restarted my computer with no change. I haven't updated anything, upgraded anything, or changed firefox in any way recently other than to add http://www.theanimalrescuesite.com  as a final bookmark about 4 days ago. They just randomly disappeared after surfing. Searched through the databases to find answers, but nobody has this specific problem-they all updated something first. Recently bookmarked list is also gone. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to bookmarks at top of the page
2.All that's there is a folder with a star and an arrow. Nothing happens when you scroll to it. 
3.Go to organize bookmarks, double click on bookmark menu. 
Actual Results:  
I can see only 2/3rds of what I'd bookmarked

Expected Results:  
I should have been able to see ALL of my bookmarks in the pull down menu, and then in the library.
