double clicking a flash object dispatches keyboard events that can be caught inside the flash code. this makes the mouse action behave exactly like pressing keyboard keys in the following order:
1. key down - char code 17
2. key down - char code 45
3. key up - char code 45
4. key up - char code 17

this is confirmed in windows versions of FF 3.5 and 3.6b
this behavior does not happen in: IE7, IE8, Safari and FF 3.5 under Ubuntu linux. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. goto http://www.vayer.com/dblclickbug/
there is a simple example written in Adobe Flex.
2. double click the button few times
Actual Results:  
char codes of pressed keys will be added to the textbox


Expected Results:  
nothing should be added to the text area. mouse actions should not dispatch keyboard events.

right click the flash object, select "view source" to understand what is going on (trivial code). this works as expected in IE and Safari browsers and in FF on linux.
current behaviour is very disturbing because of character code 45 - this is like pressing the `insert` button on the keyboard. it makes all text-input fields switch between `insert` and `type over` writing modes. making the use of flex applications very annoying.

*** please let me know when i can remove the example from my webserver ***

thanks and good luck!
