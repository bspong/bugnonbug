Firebug debugger issue due to a commit made at 2013-11-14 in mozilla-central
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:29.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/29.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20131226030203

Steps to reproduce:

1. Use Nightly and install Firebug 1.12.5 from AMO [1]
2. Follow the instructions of this page: https://getfirebug.com/tests/head/console/5033/issue5033.html
   |=> Note: don't press "Continue", but the "Step Over" button (F10) 4 times
3. Reload the page

Actual results:

- You will notice that Firebug UI is broken at step 6 of the test case.
- After the reload, the Firebug UI is still broken, and won't work anymore unless you restart the browser.


Expected results:

Everything should work as with Nightlies before 2013-11-14.

Notes: 
- I have used mozregression and noticed that a commit made at 2013-11-14 [1] has introduced the bug (could that be f059a2f80c22 ?). 
- I couldn't bisect the commits (I got errors while compiling and it takes me long to build Firefox each time).
