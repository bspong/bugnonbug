Firefox GUI fails after launching Win2000 Terminal Services:
After launching Windows 2000 Terminal Services, the Graphical User Interface in
Firefox fails.  Specifically, no buttons, menu, borders, etc. can be seen - only
the page body (of the website being viewed) can be seen.  The space normally
containing the GUI is transparent - that is to say the portions of same of
whatever window is behind it is viewable but not visible where the Firefox GUI
normally exists.  However, upon moving the pointer over the areas where the
Firefox GUI normally exists the GUI starts to 'appear'.  Where there are no
controls it never appears.  Only by ending Terminal Services and re-launching
Firefox is the problem solved, and then only until Terminal Services is used again.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox (and load a webpage if necessary).
2. Launch Terminal Services.
3. Return to the Firefox window.

Actual Results:
