For Mac OS X 10.4, in firefox there is no way to print page headers and footers or turn off the background.  In OS 10.5, one can change these settins by a link from the Print menu, and I thought I could rember doing it with earlier versions of Firefix.  There is no firefox option in the print screen in 10.4Current version: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404 Firefox/2.0.0.14.

On the other hand, Tbird does have those options in the tbird pull-down within the print dialog box.  It looks like it has to be set every time, and I wonder if someone got tbird and firefox mixed up.  tbird has the same version number as Firefox.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Check page ssetup (which is where the option is on Windows).  Not there.
2.Go to print a page.
3. Look for a firefox option.  Not there.
4.  Print page.  Background prints, no headers or footers.
Actual Results:  
Background prints, no headers or footers.


Repeating.  The bug is only in 10.4 and Thunderbird seems to have the firefox kind of options.
