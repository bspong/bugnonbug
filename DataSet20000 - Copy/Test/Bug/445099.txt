Multiple select widgets seem to loose selected items when focus is lost

If you open a page with a multiple selection widget like this:

http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/forms/_SELECT_MULTIPLE.html

In Firefox 2.0 or Konqueror under Linux it works correctly. You can select options and they remain selected when you click outside of the widget or do submit (when the focus is lost from the selection widget)

BUT in Firefox 3 (under Kubuntu 8.04) it DOES NOT work, the options appear to be unselected as the focus is lost from the widget (the blue selection color disapears from the options you selected), (it seems though that the options are actually submited, even if you can't see what you selected)

THIS does not happen in Windows. Could it be a GUI error possibly related to that other bug that makes checkboxes to show grey when selected and in focus?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the URL http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/forms/_SELECT_MULTIPLE.html
2. Select "mushrooms", "greenpeppers" and "onions", click outside the select widget.
Actual Results:  
You see that the 3 selected options lose the blue selection background as if they were unselected.

Expected Results:  
The options should stay marked as you left them, as it happens in Firefox 2, Konqueror, IE or even Firefox 3 on Windows.
