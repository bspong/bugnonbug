Make Profile Manager easier to launch - without exposing it in the UI

Fair enough, don't expose it in the UI, but make it easy for supporters to guide
clueless users to open this Manager when troubleshooting extension collisions or
other weird behaviors. Command line options are too complicated for many users.
People have actually created VBS scripts that create shortcuts that open the
Profile Manager. See http://planet.nana.co.il/ranyk/Files/CreatePMShortcut.vbs

Installing an extension to launch the Profile Manager would be an overkill. In
fact, instead of having to guide users to add the host to the extensions
whitelist would, we might as well spend a few support iterations teaching those
users how to use the command line. This can be very time-consuming in some
cases. If you read Hebrew, check this level of cluelessness:

Two easier to use alternatives:

1. An option to restart Firefox into the Profile Manager by holding the Shift
key when exiting the browser (e.g. File -> Exit).
-and/or-
2. An option to launch Firefox into the Profile Manager by pressing and holding
the Shift key right after launching the browser. This could be useful when the
browser refuses to start.
