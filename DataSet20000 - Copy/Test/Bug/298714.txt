Setting innerHTML prior to adding a node to the document crashes Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

To reproduce this you'll need to have the Greasemonkey extension running and
install a modified version of my Wikipedia Animate script (available at the URL
listed above). Once you have it installed, simply click the "Animate" button
from a Wikipedia history page.

Line 360 is where things go bad:

        // The following should crash Firefox 1.0.4
        frame.innerHTML = content;
        main.insertBefore(frame, controls);
        
        /* This will not crash Firefox
        main.insertBefore(frame, controls);
        frame.innerHTML = content;
        */

Sorry about having such a complex test case, but so far I haven't been able to
reproduce it with anything simpler.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Greasemonkey
2. Install Wikipedia Animate user script
3. Visit a Wikipedia article history page
4. Click the animate button

Actual Results:  
Spinning beachball of death, followed by a crash notification.

Expected Results:  
Animation of the Wikipedia article revision history.
