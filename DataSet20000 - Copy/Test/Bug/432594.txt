Sometimes when launching firefox, or opening a new window the bookmarks toolbar loses all of its links except for the initial Home link.  Restarting will usually restore the full set of links.  Opening a new window will sometimes fix the problem too.

When the toolbar is broken, a secondary effect is that new tabs won't have a close option on them (the cross inside the actual tab).  The right-click tab menu still works though.

A third symptom is that in the bookmarks menu the bookmarks toolbar folder menu item often won't have a name against it, just a blank space.

I've not found a way to reliably trigger this bug, it just seems to be a random occurrence which happens on some launches of firefox.  I've only ever seen it on OSX.  I use the same version of firefox on windows and haven't seen this.

Reproducible: Sometimes
