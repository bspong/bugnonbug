When running SkillSoft Course Manager under FireFox 3.0 (a java application) I get a pop-up message and the application fails to find a file or component at the listed URL.  This problem does not occur when I run SkillSoft Course manager under FF 2.0.14 or under IE7.  After extensive chat with SkillSoft tech support, they simply said that FF3 is "not yet a supported platform".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start SkillSoft Course Manager
2.Select a course of instruction from a catalog of downloaded courses
3.Select link in the catalog to take a test on course material
4.Test question is presented properly...select an answer and select "Done" button
Actual Results:  
An application-modal Pop-up message window appears saying "Couldn't find the response form".

Expected Results:  
The normal expected result is a display of the correct answer to the question and links enabled to continue the test
