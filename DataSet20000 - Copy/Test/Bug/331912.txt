Firefox systematically crashes on these actions: open the tools menu, clear private data and download a file
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

Firefox systematically crashes every time I try to open the Options menu, select the Clear private data menu  from the Tools menu or try to download a file.

I've had this problem for weeks but cannot pinpoint a specific start to these problems. Re-installing and disabling all extensions do not affect the problem.

I can download files if I switch the rendering engine with IETab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Tools -> Options [Crash]
2. Tools -> Clear private data [Crash]
3. Download a file (run or save make no difference) [Crash]
Actual Results:  
Each step makes Firefox crash.

Expected Results:  
Not crash

This problem seems to be specific to my installation so I will have to provide certain information to help locate it. I am down to the point where I would have to reinstall Windows to have Firefox working again or stop using. Neither options are interesting to me. I'm a developer so I can manage requests you may have.

When choosing to debug the software, the error is an "unknown win32 application", which is certainly very useful. More useful information: no themes are installed, all extensions are disabled and I just tried with a fresh re-install (uninstall, reboot, install).

Crashes come in pair in the Event manager.
