FF 3.6.2 crashes (as well as FF 3.6.0) if many windows are opened and loaded. It do not crash if the windows be opened while there is no connection to the internet.
The opened webpages are not uniform from the same time. That mean sometimes the opened pages are from a newspaper, sometimes they are from wikipedia, ...

No PlugIns are installed.
Installed Add-ons are Adblock Plus and Deutsches Wörterbuch (German Dictonary). Both had been deinstalled temporarily but that didn't helped.

After restarting FF it crashes as long as most of the windows are closed manually.

After downgrading to FF 3.5.8 that version crashed as well (but never did before the first update to FF 3.6).
