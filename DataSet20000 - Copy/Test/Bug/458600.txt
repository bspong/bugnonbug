Java broken in Firefox 3.0.x for mac

My mac is a MacBook Intel Core 2 Duo 2.16ghz with 2GB ram running Mac OS X 10.5.5 and Firefox 3.0.3, this problem has existed since 3.0. Visiting any website that uses Java will result in everything but the Java applet properly rendering. In fact, the Java applet does not even initialize (yes, the Java plugin is seen by firefox and is enabled) although the same website loads fine Java and all in Safari. I have tried using this solution: http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20041208225636798  but to no avail. Other people have experienced this issue as well (e.g. http://support.mozilla.com/tiki-view_forum_thread.php?locale=en-US&comments_parentId=76259&forumId=1).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox 3.0.x
2. Go to website with Java applets
3. See that the website renders fine but without the Java applets which do not even initialize even though the Java plugin is enabled
Actual Results:  
The website renders fine but the Java applets don't even start to initialize

Expected Results:  
The website renders fine and the Java applets load into a usable state.
