No way to set an icon for javascript bookmarklets on toolbar and menupopups

In fx2, javascript=based bookmarks such as bookmarklets could be distinguished from standard bookmarks with a selector: .bookmark-item[statustext^=javascript], allowing for a distinct icon.

Although this method still works on the Bookmarks Toolbar overflow (under the chevron) and in menus originating from the Bookmarks dropdown menu, the javascript bookmark shows up with a default icon on the Bookmarks Toolbar.

Further, on a dropdown menu coming from a bookmarks folder item that sits on the Bookmarks Toolbar, the object does not appear at all, even though it does exist and can be seen - complete with its distinct icon - in menus originating from the Bookmarks dropdown menu from the Menu Bar.

In the fx3 browser.xul, the whole block relating to this has been removed, but the missing statusbar element does not seem to have been replaced with corresponding code elsewhere.

If the issue of missing javascript bookmarklets deserves a separate bug, let me know.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a javascript bookmark (bookmarklet), or
   Import a bookmarks.html file that contains bookamrklets
2. Install a theme that supports distinct icons for javascript bookmarks
   (e.g.--SphereGnome or FormalGnome)
Actual Results:  
No distinct bookmarklet icon when the bookmarklet is on the Bookmarks Toolbar.

Bookmarklets do not show up at all in menus that come from bookmarks folders on the Bookmarks Toolbar.

Expected Results:  
Distinct icons for the bookmarklets. 
Bookmarklets should show up on all menus.

I have an developmental version of SphereGnome which works with fx 3.0a9 as of the 2007-09-22 build if someone needs a theme to see the problem with.
