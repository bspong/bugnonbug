Call TelemetryStopwatch only once per item (history / bookmarks / logins) rather than for each resource
Gijs says it shouldn't be a problem for the data we're looking at, but it's probably still a good idea to clean this up.

<dao> Gijs: what kind of things are migrationType and itemResources in https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/migration/MigrationUtils.jsm#297 ?
<Gijs> dao: itemResources are objects that have a 'migrate()' function that gets called to migrate that particular resource
<Gijs> dao: migrationType is the type of resource migration (bookmarks, passwords, etc.)
<Gijs> dao: so for instance, for edge we import 2 resources of type bookmarks
<Gijs> (the normal bookmarks and the reading list)
<dao> and we use a separate TelemetryStopwatch for both?
<Gijs> dao: there's also an "other data" type that I think we use several of when doing a Firefox reset/refresh
<Gijs> dao: looks like it, yes.
<dao> Gijs: is that intentional? seems weird to me
<Gijs> dao: I don't think it was considered when implementing the stopwatches. Regardless, I don't think it makes a big difference here...
<Gijs> dao: there's only 1 item of each resource type for Chrome, so...
<Gijs> ditto for IE, though we have 2 separate ways of importing passwords (depending on the Windows/IE version), I'm fairly sure we only ever use one at a time.
