Hello,
I reported this bug a while ago and did not receive much response on it. If I resize a Firefox window to a smaller size, (say half of my display) maximize it, and close Firefox using Ctrl + W, Firefox will forget my preferred restored window  size. It will open up maximized, then when I restore the window it will occupy the entire screen rather than half. This does not happen when I manually click the X to close Firefox. It only happens when I use Ctrl + W one last time after closing tabs to close Firefox. Again, the steps to reproduce this are below, and I have reproduced it on every PC I can.

I have reinstalled Firefox into a new folder, used new profiles, on several PCs and have experienced this on each and every one.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.1. Open Firefox
2. Set browser window in restored mode.
3. Resize the restored window to any smaller size.
4. Maximize the resized window.
5. Close Firefox using Ctrl + W.
6. Start Firefox.
7. Set browser window in restored mode.
Notice that the restored window will occupy the entire screen rather than shrink to the last size used in restore mode.
Actual Results:  
Firefox does not remember my 'preferred' non-maximized window size.

Expected Results:  
The last size I resize a non-maximized window to, Firefox should keep that size in mind for whenever I close Firefox using Ctrl + W. Again, it remembers it if I do NOT use Ctrl + W and click on the X instead.

None, thank you :)
