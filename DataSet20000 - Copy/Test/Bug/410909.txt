{You have to be logged in to the game on travian.com; i play on s11.travian.interia.pl but i think it happens on every servers)

When you are logged to the game Travian and something is builden (or army is on their road) interface of game shows times to the and of venture. On every second all OS freezes for short moment, even if window of firefox is minimalized.

Freezes means that everything stops for short moment. For example mouse couurser stop its move

I have it on Firefox 2.0.x but now i tried nightly and it still egzist.
It doesn't happend always, but i cannot recognize from what it depends. Sometimes, when it heppen, i open new program (such as Thunderbird) without closing Firefox and after this, OS stop to hung. It looks that it is JS problem or problem with acccesing to the time counting mechanism (?) in OS. Now i use openSuSE but one year ago i had Mandriva and everything was OK (but of course i used then other older version of Firefox)

When I check it in Opera, system doesn't freezes
