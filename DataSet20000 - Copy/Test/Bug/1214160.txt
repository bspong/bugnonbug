Firefox fails to attach pdf files to some application forms
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:41.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/41.0
Build ID: 20150929144111

Steps to reproduce:

1. I opened these websites in order to submit my application for a job.
2. I completed all the forms and tried to attach a pdf file.
3. I clicked submit.

The websites are: http://lavoraconnoi.euronics.it (requires registration, then it asks for you to complete profile by uploading a cv), http://www.rana.it/it/lavora-con-noi and http://www.subito.it/offerte-lavoro/banconisti-per-fiera-verona-verona-139413138.htm


I'm sorry these are mainly in italian.


Actual results:

In the latter two websites it failed to submit the applications due to its inability to recognize the pdf file as a pdf file (messages like "you must submit a pdf file")
I tried with other pdf files and it didn't work. I tried with the Opera broswer and it worked fine.

In the former website I couldn't perform a single action after login: I login, got into my profile page and then it didn't recognize me as logged in. With Opera I had no problem.


Expected results:

It should have recognized the login and the pdf file.

Firefox 41.0.1 on Windows 7.
