Caret browsing sends object:text-caret-moved events when moving over <description> element contents in XUL applications only when the given <description> element is put directly in a .xul file.  When the <description> element is added dynamically by a script, caret browsing doesn't send the object:text-caret-moved events from it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the URL given above.
2. Press the "Add text" button one or more times.
3. Run Orca or Accerciser.
4. Move the caret using left/right arrow keys over characters in both "Static text." and "Generated text." lines and listen to Orca output and/or watch Accerciser events.
Actual Results:  
Orca reads characters in "Static text." but doesn't read characters in "Generated text.".  Accerciser reports the object:text-caret-moved event for each caret movement in "Static text." and for none or only some of the caret movements in "Generated text.".

Expected Results:  
Characters in both "Static text." and "Generated text." lines should be handled the same way.
