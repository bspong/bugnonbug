Firefox Locking up at almost every page which has Adobe Flash

I'm using FF 3.6.1 and Adobe Flash 10.1.102.64. Flash is now crashing in over 80% of any visit to any site with a Flash component running. This causes Firefix to lockup for a few minutes, or crash entirely. I've been tying to complain about this for the past hour! Since when I went to post a question about this; the FF question form said the field was 255 and I had 516??? Which I erased nearly all the data before I figured out I wasn't going to be able to submit because it kept saying I had 516 chars...?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Visit a site with Adobe Flash
3.Watch it lockup and crash.
Actual Results:  
I'm not getting in all this detail since this happens to about every site I visit that has Flash. It's gotten so bad I disabled Flash. I don't have 1, not ONE single session using the Firefox browser that doesn't end with a crash. Some weeks ago, I did a FULL FF uninstall and reinstall using FF 3.6.1. Since the induction of the Plugin container, I've seen a steady incline of reliability issues and crashes.

Expected Results:  
To just...work? I don't know?? To be able to properly render a web page, regardless of the plugin.

Again, I want to re-iterate that when the Adobe Flash Plugin crashes, the Plugin Container locks up/or crashes; sometimes it's bad enough to lock FF entirely for a few minutes, to a full blown browser crash where FF shuts off.
