The new Stop and Reload icons emulate far too closely, common Delete and Undo icons.

The first attachment shows the Delete and Undo icons found on the most widely used platform's File Manager, next to Firefox's current nightly different button icons, Stop and Reload.

For four years Firefox has successfully used a clear octagon stop sign with white interior, subtly emulating a widely recognised stop sign to be clearly defined.  As well as the single red colour now matching very closely, an X emulates Delete even more closely, leaving a near match.

Reload from Fx 2 lost one of it's arrows, and in Fx 3 currently it's thickness, leaving one thin arrow much like Undo/Redo in Windows Explorer, and even Microsoft Office, Open Office and more.  The colour has also been darkened, again leaving a near match.

Whilst one admires aspiring to develop a brand and difference to other programs, this should not be at the expense of usability.  They break what novice users are used to not only in terms of basic icon recognition in Windows (nativity) and more, but also previous Firefox versions.

For 4 years Firefox has consistently successfully used the clearer stop and reload icons.  The new icons make it far easier for novice users to mistake them for Delete, Close, Undo, Redo icons they see very often in Windows Explorer, MS Office, Open Office, and many more.  

This issue must be addressed as it breaks long term established standards novice users are used to seeing, nativity, and even Firefox consistency.
