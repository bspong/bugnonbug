When I recently switched to using Firefox 0.9.1 I noticed an annoying behavior.
When I click the x in the upper right hand corner of the screen (minimize,
close, maximize, etc) it closes all open firefox windows, not just the current
one. If other windows had more than one tab opened it doesn't even give the
'closing multiple tabs' warning like it does if I close the window with the
multiple tabs directly. So basically when i revert to habit and use 'x' to close
the current window I can lose all my firefox windows and tabs immediately. i
didn't know if this was intended behavior or a bug so I figured I'd report it in
hopes it was a bug.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.open multiple windows of firefox
2. click x in upper right hand corner of any firefox window
3. swear and curse as you try and recreate the tabs you had opened in other
firefox windows

Actual Results:  
they closed

Expected Results:  
It should only cause the main window to close, not all open firefox windows.
