XML viewer doesn't handle expansion/hiding properly

When using the XML viewer, certain nodes are not handled correctly when
hiding/expanding. I have seen 2 bugged behaviours which I suspect are caused by
the same bug:

1. Hiding a node (click -) causes the node to be hidden, but the nodes
underneath it are not moved up, leaving a white space on the page.

2. Expanding a node (click +) causes the node to be expanded, but the nodes
underneath it are not moved down, causing overlapping text.

This does not happen for all nodes, however it does happen in one of the nodes
in an XML document I will attach in a comment below.

1 is really simple to reproduce, simply contract the <nav:url> tag in my
example. This is 100% reliable on this browser.

2 is harder to reproduce because it only happens for the <nav:url> node, which
doesn't move the text below it up in normal circumstances. By clicking on random
stuff I have managed to reproduce this (only takes a few seconds of random
clicking), but I haven't worked out a reliable path to it.

Note that this works fine on Mozilla 1.7.2.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open example.xml, which I will attach below.
2. Hide the nav:url node

Actual Results:  
The node was contracted, but nodes below it did not move up to fill the space.

Expected Results:  
The node should contract and nodes around it should adjust properly.
