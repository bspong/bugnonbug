the back button does not control the frame, it controls the whole page

When surfing inside of frames firefox is inconsitant with the handling of the
back button.  When I go to a new page inside of the frame then click the back
button, the frame stays in the same location, but I am shifted to the previous
page.  The main thing that makes this error so bizzare, is that it does not hold
true for all pages.

I posted this as reproducable because it is consistant on the pages that the
glitch occurs on.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to one of the listed glitch pages
2. click on a link that is contained within the frames (and stays in the frame)
3. hit the back button (on the browser window, but also works with right click)
Actual Results:  
the site shifted back

Expected Results:  
The frame should have shifted back one page instead of the whole site
