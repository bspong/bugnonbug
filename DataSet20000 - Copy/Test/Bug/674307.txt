Facebook Login Approvals recognized devices is resetting
If a user has facebook set to require login approvals 

(description: Login Approvals
When an unrecognized computer or device tries to access my account:
Require me to enter a security code sent to my phone) 

it should hold that device until it is removed from the list. This feature has been working for me on Aurora builds since June 25th (when I first enabled it). However, in the last few days when I logout and log back in I have to re-approve the device and browser on at least a daily (if not more often) basis. 

Steps to reproduce
1) Setup facebook acount to use login approvals
Account -> Account Settings
Account Security -> change
Put a check in  "Login Approvals" 
When an unrecognized computer or device tries to access my account:
Require me to enter a security code sent to my phone
Save the setting.
2) Log out and log back into Facebook, you should be prompted for a code to access your account.
3) This setting should stay as long as the device/browser combination is approved.

Actual results
1) Approval is resetting approx every 24 hours and the list in Facebook is an increasing list of approvals

Impact
This could be perceived as a problem with Firefox and Facebook not doing security correctly and thus a mark against the browser. This is a recent regression in behavior as until this point this was not a problem and the site could remember the browser/computer was authorized even across daily updates.
