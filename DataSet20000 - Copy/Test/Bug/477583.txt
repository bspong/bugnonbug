Backups of bookmarks will stop working as soon as a *.json file with a newer date is found in the backup folder.
If you happen move ahead the date on your computer, to test some software in my case, and during that time open and close Mozilla a backup will be created and stamped with the fake date. Once you set the computer calendar to the real date and time Mozilla backup will stop working. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open and close all running instances of Mozilla.(This step should create a backup file. *.json)
2.Move forwared the computer date (lets say 30 days) 
3.Open and close Mozilla.
4.Check the backup folder for the latest backup file (*.json) It will be stamped with the current date +30 days
5.Move back the date to the current one.
6.Open Mozilla, then close it.
7.Check the backup folder and you will notice that no new backups are being made.
Actual Results:  
Backups of bookmarks stop working

Expected Results:  
Backup of bookmarks should work

The software has to be able to always make backups.  Probably, the software will have to label the backups differently to distinguish them from the rest.
