Mozilla: courier > monospacer; IE 6.0: monospace > courier

When "font-family:courier" is specified in the style, it seems that Mozilla 
displays the text in courier font with the point size specified for serifs. This
results in big text, since courier 10 is bigger than times 10. When font-family
is "monospace" Mozilla honors monospace font size specified in options, and the
text looks fine.

IE has different behavior. When font family is "courier", it tries to find point
size, such that actual character height more or less matches that of serifs.
When font family is "monospace", it displays the text in courier font with the
reguilar point size, resulting in huge text.

This makes problematic writing a page with courier that looks good in both IE
and Mozilla. If I set font family "monospace", text is OK in Mozilla, but big in
IE. If I set family "courier", text is OK in IE, but huge in Mozilla.

If "courier" was treated the same as monospace, I could just set font faily to
"courier" and leave it alone.
