There's something wrong with how the layouts are appearing on many websites. Most of the time it shows up in the form of large horizontal gaps between lines or paragraphs in the text. It also happens a lot when there's a username and password requested. It's happening all over Mozilla's own site too. Sometimes it spaces things weirdly so that sections of text are too close and overlap each other instead.
This used to happen in Safari if we were running Safari and InDesign at the same time. It began with the first update to Fifefox 3 (last week?). I figured you'd fix it soon, but just got the new update and it's still a problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
These are all website that used to show up the right way and ever since the upgrade they have problems.
1.http://www.steepandcheap.com/ loads of space under "current deal" and 3 times repeat of the ad in the light gray rectangle just under that.
2. http://www.gambianbecky.blogspot.com/ huge spaces between the title words on the left, and between the photos and their captions
3.On this very site, to the left of this box "Steps to" is on one line and about 2 inches below it "Reproduce" appears, way lower than this box.
Actual Results:  
Each website layout appears wrong

Expected Results:  
I expect the gaps to be much smaller. "Expected Results" should appear to be one heading, but right beside this box is the word "Expected" and an inch below the box is the word "Results"

Right now I have Finder, Dashoboard, Firefox, Entourage, Photoshop, Bridge, Suitcase Fusion (which manages fonts), Spark, Excel, Entourage Reminders, Preview and Word all open and running.
