Back button does not work along edge of screen (would like to see Fitts Law applied when on left most edge of the toolbars)

I'm using the current nightly build and noticed that the back button behavior is different than in all previous versions of Firefox (from 1.0 until 3.6.3)

With a maximized window, the back button should be click-able from the extreme left edge of the screen, next to the button. This is to take advantage of Fitts's law. This is how it works in all previous Firefox versions (and most other browsers), and I consider it a bug in the current nightly version. This report is just to ensure awareness, I realize there are hundreds of more pressing issues at the moment.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Maximize window
2. Make sure the back button is active (ie, there's a previous page to go to)
3. Click with mouse directly against the left edge of the screen, at the same vertical position as the back button
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
The back button should be activated the same as if I clicked directly on it.
