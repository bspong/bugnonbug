Polish about:sessionrestore
Here are a few polish changes to the about:sessionrestore page:

1) Use native checkbox widgets in the restore column (might need to file a separate widget bug to get this working).

2) Instead of using a folder icon for each window, use a generic window icon, which you might need to copy over to toolkit

I'll need to get you window icons for OS X and Linux (basically take the Tango new window icon and remove the star)

3) Update the text of the window

Since there is a large question icon, the title should ask a question

Would You Like to Restore Your Session?

------------------------------------
We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. You can restore the tabs and windows from your previous session, or start a new session if they are no longer needed. 
------------------------------------
If Minefield closes repeatedly:
   * Try disabling any recently added extensions in the Add-ons Manager.
   * Try restoring your session without any Web pages you suspect might be causing the problem.

4) remove the line "uncheck the tabs that you don't want to restore" this should be apparent from the interface.
