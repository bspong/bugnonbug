I'm very sorry if this is the wrong area to post this, but I've given up trying to find the appropriate place!

Starting about 10 days ago when forwarding emails with images, the images did not go through.  There was only an empty box with the red “x” on the recipients end.  Sometimes in my "sent" box the email would show an empty box with what looked like a piece of paper torn in half in the upper left corner and other times it had the red "x".  Right clicking on the red “x” (either in my sent box or by the recipient) and on “show picture” did not open the picture.  This happened when using Firefox and Explorer.  I was able to forward emails containing images using Outlook, and was able to send photos using Yahoo email.   Our son was able to forward emails with images using his Yahoo account on my computer.   I’m sure it was not the source or form of the images, because my husband could forward the same emails/images received from the same people I received them from using Yahoo on his computer.  I was thinking it was a hang up with my browser software, but since it happened with both browsers I was thinking it had to be in the computer programming or whatever.  Obviously I'm not very computer literate!  I don't remember changing any settings, etc. before this started.   I contacted Yahoo, Firefox and Kaspersky, my virus program, with no success, and posted on various help sites, but did not received any answers that helped.  Most just said to hold the "ctrl" key while clicking on forward, which only worked once.
 
Yesterday I decided to try again to forward an email with images thinking maybe whatever had started the problem had stopped as suddenly.  I had saved a couple of emails containing pictures in my drafts folder to send when the problem was solved.  When I opened my drafts folder I noticed a couple of emails from Pet Wellbeing, a site I had ordered a product from.  I had kept the emails so I would have all of the information in case I wanted to order again.  At this point I knew I was not going to reorder, so I clicked on the first Pet Wellbeing email to delete it.  Immediately my “My Pictures” (in “My Documents”) opened.  I thought, “I wonder how I did that,” but didn’t think anything else about it.  I closed the pictures and deleted the email.  When I clicked on the second Pet Wellbeing email to delete it, the same thing happened with the pictures!  I again closed it and deleted the email.  Immediately after this I was able to send emails containing images!  All I can think is that Pet Wellbeing has something in their emails that is somehow overriding Yahoo’s, Kaspersky’s and Firefox’s programming or something!  I thought this might be of interest to you in case this problem happens to someone else in the future.



Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
I'm guessing saving another Pet Wellbeing email to my drafts would reporduce the problem, but I'm not going to do that!  From now on their emails will be going to spam!

Expected Results:  
I didn't try again.
