Duplicate Software Update windows show if the first isn't responded to
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When a "large" Software Update window appears prompting an update to the next version, if that window isn't responded to in a while, additional Software Update windows can continue to appear.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Wait for a large "Software Update" window to appear.
2. Don't do anything to dismiss it and continue waiting.
3. Eventually another "Software Update" window will appear with the same contents.
Actual Results:  
Multiple Software Update windows with identical information appear.

Expected Results:  
Only one Software Update window shows at a time, and additional ones don't appear as long as the one window is still there.

I've had this happen to me on at least 3 occasions, but by its nature of having to wait, it's difficult to reproduce this at will. (Are there about:config settings that can reduce the time to wait so this can be reproduced easier?)
