Eliminate "Switch to tab" implementation

The switch to tab option is gold plating.

It originated with a number of proposals back in 2008 (see [1], [2], and [3] for example), which eventually culminated on a requirement [4] the implementation of which is documented as bug 480350 [5].

It could be debated whether the implementation fulfils the requirement, notably as the non-goals seem to have been achieved (in particular #1: "[Do not] Promote tab searching over other types of revisitation")

Its value, if any, has not been demonstrated by any known usability tests. On the other hand, as currently implemented, it is documented that this requirement has caused a great deal of dissatisfaction to many users. See [6] for a representative example, or peruse Google's "switch to tab" results.

In addition to the usability problems it is causing (most of which are well documented in [6]), it has triggered a number of other bugs: see [7], [8], [9], [10] for a non-exhaustive list of examples. All this costs additional time, money, and effort to fix, and they're all detrimental to the user's positive perception of the product.

The requirement in [4], if deemed desirable (i.e., justified by user demand) could probably be implemented as an extension, which would:
 * reduce bloat in the core
 * free core developer resources
 * target this feature to the users who actually want it
 * allow competing implementations to exist, for a survival of the fittest and/or for varying use cases or user likes/dislikes.

   Of course, in the event that changes to Firefox itself are required in order to allow implementation as an extension, those could and should be made.

   In summary, scratching the current implementation would eliminate the known instances of user dissatisfaction and should contribute to reducing the number of open bugs, while opening the door for an extension-based mechanism to be used to fulfil the requirement as per [4]. It is my belief that this would cure the disease rather than what appears to be the current approach of treating the symptoms. While it is unfortunate that some of the time and effort invested in this feature would be gone to waste, the original premise of Firefox (Phoenix) when it was spun off the Mozilla project was to have a lean alternative to the piece of bloatware that Netscape had become. That fundamental goal should be kept in mind at all times.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a URL (e.g., http://google.com/)
2. Open a new tab or window (e.g., Ctrl+T or Ctrl+N)
3. Set focus on location bar and start typing the same URL as before (e.g., "google.com")

Actual Results:  
Autocompletion shows the previously used URL. On selecting it and pressing ENTER, the user is taken to another tab.

Expected Results:  
Autocompletion shows the previously used URL. On selecting it and pressing ENTER, the selected URL is loaded in the current window and tab.
