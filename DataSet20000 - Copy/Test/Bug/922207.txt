Find out why UX branch regressed when bug 918613 landed
Looking at Datazilla this morning, I see a slight up-tick on several Windows XP TART subtests - specifically:

icon-open-DPI1.all.TART went from an average of 2.39 to 2.59
icon-open-DPI1.half.TART went from an average of 2.04 to 2.19
iconFade-open-DPI2.all.TART went from an average of 2.27 to 2.44
iconFade-open-DPI2.half.TART went from an average of 2.43 to 2.59
newtab-open-preload-no.all.TART went from an average of 2.97 to 3.09
newtab-open-preload-no.half.TART went from an average of 2.13 to 2.26
newtab-open-preload-yes.all.TART went from an average of 2.50 to 2.63
newtab-open-preload-yes.half.TART went from an average of 2.13 to 2.26
simple-open-DPI1.all.TART went from an average of 2.32 to 2.49
simple-open-DPI1.half.TART went from an average of 2.03 to 2.18

The spike is more obvious when looking at Datazilla graphs:

https://datazilla.mozilla.org/?start=1377082034&stop=1380560215&product=Firefox&repository=Firefox-Non-PGO&os=win&os_version=5.1.2600&test=tart&compare_product=Firefox&compare_repository=UX-Non-PGO&project=talos

Here are the changesets in that range:

I'm immediately suspicious of:

3287d7bbdc14	Bas Schouten — Bug 918613: Convert cairo path code to use cairo_path_t. r=jrmuizel

Which just landed to fix bug 919656 (among other things).  I've pushed a patch to try that backs this out, and we'll see if these numbers go back down.
