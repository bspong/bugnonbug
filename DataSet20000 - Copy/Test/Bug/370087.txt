Every single site or search, including a Google search for Mozilla, comes up with Server not found. Upon a second try, it will work.  Also, was working in my online billpay and went from the first secure and locked page, to the next page within the site to go to the billpay section, and it came up server not found, and suddenly, while still in the site, it was no longer secure and no longer locked.  This is happening on both mine and my husbands' computers. I have checked Zone Alarm and put the green check as instructed, but for 2.0.0.1 it is listed as Firefox Installer in the list by the check, and as Firefox at the bottom. Don't know if this helps. Very concerning that Firefox can unlock a secure bank site with an error.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to go to any website, or perform any search.
2. Server not found error will appear
3. Try again, you will connect (on a locked site, you will now be unlocked and no longer secure)
Actual Results:  
See above.

Expected Results:  
See above.

Firefox should take you to the requested site or search on the first try.  This problem has only been encountered since downloading the new version 2.0.0.1
