Theming issues with the start / stop recording buttons on Linux
Created attachment 8603819
performance-theme-issues-dark-theme.mp4

STR:
1. Have a Linux system.
2. Have a Linux build with fx-team rev 6c0788228680 in it (links at the end).
3. Open performance tools.
4. Start and stop recordings with both UI buttons and console.profile.
5. Switch themes and do #4 again.

Expected results: The buttons should look like in attachment 8603680 of bug 1082695.

Actual results:
* Light theme: the 'Stop recording' button text is white and the background is light gray making the text hard to read especially if the cursor is over the button.
* Dark theme:
  - 'Start recording' text is dark gray against theme default background.
  - 'Start recording' background turns to light gray when hovered.
  - 'Stop recording' button is light gray with white text.

See the attached screencasts for better illustration about the issues.
