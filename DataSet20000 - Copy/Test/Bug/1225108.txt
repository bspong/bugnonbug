Introduce a special addon to ease working on devtools from Firefox
We revived devtools.loader.srcdir and Loader.jsm recently.
It allows to hot-reload a bunch of devtools resources, but not all.
Also, it is very specific to devtools and this workflow can't be applied to any other Firefox resources.

The big file moved :jryans did alllows us to simplify hot-reload feature by using an addon instead. We wouldn't bundled devtools as an addon.
Instead we would just register xul content, skin and locales via an addon chrome.manifest. There wouldn't be any magic done in Loader.jsm.
The addon is going to remap all root URL used by devtools to a local mozilla-central checkout transparently.
This would have the benefit to not introduce a different codepath/loader/whatever between running firefox from a local checkout versus released package.

The contribution workflow is done to be:
 * Install a Firefox Nightly
 * checkout mozilla-central with the same revision used to build this Nightly
 * Register the addon (that lives in m-c checkout) via Firefox UI, bug 1221141
 * Play with devtools
 * Hit a keystroke (CTRL+ALT+R?) to hot-reload devtools
 * Play with devtools with sources being hot-reloaded

 * If you reload firefox, devtools are automatically going to be using local checkout sources.
 * If you want to stop mapping to local sources, disable the addon.
