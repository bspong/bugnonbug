Can't upload pictures nor update blog in Firefox 3 for blogger, picasa, photoshop express, or flickr
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404 Firefox/2.0.0.14
Build Identifier: Firefox/3 (beta)

I've been having trouble uploading files and updating online files while using the beta of Firefox 3.  When I try to create/update a blogger entry, the bar at the bottom says "javascript:void(0)" for a while, then opens a blank pages.  Changes are never saved.  When I try to upload pix to blogger, picasa, photoshop express, and flickr, I initially got a few through with mostly errors--then I got none through at all.  All websites work normally & upload properly if I use (gack) Internet Explorer.  I've since uninstalled Firefox 3 and reinstalled Firefox 2 instead, and everything so far is working fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.make changes/specify files to be uploaded
2.click the upload/publish button
3.get error message or blank screen.  Error messages are never very informative.  Just say "upload failed" or similar.  Photoshop expres just shows a yellow triangle with an "!" inside of it.
Actual Results:  
Uploads fail/no changes are made to blog entry.

Expected Results:  
Should have uploaded my pictures or saved a new/revised version of my blog entry.

I'm running Vista and AVG virus protection.  My security settings were as permissible as possible--accept all cookies, java, and javascript.  IExplorer and Firefox2 performed the same functions without problems.
