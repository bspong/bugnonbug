I use multiple tabs a lot and I notice that if 2 or 3 of them have java on them that after I have viewed them and closed them that the total CPU usage of Firefox has increased by just about double. Also, after I have closed the java tabs the Firefox software slows way down and doesn't fill in the address associated with the tab. 
It is getting problematic as after veiwing my 'weather' tabs I have to restart Firefox in order for it to work properly for the rest of my viewing.
It does seem that this problem became worse after I had updated java to the latest version.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open several tabs that are assoicated with javascript
2.check on task manager how much CPU is being used both before and after
3.time the response time after task 1.

Actual Results:  
firfox slowed way down and/or quit running altogether to the point that i would have to restart

Expected Results:  
removed all of the javascript out of the memory
