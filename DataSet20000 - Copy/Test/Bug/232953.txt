Strange behaviour with query strings and PHP header location commands

Developing a shopping cart, and my basket script, I notice the following bug,
which is not present in Mozilla 1.6 or IE. The basket script uses a query string
to add a product to the basket, in order to prevent multiple items being added
when using browser forward/back buttons, I add a header("Location:....") command
to my php code. This directs back to the same basket page without the query
string. However, when pressing refresh or using the forward/back buttons, the
page still processes the now non-existant query string.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a PHP page with an incremental count based on a query string.
2. Add a header() location command back to the same page after processing the
script.
3. Link to the page with a query string, which in turn processes the query
string, then reloads the page without the query string. Refresh the page.

Actual Results:  
Firebird still processes a non-existant query string.

Expected Results:  
Pressing F5 should refresh the page without the query string and thus have no
affect on the increment.
