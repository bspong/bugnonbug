User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:36.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/36.0
Build ID: 20150222232811

Steps to reproduce:

In a clean Firefox 36 stable profile:
- install Greasemonkey addon v2.3 (without any userscripts) and restart FF
- launch the Performance tool (shift+F5 or via the hamburger button|Developer)
- press the Record button (either of the two available) to start recording a  new profile 
- open any page, eg http://www.greasespot.net/
- after the page has loaded press Record button again in order to stop the recording.


Actual results:

The Performance tool displays "Loading..." 
(note that the text "Loading..." has a momentary display glitch then)
and hangs at "Loading...",
the recorded profile is not displayed, 
and clicking again on the Record button doesn't fix the problem.
(see the attached video)

Disabling Greasemonkey and restarting Firefox fixes the problem.


Expected results:

Clicking on the Record button 
should make the recording stop.
Then, the recorded profile should be opened 
and the Record button should be available again.
