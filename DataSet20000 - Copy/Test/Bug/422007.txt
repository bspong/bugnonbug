Weird Drop-Down menus size/borders

AFAIK this did NOT happen with Firefox 3b3. The drop down menus (like "Default font" or "Size" under Options > Content > Fonts & Colors or in on-line forms) have strange dimensions/borders. It is already obvious when using Windows' default (Luna) theme but it is ESPECIALLY obvious when using a more complex non-official windows theme (like in my case "corona" or MSN6i) where when unselected they were twice as thick and when selected the fonts would get partially hidden...)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Firefox 3B4 (or in my case, upgrade from 3b3)
2.(Optional) Use a non-standard and more complex Windows theme (in my case corona)
3.Just observe a drop-down menu in Firefox 3b4 like in this very form the "Reproducibility" above



I tried this using the default Firefox 3 theme.

The themes I tested it with in Windows XP were "Corona" and "MSN6i".
Please contact me if you need to send you or for the method of uploading one of the above themes for testing.
