Started a new FF session and got a notice of updates.  My FF auto updates are turned off (verified!).  Notice said that some add ons were incompatible with 3.6.  But they had been previously installed and working.  Plus, some add ons  disappeared completely.  NoScript, Ad Block Plus, Cookie Culler were just gone.  Others were marked incompatible.  I reinstalled the missing ones, and they worked fine.  Even found existing options settings.  Never happened before.  Hasn't recurred.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I did nothing to cause it.  That I know of, of course.  But I had been away from the computer for hours and had just returned.  Played Bookworm for a while,  but it was closed.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Retarted FF many times, but did not recur.  I know that not being able to reproduce the problem makes it tough to figure out.  But I report this as a straw in the wind.  My first ever FF bug report, BTW.


I assumed that there could be a malware issue here, but I ran a Malwarebytes full scan and it reported nothing.  I also have Norton installed.  FF and its add ons have always worked beautifully and seamlessly before.  This was bizarre.  I had made no changes to FF in recent days.
