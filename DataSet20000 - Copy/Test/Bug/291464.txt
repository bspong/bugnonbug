New Tab (Ctrl-T) shortcut fails to work

Since 1.0.1 I have seen the default ctrl-T keyboard shortcut stop working most
of the time. Sometimes opening a tab via the file | new menu will cause it to
suddenly start working, but generally it does not.

I have experienced this problem on two separate pcs running windows xp, one of
them brand new with a fresh windows installation.

My best solution has been to use the keyboard shortcut extension to remap new
tab to ctrl-Q, which seems to always work.

I have tried reinstalling firefox, downgrading, removing the profile folder and
more. Nothing has been successful in restoring the functionality.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Stopped working shortly after installation of 1.0.1 on both PCs, but no obvious
pattern to reproduce



I have to expect this might be some kind of conflict outside of firefox since no
one else seems to have this problem and remapping to control-Q works. When I
first installed on the new PC, the only common denominator between the two
systems I can think of was MS Visual Studio .NET 2003. Of course the problem
happens whether or not VS is running or not, though. I can't uninstall it to
test because I need it, and I am hardly the only person using it and firefox.
