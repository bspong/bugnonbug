This is not really a bug. But a cool suggestion. 
Code that will synthesize a web page for the user. 
It will let a user embed a java routine or other code into the code downloaded from a web page.  SO th euser can customize other peoples web page. 

So for example you open a page at microsoft, you can configure the browser to insert a java frowning face every time you load that page. 

Also great to insert gadgets, stock charts, etc.
