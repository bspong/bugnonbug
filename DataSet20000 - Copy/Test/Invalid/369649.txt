The installation of CSS is kind of 'only the half way' - compare URL in Opera and IE
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

If you compare the (second) page within different browsers, you will discover that the page view of - Sorry! - IE is the best one, the Opera view is between IE and Firefox and the page viewed in Firefox really looks not very well. 
Didn't you state the full integration of CSS 2.0? Well, it seems not to work as it should work.

Reproducible: Always

E. g. you will see big CSS-buttons where you should see small ones.

A nice page view like that one in IE. (Sorry again!)
