Sort out menu behavior for menuless windows in cocoa builds
Mac menubar, always painful.

Here's the current state for XP-menuless windows in cocoa builds:

  1. In windows which are overlaid by macBrowserOvelay (e.g. the download manager), the menus work the same as in carbon builds.
  2. In windows which are not overlaid, we're failing back to the menubar of the  hidden window, this is a significant improvement over the carbon-widget situation (the menus of the last-window-with-menus are shown, and do not work at all).
  3. Since the "Close", "Minimize" and "Zoom" commands are disabled in the hidden window (for obvious reasons), they're also disabled in menuless windows.
  
What i think we should do is:
  1. Get rid of the various overlays which apply macBrowserOverlay to menuless windows
  2. Enable the Close, Minimize and Zoom commands.
  3. Make them work against the active window using nsIWindowWatcher (Though zooming the hidden window is probably useful ;)).
  4. Figure out whether we can disable them for the hidden window only, low priority for now.
