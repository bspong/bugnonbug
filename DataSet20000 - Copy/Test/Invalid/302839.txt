Whenever i'm entering a internet page, a message appears that the page is not
found, or it's not there... but if i click ok and enter the same page i get in,
usually this message pops up about 3-4 times before i get in to the page...

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open internet explorer
2.Enter www.google.com
3.Search for something, and press some of the links that comes up, if the
problem doesent appear the first time, try another link

Actual Results:  
The ''Alert'' message pops up and tells me that i cant enter the page, i ignore
the message and press the same link and after a few try's it works.

Expected Results:  
I should have been able to enter the page without problems
