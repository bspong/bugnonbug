pc randomly reboots, whether firefox runs or not... stops when firefox uninstalled!
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Latest build on website

The pc was randomly rebooting when firefox was running, sometimes every 5-10 
minutes, and also AT THE LOGON PROMPT! Nothing ever showed in the event log, 
and no errors came up. Just a sudden reboot. happened during use AND if left 
alone.

I tried everything I could think of to troubleshoot and eventually someone non-
technical pinpointed it by uninstalling firefox. No more reboots.

Windows is xp sp1 + all latest updates. Think it was an incompatability with 
the build of image EDS use on their pcs in work.

Thought it might be of some interest to you, I;ve never seen this before with 
a browser. Firefox works perfectly on my home pc.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.use pc,
2.dont' use pc,
3.it happens at random.

It's only happened this time on this build so obviously it's not wide-user 
critical, but it may be of use to you.
