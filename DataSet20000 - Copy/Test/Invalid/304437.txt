o s wont shutdown. requires removal of new firefox download upgrade
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; AOL 9.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: mozilla ver 1.0.6

old version worked great. new version was downloaded yesterday while online as 
requested for the upgrade. new version would not load the web page, asks for 
start.mozilla.org. anyhow after not loading, i cant shut down my computer, 
unless i remove the entire mozilla and all components. i tried to re-download 
and reinstall 5-6 times with the same results. is there a way to get the old 
version back until the new version gets fixed?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.download the new version by going to mozilla site and following the download 
instr.
2.follow install procedure, and error messages pop up about firefox exe still 
running even though they are not.
then closing out of the program and loading the page thru the mozilla firefox 
icon on my screen.

the page seeks start.mozilla.org and never loads. i have tried to go to that 
page thru another browser and nothing comes up.
3.

Actual Results:  
my computer works fine but will not shut down unless i remove the new download 
and all the mozilla file on the computer.

Expected Results:  
operated properly
