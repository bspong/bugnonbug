Bitdefender Antiphishing Toolbar causing problems with Firefox 3.6
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6

With Bitdefender Antiphishing Toolbar installed,
1. Opening a new tab
2. Hitting enter after changing an address in the address bar
3. Hitting the X button (to stop loading the page)
results in a few seconds crash, after which Firefox functions normally, until you do one of the 3 things given above. This only started happening after I installed Firefox 3.6. It was fine when I had Firefox 3.5.7. I will report the problem to the Bitdefender team as well. I have tried disabling every add-on till I got to this one.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Bitdefender Total Security 2010 Trail
2. Try switching tabs in Firefox
Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes for a few seconds every time

Expected Results:  
Not crashed.
