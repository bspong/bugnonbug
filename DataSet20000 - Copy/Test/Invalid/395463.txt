Authentication prompt is displayed in an endless cycle
Strange problem when trying to access Google services such as gmail and docs using the latest nightly.

1. Ensure you are logged out of google services
2. My u/p are stored in the password manager and selecting from the dropdown list fills in the dialog appearing on https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?continue=http%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2F&followup=http%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2F&service=writely&nui=1&ltmpl=homepage.
3. Click Sign In
4. Expected behavior is that you get logged onto the service, instead I'm reprompted with the same page but this time with the username field set by Google as text (not a field) and the password field is blank
5. Retype my password correctly and click "Sign In"
6. I get into an endless loop with no error messages from Google about problems with my login - returned to the same form with the password blanked out.

This occurs with my existing Minefield profile that had saved passwords.

Trying this on a clean profile does not exhibit this problem.

Another data point: If I quit Minefield and restart, it recognizes that I have a saved session (with Google docs as one of my tabs) and logs me in properly and restores the session.
