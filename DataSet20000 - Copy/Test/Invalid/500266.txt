Options not carried over on install

Many options from my last version of FireFox were not carried over on the upgrade to 3.5 RC. Such items as default applications, default download directory, "always do" options on downloads. 

Also missing are many of my "remember" fields on login/forms fields (when pressing the down key, the list is missing or incomplete, having some but not other strings available). Others have the wrong saved items 

Not a major bug, but a rather annoying inconvenience. 

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Uninstall FireFox 3.5RC, and all other left over Mozilla/FireFox items
2.Install an earlier version of FireFox, configure options and form entries. 
3. Upgrade to 3.5RC
Actual Results:  
As stated above, options and configuration settings are incorrect on upgrade. Forms are missing saved data strings, or have incorrect strings. 

Expected Results:  
Options should have remained the same as the last version, string data should not have been deleted or jumbled. 

Same problem on:
Vista x64 ultimate, 
Vista x32 Ultimate
Vista x64 Home Premium
XP Pro X64 
Linux (debian) install using windows version with Wine. 

Also of note, the jumbled saved strings for field input may be a security issue as if I select one screen name from the saved list and it gives a password used for that screen name on another site rather than the correct saved one (cant tell with the little dots, until it fails), I'm giving away passwords to the wrong people.
