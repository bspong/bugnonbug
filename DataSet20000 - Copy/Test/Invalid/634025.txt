A "<div> with text" is shown over the next "<div> with table", so the webpage is unreadable

I have the files to show that bug. Where do I have to upload them?

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
There is text written in the webpage which is just over a text field, so it's not possible to fill it

Expected Results:  
The text would be up and the text field down

Firefox 3.6.13, Windows XP
