There are some rare instances in which Firefox 2.0 for Mac will not render some url links on some pages.  Two websites that have exhibited this behaviour are theregister.co.uk and google.com.   Looking at the HTML, it's impossible to identify under what conditions this bug manifests itself, since there's no visible differences in the <a href> tags.    I don't know how to attach a screenshot to this bug report.  Please view the following URL in both Firefox and Safari:

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=wmp+plugin+mac&btnG=Search

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=wmp+plugin+mac&btnG=Search  (example URL)

Actual Results:  
The URL links for the first two search results are completely missing, including the underlined link and the text of the link itself.

Expected Results:  
Both links should be visible and enabled.
