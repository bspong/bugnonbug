Search bar drag and drop should apply to the search button only (and not the text field)

Currently, dragging and dropping text to the search bar's text area will immediately search the text dropped there using the selected search engine.  IMHO, dragging and dropping text onto the search button (magnifying glass) should initiate a search for the text dropped there, but dragging text to the search bar's text area should just display the text there.

This applies for Bon Echo and Minefield, but not for older versions as there is no "search button".

Reproducible: Always
