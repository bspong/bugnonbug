Change Firefox version scheme to indicate build date to facilitate rapid release cycle
Mozilla Firefox as it is switching to the rapid release cycle will face the confusion of version numbers incrementing rapidly.  Bug 679141 suggested removing references of the version completely from the about window.  I think that a compromise idea would be for the version field to be replaced by simply saying the build date and platform (32 bit, 64 bit, Windows, Linux, Mac, etc.) if using a final release.  The nightly, beta, and aurora channels would also show this information along with some type of message that a tester would be able to determine which release target to file bug reports against, as there could be the possibility of confusion if a tester wasn't aware of merging of channels on the roadmap.
