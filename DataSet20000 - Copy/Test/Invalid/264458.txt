Hey there all Firefox users! if you keep up with the times, you now have a
gaping security hole in your system, why, don't know, but according to
mconner@stelgryphon.com:
"Just because a feature exists at some point does not mean we are under any
obligation to you or anyone to continue to support that feature."
See Bug 264297 if it has not been censored from the system

    Firefox *used* (since as far back as I remember) have a provision to allow
you to allow all cookies/BUT ASK FIRST. For no sane reason, this was hacked out
of the code. Apoparently taking them to task for allowing al of us to be
cookie-raped is, m@sg.c says a "bogus issue"
     New Version allows user to allow any and all cookies, then, after a session
of doubleclicks, et. al. decide whether s/he wishes to allow those cookies to
remain on the system. HOW NICE.

        Yeh, I was rude - 'cause I cannot cut code, and have NO WAY of undoing
the damage you did for NO REASON to a fine program/feature.



     It is a security hole 10 feet wide and should be closed ASAP!

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.install current version of Firefox
2.Expect that basic security features being transferred include basic security
features there since Phoenix days
3.Find yourself with 120 unwanted cookies, tracing you all over the place
Actual Results:  
Old cookie system: Accept All Cookies, but ASK FIRST
New one: Accept all cookies and ask after the fact

Expected Results:  
Been left unchanged! Instead, send angry user a note reading in part:"Just
because a feature exists at some point does not mean we are under any
obligation to you or anyone to continue to support that feature" instead of
restoring the code. Reads like the Gates letter about "stealing" the version of
BASIC ha stole himself - neet - huh? How many users have now been dblclicked by
this unannounced new "improvement"
