I couldn't find the right place to report problems with MineField so I will
just post them here(FireFox Bugs). The 'bug' that I found is to do with the
'throbber' tool/button. It doesn't work! Nothing happens when I press it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Click the throbber tool in the top right corner of the screen. Just under
the X (close/exit) button.
Actual Results:  
Nothing!

Expected Results:  
It should of gone to a website!
