When I  start a private mode after taking some pages in general mode.
I close the private mode using mouse.
The general mode is also closed. 
My general mode pages are restored on firefox restart but All form fields data entered  are lost



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start in general mode . Fill forms data in some fields
2.Start Private mode (Cntrl+Shift+P)
3.Close private mode using mouse (not using Cntrl+Shift+P )

Actual Results:  
The general  mode pages from which I have opened the private mode are closed.
Also I tried these using separate Firefox windows. That case also the parent page gets reloaded

Expected Results:  
The parent window from which I started the private mode should not be closed.
And if not closed , should not be reloaded
