access violation when I use javascript after about:config (access to local content)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; pt-BR; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

When I add a bookmark such as "javascript:void(location.href='file:///c:/');" I
can`t show the contents of the folder C:/ because a security error by Firefox.
It`s OK. However, if I execute the same bookmark after the option "about:config"
all the content of the folder C:/ (folders and files) was showed!! I didn`t
change any enviromments variables!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.In option manage bookmark, add a new bookmark called "home" with the following
address: javascript:void(location.href='file:///c:/');
2.In the browser location I put the address: about:config and clicked go
3.I clicked in my bookmark "home"

Actual Results:  
All the files and folders in my computer (C:/) were showed on the browser,
unlike the default behaviour of the Firefox which it doesn`t show that content.

Expected Results:  
Not show any content, like it happens if the option about:config it doesn`t used
before the bookmark.
