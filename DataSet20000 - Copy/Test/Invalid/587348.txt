The Rhapsody music service plays its tunes in the Flash player.  FF 3.6.8 seemed stable, but Firefox 4 Beta 2 and 3 both hang ("beachball") easily in this use scenario if the player is allowed to play for perhaps 30 minutes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit rhapsody.com
2. search for an artist, say "supertramp."  Load up a couple albums in the player's queue.
3. Listen and wait.  The player will stop playing after some time, and will become unresponsive.  The dreaded beachball will appear over firefox.
Actual Results:  
Hung (unresponsive) browser.  Firefox does sometimes recover if you can close the rhapsody player's window and wait for a while -- 10 minutes perhaps.

Expected Results:  
It's hard to say whether it's flash or firefox hanging -- if not both.  I'd expect firefox to remain responsive even if some plugin gets itself into trouble.

I believe Flash dies -- I see it in Safari in this scenario, too.  In fact, when I installed the latest Flash player the Adobe installer first complained about two "flash containers" being open even though no browsers were open.  This told me Flash had at some point been spawned but hadn't been able to close gracefully.

Still, Firefox should not (now) be taken down by that.
