Since I upgraded to Ubuntu 8.10 my entire machine randomly crashes several times a day. Normally it is when I am accessing something via Firefox.  If Firefox is not open then it does not seem to crash.

Looking in the messages file just before the restart there is normally a Firefox segfault here are a few examples:

and so on.

There was nothing specific I was doing at the time.  Sometime I had just clicked on a link, sometimes it was a few seconds as I was loading a page, sometimes Firefox was just open and I was not accessing it.

Is there any other 'debugging' info source I can look at?

It is very annoying as often I have other applications open and I lose unsaved data.



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
See above, start firefox, use it for a while, it crashes.
