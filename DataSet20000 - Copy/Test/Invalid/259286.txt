Popup blocker still blocks popups when it's switched off; also blocks Flash popups.

Turning the popup blocker off completly causes it to still block popups.

Also, Popups opened from within a Flash site with this actionScript command:

getURL("javascript:window.open('url', 'window', 'options')"); 

as my sample page demonstrates (click the blue button) fails most of the time,
even if you turn off popup blocking or allow the domain.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://www.intellifolios.com/login/test.html
2. Click the blue button.
3. If the popup opens the first time, close it, and click it again.

Actual Results:  
The popup fails to open.

Expected Results:  
The popup should open.
