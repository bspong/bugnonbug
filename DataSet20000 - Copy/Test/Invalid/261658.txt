middle mouse click to open new window feature (like the regular mozilla)

Please bring this feature back to Firefox.
(I believe it was still in some earlier versions of phoenix or firefird)

With Mozilla 1.6x 1.7x etc. you can click the middle mouse button
and open a new browser window.

Tabs are nice but I would like the option to set the middle mouse button to open
a whole new browser window instead.

I'm aware that you can do this (with 2 steps) using the right click, and select
"Open Link in New Window",

but I miss middle-clicking a link to get a new browser window.

Is there a way to configure this now with Firefox?
(I haven't been able to find it)

thanks
