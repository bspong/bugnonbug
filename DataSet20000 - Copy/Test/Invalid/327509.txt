Make Places an option for Homepage
Trying out the new builds, I find that I like to have Places be my start-up page. In the preferences, a button could be added to make it easy.

Otherwise I have to be smart enough to have a chrome URL be my homepage URL, and most users probably don't know what chrome is.

Finally, the user should be able to choose what part of Places should be that startup (ie Bookmarks, etc).

P.S. (Separate issue) Is chrome://browser/content/places/places.xul ever going to be masked in the URL bar? Instead of the alien (to users) chrome URL, maybe just say "Places"?
