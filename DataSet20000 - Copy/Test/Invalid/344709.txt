Shortcuts to open places popup should close places popup
Right now while you can open the places popup with either ctrl-h, or ctrl-b (well bug filed on that one anyways).  The places popup doesn't close after reentering that command.  Neither does escape work to close the popup.  As of right now the only way I've found to close the window is to click on the icon again.
