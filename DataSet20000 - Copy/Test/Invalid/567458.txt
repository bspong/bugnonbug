Firefox shouldn't restore tabs after a freeze

I had Firefox freeze on me while using the Download Statusbar add-on to download a file. So, I killed off Firefox using the task manager. But this isn't about the freeze, it's about the restart behavior.

When I restarted Firefox, it did not load my homepage as it was set to do in the options. It loaded all the tabs I had open when it froze. This is a bad behavior. What if one of those tabbed pages caused the crash? You could never navigate away without a total re-install.





Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open multiple tabs that are not any pages you load at start up
2. Download a large file with Download Statusbar installed
3. Open task manager, and attempt to kill Firefox while your downloaded file is being copied from the temp area to where your downloads get placed.
4. Launch Firefox again.
Actual Results:  
Firefox reloads all the tabbed pages that were open when I killed it.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should load whatever pages I have set via Tools -> Options -> General -> Startup -> When Firefox Starts
