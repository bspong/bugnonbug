The example page sets the style.display for a <TBODY> section in the middle of a table to 'none' then 'block'. First, the middle section is hidden (as expected), leaving just the top and bottom rows. Then the middle section is redrawn below the bottom of the table, with all column widths being ignored (whether set using CSS or with width="" attributes).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See example page: click and click again on the 'Hide/unhide TBODY' button.
Actual Results:  
TBODY section is redrawn incorrectly.

Expected Results:  
TBODY should be redrawn exactly as defined, i.e. as before it is hidden.
