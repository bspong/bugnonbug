This is really annoying... I have noticed it from 1.0.4 but didn't know why this
sometimes happened... but when I hold the shift key on the keyboard and right
click on any the text 2 times the text erases and doesn't come back.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Hold Shift key
2.Double text on webpage or form or images
3.Try to highlight the text,form, or image

Actual Results:  
The Text disappears for good, or until refreshed.

Expected Results:  
highlight the whole text..

This is deadly because it can blank out text images and forms..... though nice
trick to rid of images lol.
