There have been 2 separate threads on whether Cmd-W should close the single-tab window.

bug# 436664 implies "yes, it should". This is the FF2 behavior.
bug# 435614 says "no, it should not", but the bug is in the Unconfirmed state for some reason and unfortunately seems to be fixed.

Other software to compare behavior with:
10.5.3 Terminal (at least when the default UI language is En-US, there are known issues for other languages): Cmd-W closes a one-tab window.
Safari 3.1 on 10.5.3: Cmd-W closes a one-tab window

Results of internal vote: 
2 out of 3 Mac developers familiar with Mac OS X human interface guidelines vote for "Cmd-W should close a one-tab window"
1 out of 3: "Cmd-W should close a one-tab window given that there is no Undo for the New Tab command"
