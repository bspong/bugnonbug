When I change my settings to add clearing my cache and browsing history, then want to "Clear Now", only the OK button and half of the CANCEL button show in the box.  I usually have my normal Firefox pages zoomed for my poor vision.  I hope this helps.  This is my first attempt at reporting a problem and I couldn't find this bug in any of the lists. I'm not familiar with the programming language. Thank you.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on Tools, Options, Privacy Tab, Clear History when Firefox Closes, Settings, (Settings for clearing history box appears and right half can't be seen. There is no border adjustment handle.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
It is possible to tab through the boxes, but when it gets to the area that isn't visible, you can't tell what menu the selector is on.

Expected Results:  
Unable to clear only certain items without changes entire settings.  The CLEAR NOW function button is not visible because it is outside dialog box.  Adding border resize handle should correct this. :-)

Menu box should have shown all options in box or allowed user to adjust menu box with resize handle.
