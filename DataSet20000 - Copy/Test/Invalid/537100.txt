Recent versions of Firefox won't print secure pages to PDF
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091201 Firefox/3.5.6

For years, I've been printing to PDF from secured Web pages (e.g., bank statements, boarding passes) with Firefox.  After some recent Firefox update, secured Web pages stopped printing to PDF from Firefox, although (1) unsecured pages print from Firefox to PDF, (2) secured pages print from Firefox to my printer, and (3) secured pages print to PDF from IE.  I have several PDF print drivers, and all of them fail to print secured Web pages from Firefox to PDF.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a secured Web page with Firefox
2.Click Print and select a PDF print driver 
3.Curse and stamp your feet


Expected Results:  
Either nothing happens, or Windows signals a print error
