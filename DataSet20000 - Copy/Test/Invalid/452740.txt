After running firefox 2 without problems on my ubuntu 7.04 laptop, I thought I'd give beta version 3 a go, but on most web pages strange characters are displayed (seemingly at random places) instead of English text, I have since upgraded to ubuntu 8.0.4 which included firefox 3.0.1 and I have the same problem. Opera and Konquerer on the same laptop run ok, as did firefox 2, firefox 3.0.1 on windows on the same laptop does not produce the same problem either.

Reproducible: Always




I have a screenshot, but no way to upload it?
