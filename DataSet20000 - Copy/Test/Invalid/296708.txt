loading an image off the local hard drive doesnt work.
works in IE6, almost works in Opera7.53
adviced it fails due to potential security risk; yet the URL the page came from
was literally 127.0.0.1/



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. place a p.png file in C:/
2. look at  http://www.fourspace.com.au/t5.html  it validates with w3.org

Actual Results:  
IE6 displays the image, Opera gets all details and makes placeholder but does
not render the pixels;  Firefox1.0.4 (appears to) ignores the whole html tag.

Expected Results:  
displayed the image.

if its a "security" issue to load an image from the local hard drive; the fact
the URL was obtained from 127.0.0.1 should turn off that security "feature".
