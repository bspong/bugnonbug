I have 3 computers (2 laptops (WinXP Pro SP3) and 1 Desktop (Win98SE)) networked together.  An HP Deskjet 722C printer is wired to the Desktop computer which is running FF 2.0.0.0.14.  FF does not need to be active.  When I send a print job from either laptop, the desktop locks up with the following error message:
"A fatal exception 06 has occurred at 6A47:000000F4.  The current application will be terminated."

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn on the Desktop running Win98SE.
2. Send print job from either laptop computer (Win XP Pro SP3) wirelessly.
3.
Actual Results:  
Computer locks up and this Error message is displayed: "A fatal exception 06 has occurred at 6A47:000000F4.  The current application will be terminated."

Expected Results:  
Expected the print job to be executed flawlessly, which happens with FF 2.0.0.0.13.

The FF software should have done nothing as FF was not active during this episode.
