VeohTV2Version? Firefox continually crashes in any attempt to enter the Veoh page.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090624 Firefox/3.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090624 Firefox/3.5

Ever since I uploaded the 3.5 version, I have not been able to open the Veoh.com page. Every attempt I make causes the browser to crash. Reloading, or closing and relaunching does not solve or alleviate the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch Firefox 3.5
2.Go to Bookmarks
3.Click http://www.veoh.com
Actual Results:  
Browser crashes after 2 seconds. A couple of times, the browser gives me a notice that it cannot restart from the previous page. So I quit trying just in case something gets erased.

Expected Results:  
Load the page.

I have No Script and AdBlock, but even if I turn them off, the browser still crashes.
