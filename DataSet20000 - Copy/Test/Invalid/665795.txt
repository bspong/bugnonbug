Tab drop indicator does not vanish on dragexit

The tab drop indicator lingers around even after the tab has been dropped.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Uncheck View -> Toolbars -> Navigation Toolbar
2. Open 2 tabs
3. Click and drag one of them
4. Drag the first tab near the edge of the other tab so that the blue tab drop indicator appears
5. Drag the tab vertically downwards away from the tab bar, into the content area of the other tab
6. Release the mouse button to create a new window

Actual Results:  
The drop indicator remains even after the tab is dragged away, and even after the new window is created.

Expected Results:  
When the tab is dragged away from the tab bar, the blue drop indicator disappears.


It appears that tabbrowser's dragexit handler, which is responsible for hiding the drop indicator, does not fire when moving from the tab bar into the content area.

This bug does not occur when the navigation toolbar is present. However there are some extensions which disable it as they provide their own modes of navigation (e.g. vimperator), so this is certainly worth fixing.

Although the build identifier says FF5, I have verified this on Nightly.
