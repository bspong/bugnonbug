Initial page of new window will not be on back button's history

When opening a new window, the initial page of that window will not be in that window's back button's history.  If you navigate to another link in the same window, the back button will not un-gray.  Navigating to a third page will finally un-gray the back button, but its history will only show the *second* page.

This happens either from an external link (with FF options set to open in a new window), via right clicking on a link and choosing "open link in a new window", or just opening a new window with a home page set.  In the latter case, this *may* be the correct behaviour (this author does not know), but the other cases seem like a bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right click on a link and select "open link in a new window".
2. Within that page (let's call it page A), navigate to one of the "normal" links (one that doesn't have any special behaviour attached to it).
3. Note that the back button is still grayed out as you're viewing page B.
4. Click on another "normal" link to navigate to page C.
Actual Results:  
The back button's history contains only one entry, page B, when viewing page C.

Expected Results:  
The back button's history should have two entries, pages A and B.

The browser history *does* record the visit to the first page; this is just the window's history which seems to exclude it.
