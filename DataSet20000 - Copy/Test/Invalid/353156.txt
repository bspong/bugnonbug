For some reason, when first loading either https://bugzilla.novell.com/ or https://innerweb.novell.com/ Firefox 2.0 pauses for several seconds (if not minutes) before it shows anything.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Restart browser
2. Go to https://bugzilla.novell.com/
3. wait

Actual Results:  
Page takes a really long time to load

Expected Results:  
It should just load up fast-like.

First off, I would like to apologize for filing this under "General". I have no idea what is actually going on.

I would try to report this to the server admins here, except that I do not see this problem with Firefox 1.5 or any other browser, so it must have been something that changed between 1.5 and 2.0.  If you have any specific questions you'd like me to ask them, I can certainly give that a try.

I tried to see which request was hanging, but it was difficult.  The HttpLiveHeaders only shows *completed* transactions (and only works in 1.5).  It would be nice if Firefox had an "activity" window like Safari which would display pending connections, or something.

Thanks and good luck.
