Some fonts are rendered too big and bold when they shouldn't

On certain websites, Firefox 3 renders some fonts bigger than Firefox 2 and also makes text bold that other browsers (IE7, Opera, Firefox 2) render as unemphasized. It looks like this only happens with "default fonts" (ie. fonts with no or minimal CSS attributes applied) and I have only seen it happen with sans-serif fonts like Arial and Verdana (or open source alternatives of those).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a website that causes Firefox to display the fonts in this way (ie. Libsyn.com)
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Some text is displayed too big and bold, which makes the site look very ugly and in some cases breaks the design of the affected sites.

Expected Results:  
Text should be displayed as it is displayed when I visit the site in Firefox 2.
