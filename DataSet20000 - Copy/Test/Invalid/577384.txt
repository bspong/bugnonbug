I accepted the automatic update to 3.6.6 on my Mac 10.5.8.  Since then when I launch/start/restart Firefox, sometimes a browser window will open, sometimes not.  Sometimes when it does open, the address bar and "body" of window are blank, other times my home page opens, other times the last page that was open opens again (although this is seldom because I can seldom get it to go anywhere).  The drop-downs and buttons never work.  I can seldom manually enter a web address.  At this time Firefox is, for all intents and purposes, unusable.  I am using Safari to make this report.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch/Start/Restart Firefox
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
The same as I described above in the details section.  My home page opened, the drop down menus and buttons would not work, and I could not enter a URL.

Expected Results:  
It should allow me to "surf" the web.

There was no crash.  I have the black and orange/gold where the bookmarks and address bar are, and the pink skin.
