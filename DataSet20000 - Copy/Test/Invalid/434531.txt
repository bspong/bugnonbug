Firefox 2 and Firefox 3 installers use incorrect backgrounds if both are on the system
If you have FF2 and FF3 disk images mounted on your system, they will use the background of whatever image was mounted first.

The name of the background bitmap should be changed when it visually changes so it doesn't clash.
