Copy to clipboard to work . It works in IE7. It asks me whether to allow access to my clipboard because of my security settings. 

As far as I can say, as a rant, IE7 is not as bad as it is made out to be.There are people like browsehappy.com that say IE is unsafe, but so are all the other browsers. IE just gets more publicity because it is made by Microsoft. Here is how IE7 is more usable for me than Firefox, though slower.

a) It doesnt force me to choose a file in file upload box. I can copy paste the path from windows explorer.
b) Single click on address bar and then a text selection mouse move selects part of the text which is what I want, and Firefox thinks I am going to drag n drop the whole address somewhere else.
c) I dont like the default enabled setting of all downloads go to my downloads folder. I have changed the settings, but I dont like the software assuming where to download things because in my single open browser session kept open all throught he day, several downloads need to go to several different folders.
d) IE 7 displays ALT in images as tooltip. Firefox says wontfix because of standards. I dont care about standards. I want browser to be usable for me. I write art blog posts, and I view art materials in sites where the webmaster has specified ALT tag but no TITLE tag for images. I need to know what the painting is about through a tooltip in addition to the image itself.
