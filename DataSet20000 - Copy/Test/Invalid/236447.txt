When using the Bluecurved theme for Firefox I have noticed that the web page
shakes up and down. Not the tool bars or sidebar, only the web page itself, the
scroll bars, and the favicon for the page (right hand side of address bar).

This only occurs when the "Activity Indicator" is not on the top toolbar (the
one with the menu bar).

The Bluecurved theme can be downloaded from:

I have tried different Windows XP visual styles, the bug still occurs no matter
what XP Visual style I use. The shaking doesnt occur when using different
Firefox themes. Only occurs when using Bluecurved.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download and install the Bluecurved theme
2. Select to use the Bluecurved theme
3. Make sure that the "Activity Indicator" is not on the top toolbar.
4. The web page and favicon should begin to shake up and down.
Actual Results:  
The web page and favicon stated to shake up and down.

Expected Results:  
The web page should not be shaking.
