Java application is misplaced to a slightly incorrect position once restarted

When the browser first starts the Java environment for an applet, it positions the applet correctly. However, when the same applet page is revisited, (and the Java environment has already already loaded after the previous use) the applet is mispositioned towards the bottom right corner.

Seems like the browser doesn't handle very well the closing of the java applet session. Sometimes there's even an error message from the java environment.

Java version I use is 1.4.2_03 (build 1.4.2_03-b02)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go play an applet game at aapeli.com (or some other site)
2. Visit somewhere else
3. Go back to aapeli.com and try running any applet game

Happens 95% of the time.

Actual Results:  
The applet is drawn misplaced towards the bottom right corner. Otherwise functions completely well.

Expected Results:  
The applet should be positioned to the reserved area -- always.
