I've been unable to download a file successfully with a filename of over 255 characters. The file name size I was trying to assign to it was 272 characters long. This was easily fixed by just cutting the text down to about 200 characters max.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set a long filename of over 255 characters
2. Try to download
Actual Results:  
File asks to be saved, but will just vanish as if it never happened.

Expected Results:  
Downloaded file with a shortened filename to support OS restrictions on filename length limits. (Taking into consideration the file type ext as well)

Works in IE quite fine.
