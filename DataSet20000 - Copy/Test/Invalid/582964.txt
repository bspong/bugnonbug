Selecting a tab causes the tab bar's scroll position to shift abruptly
Steps to reproduce:

1) Open enough tabs to cause horizontal scroll in the tab bar (eg. 20 or so)
2) Scroll all the way to the right.
3) Select the first tab visible on the left.
4) The tab bar abruptly scrolls such that the now-selected tab is on the far right.

Expected result:

The tab bar's horizontal scroll position should not change.

I'd call this a paper cut, but it's really been annoying me in the nightly builds. I'll have a set of vaguely related tabs adjacent to each other in a well-populated tab bar, and clicking on any of them makes the bar jump around in a disorienting way. I have to keep scrolling right to get back to the now-hidden tabs.
