Multiple CSS files not loading as expected-- only first one applies
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en; rv:1.8.1.5) Gecko/20070718 Fedora/2.0.0.5-1.fc7 Epiphany/2.18 Firefox/2.0.0.5

I have reproduced this problem in FC7 with both the latest Epiphany and Firefox (both with and without the webdeveloper extension), and on the latest Firefox on Windows.  I have searched for bug reports and not found this problem, so.....

I am not sure why this particular example is failing-- other files with multiple stylesheets work fine.

In the above example, two different CSS files are linked in the original simple HTML file.  If the first stylesheet applies, the hyperlink text turns red.  If the second one applies, the li element displays a border.  The text is red, but the border is not displayed.  If the order of the stylesheets linked are reversed, the border displays on the LI but the hyperlink text does not change color.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Download the html and css files above.
2.  Reverse the order of the CSS files.
3.  If you have webdeveloper installed (optional), disable and re-enable stylesheets to see what I was expecting to see.
Actual Results:  
Only first stylesheet applies properly, regardless which stylesheet it is.

Text of hyperlink is red, no border around list item.

Expected Results:  
text of hyperlink is red.  List item shows red border.


Information from webdeveloper:

At first I thought this was a webdeveloper bug because if, in webdeveloper, I disable CSS and then re-enable it, the page displays as expected.  Furthermore, if I edit the CSS and click the reload button on that pane, the css applies properly *and* the second css file appears as a tab in the edit css pane.

DOM Inspector:

The DOM Inspector shows the proper LINK elements regardless of whether they are applying to the rendering of the output.
