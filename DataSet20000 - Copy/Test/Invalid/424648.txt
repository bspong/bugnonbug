'Sort by name' produces unexpected behavior on tag containers
Make sure you have tags and follow these instructions, do NOT go to the places library, it seems to work o.k there

1. Go to bookmark toolbar
2. Click on Smart Bookmarks
3. Click Recent Tags
4. Right click on a tag category
5. Click sort by name
6. A tag disappears 
7. Other things seem to happen, like sometimes it uses the page title to display the name, other times it doesn't

Not sure this can be fixed till bug 419731 is though
