When scrolling to the end of a line that is too long to show, and i select the
line from right and to the end of my screen, the page should scroll to the left,
but it doesn't. But if i select from left to right and get to the end of my
screen, Firefox correctly scrolls the page to the right, so i can select the
whole line.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a page with a line that's too long to show, so it creates a horizontal
scrollbar.
2. Scroll to the end of the line, using the scrollbar.
3. Start selecting the line that's too long, and move the mouse cursor to the
left as far as you can.

Actual Results:  
You have selected text from the right to somewhere left, but not the whole line.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should scroll the page automatically, so it's possible to select the
whole line of text, from right to left.
