Ctrl+W close tab is a serious design flaw

In filling out this form, if I need to type a capitol W, if I miss the right shift key and hit the control key, or accidentally hit both, the tab will close and I will lose all my data. 

In writing this bug I remembered the undo closed tab option, and was just shocked to find that the long email I had written to a friend and lost suddenly was miraculously retrieved. Hooray, but how many people brilliant enough to consider that option. The ctrl+w close tab needs re-designed. Your the absolute best! Thanks
