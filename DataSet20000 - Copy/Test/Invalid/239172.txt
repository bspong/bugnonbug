When Firefox is on a secondary monitor clicking on the menu title brings the
menu up on the primary monitor. 

If the second monitor is to the left of the main one the menu's y position is
correct, but its x position places the left side of the menu on the left side of
the primary monitor.

If the second monitor is to the right of the main one the menu's y position is
correct, but its x position places the right side of the menu on the right side
of the primary monitor.

If the second monitor is above of the main one the menu's x position is correct,
but its y position places the top side of the menu on the top side of the
primary monitor.

If the second monitor is above of the main one the menu's x position is correct,
but its y position places the bottom side of the menu on the bottom side of the
primary monitor.

This problem also occurs with the pull down for the addresses entry box
