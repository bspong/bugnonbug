When I was searching a webpage using the "Find" tool box and had Echofon open, Firefox would highlight the first letter and then jump to the open Echofon window. It did this for each subsequent letter after manually placing cursor back in "Find" window. 

No problem if Echofon was closed.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open echofon
2. Ctrl F
3. Enter text
Actual Results:  
same

Expected Results:  
Allow me to continue entering text in the "Find" window
