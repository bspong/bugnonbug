I have ADSL the week only.
During weekends, if I start FireFox without internet connexion, it display a
totally gray window and I can't do anything.
By changing homepage in config files it start well.
But if I click on a WEB link, it doesn't respond another time : try to load a
page non-recheable !
I can avoid this strange behaviour
