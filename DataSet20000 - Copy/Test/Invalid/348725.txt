firefox starts up with space when notebook is offline

I'm not sure if this was reported previous (apologies if it was) and if I've
described the issue properly.  When my notebook is not connected to the internet, when I start up firefox I always get some blank lines/space between the window 
frame and the status bar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. make sure PC/notebook is off line i.e. Ethernet/Wi-Fi not enabled
2. start firefox 1.5.0.6
3. I see empty wasted spaces at the bottom of the window




I've captured a screen shot of the problem.  Can upload the picture if you
require it.
