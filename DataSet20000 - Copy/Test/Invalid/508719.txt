RoboForm V 6.9.91 does not seem to work with Firefox 3.5.2.

Here are details of the Roboform installation. It worked with the old version of Firefox and on another computer with an older version of Firefox. Also works with IE. It stops at the log-in screen and won't autofill, and that's what Roboform is about.
