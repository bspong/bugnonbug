Firefox don´t accept ZendDebuggerCookie
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de-DE; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050717 Firefox/1.0.6

Using Zend Development Enviroment I recognized that debug session are lost.
Those sessions are set by cookie name "ZendDebuggerCookie". 
If I enable to accept/reject each cookie manually, firefox ask me first to set,
than after page is loader to unset the cookie. You can test it on above URL.
With other browser, like 1.0.4 on Linux, this will not happen.

Some more investigation I found that this depends just on this cookie name. If I
change a single letter, it will not happen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enable to ask before accepting cookies
2.go to http://62.44.9.210/~sebastian/test.php


Actual Results:  
The cookie is just send once, but you will asked twice
