Actual Results:  
it happens so much I haven't got a clue why it's happening...I;m usually checking out stories on the internet and it will occur,,,not sure why or how but it looks like others are having to close out firefox and restart....this used to work for me but not now firefox won't close or quit.  in a little while i'll try a reboot and hope that will give me a temporary fix.


I believe I'm using the standard firefox theme,,,
