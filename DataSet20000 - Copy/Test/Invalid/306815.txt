I cannot close tab anymore.
When I middle click a link, it opens on a new tab but, when i middle click on
the tab label, it doesn't close (ctrl + W or middle click or right click + close
tab).
I tried with a new profile and then , the problem doesn't appear.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a new tab
2. try to close the tab (ctrl + W or middle click or right click + close tab)
3. 

Actual Results:  
the tab doesn't close

Expected Results:  
the tab should close

This issue is limited to one profile, so this issue is not critical.
Perhaps just a configuration problem but I didn't change anything myself on
configuration.
