User stylesheet not loading in Firefox 3

In Firefox 2, I used the Accessibility toolbar to install a user stylesheet. That toolbar doesn't work in Firefox 3, so it's gone. Now my user styles don't work. I checked in about:config that accessext.styles.userStylesheet.enable is true and that accessext.styles.userStylesheet.text contains the correct CSS code, but Firefox is simply not applying it.

I tried using the Web Developer Toolbar, but when I turn Persist mode on, it prompts me for the location of my CSS file every time I load a new page, so that's no good.

Here's the original CSS:

/* Distinguish visited links at www.washingtonpost.com */

@-moz-document domain("www.washingtonpost.com") {
  a:visited {
    color: purple ! important;
  }
}

@-moz-document domain("newsweek.washingtonpost.com") {
  a:visited {
    color: purple ! important;
  }
}

body #comics_wrapper2 a:visited {
	color: purple ! important;
}

I created this because washingtonpost.com, amazingly, styles its links NOT to turn color after being visited, so that I can't tell which articles I've read already.

This is exactly the code I found at accessext.styles.userStylesheet.text (except that the line breaks had been stripped out).

I also tried an instruction I found to name my CSS file as userContent.css and to put it into my Firefox profile directory, but it was still ignored.

To troubleshoot, I replaced the stylesheet and the setting at accessext.styles.userStylesheet.text with much simpler CSS and tried it out on a simple web page to show that it wasn't just a matter of looking at pages where new markup was interfering with assumptions about the cascade, but it really just isn't being used. Even Firebug doesn't indicate that my user stylesheet is being used.
