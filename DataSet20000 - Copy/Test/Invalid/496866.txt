When watching a fullscreen Flash video, it's somewhat common to have to fiddle with the system volume.  Unfortunately, this unfullscreens the video.  No desktop video player I've used does this; why does Firefox?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Watch a flash video in full screen
2. Press a hardware volume up/down key
Actual Results:  
Video leaves fullscreen

Expected Results:  
Video stays in fullscreen
