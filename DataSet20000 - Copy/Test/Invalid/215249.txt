When dragging links, the Close Tab icon should change to a New Tab icon

Firebird's Close Tab widget also serves as a drop target for links. This is
especially important when several tabs are open and no space is left for the
drop target (I will soon attach a screenshot that shows this problem).

Rational:
1. Dropping links on the tab bar (to open new tabs) is one of four supported
ways to open a link in a new tab.
2. During this drag&drop operation, the *only* functionality of the Close Tab
widget is to provide a drop target for new tabs. It can't be used for closing
tabs while a link is being dragged.
3. Using a Close Tab icon |X| as a drop target is counter-intuitive. The icon
hints for closing an object, not for spawning one.

See the OS X Trash as a good example of a widget that changes its icon to
reflect a different action during a drag. When the user drags a folder or a
file, it looks (and acts) as a Trash bin; when the user drags a mounted disk/CD,
it looks (and acts) as an eject button.
