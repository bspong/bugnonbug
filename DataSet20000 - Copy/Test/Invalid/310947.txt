This also happened with version 1.0 also, that in general after entering a URL
site and clicking on a secondary URL within that site, sometimes but not always
the key board and mouse locks up and no futher action is possible.  I have to
turn the power off to exit the situation.  I am fortunate that my hard drive
does not crash.  This happened to me the first time I entered this site to file
a bug report just now.  I have reviewed my security administration to see if
this was being done maliciously by others, but did not find permissions that
would allow this lock/up by others, as I am the only user and Administrator.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into valid network URL (successful)
2. Browse within the original selected URL 
3. Sometimes but not always, when trying to select or click on another site or
   URL within that site the mouse locks up as well as the key board.  the 
   Mozilla circles in the upper right corner have also stopped moving.
    


Actual Results:  
 The only way that I can exit or change the page or view is to power down the PC.

Expected Results:  
Should have said that the page could not be found and allowed for another entry.
or said that site was busy and to try back later and allowed for another entry.
or said that the page or URL was not valid and allowed for another entry.
or come back with somekind of system entry explaining the situation and allowed
for another entry.

There does not seem to be a particular pattern that I can describe when getting
the locked up sysem.  This happens in most applications  use HGTV houseplans
.com and many other sites that this has occured on as well as this very site.

  My PC is Pentium 4 2.8 gig  ASUS Mother Board (Raid) P4P800  2Gig random
access memory --seagate 120Gig hard drive OS is XP Pro. Service pac 1. High
speed cable modem is Motorola.

I have Norton System Works and Virus protection that might be involved, just do 
not know. Lavasoft Adaware but I do Not think is involved.  All Microsoft OS
updates are installed with the exception of service pac2, and I have service pac
1. installed.
