I had earlier installed Google Toolbar for Firefox and had replaced the Firefox search box with the Google Toolbar Search box ( using the 'Layout' option in the Google Toolbar options ). If the search box is resized using the separator between it and the location bar - dragging the separator to the left to the extent that it just reaches the website icon causes the Navigation bar as well as the contents of the web page to move towards the right. They come back to their original positions once it is dragged back towards the right.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Google Toolbar
2. Replace search box with the Google search box.
3. Drag the separator between the search box the location bar towards the left until it reaches the website icon (beginning of the web page address ).
