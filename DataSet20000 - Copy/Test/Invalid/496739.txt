multiple extensions not working after complete uninstall / reinstall and new profile
User-Agent:       Opera/9.64 (Windows NT 5.1; U; en) Presto/2.1.1

I have Adblock Plus, Fission, Extended Statusbar, Java Quick Starter, Stumbleupon, and Ubiquity installed. Adblock works, but didn't display the first-run "pick a list" page. Fission works fine, but it's more of a cosmetic update than an actual usability extension. Ubiquity fails to respond to any keymapping, but About:Ubiquity works. The stumbleupon toolbar doesn't load, and the mapped shortcuts don't work either. This is all persisting through a full uninstall and reinstall, where I manually deleted everything associated with firefox after running the provided uninstaller, and a new profile, created through the profile manager.

Reproducible: Always




>_< I want stumbleupon back! the webtoolbar just isn't the same!
