When filling out forms, ie. e-mail, when typing @ (Alt-Gr + 2) Firefox switches to tab #2.
When making BBCode ([] tags), Firefox switches to either tab #7 or tab #8

Only seems to happen with <input> fields

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Focus input field 
2. Type name@email.com
Actual Results:  
Firefox switches to tab #2, AND inserts @

Expected Results:  
Only the @ should be inserted, and the current tab should stay focused
