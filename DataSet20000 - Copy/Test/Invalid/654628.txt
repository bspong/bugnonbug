So, I have been using the feed bookmarks in the Bookmarks toolbar & have some suggestions. Major issue is that when the list of feed items in the drop down is longer than the page, it scrolls. This is great, but the last two options "Open ____" & "Open all in Tabs" gets hidden at the bottom of the list. It would be great if they always stayed visible & the feed items scrolled between the bottom 2 items (which would always be visible, and the top.

The second thing I think would be helpful, is if the original icons could somehow be preserved & a Feed icon placed over top, or in the corner of the feed logo. I switched a lot of my bookmarks over to feed bookmarks, but often just like going to the site, being able to find the icon quickly (by the favicon) & being to jump into the site quickly are a priority.

Third Suggestion. The feeds only update so often. Its too slow for quickly changing content. Would it be possible to specify how often they are updated, or even better, if it has not been updated when one uses the drop down (by hovering over, or even clicking the feed (to produce the drop down) Perhaps it could produce and event to re-check the feed, to see new items. I know it might be a bit of a nightmare in terms of what it does to a feed already loaded, but I could certainly live with items moving around some if it was going to provide me with up to date information.

To Recap.

1. Drop Down Bar On Feed Icons Scroll between the last <HR> so that "Open" never dissimilar on long feed lists.

2. Favicon has rss icon superimposed rather than replaced with rss icon.

3. Hovering over the bookmark feed, or clicking on it creates an event to re-check the feed for new items.
