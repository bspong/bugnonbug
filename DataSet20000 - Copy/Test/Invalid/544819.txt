[Mockup] Home Tab

For the new Firefox theme/UI we would like to introduce a "Home Tab"; moving the functionality of the home button to a persistent tab attached to the far left of the Tab Bar. Visually this tab looks like a mini-tab containing only the Home glyph. This tab initially will just take you to your home page. Any links clicked on this page would spawn a new tab. This would serve as a good introduction to tabs for users not accustomed to them. 
				
This will be the introduction of the Home Tab. In the future enhancements will include making a locally hosted page with access to history, add-ons, bookmarks, etc. Opening up possibilities for creating a user centric home page.

See attachment for mockup.
