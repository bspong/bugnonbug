I suggest you merge the "Stop" and "Reload" buttons in the toolbar like in Opera. Also, I'm not sure the "Home" button is used a lot or not, if so, then maybe remove it. Now, a button that most people would use is the "New tab" button that should be included in the toolbar by default. Many people don't know about tabs and don't know how to personalize their toolbar. Including a "New tab" icon would help them discover tabs.
