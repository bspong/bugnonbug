Bugs with Google Toolbar

It is all fine and clear in the latest Lorentz build, but in Minefield the Google Toolbar is both not working, and using incorrect settings. The auto-fill in is broken, and registers that not a single name/e-mail/phone number/etc is filled in, and unless you right click the toolbar under the add-on menu itself, will not even up the options menu to change the settings.

Besides that, I've also noticed that added context buttons, that I did not, and have not selected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Google Toolbar
2.Right click on any page to see the add-ed context menu buttons
3.Try and fill in applications or anything of the sort with the auto-fill in feature, it shouldn't work.
