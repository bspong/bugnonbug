This is not but of Firefox
But i decided to report about this because some users may think about Firefox's bug

I updated Firefox to 3.5.* but i was needed to use new Roboform 6.9.96
After updating i saw often 100% CPU using with DOM operations (JavaScript - inserting HTML nodes, deleting, changing the parent of nodes and etc)

First time i thought that this bug of Firefox 3.5.* I made many things to find a root of trouble. The last thing that i did was downgrading to Firefox 3.0.13. But after this trouble was being... I deinstalled IE 8.0 -> IE 7.0 (i thought that may be Microsoft did some bad things ;-)). But this didn't help.

Only when i installed old version of Roboform (6.9.92 for Firefox 3.0.*) an anything began to work fine.

So if you often have a 100% CPU eating by Firefox and you have Roboform - please to see a version of last one. If there > 6.9.92, i recommend to downgrade the Roboform.

I reported about this trouble to Roboform support. But i don't have an answer during whole 1 business day. I don't know that they think about this problem ...

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Firefox 3.*
2. Roboform 6.9.96 (may be enough > 6.9.92)
3. JavaScript pages with DOM using (DHTML pages)

Actual Results:  
100% CPU loading by Firefox
