Refresh button does not work after the page load is canceled

When I type an URL and press the green button to open the page, if I stop the page load pressing the red button, the refresh button will appear in place, but it will be disabled. So, the only way out is by clicking on the address field and then the green button to load that URL again.
But this bug only happens if none of the page contents had been loaded yet.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type an URL in the address field
2. Press the green button to load page
3. Right after step 2 press the red button to stop loading
4. Now the refresh button will appear, try to press it
Actual Results:  
I couldn't reload the URL that I typed in the address field.

Expected Results:  
The refresh button should be enabled in this case too. So it would not be necessary to click on the address field.
