Three finger swipe (left) causes Firefox to hide

It seems this bug has been reported before (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=478600, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=469483) but the solutions provided did not solve the issue for me. The problem is initiated when the three finger swipe left is used; Firefox hides as though command+h was pressed. 

I have confirmed that this is user specific since the other user on this computer does not have the same issue. 

At this point I wonder if it may be something related to the OS X user-specific configuration files rather than Firefox itself. Although all other three finger left gestures work correctly within the OS.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open browser
2. navigate to a new page
3. swipe left to go back and browser hides
Actual Results:  
Browser hides as though command+h was pressed

Expected Results:  
navigate to the previous page

only plugin installed is Google Bookmark Button Reloaded 0.9.6. Disabling plugin does not remedy the issue.
