I've used Opera for years since it is:
* VERY fast
* the most usable browser (even more than Firefox, IMHO)

I think you should imlement a tabs bar like Opera. This mean:
* one should be able to put the bar where he wants; for example, I like to have
it in the bottom of the window (I remember it was default in old versions of Opera)
* tabs titles should be more readable (black text on white background, maybe);
it is better for all, but VERY IMPORTANT for disables
* Opera 8 has a trash in the tabs bar; it contains closed tabs (very useful if
you close a tab by mistake!) - you can also empty trash

Will we see these features on Firefox?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
uh... download Opera 8 and see how these features are implemented :)
