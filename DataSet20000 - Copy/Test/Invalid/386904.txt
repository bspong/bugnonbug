DIST_FILES and DIST_CHROME_FILES not implemented for install:: target in config/rules.mk
Created attachment 270967
install:: for DIST_FILES and DIST_CHROME_FILES

-- Summary:

This patch implements DIST_FILES as well as DIST_CHROME_FILES install::
target.

 -- Evaluation:

DIST_FILES is now used in browser/app/Makefile.in to install
application.ini; however, DIST_FILES is only implemented for
libs::, but not for libs::.

In consequence, make install'ed installs of firefox now break
with missing application.ini file.

When writing this fix, it became obvious that DIST_CHROME_FILES
install: target is missing too ... though it doesn't cause any
problems because its not really used.
