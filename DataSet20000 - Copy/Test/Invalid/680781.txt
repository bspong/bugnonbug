Firefox 3.6.20 asked to load a self-signed java jar ignores CN etc and reports as "UNKNOWN" asking the user to "always trust content from this publisher" and if this means always trust UNKNOWN we need that to be changed to 'unknown from that website'.

dialog raised by encountering self-signed jar

If a web site deploys a self-signed java jar, firefox 3.6.20 comes up with
the attached diaglog. It does not display any of the configured items like CN
from the code signage but asks the user: 
The applications' digital signature cannot be verified. Do you want to run the application?" 
Name (blank)
Publisher (UNKNOWN)
From: (website and port)
checkbox: always trust content from this publisher.
The problem is what does it mean "always trust content from this publisher?" Needs to be clarified. And it should not enable any self-signed code from any website. It should enable only self-signed code from that website (and/or that
website and that port.) The latter would be fine.
