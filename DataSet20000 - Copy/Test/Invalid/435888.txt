TakingYourHeadOutOfYourAssReadEntireMailStupidFuck,

Yes, live in France - country of stupid frogs, I admit.

How about taking the default out that does not let me select my location in websites.

How about not trying to FORCE me to take upgrades in French.

I used to work for MS and the greatest thing about their tools is that they never force a language choice.

Your bitOshit browser does not give me the option, with MindMap for example, to download in English. Websites like mindmap only allow me to DL in the FreedomFagFrogLing since I live here - but wait - that's not all.

With your toy I have problems with google. they feed me shit in frog when I post a search in English. I type a .com and your bit-o-shit toy send me frog answers.

IE does not.


Your browsing toy is shite and I am torn between it, IE, and pounding nails in my head.

Here is the test to see if you actually read the entire question, but you probably will not answer because this will land on the desk of a dickless frogtwat.

What can I do to NOT get the useless Frog language as a default?

Yes, I happen to use a French ISP.
