In View menu no Sidebar -> Bookmarks
When I click View -> Sidebar, I see only a History option, but no Bookmarks item.
As I am a typical mouse user, and rarely use keys, and never key combinations like ctrl+b, I have no way to access the bookmarks sidebar with my mouse, except dragging the bookmarks icon onto my toolbar which costs too much space.

I could not find a duplicate for this, although I think it must be there.
