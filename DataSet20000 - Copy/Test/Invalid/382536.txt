Google maps fails in 2.0.0.4 with "Your web browser is not fully supported by Google Maps"

After upgrading to 2.0.0.4, google maps reports the following error "Your web browser is not fully supported by Google Maps".  This was tried on a profile in FF that had no add-ons (fresh new profile).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. navigate to maps.google.com
Actual Results:  
you get the maps search dialog with the above message

Expected Results:  
my home location in maps

I'm calling this major because it will cause me to roll back to a previous version of FF, and i assume that google maps is widely used.

I understand that this may be known of/something being done about it either by google or mozilla.org, but I have no visibility of that, so minimally this case should give visibility of what is occuring to fix the problem.
