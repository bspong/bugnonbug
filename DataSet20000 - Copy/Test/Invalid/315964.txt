When going into fullscreen mode from "Restore" windowed mode, titlebar remains.
This doen't happen when going fullscreen from "Maximize" windowed mode

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.run Firefox in "Restore" windowed mode
2.go to fullscreen mode (F11)
3.titlebar remains

Actual Results:  
Firefox is in fullscreen mode with window titlebar

Expected Results:  
expected the titlebar to disappear (as when going fullscreen from "Maximize" windowed mode); I think that is the correct way to implement fullscreen mode
