Don't load nsSessionStore component if browser.sessionstore.enabled == false
Mano's suggestion:
Make Cc["@mozilla.org/browser/sessionstore;1"].getService(Ci.nsISessionStore) throw when Session Restore was disabled through the pref - i.e. don't let the service initialize in the first place (and replace checks for that variable with try-catch-blocks).
