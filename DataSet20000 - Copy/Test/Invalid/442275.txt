May access personal certificates from other people without security check
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; es-ES; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

I have four personal certificates installed on firefox at my home's computer (One is mine, the other of my relatives)

I backed up them with high security level, so I am prompted for a password every time I install one of them

The problem, is that once installed, I may use any of them, and I am never prompted for a password again. Firefox just prompts to ask which certificate I want to use.

And the worst problem is that they are all official documents emmited by spanish government, so any one using the computer may suplant me, which is a quite serious issue. Ok, they are my family and I trust them, but that's not always the case.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install several personal certificates
2. Configure firefox to ask which certificate to use every time you are requested
Actual Results:  
No security check when personal certificates are used (only when installed). May use any installed certificate installed on the browser with no security restrictions

Expected Results:  
Should ask for a password every time a personal certificate is requested and selected.

Password should be different for every certificate, and should be requested when certificate is installed.

User may deactivate security on a certificate by certificate basis (Prompted for password to deactivate).

This function might not be globally deactivated, but browser may be configured not to put security on certificates by default (Not request a usage password when certificate is installed)

Secured certificates should be protected, so they can't be used just by copying them to another profile.

It's a new feature, but I think is a major security problem (a problem shared by any browser I know)
