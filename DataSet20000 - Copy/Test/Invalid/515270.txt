Taskfox wireframes

Currently, the Taskfox search results don't have much in the way of styling. We need to add some flair here. :)

Wireframes of the proposed layout (but not visual design), can be found in the attached PDF from page 3 onwards. These are just suggestions, feel free to deviate from the proposed structure.
