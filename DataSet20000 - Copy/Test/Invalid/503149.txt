When I log in on Facebook the "home" page is blank

After logging in on Facebook (which is sometimes hard because it doesn't log in, while it works with Safari) I get a blank page (the home one with all the updates from friends in the middle). It started doing this since 2 days ago, I deleted Firefox (with preferences, application support and everything) and I reinstalled it: some issue.

P.s. I also cleaned the cache and cookies

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log in on Facebook
2.Facebook redirects you on your "home" page
3.The "home" page appears blank
Actual Results:  
I get a blank page

Expected Results:  
I should get my regular home page

It works fine if I click on profile, friends, etc. It happens only when I am on the Home section.
