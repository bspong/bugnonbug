DETAILS TAB: on this page, an image starts to load, but then goes black. Clicking on any of the 4 image icons yields a (correct size) black spacce. If I drag this, however, the image is displayed while I am dragging.
IMAGES TAB: Working along the images from the left, they are black until the 8th, which displays correctly. Then the 5th, 6th & 7th does also.8th and above always display. I see all the thumbnails.
MAP TAB: I see the icons for houses, the controls, but the actual map itself  is blank. This map has about 6 images and whatever one I drag shows as I drag it. 
I have Slamd64-12.2(64bit port of slack). These all work in 32 bit Slackware-12.0 on a different box, so it is either a javascript or a video thing. Fedora 10 also on the 64 bit box with a different java plugin and video driver also has issues here.

I should mention everything is x86_64: The cpu is a Turion(amd64). Browser, flash plugin, java plugin.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
None needed - just go about your business.
1.Any page from www.myhome.ie has some problem. The map always fails
2.http://www.youtube.com
3.
Actual Results:  
Big image is black unless dragged off centre. Thumbnails OK.

Expected Results:  
Larger image should display. On youtube, the 'videos being watched now' has a large frame and that is black unless I drag it.

All javascript features are enabled
The image is there. The black frames vary in size with images, and display once dragged, even with my bandwith throttled to near zero. I have a  Windows nerd son doing exams :-(. 
Java and DRI work, but there is an issue on Java, which is this. libmawt.so is needed. Java crashes without it. I have
/usr/java/jre1.6.0_14/lib/amd64/headless/libmawt.so - that crashes firefox!
/usr/java/jre1.6.0_14/lib/amd64/motif21/libmawt.so - apparently working
/usr/java/jre1.6.0_14/lib/amd64/xawt/libmawt.so - apparently working

Despite having /usr/java/jre1.6.0_14/lib/amd64/ in /etc/ld.so.conf none of these are found. ldconfig runs on reboot. I have a symlink in /usr/java/jre1.6.0_14/lib/amd64/ to ~/xawt/libmawt.so currently. All dependencies are found (I made sure of that!).

The build is your general release. The original one talked me into retiring it.
Ctrl_Alt_F1 shows 4 errors (presumably from the browser)
Error: No running window found (twice)
None (twice)
