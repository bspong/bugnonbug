[meta] Use every icon produced for Firefox 3
This is a tracking bug for making sure that all of the icons that we have produced for each platform is actually landed and appearing in all of the correct locations in the user interface.

A tremendous amount of work went into producing more than 480 icons across the 4 platforms, so we need to make absolutely sure that all of the icons produced for features in Firefox 3 are actually being used in order to give the product a high level of polish.

I'll cc the various themeing teams to bugs that block this tracking bug based on the relevant platforms.

I would like to manage this list myself, but please nominate related bugs in the comments below, or to faaborg@mozilla.com.  My apologies if I file any dupes, I'm working mainly off of the icon inventory and trying to get everything covered in bugs quickly.
