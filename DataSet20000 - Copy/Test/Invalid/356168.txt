style element contains cdata - firefox parses it verbatim
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6 (Debian-1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.6-4)

the content model of <style> elements is CDATA, whcih requires parsing and expansion of entities.

Yet firefox ignores entities at elast for text/css styles, e.g.:

<style type="text/css">
   td > div.a { background: blue; }
   td &gt; div.b { background: blue; }
}

The first rule is correctly applied, the second isn't, althought &gt; is equivalent to > in CDATA sections.

Tested in standards-compliant mode, if that makes a difference.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
use &gt; instead of a verbatim > character in style elements.
Actual Results:  
rules using &gt; are not being applied, rules using > are

Expected Results:  
&gt; is equivalent to >, so the rules should apply regardless of encoding
