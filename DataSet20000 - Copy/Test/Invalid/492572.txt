Some keyboard shortcuts seem not to work in all kind of text fields, for example pressing <Ctrl> + <K> in the location bar simply eareses my selection as <delete> was pressed. <Ctrl> + <K> works fine when I'm my cursor is not in a text field. Weirdly though some keyboard shortcuts seem to work normally, such as <ctrl>+<J> (focuses search bar) but most I tried don't work and simply delete the selection.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Focus a text field (try: <Ctrl>+<L>)
2.Grab some selection
3.Press some keyboard shortcut (not ctrl-L, J, T, copy/paste nor re/undofuncs)
Actual Results:  
Selection eareses and isn't cutted to clipboard (except for ctrl-x and c). User is forced to defocus the text field to use the shortcut (F6, click or 1-or-more tabs…)

Expected Results:  
Shortcuts should work as if no text field was focused.

I wasn't able to reproduce this on my Mac, wich has Firefox 3.0.6, while I'm currently on Fx3.0.8 on Ubuntu.
