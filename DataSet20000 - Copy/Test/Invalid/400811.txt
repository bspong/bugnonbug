Inside a div, I am placing 4 divs with the rule "float:left;". Inside these four divs there is a list in each one.
The parent div (the one that holds the four divs floating to the left) has no height, even though it should be as tall as the tallest div inside it.

The specified url ( http://www.definethis.org/temp/bugzilla/listitems/test.html ) shows what I mean and also shows a version of the same code but using tables, which appears fine.

Both versions appear fine in IE7 and the page validates with W3 validator.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Check specified website and see source code

Actual Results:  
The background of the parent div is not shown and using Firebug, it seems that the parent div has no height.

Expected Results:  
The four lists should appear nicely on the background of the parent div.
