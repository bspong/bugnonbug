1.
Folders in the history-sidebar collapse and expand on single click.
But they should do so on double-click, like the bookmarks-manager and the
history-sidebar.



2.
- make sure you have some bookmarks and bookmarks within subfolders in the
bookmarks toolbar

-  make sure to have no(!) bookmarks outside (in parent dirs) the bookmarks toolbar

- open the bookmarks sidebar

- double-clik any sub-folder within the folder of the bookmarks-toolbar:

The hole bookmarks-toolbar-folder collapses! It should not do so!
