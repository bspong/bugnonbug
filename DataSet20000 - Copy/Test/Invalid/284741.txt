When using many tabs, if I try to open some page with flash or javascripts and it takes long to open, if I close that tab also Firefox continues to try loading that page and ultimately hangs
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: 

Once I close a tab, Firefox should stop loading that page. Instead the status 
bar shows that the page is still trying to get loaded and as a result I am not 
able to open new tabs and present tabs are also lost, 'coz Firefox hangs 
ultimately

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a few tabs with some pages
2. Open a new tab with a page that takes long to load maybe with a huge 
javascript.
3. Close the latest tab


Actual Results:  
Firefox continues to try and load the page and ultimately crashes, i.e unable 
to open new tabs or even a new window.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have stoped loading that page when the tab is closed and have 
no problems.
