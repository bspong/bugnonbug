Bad CSS rendering when repeating backgrounds
When i view this page on firefox 0.9.3 or 1.0PR on any os the css that is supposed to fill up the top 
table with the striped background doesn't work.

The code for both the table and the css is attached below, along with a screenshot of how it should 
look (safari) and how it looks on firefox

The code is valid xhtml 1.1 and css
