Move gripper out of the status bar element

As of Bug 609127, the status bar element now has a high ordinal. This is an issue because it prevents users from arbitrarily positioning it  by placing other toolbar items around it.

This is also a problem if the user has the "Firefox 4 UI Fixer". This allows users to move the status bar to different toolbars. On platforms that actually use the gripper (XP I think?), this puts it in a very strange position.

The gripper should be moved out of the status bar, and the ordinal should be moved from the status bar to the gripper.

I brought up Bug 602971 (in the original bug) as a potential problem. If it is a problem, a potential work around (aside from fixing the actual problem) could be to wrap the addon-bar and the gripper in an hbox.

Reproducible: Always
