System crash when browsing random wep pages (even in the -safe-mode)
User-Agent:       Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 5.1; U; en) Presto/2.2.15 Version/10.10
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.12) Gecko/20101026 Firefox/3.6.12

System Freezes totally (ONLY when using in Firefox). Mouse cursor just stops, keyboard doesn't work (even Num lock lights) Windows frozen, no error msg. Only a hardware reset button helps.

Problem appears on random url's. Not just on the one page. It often happens when scrolling down the pages by mouse wheel and not immediately after the page content is loaded. Happens even in the -safe-mode

No such problem until 3.6.12 upgrade.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just browse I'm afraid...
2.
