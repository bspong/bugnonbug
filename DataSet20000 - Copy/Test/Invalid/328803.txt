In my preferences I have it set to print background colors and images, however on this particular site it fails to print the site as it apepars on the screen, in fact there is no color used at all, Aparenly the styles and colors and bground color of the tables is applied in a CSS Style Sheet, and if I were to disbale the CSS Style Sheet then how it looks on the screen, like blab that's how it prints. 

Would it be possible so that when we printed websites it applies the CSS Styles if we have out printer options set to print background colors and images.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Print Prview or Print (with the Page Options (Print Background (color & iamges) Selected)
2. Go to the printer, and notice that the big expensive color laserjet printer failed to render any form of color
3.

Actual Results:  
It prints like CRAP, difficult to read beacuse the newatness and colorfulness of the style sheet is not applied while printing.

Expected Results:  
It should print exactly how it looks on my screen while i'm browsing the website.

P.S. Aparenly I was only able to print this website via Adobe's Go Live, because attempting to print via IE and FrontPage both failed to produce the results of how it appears on the screen.
