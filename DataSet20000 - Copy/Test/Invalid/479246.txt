Over the past 2 months, have been facing this issue of 
- Firefox auto-opening a new browser while I'm still surfing. 
- There are no signs of a virus attack as the new browser opens and loads my default homepage. 
- However today, it auto-opened the browser with this URL - http://nachgeb.com/?affid=175040&guid=D8BB4A4808C64D80906B555ED779CA6C&uid=0F9001B8E0EB11DD874B17504015FFFF

- Today also, as I've switched to Google Chrome, while surfing using Chrome and I hit enter for a search, Firefox auto-ran and launched a browser! 
- I've run scans with NOD32 on my PC but nothing seems to be the problem. 
- I've also tried to uninstall Firefox twice and downloaded the latest version to no avail. 

Reproducible: Always
