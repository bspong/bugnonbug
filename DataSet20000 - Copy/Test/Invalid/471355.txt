Hi heres my problem
I really love to use moziila firefox as a browser but something happend last day
so after an update i restarted the browser as it say and after that im not able to load any page.I am good with computers so i tried everything i can do like:
I installed 5 other versions of firefox and nothing changed same problem
I cleared the chache - no change
I deleted all the registry entries in windows and installed the latest version of firefox - and again can load any page
I turn off every firewall i have ( i dont have antivirus) - again nothing
no matter what page i try the only thing i see every time is this:"
Address Not Found

      

      
      
      

      
        
        

          

www.google.com could not be found. Please check the name and try again.

        


        
        


The browser could not find the host server for the provided address.




    *  Did you make a mistake when typing the domain? (e.g. "ww.mozilla.org" instead of

        "www.mozilla.org")


    *  Are you certain this domain address exists?  Its registration may have expired.


    *  Are you unable to browse other sites?  Check your network connection and DNS server settings.


    *  Is your computer or network protected by a firewall or proxy?  Incorrect settings can interfere with Web browsing."
