potential js injection in sessionstore.js
potential js injection in sessionstore.js

$PROFILE/sessionstore.js seems javascript that gets executed.
it is possible to include the following:
_hosts:{localhost:true, true:true}
true:true is invalid construct.

to reproduce.
put a name in /etc/hosts for a host "true".
visit "http://true".
open $PROFILE/sessionstore.js and search for "true:true".

this seems to need investigating.
