If address in location bar is highlighted, going back erases the location
Using a build off the trunk that I did this morning, I've noticed that the address in the location bar gets erased if the address is selected before hitting back.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any site
2. Go to another site
3. Select the address of the current site in the location bar
4. Go back
5. Address bar will now be blank instead of showing the address of the first site

I'll see if I can track down a regression range.
