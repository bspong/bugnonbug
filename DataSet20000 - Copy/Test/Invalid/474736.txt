Just upgraded, "Organize Bookmarks" no longer works

I just responded to a window offering firefox upgrade and did so.  Prior to upgrade, "Organize Bookmarks" opened a window and allowed full navigation to make changes.  I read that some people had their bookmark file corrupted or deleted.  Mine is there but after the upgrade, a different window opens and is virtually empty.  I'm frustrated as I've spent over 2 hours on this site trying to do the right thing in reporting this problem and have to say that no one else stated exactly this problem and, although you ask that we don't post bugs older than 2 weeks, this is not older than 2 weeks for me and your voluminous bug lists do not show any dates that can be of help to me in determining whether or not I should report it.  Also, all the codes don't make sense to me, looking like some are resolved when mine doesn't work.  I'm betting there's some place to find out what the codes mean but I just don't have any more time to spend on this.  I hope this helps.  Those of us out here that are not computer tech experts cannot possibly help you if you don't help us better.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Be in Firefox
2.Regular bookmarks, individual and folders appear
3.Click on "Organize Bookmarks"
4.Small window opens with a few items, but not my bookmarks except the toolbar bookmarks.
Actual Results:  
as stated

Expected Results:  
Full window should open with access to change location etc. of individual bookmarks.

This is pretty straightforward.  It's not a crash or a hangup.  It happens just like this, every time, since the update:  refreshing doesn't help, restarting doesn't help, my bookmarks are NOT corrupted, they are NOT deleted.  I just don't have access to be able to organize bookmarks.
