History shows duplicate items until a search is performed, whether or not the search should filter any items.  Duplicates reappear when "Show Places" is clicked again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Safari and browse to several pages
2. Quit Safari
3. Launch Firefox and browse to several pages
4. Import Safari profile data into Firefox
5. Show Places
6. Select History from Places sidebar
7. Click in History search box and press <Return>
8. Click Show Places again
Actual Results:  
After step (6), 18 sites appear in the History list, including several that appear to be duplicates (same name and URI, different timestamps).  After step (7), only 14 sites are listed.  Step (8) returns to the same view as step (6), including duplicates.

After step (6), today's date is highlighted in the calendar.  After (7), the entire month is.  It's counterintuitive that fewer results be shown for the month than for only today.

Expected Results:  
Performing an empty search should not filter the results.  Whether duplicate items are listed should be consistent throughout all views of the History.
