freezes with this stylesheet/content combination
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030728 Mozilla Firebird/0.6.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030728 Mozilla Firebird/0.6.1

The following text, as an HTML web page, will freeze Mozilla and Firebird.

<html>     
<head>     
<style>
body
{
    font-size: small;
}   
</style>
</head> 
<body>  
&mdash;
</body>
</html>

I can:
  - remove the &mdash;
  - remove the "body {" and "}" from the stylesheet
  - remove the "font-size: small;"
Any one of those removals will cause firebird to render happily.
The combination freezes the entire UI.

This test case is winnowed from the page
 
http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/26005;jsessionid=aaa5-sZ_al1XNN

which is much more complex and has a separate stylesheet.
I've run across this several times in the wild but never been able to pin
down the page because it wasn't the active tab.

This is a real killer, requiring me to restart the browser.
The browser is not spinning - it's blocked on a select() call.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Check the above sample text into foo.html.
2. Fire up firebird on file:///foo.html (adjust to suit).
3. See how the whole UI is locked.

Actual Results:  
Frozen user interface for browser.


Expected Results:  
Rendered an mdash (or em dash?).
