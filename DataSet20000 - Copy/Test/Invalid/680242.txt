Steps to reproduce:

Opened http://www.amishcountrylanes.com/Pages/hs3606.shtml and clicked "Next Photo"  


Actual results:

nothing


Expected results:

show next photo

the "Next Photo" button is part of an HTML form embedded in an HTML object. Only a problem with Firefox 6, works fine in Firefox 5, 4, 3 as well as IE8, Chrome and Safari.

Same problem occurs with other HTML forms embedded in objects.
