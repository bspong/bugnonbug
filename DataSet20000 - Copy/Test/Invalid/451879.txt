No direct way to the Yahoo page I created.

The home page takes me to a Yahoo default page.  I then have to sign in, each time, to get to the page I created. http://cm.my.yahoo.com/.  Removing the # in the home page does nothing.   I.E. has no problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.http://cm.my.yahoo.com/    as  Home Page
2.Start Firefox,  any Version
3.Must Sign In to get to my page
Actual Results:  
I go to http://cm.my.yahoo.com/  which is in the layout I built

Expected Results:  
Direct to the page I created in Yahoo.
