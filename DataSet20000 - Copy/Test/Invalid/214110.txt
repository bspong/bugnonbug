toolbar buttons should have context-sensitive menus revealing otherwise hidden
or unavailable, yet related functions.  back/forward are already menubuttons
that provide more options when you right-click them.  why not the others?  for
example, the reload context could have -reload, -force reload, -reload all tabs.
 home could have -go home, -set current page(s) as homepage.  see this thread
for a more complete list of examples:

additionally, some new buttons could be added such as an image button.  it's
primary function would toggle display/loading of images.  the context menu could
have -toggle loading/display of images, -toggle auto image resizing, -toggle
image animation, -image manager (image blocking permissions), -reload images

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
right-click a toolbar button (other than back/forward).
Actual Results:  
all you get is -Customize...

Expected Results:  
display a popup context menu with more button-related functions
