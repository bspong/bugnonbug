Firefox causing major memory leaks on the Vista Operating system

Been messing around with the "infamous" Vista since the day it was released (installed on a brand new Toshiba).

Over the past months I had been noticing Vista slowing down to a virtual standstill (typing with 2 second lags, etc...) and thought "what a piece of junk" Vista is... Well those where my thoughts before I began running the "Windows Task Manager".

To my great surprise and sadness I noticed the cause of the problem being Firefox.

After 6 months of web development with Firefox on Vista I have realized the "Fox" may have more memory leaks than Windows NT. (Booo!)

After about 5 or so hours of coding and having an average of 7 tabs open, the memory consumption of Firefox is astronomical. Just before closing down Firefox, the browser has reached 300,000K of memory usage according to "Windows Task Manager".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load Fireofox on Vista and wait
2. Running Gran Paradiso no plugins... and it happens
3. It is a really big problem
Actual Results:

I am totally aware that Vista is a freaking turtle but there is no excuse for a browser to consume 300 megs of memory in 5 hours.
