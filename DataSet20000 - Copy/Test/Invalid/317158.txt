When you visit the site http://www.nclax.com, there's a menu at the top of the page that causes a dynamic drop down menu to appear when the mouse hovers over it. Each item on the menu is a link to another page as most can discern. The links work normally when left clicking, but when you middle click on one of the links to open it in another tab, the link does not open. Now the dynamic menu appears to be mostly based on javascript, so I'm assuming that this is a browser issue and is fixable. Let me know if I'm totally off.

On a side note, some other sites with dynamic menus built with flash also have similar behavior. Although that may be out of the hands of the developers as it probably pertains to the flash plugin.

Alright, that was my two cents. Sorry if it sounds noobish, I'm not as knowledgeable with coding as alot of you guys are.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.nclax.com.
2. Hover the mouse over one of the links in the dynamic menus at the top of the page.
3. Move the mouse down over one of the links.
4. Middle click one of the links to attempt to open it in another window.

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
The link should open in another tab, or at the very least, open.
