Unwanted automatic loading of firefox/2.0.0.20 caused PC to crash, even after removing it, and take away all bookmarks. Occasionally, it comes at 50% up but after hitting twice a new flag that shows "STOP SCRIPT."  All the normal FF functions were wiped out, even after reloading FF 2.0.0.4. All these problems started after it automatically downloaded FF 3.5. last weekend. PLEASE HELP WITH SIMPLE STEP OF INSTRUCTIONS IN ENGLISH. THANKS A MILLION. Alfonso.
