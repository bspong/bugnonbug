If I have two tabs or windows open (usually both with flash content but maybe not always), and I close the second tab or window, the first flash will go grey. Example: youtube videos.

Sometimes this will also happen when navigating to a second youtube video page in the same tab.

I never had this problem until the Ubuntu Firefox 3 Beta 5 came out yesterday. For example, Beta 4 worked perfectly. 



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a youtube page with a flash video
2. Open a second youtube page with another flash video
3. Close down the second page
Actual Results:  
The video on the first page goes gray and stops working.

Expected Results:  
The first video should still work properly

I am using Ubuntu Hardy (beta) with:

File name: npwrapper.libflashplayer.so
           Shockwave Flash 9.0 r115
