yahoo tool bar quits working in newer versions of firefox, I use an older version to keep it working
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.20) Gecko/20110803 Firefox/3.6.20 GTB7.1 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build ID: 20110803131630

Steps to reproduce:

I had to go back to 3.6 version to get yahoo tool bar to appear every time.  It works great.


Actual results:

When I upgrade to newer versions of Firefox I have to keep doing the yahoo tool bar over and over. It only works once or twice when I set it up.  I use this tool bar a lot so returning to older version is the only way I can be sure the tool bar won't lose my settings.


Expected results:

Should be unaffected by newer firefox updates.
