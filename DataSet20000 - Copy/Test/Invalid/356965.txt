I noticed that when an IMG tag references a URI with two dots (periods) in the href attribute, the referenced image is not rendered.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an HTML page which contains an IMG tag whose href points to an image file matching the pattern: /.*\.\.jpg/
2. View the page in Firefox 1.5.0.7, note that the image is not rendered.
3. Confirm that another browser (IE6 for example) does render the image.

Actual Results:  
No image is rendered in Firefox.  Images were rendered as expected in IE6.

Expected Results:  
I expected the browser to render the images similarly to IE6.

Firefox was able to view the images directly when 'View Image' was selected from the context menu.
