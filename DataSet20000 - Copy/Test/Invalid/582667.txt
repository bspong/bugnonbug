It seems that there is a memory leak in firefox. at application start all is normal, but after a while sometimes the allocated memory increases over 1GB, then I have to restart. 

additionally, very often when I come back to my PC (I never exit firefox when I leave my room) I see a Runtime Error in one of the C++ Libraries, the content of the error window is
<Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library (titlebar)
Runtime Error!
Programm ...firefox.exe

The application has requested the runtime to terminate it in an unusual way.
Please contakt .....>

Clicking Ok stops firefox

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start firefox and open a webpage like googlemail (I'm always logged in the whole day)
2.open a second window or tab and start to browse whatever you want
Defect: sometimes, after a while the memory increases, also the CPU load increases due to firefox
3. keep openend firefox and check memory after about 5 hours

Actual Results:  
mostly when I came back to work with my PC the error message described above was displayed and also the memory increased over 1GB



Expected Results:  
no error message, memory normal

Unfortunately I can't give you more information how to reproduce it. I never had it before I changed to version 3.5.?, one of the latest (done two weeks ago) and now I have the same problems with the latest version 3.6.8. 

the only Idea I have is the fact that around the same time I changed to V3.5.? I was asked also to update JAVA.

I Use Java 6.0.20 and .Net 1.2.1
