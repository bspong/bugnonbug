I have lots of tabs (more than 10) open.
I could not find close button on the inactive tabs.
Close button is there only on active tab.

When number of open tabs reduced to less than 10, close buttons on inactive tabs started appearing.

Wish to have close buttons on all open tabs irrespective of whether they are inactive or active.

Screen resolution: 1280x1024.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start new instance of firefox.
2. Open around 10 (or more) tabs
Actual Results:  
No close button for open inactive tabs.

Expected Results:  
Each tab should have a close button
