serif fonts used in Mozilla menus and other standard Windows widgets

I recently changed my theme to Aluminum Alloy 3. After changing to this theme,
the menus (toplevel and context), as well as the URL entry textbox and the
Google search textbox appear in serif fonts... the thing is, in every other
application, the fonts are sans-serif. This leads me to believe that this is a
problem specific to Mozilla. In fact, I strongly suspect it is an issue that can
be found in the main Mozilla tree, since I also suffer this serif problem in
Thunderbird. Serif fonts are really not good to use in UI elements, and it makes
it hard for me to use it. Finally, this theme also reduces the size of the fonts
used in the GUI widgets from 12 points to 10 points, so I suspect that this is
causing problems for Mozilla.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the Aluminum Alloy 3 theme from http://www.deviantart.com/view/2964142/.
2. If you haven't installed a utility such as StyleXP to use third-party themes,
refer to http://www.lightstar1.com/install.htm for an easier way to do it.
3. Install the Aluminum Alloy 3 theme.
4. Set the Aluminium Alloy 3 theme.
5. Start Firebird or Thunderbird
Actual Results:  
All the menus and standard Windows widgets (textboxes, labels, and such) appear
in a serif font.

Expected Results:  
Not used a serif font...

This is with the default theme in Mozilla. I'm pretty sure it's not a problem
with the theme.
