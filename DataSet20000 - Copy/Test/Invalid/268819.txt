I'm developing an ASP file wich prints XSLT data to the browser. The included
file in the XML file has the extention ASP.

The error 'Error loading stylesheet: An XSLT stylesheet does not have an XML
mimetype' is raised by the interpretor of FireFox. In IE it's possible to use
different extentions.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a generated XSLT stylsheet and use the ASP file extention
2. Include/link it in the XML file
3. Open the URL to the xml file

Actual Results:  
The next error apears: Error loading stylesheet: An XSLT stylesheet does not
have an XML mimetype

Expected Results:  
Show the HTML output.
