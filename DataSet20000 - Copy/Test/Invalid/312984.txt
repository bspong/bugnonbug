Set default browser to Firefox and home page to about blank.

The URL about:blank  when entered into the Firefox navigation bar will get you a
blank page just like hitting the Home button.

Enter about:blank into the Windows run dialog (Start => Run on Win2K in classic
mode) and you will get Internet Explorer with a blank page instead!  

I expected FireFox.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set firefox as the default browser.
2. Set home page to about:blank
3. In the run dialog (Start=>Run on Win2K in classic mode) enter about:blank and
press OK.

Actual Results:  
Internet explorer came up with a blank.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have been launched with a blank page.

I tried to create a file association for an "extension" of about:blank and it
did not change the behavior.  This might not be fixable.
