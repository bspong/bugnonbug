When I first set browser.ctrlTab.previews to true, I almost filed a bug report because I saw no dialog, even with two tabs open.  Of course, I needed to have at least three tabs open.  I would like to be able to change the minimum number of tabs that must be open before the preview pane displays.  Personally, I would like it to default to 1.  I find that users get confused when hotkeys change behavior based on the current context.

Reproducible: Always
