Popup blocker does not work properly when opened http://indianrail.gov.in/between_Imp_Stations.html url. After opening the url initially, i see that popup has been blocked by minefield but when i click anywhere on the page say between Source station and Destination station a popup appears with url http://n.admagnet.net/d/pc/.. 
Working on this site is a disaster and after hour an hour browsing I see lots of popup opened. Indianrail is one of the most visited website in India. Also I don't see any popup in chrome.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the url http://indianrail.gov.in/between_Imp_Stations.html
2. Click on the webpage.
3. Popup appears
Actual Results:  
Annoying Popup appear even when I have enable Block Pop-up windows in preference.

Expected Results:  
No popup should appear.

Please address this issue in Firefox4. It has been there in all releases of firefox and it is really annoying.
