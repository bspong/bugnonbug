Adds "file:///" in front of URL passed through command line

When my mail client passes a request to open a web page to Firefox with -new-tab a new tab is opened but Firefox adds "file:///" in front of the URL, and doesn't of course fine the page. This is on my Fedora Core 3 system which has linc-1.0.3-3.1 installed. I even rebooted after the install. On my Fedora Core 4 system, using the same version of everything, there is no problem. I've compared the .mailcap and .url.helpers files on the two systems and they are the same.
