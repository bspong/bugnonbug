when i launch firefox, the screen turns blank, then it comes back again and all
the colors are distorted, including my taskbar and quick launch bar.  it's
almost like everything (icons, words...) is blocked out and shaded a dark green.
 when i exit firefox, the screen turns blank again and then i'm taken back to my
regular screen.

i created a new profile and that didn't work.  then i downloaded mozilla and had
no problems there, so it is firefox specific.  i have XP, but used to have win98.
