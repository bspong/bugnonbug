When initially loading a new window firefox stalls and no links or menus respond - only since latest update
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.15) Gecko/20110303 Firefox/3.6.15 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0E)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.15) Gecko/20110303 Firefox/3.6.15 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0E)

Only since updating to Firefox 3.6.15 from 3.6.13 or .14 have I seen/had this issue.
The window is stalling/freezing as it loads website and I have no use of links or menus for about 10-30 seconds.  This has happened for a number of websites but not all that I have gone to since the update.  
Examples include; www.cara.com, ca.yahoo.com and www.ctv.ca.  I can not attribute this to my system as it has never happened before and I have made no hardware or software changes other than updating Firefox.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Tried multiple websites and occurred on about 50% of the dozen sites I tried.
2.Have also closed just Firefox and reopened with no change.
3.Have also rebooted with no change.
Actual Results:  
Had no change with all troubleshooting.  However it does not happened for every link within one particular website.  

Expected Results:  
Hoped to stop on its own for whatever reason!!  

Not quite a major issue, but it is very annoying since it only started happening after updating to this new version!
