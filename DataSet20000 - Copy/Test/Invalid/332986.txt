In Firefox for non-Intel machnes, Spellbound (dev version) works great.  For Firefox Intel version, it doesn't do anything even though it installs successfully.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install SpellBound dev version from forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=351130
2. Restart Firefox
3. Go to Google and type garbage into the search bar.  
4) Right click and select 'Check Spelling'

Actual Results:  
Nothing Happens

Expected Results:  
A window should pop-open with spelling suggestions.

I belive this is a Firefox issue because it works on all builds except for the Intel Mac version. :)
