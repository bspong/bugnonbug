Incredibly slow startup times

Firebird takes 5 seconds to load on my pc on a fresh boot.  Other browsers come
up almost instantaneously.  I have got a power machine:  P4 2 mhz chip, 500 mg
ram, 500 mhz bus.  I think I can get better hardware, but only marginally so. 

I have another older box I also use.  It is packs a PII 333mhz chip, & 191mb ram.
It is a dual boot with win98 second edition on one side and Knoppix/debian on
the other side.

There firebird takes 13 seconds to load on a fresh boot while IE 5 comes up
almost instantly and phoenix with quickstart ( on the windows side ) comes up in
about 1 second.

I guess at some point every machine, no matter how much of a killer it was when
it came out, becomes "slow" by current standards and is not worth the time of
the developer in supporting it.

However, a lot of people are still on PIIs( and less ) and browsers far older in
tech then firebird run better.

My PII is still incredibly useful and fast on my linux partition( using icewm ).
The only thing missing is a fast browser.  If I had that I could have gone on
using the PII for several more years.

Just a thought.  Please don't be offended.  I have been very impressed with
firebird( and mozilla in general ).  My ONLY issue has been performance on startup.

It seems like it is not a priority so I am posting this bug/feature request here.

Firebird is a dazzingly modern, sleek browser.  Please make it perform as well
as old clunkers like netscape 4.8 and IE 5
