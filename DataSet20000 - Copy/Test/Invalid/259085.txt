installer buttons use system locale instead of installer.ini

The buttons in firefox-installer take translation from system locales and not
from installer.ini. Problem is that there are various systems with various
translations (for example when I use gnome and use only gtk). Also some useres
install translated versions on systems without locales.

So, I'm not able to write localized text for installer because i can't write:
"click button 'XXX'" because I don't know how it will be called.

Translation from install.ini is ignored.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. untar installer
2. edit install.ini
3. run ./firefox-installer

Actual Results:  
Installer buttons are translated from system locales.

Expected Results:  
Installer buttons should be translated as defined in install.ini
