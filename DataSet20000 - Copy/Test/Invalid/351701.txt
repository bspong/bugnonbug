Having to look for an undocumented option in about:config is too difficult for the average user, and honestly not so straight even for more experienced ones, if I had to find out in Bugzilla why all my tabs were gone. Please consider that it's a behaviour that quite a lot of people find annoying (see bug 216346 and ALL its duplicates). IMHO the preference should be set to false by default (the less destructive behaviour) but since the developers think true is better, a radio button or a checkbox at least would be useful under Edit - Preferences - Tabs.

Reproducible: Always
