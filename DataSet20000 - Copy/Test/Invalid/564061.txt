Dear Bugzilla Team:

I cannot access one of my personal banking sites (www.chase.com) since Mozilla upgraded to version 3.6.3.  I can get to chase.com, but when I enter my ID and password, it locks up and is unresponsive.  I have tried uninstalling Firefox 3.6.3 & reloading it...but this problem persists.  I have no problem accessing my Chase banking information using Inernet Explorer.  I'm not the only one reporting this.  If you check your forums using "chase.com" in the search criteria, you will find others.  So far, I have seen no good solutions offered.  For now, I will continue to use Internet Explorer when I need to access my Chase banking information.  If you have any additional questions, you may call or e-mail me.

Best Regards,

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Mozilla Firefox
2.Type Chase.com in browser window
3.Enter a valid user ID and password
Actual Results:  
Mozilla Firefox 3.6.3 locks up.  Task manager shows it as "unresponsive".

Expected Results:  
When working properly, this opens my personal banking information.  

You will have to create an account with Chase in order to research this.  Anyone with a valid Chase credit card can do this.  I'm assuming that someone on the Bugzilla team has a Chase Bank credit or debit card...or a Chase bank checking or savings account.  

This browser worked before the upgrade to 3.6.3, so I'm assuming there is a bug in the newest version of Firefox.
