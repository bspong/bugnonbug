The installation of a new Joomla template ,which is a local zip file, on a server through the administrator panel of Joomla doesn't work, nothing happens. I have tried the same thing with IE and there it works fine. I don't know if Firefox is the problem or the compatibility of Joomla in combination with Firefox.

3. Browse to the package of the new template and click on upload file and install

Actual Results:  
Nothing

An upload of the file and installation on the server
