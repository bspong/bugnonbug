it redirects http://ecafechat.net to http://www.ecafechat.com/x/index.php which is not desired.

Initially I used URL rewrite through .htaccess file for my website. My website has 3 domains parked on each other ecafechat.net, ecafechat.com and ecafechat.co.cc. I redirected all domains to www.ecafechat.com. But now I have removed all rewite rules from .htaccess file and don't want to redirect but still it redirects. In other browsers this is not happening and working fine as expected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I entered the domain test.ecafechat.com then it redirects to www.ecafechat.com/x/index.php
2. I entered ecafechat.net then also it redirects to www.ecafechat.com/x/index.php

Actual Results:  
There is no change in the output whatever I did. 

Expected Results:  
It should not add www automatically to the domain and should not change the top level domain, i.e., if I am entering the url ecafechat.net it must redirect to ecafechat.net/x/index.php instead of www.ecafechat.com/x/index.php. It shoud not change the domain name.

I am using the default theme. I just downloaded the installer and install it. Nothing is changed from default.
