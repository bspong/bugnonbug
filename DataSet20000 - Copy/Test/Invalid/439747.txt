I cannot log on AccesD with firefox 3.0. Worked with 2.0.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)

After entering my account number and my password, the site reports a server error. It must have something to do with how firefox 3 handles security because I tried Agent Switcher (IE6) and it didn't work either. I don't think its the site faults since firefox 2.0 is working.

Reproducible: Always
