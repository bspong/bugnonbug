delays page display when AAAA record not available.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.8

The domain takes ages to resolve. I think this is because their DNS server does
not respond properly to AAAA (IPv6) requests and thus the requests have to
timeout before Firefox displays the page as retrieved via IPv4. For e.g.
www.yahoo.com, the AAAA request immediately returns a negative response and thus
firefox can display the page with IPv4 almost immediately.

The problem is that many domains don't handle AAAA properly and thus quite a few
pages take ages to load in firefox, which first queries IPv4 then IPv6 and only
then displays the page.

Couldn't it be made to use IPv4 if available for now? IPv6 isn't really
production yet. Or maybe the timeout can be decreased from 25 seconds to
something like 4 or less.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Fire up a packet sniffer for port 53 tcp/udp
2. Visit www.allmusic.com in firefox
Actual Results:  
25 seconds load time.

Expected Results:  
load immediately when the IPv4 A request returns.
