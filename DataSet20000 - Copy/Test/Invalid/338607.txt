When downloading a .torrent file, Firefox will not pass the fille correctly to the Azureus application.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.0.3) Gecko/20060426 Firefox/1.5.0.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.0.3) Gecko/20060426 Firefox/1.5.0.3

When firefox is set to use the helper application Azureus to handle .torrent files, after the file has finished downloading it successfully opens the Azureus program, but does not correctly relay the file.  In essence, the downloaded file is not passed correctly to azureus and therefore one must then manually open the file.  When using other browsers this is not a problem and works correctly, the problem only occurs when using Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download a .torrent file
2.Tell firefox to open the file with azureus
Actual Results:  
Once downloaded Azureus will open, but the file is not passed correctly and the downloaded file will not open.


Expected Results:  
The file should be correctly opened by Azureus.

This was not a problem with pre 1.5 versions of Firefox, and possibly with early 1.5 versions, but I can not remember.
