Allow to clear single items from the Clear Recent History dialog via per-item "Clear Now" buttons
... by adding "Clear ... Now" (or similar) buttons after all items. This nicely allows to drop these buttons from the reorganized pref window (as done in bug 340677) but still prevents unnecessary clicks, i.e. you don't have to uncheck all items if you e.g. only want to clear the cache.
