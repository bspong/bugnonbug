i recently moved from mozilla 2.5 to 3.0.13 because my myspace player wouldnt load, saying i had no flash player installed and had to fetch it at macromedia's (altough any other website displayed flash correctly). have 3.0.13 solved the problem.

i upgraded to 3.5.2 today, to see how it was, and my problem re-appears in the exact same way..."you dont have flash installed, download it now". only on myspace, again. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to a myspace page with firefox 2, no player appears
2.go to a myspace page with firefox 3.5.2, no player appears
3.go to a myspace page with firefox 3.0.13, everything works fine
Actual Results:  
no music player appears

Expected Results:  
a working music player...

i use kubuntu 8.04 on a pc laptop. i have flash upgraded.
