Add Flag to distribution.ini to enable Installer Survey
Please add a new flag to the distribution.ini to enable the Kampyle survey so future versions have an option to only enable it for specific funnelcake builds.  This will allow us (Kev) to modify funnelcake and add the flag when we want the survey enabled.

One more note from Rob: "Also, it was suggested that the base of the url to use should be the value so if you ever want to change the url it can be done via the distribution.ini."
