The default user changed somehow and I lost all of my bookmarks.

A screen appeared after entering a website called "funnyjunk.com" I have entered
this website many times before with no problems. The screen that appeared asked
if I wanted to make firefox my default browser. I said no, and every time I
tried to open Mozilla, that screen would appear. It finally created a new
default user somehow, and I lost all of my bookmarks, etc. How can I get back to
my default user? That screen won't appear anymore.

Reproducible: Always
