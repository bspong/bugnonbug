Firefox shutsdown on its own and sometimes when I shutdown firefox and try to re-open, it tells me firefox is already running therefore it won't let me open it again.

Firefox closes on it's own and an error repot is sent. It also says firefox is already running when I try to open firefox. Therefore, it won't let me open firefox and I have to re-start the computer.

Reproducible: Sometimes
