Cookies corrupted when installing using built-in installer, gmail doesn't load
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9b3pre) Gecko/2007121204 Minefield/3.0b3pre

When I use the built-in installer for a new version, my cookies get corrupted and gmail refuses to show my inbox. I have to delete the cookies to get it to work (with all annoying consequences).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run the installer to update FireFox/Minefield (I have gmail loaded)
2. Restart FireFox/Minefield
3. Try to load gmail at the URL given above
Actual Results:  
A warning that gmail could not load, with a link to a Help page which tells me to remove the cache and the cookies. Removing the cookies makes it work again.

Expected Results:  
Gmail should be able to lopad, cookies should not be corrupted by the installer.
