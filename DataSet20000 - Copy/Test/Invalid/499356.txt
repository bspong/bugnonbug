PDF Creator and RealPlayer extensions not compatible with Firefox 3.5

When I open up Firefox 3.5, I receive a list of extensions working in Firefox 3.0 that are not compatible with Firefox 3.5. Among them are the RealPlayer Video extension and the PDF Creator toolbar extension. PDF Creator lets you create a .pdf from the very web page and doubles up as a search engine. RealPlayer lets you download web-based videos. I would like these extensions to work with the new browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox 3.5
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Get a window with incompatible extensions which are deactivated, then you click OK and Firefox 3.5 opens without those extensions.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should open normally with working extensions.

I use the default theme.
