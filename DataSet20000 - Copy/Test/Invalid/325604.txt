With 1.5.0 you could reduce the width of the window until the address bar only displayed the icon and the scrollbar would remain visible.  With 1.5.0.1 has a fairly large minimum size (roughly 1.5 times the standard width of a single tab in the default theme) and this results in the scrollbar vanishing sooner.

Given that I've customised the menu bar to include the navigation bar, this happens at a fairly large width.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Display content that needs a scrollbar
2) Reduce width of window
3) Watch scrollbar vanish
Actual Results:  
Scrollbar vanishes

Expected Results:  
I'd expect the location bar to keep shrinking, as it used to

Occurs with the default theme.
