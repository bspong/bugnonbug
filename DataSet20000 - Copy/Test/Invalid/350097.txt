"Open Location..." behavior inconsistant when opening new window

When a window is open and File->Open Location... is invoked (either via the menu or the keyboard) focus is given to the address bar.

When no window is open and this command is invoked, a new window opens and shows the "Open Web Location" dialog. It seems to me that open location should behave in this context in exactly the same way as the new window command.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close all windows
2. Invoke File->Open Location...
3.
