firefox connect error  rips window focus away from other tasks

If I am attempting to connect to a site which does not respond  rapidly (www.bmtmicro.com has been most troublesome)

and if I continue to do some other applic while waiting, then when everyone decides the site is not responding, the error routine rips control of the system away from me (right in the midst of typing) and presents me with a Firefix window and the error message.  

If I had attempted to connect in a 'new tab' - than that tab is close and I am also returned to the previous tab.

All in all, a very frustrating interface problem.

Thank you

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
using Firefox attemp to connect to disconnected site
switch to another application - it doesn't matter what


Expected Results:  
I would expect an error message within the firefox application, but don't expect to lose control of the software I am currently running.
