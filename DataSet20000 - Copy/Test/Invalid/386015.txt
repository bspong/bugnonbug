To conserve paper, I print even pages first reversed and then I take the even pages and put them into the input tray to print odd pages only (not reversed)on the other side. In this way I get double sided printing done. When the total page count is odd the system fails. When a reverse order of even pages is requested, page 2 is duplicated. When odd pages are to be printed, it prints pages all the odd pages except the last one.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Select a PDF document with an odd number of pages and print the even pages in reverse order. The last page (page 2) will be duplicated.
2.Select a PDF document with a odd number of pages. Print the odd pages only. The last page is not printed.
3.
Actual Results:  
For example, when a reverse order of even pages is requested for a 9 page PDF article, it results in printing pages 8,6,4,2,2. (Page 2 is duplicated and is extra). Then when I ask for the odd pages to be printed, it prints pages 1,3,5,7. The last page is missing (Page 9 is not printed).

Expected Results:  
When even pages in reverse order are printed, an extra last page (page 2) should not be printed.
When odd pages only are printed, the last odd page should be printed.

In the above example, a 9 page PDF document, even reversed pages printed should be printed as follows: 8,6,4,2. The odd pages should be printed 1,3,5,7,9.
I'm using  Adobe Reader version 8.1.0 and Foxfire 2.0.0.4. I've done double sided printing using two passes before with earlier versions of Foxfire and Adobe Reader with no problems like this.
