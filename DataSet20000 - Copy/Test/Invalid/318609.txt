Document names beginning with "adm_" make elements with classes vanish

Files beginning "adm_*.html" or "adm_*.cfm" and the following simple content:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en">
<head>
  <title>Test</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="example">This will disappear because it has a named class.</div>
  <div>This will not</div>
</body>
</html>

...end up making the content of "example" briefly appear, but disappear once the page loads. If you rename the file to test.html, the behavior goes away. If you View Source when the problem appears, the file looks normal, but if you Save Page, then 'style="display: none;" is added to the "example" div in the saved version (and indeed every element which has a class name specified).

The behavior was not present in Firefox 1.0.7 and earlier, but appeared at some point in the Deer Park betas. I didn't report it until now because my "test.html" pages that I prepared to illustrate the problem magically worked....

Reproducible: Always
