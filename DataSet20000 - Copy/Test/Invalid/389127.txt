when using a script monger, such as the Web Developers Toolkit or Greasemonkey, using document.writeln() or window.write() causes the whole process to loose keyboard input.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a new greasemonkey script that contains "document.writeln('hello');" as the script body
2.set the @includes to include say, google.com/lol
3.go to google.com/lol
4. try typing ANYWHERE in the interface
Actual Results:  
no input at all is accepted by the interface until i Force Quit FF

Expected Results:  
the interface should act as normal because of how the interface is designed.

Using any other os it works fine -- linux, windows, anything, but Mac OS X just flails. this DOES NOT occur also on Intel based macs. [crit because it makes the entire UI Unusable]
no themes are being used (other than the default), addons are Greasemonkey, Web Developer Toolkit ['Web Developer'], talkback and the DOM Inspector.
