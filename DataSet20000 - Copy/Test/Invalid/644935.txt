in FF4 it seems as if the context menu in windows created by extensions are transparent.

since i'm sitting on Win7, already tried to turn off aero - but it's still the same.

tested extensions so far:
* securityheroes maximum adblock free (in the 'disabled items' window)
* tamper data (the 'requests' window)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install the tamper-data extension
2. open the tamper-data ('request')window
3. open a webpage, the tamper-data window fills with data
4. right-click one of the upper entries

Actual Results:  
the context-menu-background is transparent

Expected Results:  
the context-menu-background is not transparent so that one can read what is written on the items

just upped a screenshot which shows the problem:
