Location bar returns bookmark results despite not being asked to
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Basically, I had this problem on 3.5.8 as well.  I tell Firefox 3.6 not to show bookmark results in the location bar autocomplete, yet it does.  It returns a result from one of my feeds, the Latest News feed that comes with the install.

I have no idea how to reproduce it I'm afraid.  It just happens.

This happens even after I clear all private data.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clear private data, set result to only return history
2. Enter "y" into the location bar
Actual Results:  
Autocompletes to a result on the feed (for me, it's http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8530847.stm)

Expected Results:  
Nothing should happen.
