Characters within private ranges don't appear unless you define them to use an installed font with CSS. Characters in the official range appear automatically as soon as a font that covers them is installed.

For example if a font for Cuneiform is installed (U+12000 to U+1236E) the characters appear automatically. When a font for Tengwar (U+E000 to U+E07F) is installed they characters remain unknown block symbols.
