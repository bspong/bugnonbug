So i did a live chat with verizon, they said no idea when their application would work with firefox. Then they said "oh see if firefox can fix it" 
-- It's in my mind their app that needs fix ,, but I'm just letting you guys know to. Maybe you can fix it.

Sorry if i wasted your time for something that is likely Verizon's buggy apps problem.
