If you go to slashdot, or any page, and hold down shift and double click on a
section of text, it will disappear.  If you hold down shift, double-click AND
hold down the button on the second click, you can move your mouse around and
actually remove _almost_ every text, image, link, button, or even table cell on
the page.  This can be reproduced on any page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open webpage
2. Hold down the shift key
3. Double click on a section of text (non-link or button)
OR
4: Double click and hold down the mouse button and move it around

Actual Results:  
3: Text will disappear
4: Every section of text, image, link, button or table cell that you hover over
is removed from the page

Expected Results:  
Nothing?

I and the guy in the cube next to me both tested this out with the 1.0.1 release
of Firefox and got the same result.  The only extension we are using which we
have in common is the web developer bar (
http://www.chrispederick.com/work/firefox/webdeveloper/ ), which could possibly
(maybe?) be the culprit.
