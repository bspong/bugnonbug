Netstream buffer is too restrictive, should be larger to improve performance like in IE

Sorry for the IE reference, but it seems the netstream buffer could use bump in size to improve download performance.  Navigating to a flash intensive site can be slow.  On IE, because the buffer is larger, a flash intensive site is darn zippy.  Reference to IE is only for comparison and I must state, I do not use it personally.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Best way to reproduce is over a wireless connection:  Try with both IE and firefox browsers.

1.nav browser to:
http://www.playercore.com/users/qos/Final/Main-Final-TestPlan.html
2.select movie - H264 Trailers 720p
3.let it play
Actual Results:  
In IE - Playback is smooth and buffer is steady.
In Firefox - Buffer is sporadic and playback can be interrupted.

Expected Results:  
Firefox - Buffer should be steady and playback smooth, if netstream buffer would be increased.
