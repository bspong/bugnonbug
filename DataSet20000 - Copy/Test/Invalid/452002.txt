The fix for bug 416225 doesn't make sense: "Unsorted bookmarks" is misleading because it can be sorted. I support "Default" or "Starred" or something else that won't be misinterpreted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right-click on Unsorted Bookmarks in the left pane in the Library.
2. Select Sort By Name.
Actual Results:  
The folder is indeed sorted.

Expected Results:  
Unsorted, since that is the name of the folder!
