I went to my bookmarks tab today and all of my bookmarks are gone. I also checked organize bookmarks just to be sure, and they really aren't there. On closer inspection, I realized that the bookmarks that I put on the firefox toolbar were also gone. This is very important to me, not only because of the bookmarks I have lost but also because of the bookmarks that I may lose in the future. Please help.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open FireFox
2. Open the Bookmarks tab
3. Observe the missing bookmarks
Actual Results:  
I still had no bookmarks

Expected Results:  
It should have given me back my bookmarks

There is one thing. Yesterday later on in the night I went to open FireFox, and the homepage informed me that I had successfully installed the latest version of FireFox. I didnt really look at any bookmarks then, so I dont know if it was the cause.
