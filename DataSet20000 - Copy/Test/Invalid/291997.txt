Firefox does not show bulletpoints or numbers in unordered and ordered lists

In all pages with ordered and unordered lists, the bullets and/or numbers will
not show up.  I have looked at many pages and any with ordered/unordered list
have the problem of the list items not having numbers or bullets.  This is just
a random bug that it seems no one has noticed.

Reproducible: Always
