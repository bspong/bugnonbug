Create a mechanism to notify observers when all panels are ready in the highlighter
This is a follow-up bug to bug 650794.

As more tools are being added to the Highlighter, we'll need a mechanism to notify interested observers when all panels are active and ready.

"not sure how we'll do that. The panels could be opening in any given order and will certainly be ready in a non-deterministic order. Maybe we could register a listener in IUI that waits for all of the panel ready notifications to arrive and then fires a "ALLREADY!" notice to its observers."
