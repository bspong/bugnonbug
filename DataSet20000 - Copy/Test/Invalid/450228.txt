First of all the design mode has a problem. If i create an iframe in a div, enable design mode on it and remove the div node from the dom tree and then re add it the design mode the iframe will reset and not keep design mode on either the contents.
Another bug: focus a textbox and write something in it. Then loose focus and then refocus and use undo on it. It will work. But for textarea this does not happen.
And yet another: I have 2 divs positioned absolutely within a container. In each we have yet another div only one of them has z-index: 1. The inner div will be on top of the other subdiv regardless of the order of the containing divs. This did not happen in ff2. It used to be just like in guis where what's on top depends on the parent container and cannot be raised above another which's parent is below the first one's.
Hope this helps with the new engine and great work guys!
