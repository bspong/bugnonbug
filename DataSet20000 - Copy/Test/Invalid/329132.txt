The embedded RealVideo, on the right side at the linked URL, does not display in PACIFICA Trunk, but does in Fx 1.5.0.1.  All you hear is the audio, but cannot see the video.  I tested this in Safe Mode (using the installer builds).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the latest RealPlayer 10.5
2. Install both Fx 1.5.0.1 and the PACIFICA Trunk build.
3. Using Safe Mode, launch PACIFICA and go to the linked URL.
4. Click the play button on the "CBS NEWS VIDEO" on the right.  Notice that you get audio but no video.
5. Close the browser and launch Fx 1.5.0.1 in Safe Mode.
6. Click the play button on the "CBS NEWS VIDEO" on the right.  Everything should be working fine.
