should be able to 'copy link location' on bookmarks
I think "Copy Link Location" should be added to the bookmark item context menu.
At least with my usage, this is the most common thing I right-click a bookmark for.

Presently, you either have to load the bookmark, then copy the text in the URL
bar, or open the (slow to load) properties dialog, select the text inside, copy
it to the clipboard, and then close the dialog.

One-click access in the context menu would be very helpful when I'm sharing URLs
via IRC/IM.

Setting to UNCO. If someone agrees they can NEW it.
