Firefox startup time is quite a bit slower than IE
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: Firefox 0.9.3

Don't get me wrong.... firefox rocks! I prefer it to IE in most ways. However 
my only complaint is that it starts slower (like say 2-3 seconds for firefox 
rather than <1 second for IE). Not a lot of time but heck it should be 
instantaneous! Any way to achieve faster start times?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click firfox icon
2. The second startup is quicker
3. The third startup is quick too. Its just that first load time.




I wonder if you can't solve this, maybe if you "preload" firefox somewhere 
when the computer starts, if it is the default browser...at least this gives 
the "apprarance" of starting really fast when clicked then.
