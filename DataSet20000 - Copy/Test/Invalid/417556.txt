Build: Minefield/3.0b4pre 
Machine: Windows XP Laptop
Using Minefield since four months, bug started around Feb-10, 2008


When I RIGHT-CLICK

(1) after selecting any text to copy OR
(2) to open a link into new tab 

Minefield simply crashes. Basically, any where on any web page, when you RIGHT-CLICK, Minefield ( Firefox ) simply crashes. Now most of the times after a crash, I get bug reporting window ( and I do report each time )but some times I don't.

This has started around Feb-10 or so. I'm using Minefield on this same Windows XP laptop for over four months without a problem.

Thanks a million if someone can fix this thing.
