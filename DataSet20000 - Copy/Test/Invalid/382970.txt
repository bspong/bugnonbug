When viewing the image:

http://www.phpneoform.com/117/public/system/images/famfamfam/user.png

A 404 error is thrown, despite the fact that this image exists and displays properly in PC version of firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View image http://www.phpneoform.com/117/public/system/images/famfamfam/user.png (does not load)
2. Then view another image in the same dir, eg. http://www.phpneoform.com/117/public/system/images/famfamfam/application_form.png (loads properly)

Actual Results:  
Random png images do not load properly.

Expected Results:  
The image should be displayed, but instead a 404 page is displayed.

directory listing:
http://www.phpneoform.com/117/public/system/images/famfamfam/

shows that the file in question is there (trying safari or another browser shows that the image loads fine and is there)
