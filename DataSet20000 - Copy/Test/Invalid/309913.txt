Firefox locks up at multiple websites and has to be closed w/CtrlAltDel  since I downloaded required security update night of 9/23/05

Cannot read Hotmail, since Firefox locks up.  Same occurs at ING Direct, and
many other websites I have clicked on.  Also cannot open two browser windows at
the same time, that locks up both windows.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type in URL
2.Wait
3.  Starts to load then freezes

Actual Results:  
Had to press CtrlAltDel and manually close Firefox

Expected Results:  
Loaded the site so I could read it as it used to

I am not a techie and don't know what this means.

This has happened at 90% of the websites I've tried to visit since downloading
the upgrade last night.
I had to use MS Explorer for the first time in ages to read my Hotmail.
