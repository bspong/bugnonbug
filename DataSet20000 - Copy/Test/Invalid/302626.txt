When I am surfing the Web, at random times Firefox will bring up a random page,
overwriting the page I am currently visiting.  This is annoying when you are
trying to read the content of the page.  You have to press back and try to find
the place you werte before.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any website
2. After a random time, I will be sent elsewhere, eg Google, Novell, etc
3.
