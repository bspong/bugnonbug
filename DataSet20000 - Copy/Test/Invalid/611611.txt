I've reverted back to beta6 because beta7 is HORRIBLY S...L...O...W...  Keystrokes don't even appear on screen until I've typed for several seconds (~20-40 characters).  Mouse clicks are unresponsive for up to 30 seconds.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run beta7
2. Usability drops through the floor.
3.
Actual Results:  
[try to] use beta7

Expected Results:  
at least as fast a beta6

not S...L...O...W...E...D down
