Can't add exception for SSL certificate

I'm trying to access an iLO webpage which uses self-signed SSL certificate.  If you change any of the network settings on the iLO the SSL certificate gets regenerated and thus changes.  This becomes a problem after a 3rd time as you cannot add an exception for the certificate anymore and thus cannot access the website at all.  This bug can be reproduced every time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Connect to the iLO website for the first time, firefox gives a warning about an invalid SSL certificate, exception can be added for certificate.
2. On the iLO, SSL certificate gets recreated.
3. Connect to the iLO website for the second time, firefox gives a warning about certificate again, exception can be added for certificate.
4. On the iLO, SSL certificate gets recreated again.
5. Connect to the iLO website for the third time, firefox gives the following error (see below), exception button is missing, cannot continue.  Even if you delete the certificate from the Certificate Manager you still do not have the exception button available anymore.
Actual Results:  
Secure Connection Failed

An error occurred during a connection to <website>.

You have received an invalid certificate.  Please contact the server administrator or email correspondent and give them the following information:

Your certificate contains the same serial number as another certificate issued by the certificate authority.  Please get a new certificate containing a unique serial number.

(Error code: sec_error_reused_issuer_and_serial)

The page you are trying to view can not be shown because the authenticity of the received data could not be verified.

    * Please contact the web site owners to inform them of this problem.

Expected Results:  
The exception button should still be available to add the certificate.

A work around is to delete the 'cert8.db' in your profile folder.
