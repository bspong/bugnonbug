Javascript function that receives a variable passed to it cannot have that local variable name objName or else it is returned as undefined by FireFox. Once the variable named is changed the Javascript executes as desired.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
<script language="javascript">
function Text(objID, objName)
{
    alert(objID, objName);
}

<img src="someimage.jpg" id="IMG" name="TestImage" onclick="Test(this.id, this.name);" />
Actual Results:  
objName is returned of undefined by FireFox and FireBug

Expected Results:  
The name of the object.

Shown the name of the object....
