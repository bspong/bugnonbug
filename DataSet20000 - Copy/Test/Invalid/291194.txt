Upgrade/Install fails. I have two unkillable firefox.exe processes even AFTER reboot
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)
Build Identifier: 

I was running firefox 1.0.2 just fine.  Got the update pop-up in the task bar 
and clicked it to update to 1.0.3.  Here is what happened next:

1- Got the message that firefox was running and that it should be closed to run 
the install.  Clicked on the box and the install seemed to proceed nomally. 

2- tried running firefox and firefox just hung like it was waiting for a page 
to show up.  Verified with IE and found that my default page was available.  
Tried several other pages and and firefox was unable to open any pages.

3- tried to uninsall firefox and was given a message that it was running so 
uninstall could not proceed.  I lokked in task manager and saw that this was 
true.  There were two firefox processes.  I tried to kill them; but, they would 
not die.  No messages, but they just kept on running after kill signal.

4- rebooted the system and the firefox processes were STILL running after 
bootup!

5- Went to c:\programfiles\mozilla firefox, and renamed firefox.exe to 
firefox.exe.ben.  Rebooted and firefox.exe was STILL running!

6- Searched all files and folders for firefox.exe and was not able to find the 
executable.  Rebooted again and the process is still running!  

7- tried running install again and was told that firefox had to be closed to 
install.  This time install failed.  neither the installer, nor I could kill 
the firefox.exe processes that are running.

8- Ran a virus check [norton internet security 2004] and no viruses were found.

9- please note, all windows patches are up to date as of yesterday.  Norton is 
uptodate as of today.  I'm running windows XP sp2.

10-  Shutting down the system takes a long time now.  I think it has a hard 
time killing the mozilla processes.

11- I can't reproduce this because i CAN'T uninsall the application to try 
reinstalling it!  This is a huge problem for me.

Reproducible: Always
