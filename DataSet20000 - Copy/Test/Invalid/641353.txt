I just updated to today's nightly builds from ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-mozilla-daily repos. Restarting Firefox changes my default language. As in, after the restart the language of menus in Firefox remains English (US) as it always was. But Google.com, my homepage which opens by default changes to a random language. First time it happened I changed the default language back to English in the options Google provides on its page. But after restarting again, the language has changed to some other random one.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Restart the browser
2.visit google.com
Actual Results:  
My Google search page shows up in some random language

Expected Results:  
Google.com always appears in English, which is my default
