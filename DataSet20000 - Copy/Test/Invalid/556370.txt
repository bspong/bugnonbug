firefox breaks fast caching favoring slow disk, over memory devices

firefox always caches items to disk in favor over caching to the faster cache-device of "memory".  It is common practice in any cache design to use the fast-cache device FIRST, and when it fills, use the slower cache -- you want to keep things in fast cache when possible, when that cache is available. 

See bug 105344.  I quote Bradly Baetz, comment 3: "Remember that our cache currently will save all non-ssl
web pages to the disk cache, not the mem cache - we don't cascade down."

I am reporting this as a bug as I have observed and complained about this behavior only to have it ignored as 'chance' -- but now I see it is by design that the slower disk cache is used instead.  

I don't want the disk cached used -- I DISABLE it -- but still I don't get memory cache use.  This is clearly not correct behavior.  I don't know of any device that uses a slower cache when a faster one is available. (CPU's disks, etc. all use the faster media 1st).   I delete  my cache at the end of my browsing session, so it's of no benefit to store it on disk.  As it is now, I get virtually no benefit from my memory cache.  Current stats (typical, even after long sessions, though, when enabled, like now,  disk cache will be larger):
Memory 44 items @ 800K out of 1024000K used.
Disk: 448 items @ 5120K out of 150000K used.

Insane!  I have plenty of memory that I'd like FF to use when I browse -- it's slow enough as it is, and anything that goes to disk in Win7 is really slowed down (probably isn't noticeable under linux, sigh)...




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  is present in code -- and documented in bug database.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
memory cache gets used a small fraction of disk, when memory would be much
faster.

Expected Results:  
use memory over disk enabling speedup -- especially on windows where disk
activity is throttled.
