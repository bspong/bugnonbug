Compatibility with third-party app launcher, "RocketDoc"
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0)
Build Identifier: FireFox 3.6

FireFox 3.6 (when maximized) does not recognize RocketDoc when RocketDoc is configured to "autohide" and "Popup on Mouseover". I configured RocketDoc to appear at the top of the screen. When FireFox 3.6 is maximized, RocketDoc does not appear(pop up)when the mouse hovers over the designated area. This current RocketDoc setting works with IE8 and Chrome 3.0

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox 3.6 and maximize
2. Set RocketDoc screen position at "top of screen" and "autohide" and "Popup on Mouseover"
3. Move mouse to top center of screen.
Actual Results:  
Rocket Doc launcher does not appear.

Expected Results:  
Rocket Doc should pop up when mouse hovers over the top of the screen and disappear when the mouse moves away from the top of the screen.
