I have to keep re-installling the Google toolbar to use all of the buttons - specifically the g mail button. I click add buttons, and nothing happens.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.install google toolbar
2.choose buttons
3.choose mail
Actual Results:  
I install the Google toolbar, then after a while, the G mail or all of the buttons, sometimes just some of the buttons disappear. When I click add buttons, nothing happens. So I have to un-intall and re-install to make the buttons work. Then, after a while, it happens again. Once, the entire Google toolbar would not show. There was a space for it, but I couldn't see it.

Expected Results:  
Selected Google toolbar buttons should remain in the toolbar and visible.
