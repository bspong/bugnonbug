Bookmark-Toolbar Icons wont load with newest Nightly versions, all OS
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:10.0a1) Gecko/20110929 Firefox/10.0a1
Build ID: 20110929030852

Steps to reproduce:

Upgrade to latest Nightly as of yesterday, 29.Sept.2011 with 4 diff OS's and all
had more or less problems getting the icons loaded in the Bookmark's Toolbar.
Win7, Srv2008R2, SBS2011, Ubuntu 11.04,   while Win7 has the biggest error, half of the icons wont load, regardless if I mouseover, click&load, restart, even upgrading again today to latest build didnt bring my icons back.
On Ubuntu it didnt load the "Getting Started" button on a clean fresh install.
WinSRV's and another Win7  didnt load the icons at start but where able to load icon per icon when clicking&loading the website. just 1 Icon wont load, MS-Downloads page that is.   So for now I can say, upon installing most icons are gone, some installations will recover and reload the icons, some just wont.

Used various Add-Ons on those machines,  Xmarks, LastPass, Adblock-Plus ( + AddOn ) but it also did that on clean installs w/o any gimmicks added.
