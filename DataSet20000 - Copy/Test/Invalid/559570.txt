Cannot enter a URL field enter that opens files on local computer or network computer
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: 3.2

Tried different versions of "file:\\" prefix and no prefix; i.e. "c:\test.txt".
In the no prefix case the IE8 displays "file://test.txt" when I hover over the URL hyperlink in the bug. While FireFox 3.6.3 displays: "Firefox doesn't know how to open this address, because the protocol (c) isn't associated with any program."

I know the capability to open local/network files used to work in previous versions 2.x.x.  Am I just doing something stupid?
