Firefox appears unstable when working with National Regulatory Service's site <<www.nrs-inc.com>>

When I download from nrs-inc.com's site, the screen appears unstable, to the point where I can not use it.  I can go to Internet Explorer, where nrs-inc.com works very well, but would prefer for many reasons to stay in Firefox.  Is there a way that I can do this?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to www.nrs-inc.com
2.Click on Administration
3.Click on content

Actual Results:  
You get a message that reads: You need Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 or above to review and edit this page.  Please contact technical support if you need help.

Expected Results:  
I contacted National Regulatory Service's technical support, and they emailed me: "No the program is built for I.E. 5.5 or higher. Currently it is not stable
in firefox."  Are they right, and I should forget about working this in Firefox?
