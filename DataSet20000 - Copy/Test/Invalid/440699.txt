After clicking on the Bookmarks menu on Google Toolbar, Firefox doesn't load any pages when typed in address bar, selected from bookmarks or refreshed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on the Bookmarks menu on Google Toolbar
2. Refresh any page, type a new address or select bookmark

Actual Results:  
Page does not load , is not being refreshed. The status bar says loading...

Expected Results:  
Page should be loaded

Using the Tamper Data, I have noticed that when clicking the Bookmarks menu, request is being done for each bookmark in order to download the favicon of the bookmark. When there is many bookmarks, the status of last one remains as pending... and the problem occurs.
