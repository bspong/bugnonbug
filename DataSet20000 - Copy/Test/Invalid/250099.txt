Firefox Fails to load LiveRef interface graphic

When Firefox loads this web page, it fails to display the LiveRef graphic. The
graphic is still there as if one mouses over the area, one can click on it.
However, loading this same page in Mozilla 1.6 does display the LiveRef graphic
properly.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox 0.9.1. Visit the following web site:
http://www.lib.vt.edu/services/liveref.html  Scroll down to the text "Priority
is given to Virginia Tech students, faculty, and staff, and to questions
pertaining to Virginia Tech library collections."
2. Look at the blank white space beneath the text. Note how the cursor changes
when it goes over the area where the LiveReg graphic is supposed to be displayed.
3.  Launch Mozilla 1.6 and load same web page. Compare the two pages.



Expected Results:  
It should load the LiveRef graphic
