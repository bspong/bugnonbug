Software Update does not use initial install options / Removes Firefox entry from
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: 

When updating from Firefox 1.0PR to 1.0RC-1 using Software Update 
(http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/qa/softwareupdate.html), Firefox 
install options are not correct.  In addition, Software Update removes the 
Firefox Add/Remove program entry from the Windows Control Panel, so it is not 
possible to uninstall Firefox after updating.

Issue #1:  Firefox no longer listed as an installed program under the Windows 
XP Add/Remove Programs Control Panel applet.  I can't uninstall Firefox.

Issue #2:  Firefox Software Update placed icons for the browser and safe mode 
in the root of my Start Menu Programs Folder.  When I originally installed 
1.0PR, the installer created a Start Menu Folder called Mozilla Firefox and 
placed the two icons in the Mozilla Firefox folder.  Firefox Software Update 
should follow the same behavior (should use the same options as the initial 
install).

Issue #3:  Firefox Software Update placed an icon on my desktop for Firefox. 
When I originally installed 1.0PR, I unchecked the option to do this.  Firefox
Software Update should follow the same behavior, but it doesn't (should use 
the same options as the initial install).

I also had the problem described in bug # 266339.  I had to use MSIE to 
download the "Firefox Setup (1.0rc1, en-US).exe" to re-install Firefox.  When 
I used the .exe file to re-install Firefox, it fixed # 266339.  It also fixed 
Issue #1 above.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Start with 1.0 PR
2.  Perform Software Update steps in
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/qa/softwareupdate.html.
Actual Results:  
See above.

Expected Results:  
Expected to have 1.0RC1 installed without:
XML parsing error,
extra start menu icons (I unchecked this option when I originall installed 
1.0PR)
extra desktop icon  (I unchecked this option when I originall installed 1.0PR)
erasing Installed Programs entry
