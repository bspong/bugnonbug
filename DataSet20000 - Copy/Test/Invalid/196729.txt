The GoogleSearch toolbar button for Netscape 6 doesn't work consistently in
Phoenix. On loading certain URLs (such as http://www.cnn.com/), it fails to pop
up. On new windows and tabs, it pops up but fails to search.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the GoogleSearch button.
2. Close Phoenix.
3. Open Phoenix.
4. Press the GoogleSearch button.
5. GoogleSearch button pops up. Enter your search keywords. Press OK.
6. Nothing happens.
7. Go to http://www.cnn.com/
8. Press the GoogleSearch button. Nothing happens (pop up doesn't appear).
9. Open a new tab.
10. Press the GoogleSearch button and enter keywords. Press OK. Nothing happens.
11. Go to http://hotmail.com/ in the new tab.
12. Press the GoogleSearch button again and enter keywords. Press OK. It finally
works.

Actual Results:  
Nothing happened in steps 6, 8, and 10.

Expected Results:  
GoogleSearch should've performed normally in steps 6, 8, and 10 (should've
directed the user to the Google search results page for specified keywords).
