Basically the problem arises when I attempt to view only a picture, ie. a jpeg image on its own, not a html page with a picture on it. ie. http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/SanFrancisco1851a.jpg

What happens is it displays:

'The Image "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" cannot be displayed, because it contains errors.'

The browser window attempts to continually reload it and sometimes it eventually shows it but I can't expand it to full size by clicking on it.

Suspicion it has to do with the resizing mechanism, but it is only a hunch.

Reproducible: Sometimes
