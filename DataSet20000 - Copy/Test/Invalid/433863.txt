I can`t to now if mouse button is still pressed or not

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. MouseDown on document
2. Mouse Up not on document
Actual Results:  
mouseUp action is not fires

Expected Results:  
mouseUp action fires if i return to document

It is a problem becouse:
mouseDown.button = 0 which=1
mouseMove.button = 0 which=1
I can't recognize if button is still pressed or not.
I think it is more understantable if mouseMove.button = unset
