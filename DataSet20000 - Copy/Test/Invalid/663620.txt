In Google Docs on Mac Firefox (haven't tested on other OSes) you cannot use the shortcut keys that are on menus in Google Spreadsheet at least. It overrides with the Firefox ones I think where I want the key to do what it says on the Google Spreadsheet menu. This stops things like cut, copy, paste, find working when you use Cmd-X, C, V, F. The modifiers show on the Google menu, they just don't work.

This does work on Google Chrome fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Press Cmd-F in a Google Spreadsheet


Actual Results:  
Brings up Firefox find

Expected Results:  
Brought up Google Spreadsheet find
