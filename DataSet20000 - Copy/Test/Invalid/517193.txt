Installed the EndNote plugin from the EndNoteWeb page.  Browser has been crashing repeatedly since upgrading to 3.5.3 and eventually hung on startup.  Process was visible, but not application.

Re-installed 3.5.3, this did not solve the problem.  Started in SafeMode, disabled all add-ons, enabled one at a time.  Browser failed to launch when I enabled EndNote.

Started in SafeMode again, uninstalled Endnote completely and enabled all the other add-ons.  No problems so far.

Reproducible: Didn't try
