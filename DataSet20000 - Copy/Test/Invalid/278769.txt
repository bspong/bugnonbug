go to http://www.lemonde.fr and carefully look at how the page is
rendered.  You'll notice a picture rendered twice - the first time
rendition stays only about half a second and then the picture is
re-rendered smaller and off the place of first render.  To reproduce
you need to clear the cache before trying again.

This is not a serious problem for end user but it will degrade
performance if a picture is rendered twice.

I saved the picture and display it using tools like paint to compare
to the firefox (second) render and the sizes are some.  So the
browser's send render is correct.  The first render is strange -
the picture's original size is same as that of second render so
why the first one is bigger?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to the URL
2.watch carefully as the page load
3.you'll see the largest picture (itself not very large) displayed twice, in
different sizes.
