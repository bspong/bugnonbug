For a customizable product such as Firefox, a critical feature like the session restore after a browser crash page (about:sessionrestore) should not be affected by third party themes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install a 3rd party theme like Qute 3.3.7. in Minefield or Firefox 3.1 beta with the new session retore feature.
2. Enter about:sessionrestore in address (url) bar and press Enter key.

My concern in posting this bug is that a critical feature such as session restore should not be affected by a 3rd party theme. By forcing the user to have to switch to the default theme and then restarting the browser may result in the user losing the session they need/want to restore which would seem to defeat the purpose of having a session restore function.

Also, this would seem to introduce another factor(s) that 3rd party theme authors will now need to address. One would think this should not be the preferred course of action for a product with a key feature of it's user customization capability.
