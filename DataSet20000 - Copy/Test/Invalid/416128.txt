I extracted the following bug from a much larger style sheet and removed all styling that doesn't affect the bug:

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View the attached file bug.html (my results are in screen shot bug.png).
2. Compare results for ok.html (screenshot in ok.png).
Actual Results:  
The html files contain a list and two <hr/> rows after the list:
   <ul>  
     <li>1</li>
     <li>2</li>
     <li>3</li>
   </ul>
   <hr/><hr/>
   Text

In bug.html, I added CSS styling:
   ul { width: 100%; float: left; }

This causes the two rows to disappear.  The text after the rows is still visible.

For comparison, the file ok.html without CSS coding shows the rows correctly.


Expected Results:  
In both cases, the two horizontal rules should appear on the page.

I will attach the source files and screen shots immediately.
