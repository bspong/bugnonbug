crash with Forcefield and Firefox exit

It appears that Firefox is seeing a crash situation, even though it appears to exit normally.

I think this may be due to an interaction between Firefox and Zonealarm's ForceField utility.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.use Firefox with Forcefield engaged.
2.exit Firefox normally and accept 'clear personal data' screen.
3.Firefox reports exit crash.
Actual Results:  
Firefox reports that it crashed, even though it 'appears' to have exited correctly.

Expected Results:  
There should be no 'error on exit' result.  It should accept the 'clear personal data' screen and no more.

This only began after I installed Zonealarm's Extreme Security suite with Forcefield.  It does not appear to happen if I terminate Forcefield in Task Manager before I launch Firefox.
