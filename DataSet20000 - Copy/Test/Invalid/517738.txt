Up/down arrow keys for selecting engines in search bar?

Since the up/down arrow keys do not already have a function inside the search bar, I think it would be great if they could be used to scroll up/down through the list of search engines. In addition to making me very happy, this enhancement would also make Firefox more accessible for people who cannot use a mouse.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Do a Google search using the search bar
2. Hit F6 > Tab to get back to the search bar
3. Do a Yahoo search without using the mouse
