Navigating to a mediawiki's 'special pages' -> 'system messages' page will cause the Xserver to crash.  Using CentOS 5.1.  Works both with our internal mediawiki server as well as wikipedia.org.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to the "System Messages" page of a mediawiki server.

Actual Results:  
Screen turns black and you are returned to the gdm login widget.

Expected Results:  
The page should display.

Tried this on two different Linux boxes.  It's reproducible.  Windows 2000 is unaffected.
