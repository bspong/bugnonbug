in the urlbar, there's a small down-pointing arrow.  a bug was fixed yesterday
where the size of this box was about 370 pixels in height.  what was _not_ fixed
was the position of this box.  so what i get is:

a white box where the arrow should be

a small arrow overwriting the far right hand end of the url input box.
