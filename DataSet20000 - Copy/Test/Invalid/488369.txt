Something has changed since I used Firefox, earlier this morning.  When I opened it up this afternoon, I found that there was a Google search bar on the top toolbar, and following options were no longer available on the top toolbar: Morning Coffee, DownloadHelper, Red It Later, AdBlock Plus, and even the normal bookmarks bar.  I want to know how to get rid of the Google search bar and restore those programs.  I can't easily run any of them otherwise.  Please help me.

Reproducible: Always
