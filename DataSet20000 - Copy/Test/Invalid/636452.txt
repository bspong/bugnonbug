When I first started using the FF4 beta (maybe around 3 or 4), the gmail shortcuts worked fine (eg. "C" for composing a new message or "R" for reply), but shortly after I started using beta, these shortcuts broke during an upgrade.

1) I just tried deleting my settings in my .mozilla folder to see if that helped. It didn't. Also disabled all add-ons with no change.

2) I still have keyboard shortcuts in other google apps (eg. "U" will hide the sidebar in google reader)

I really want my keyboard controls back for gmail! Thanks.

Steps to Reproduce:

2.Press "C" for compose new message
3.Nothing happens
Actual Results:  
Nothing.

New email dialog should pop up.

I have disabled all plugins.
