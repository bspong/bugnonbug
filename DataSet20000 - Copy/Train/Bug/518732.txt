This is quite a serious issue which appears to have been introduced with one of the newer nightlies. (somewhere after 04 Sep)


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
- Go on posting in your favorite forums, and wait for something weird to happen :) 
[NOTE: You *MUST* post. This never occurs if you only *read* a forum.]

- If you get the following message:
"Your submission could not be processed because a security token was missing 
or mismatched.

If this occurred unexpectedly, please inform the administrator and describe 
the action you performed before you received this error."

press the Back button (occasionally you have to rewrite your post from scratch) and submit your post again.
It MAY work this time, but sometimes it even fails 2 times in a sequence.

Alternative messages depending on forum software are:

"Can't determine method".
This means, the forum software did not "know" whether it should use GET or POST. Maybe that's the culprit why I'm having these issues.
Actual Results:  
(see above)

Expected Results:  
Should never happen. Hasn't occurred *any* time with any build before 04 Sep '09 all those years.

The issue can be VERY annoying. Depending on which forum software is being used, it MAY happen you have to write your post from scratch again (because all text is deleted), OR the text is memorized with the "Back" button and you can try again.
