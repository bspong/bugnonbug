Firefox won't exit or load Tabs -- "firefox!wmain(int argc = <Memory access error>, wchar_t ** argv = <Memory access error>) 0x812 ..."

Windbg Log showing "Memory access error" in "firefox!wmain()".

It looks like there a few problems depicted in this Debug Log; it is hard to say where to start, we may need to split this. You are welcome to alter the Title to something better, I was trying to choose something unique that reflected ONE of the Problems.


Perhaps 20% of the time when Nightly starts it won't reload the Tabs from a previous Tab Mix Plus (TM+) Session. Judging (as poorly as I am able) from the Windbg Log it seems that the Problem starts long before TM+ (or anything else) starts.

When "Nightly" tries to exit the Window closes but it leaves the "firefox.exe" (and a couple of "plugin-container.exe") Processes running; that prevents restarting and requires a reboot to terminate them, they can NOT be terminated using the "Task Manager".



Here is a SHORT List of things I see in the Debug Log (that seem to be a Problem):

1. In Windbg I can see that "MSVCR90.dll" loads twice.


2. When I try to exit the Browser the Window closes but the Processes do not terminate, I need to use Windbg's Menu's "Break" to enter some Debugging Comands. When I type "|* ~* kp" some of the lines shows this:

...

...

There are many more "Memory access error" lines, that does not seem correct.


3. The Tabs won't load (the "Throbber" keeps spinning) and in Windbg's Log I see lines like this:

...
PRIMARY_PROBLEM_CLASS:  APPLICATION_HANG_BlockedOn_NetworkCall
...
FOLLOWUP_IP: 
nspr4!SocketSend+81 [e:\builds\moz2_slave\m-cen-w32-ntly\build\nsprpub\pr\src\io\prsocket.c @ 681]

FAULTING_SOURCE_CODE:  
No source found for 'e:\builds\moz2_slave\m-cen-w32-ntly\build\nsprpub\pr\src\io\prsocket.c'
...


4. Typing "g" and waiting, then using the Menu's "Break" again, gives Windbg Log Entries like this:

...

5. Typing "g" (again) and waiting, then using the Menu's "Break" again, gives slightly different Windbg Log Entries like this:

I am not knowledgeable about Windows Debugging but I have a dozen Logs that show this sort of Problem ("Memory access error", Tabs won't load, Processes won't Terminate, and need to reboot since "Task Manager" can't terminate them either). 


I am attaching on the the shorter (better?) Windbg Logs (of over a dozen) that might help.
