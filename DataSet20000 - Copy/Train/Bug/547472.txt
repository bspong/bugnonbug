Firefox 3.6 hangs on Windows 7 when used with DownThemAll!
Some of our users reported that Firefox becomes unresponsive after some time when our DownThemAll! extension is in use.

It seems the UI thread is locked (deadlocked or whatever) in some way.
The usual suspect, Antivirus Software, is not to blame this time.

Since dTa is javascript only, it cannot be some random accidental endless-loop as this would produce a slow script warning.

Furthermore this is a regression from Firefox 3.5, as the latest 3.5 builds do not produce any hangs (users reported a downgrade works).

I cannot decently debug or even reproduce this, so I'm hoping that somebody here can.

See http://bugs.code.downthemall.net/trac/ticket/1428 and dupe'd tickets for more gory details.

I also attached a .dmp file as produced by MS debugging tools (MiniDump Tool, http://bill.atwill.com/) a user kindly provided of a running but unresponsive Fx instance.
For whatever reason my MSVC2005/2008 refuses to load most of the symbols, so I don't get any information about the call stacks.
(As the process does not actually crash, there won't be any crash reports unfortunately)

Reproduce (according to users):
 * Install DownThemAll! (release from AMO and latest nightly from http://bugs.code.downthemall.net/trac/wiki/NightlyBuilds both produce such soft-crashes)
 * Use DownThemAll! to download some file(s). As users reported the "crash" will only occur after dTa has the download running for some time be sure to download a multi-MB file.
 * If you're affected the Firefox process will become unresponsive.
