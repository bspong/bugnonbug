The site listed above and many of the other user sites display different
favicons in the location bar and in the tabbed browser.  The favicon that shows
up in the tabbed browser is the correct favicon for the site.  The favicon that
shows up in the location bar is the favicon located in the server root.

See the following two examples:

http://nunyas.dyndns.org/~max
http://nunyas.dyndns.org/~lvillegas

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to http://nunyas.dyndns.org/~max or http://nunyas.dyndns.org/~lvillegas
2.  Notice that the favicon that appears in the location bar is different from
the favicon that appears in the tabbed-browser.
3.  The correct user favicon is displaying in the tabbed-browser, while the
location bar is displaying the server root favicon.

Actual Results:  
The location bar displayed the server root favicon, and the tabbed browser
displayed the "correct" user favicon

Expected Results:  
The user favicon should have been displayed in both the location bar and the
tabbed browser.

This is the only website that I've seen exhibit this particular problem with
Firefox.  It does not seem to be theme dependant since friends that are also
using Firefox (with different themes) are also reporting the issue to me.
