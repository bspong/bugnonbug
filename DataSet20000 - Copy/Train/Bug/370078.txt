Some of the web pages, which linked on the E mail I downloaded by IncrediMail, cannot be opened by Firefox, but it opens Home Page, instead.  It started to happen after I upgraded Firefox.  If I changed the default browser to IE, it opens the linked page.  Or if I opens from Web Mail, it works.  Just from the clicking the link of the E mail, it opens my home page by Firefox, instead of the linked page.
It was very fine until I upgraded Firefox.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Clicking the link on E mail I received by IncrediMail
2.Firefox opens my home page, instead of the linked page
3.I upgraded IncrediMail to see this is the problem
Actual Results:  
Firefox (default browser) opens my home page, instead of the linked page
Changing to the default browser to IE, it opens the linked page-no problem.


This is nothing to do with the E mail program, but Firefox itself, because if I change to IE as the default browser, it works.
It used to be fine until I upgraded Firefox.
