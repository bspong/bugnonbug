document download stalls while showing download progress bar

Steps to reproduce:

I accessed the car insurance website to download policy documents https://lloydstsbcarinsurance.insure-systems.co.uk/SelfService/ProductGeneric/Documents/Download?documentId=142144216!01&mode=S which requires a login, once logged in I clicked the download button


Actual results:

The download page appeared showing the download activity bar. After 10 mins it was till showing the activity bar - a graphic that does not indicate the extent of download progress. The download was attempted 5 times.

This is a serious issue, unless another browser had been available my car insurance would have been voided for not answering questions within 7 days that were placed in the downloadable document. The Lloyds TSB insurer had no ability to post out documents.


Expected results:

It should have download the policy document within 5 seconds. When using IE and Opera, the same download took 3 seconds, instantly trying FFox again produced the same stall. The problem only occurs in FFox.

The document properties for the download page show it is a PDF "e2 Rendering Engine 5.50p0252" PDF Version 1.3(Acrobat 4. and higher)
