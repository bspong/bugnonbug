remote debugger doesn't find any sources for simulator on nightly
The remote debugger reports "This page has no sources." after I connect it to the chrome://browser/content/shell.xul remote tab of the Firefox OS Simulator from the latest nightly build of Firefox.  It works fine on the latest Aurora build of Firefox.

I'm testing on the latest Firefox OS Simulator preview build (3.0pre5):

    Windows: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/r2d2b2g/r2d2b2g-windows.xpi
    Mac: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/r2d2b2g/r2d2b2g-mac.xpi
    Linux: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/r2d2b2g/r2d2b2g-linux.xpi


Steps to Reproduce:

1. install the Firefox OS Simulator;
2. select Tools > Web Developer > Firefox OS Simulator to open the Dashboard;
3. press the Simulator toggle button in the Dashboard to start the Simulator;
4. press the Connect... button in the Dashboard to open the Connect tab;
5. press the Connect button in the Connect tab to connect to the Simulator;
6. select the chrome://browser/content/shell.xul (only) remote tab to open the Web Console window;
7. select the Debugger tab in the Web Console window.

Expected Results: Debugger sidebar lists sources.
Actual Results: Debugger sidebar says "This page has no sources."


There isn't anything suspicious in the Error Console.  The debugger log has:
