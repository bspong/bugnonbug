Firefox fails to launch if Netbarrier's info hiding is on
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1.13) Gecko/20080311 Firefox/2.0.0.13

Firefox 2.0.0.13 would not launch. Did a clean system install and problem persisted. I tried to launch FF through it's safe mode but was unable to do so. I then booted the system (10.4.11) in safe mode and Firefox launched and operated properly. I narrowed the conflict to Intego Netbarrier's Info Hiding preferences.
Even though FF initially would hang, info was coming through as the "latest headlines" bookmark was current.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn on Netbarrier info hiding.. Try to launch Firefox. No go. Could not troubleshoot in Firefox safe mode.
2. Do a system safe boot or turn off Netbarrier's info hiding.

3.Firefox then launches
Actual Results:  
Install both Firefox 2.0.0.13 and Netbarrier. Turn info hiding on in Netbarrier. Try to launch Firefox. Unable to troubleshoot Firefox in its safe mode. Disabled Netbarrier's info hiding and Firefox launched with no hangs.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should launch (like Safari and prior versions of Firefox) with Netbarrier info hiding engaged.

I find it difficult to believe this apparent conflict between Firefox 2.0.0.13 and Netbarrier hasn't been reported earlier. However, this conflict persisted through 2 OS X systems (old system and new clean system installs). I will obtain another computer with OS X 10.4.11 AND NETBARRIER and try to recreate this supposed "bug". All I am able to say with certainty is that I experienced the same problem 2 times on 2 OS 10.4.11 systems on the same computer (G4 Powermac)
