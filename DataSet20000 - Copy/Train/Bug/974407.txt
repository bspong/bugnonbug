Find out why customize mode transition is smoother without d2d and HWA.
I've got two copies of Win 7 - one on a desktop machine, and one in a VM on my Macbook. I've been doing customize mode perf work on both, and I've been pretty confused by the behaviour on them - specifically, something that helps on one doesn't seem to help on the other.

For example, in [1], I commented that adding a 2 second delay to the transition smoothed things out considerably for my Windows 7 VM, and that it supported the idea that the transition itself is not intrinsically difficult to layout or paint.

That same delay didn't have nearly the same effect on my desktop machine.

One thing that was immediately obvious was that my VM does not have D2D or HWA capabilities, whereas my desktop PC does.

Using a local run of CART, I notice a pretty substantial difference in performance between both configurations.

Here's a matrix of CART results:


No d2d, no HWA:

1-customize-enter.half.TART    Average (10): 21.75 stddev: 5.45
1-customize-enter.all.TART    Average (10): 39.71 stddev: 4.81
1-customize-enter.error.TART    Average (10): 250.56 stddev: 19.92

2-customize-exit.half.TART    Average (10): 24.01 stddev: 5.79
2-customize-exit.all.TART    Average (10): 32.71 stddev: 2.94
2-customize-exit.error.TART    Average (10): 206.64 stddev: 16.49


Yes d2d, Yes HWA:

1-customize-enter.half.TART    Average (10): 35.93 stddev: 19.39
1-customize-enter.all.TART    Average (10): 66.15 stddev: 11.13
1-customize-enter.error.TART    Average (10): 472.08 stddev: 126.61

2-customize-exit.half.TART    Average (10): 30.24 stddev: 5.02
2-customize-exit.all.TART    Average (10): 50.98 stddev: 3.81
2-customize-exit.error.TART    Average (10): 346.29 stddev: 28.54


No d2d, Yes HWA:

1-customize-enter.half.TART    Average (10): 29.79 stddev: 4.11
1-customize-enter.all.TART    Average (10): 42.91 stddev: 4.15
1-customize-enter.error.TART    Average (10): 280.05 stddev: 27.18

2-customize-exit.half.TART    Average (10): 29.89 stddev: 7.68
2-customize-exit.all.TART    Average (10): 36.29 stddev: 1.71
2-customize-exit.error.TART    Average (10): 230.01 stddev: 21.16


Yes d2d, no HWA:

1-customize-enter.half.TART    Average (10): 48.97 stddev: 15.39
1-customize-enter.all.TART    Average (10): 110.16 stddev: 14.35
1-customize-enter.error.TART    Average (10): 720.96 stddev: 91.84

2-customize-exit.half.TART    Average (10): 47.16 stddev: 18.87
2-customize-exit.all.TART    Average (10): 64.21 stddev: 11.04
2-customize-exit.error.TART    Average (10): 481.17 stddev: 88.58


Looking at this matrix, it looks like both HWA and d2d negatively impact performance of the transition. I would have expected the opposite.

I'll gather some profiles.
