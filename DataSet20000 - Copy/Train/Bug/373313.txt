Video launches WMP11 plugin, but buttons (volume, stop, pause, rewind, etc.) don't work

When I launch a video news clip from CNN.com (NOT Pipeline, just "latest news" item), another window opens with a media player opens and plays the clip. But, the buttons that control volume, pause, rewind and the like do not work. I tried the same link in IE6 and the spawned window/player behaves properly. This used to work prior to upgrading to Firefox 2.0.0.2.

When I look at about:plugins, I see:
 * Windows Media Player Plug-in Dynamic Link Library
     File name: npdsplay.dll
 * Microsoft DRM
     File name: npdrmv2.dll

Notice there isn't a npwmsdrm.dll file under Microsoft DRM. I followed this page's instructions (http://kb.mozillazine.org/Windows_Media_Player#Missing_plugin) and copied that file from "C:\Program Files\Windows Media Player" into "C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\plugins". After restarting Firefox, that plugin still does not show up in the about:plugins list.

I've scoured the web for this issue to no avail. I'm exhausted. I hope I'm not submitting a bug that is documented, but I couldn't find it in my search of your database.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox and go to CNN.com
2. Choose any story under "Latest News" that is associated to a video clip
3. Try to alter the volume or pause the clip ... it does nothing.
Actual Results:  
No effect of my intended actions.

Expected Results:  
I've been able to alter the volume and pause the clip when I used Firefox 1.x.x

I'm ready, willing and able to test a fix. Let me know how I can help resolve this issue with you.
