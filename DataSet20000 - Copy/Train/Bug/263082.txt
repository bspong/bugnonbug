My users running Firefox on Windows can no longer log into my site. I'm a secure
site, and also I'm using Servlet 2.3 filtering with Jakarta Struts framework. It
does not work at all. An older version of Firefox was working, with one minor
problem, but the newest version doesn't work at all.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Using the latest version of Firefox, log in to
https://www.healthcaresalarysurvey.com
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Long pause, and Server Error with long error message

Expected Results:  
Follow the servlet filtering and display the first page of the site.

I think this is a major problem because I encourage all my users to use Mozilla,
and have been very successful since Feb 2004 when Microsoft put out the patch to
IE that broke their https implementation. So, when I find users with problems on
Firefox, I am a little embarrased, but I do tell them that this is all brand new
architecture, design, etc. But, still, it would be nice if it worked for my users.

Contact me for more information.
