Search Engine Manager doesn't consider pending keyword changes when determining whether a keyword is in conflict

Firefox gives an error message if you try and change keywords in the search engine manager to things that were changed earlier in the session.  For instance if youtube has a related keyword of "y", and yahoo has no related keyword, and the user wants to change that so youtube's keyword is "yt", and then trys to change yahoo's keyword to "y", an error message occurs stating that the "y" keyword is already taken, even though it was changed earlier in the session.  Upon making one change, closing out, coming back in, and changing the second part no error occurs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Change search engine #1's keyword
2. Attempt to change search engine #2's keyword, which was not set previously, to what #1 just was.
Actual Results:  
An error message pops up stating that #1's keyword is already in use, and therefore #2 is unable to use it.

Expected Results:  
#2 should be allowed to change to what #1 was without exiting halfway.
