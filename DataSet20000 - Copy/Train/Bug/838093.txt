[JavaScript Application] Error Syntax Error.jpg

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.8; rv:18.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/18.0
Build ID: 20130116073211

Steps to reproduce:

Simply browse to any web page.

Note, I use Firefox 18.0.1 on a Mac running OSX 10.8.2; I have J2SE 7 installed but I understand Apple has recently disabled Java on Macs following from a few publicised security flaws in the software lately.

In response to this I recently disabled Java in the browser following publicised I have read that if users do not really rely on Java (such as for application platforms) they should disable it.

Oh, also I have the NoScript add on installed and activated in my Firefox browser.


Actual results:

I keep getting a message from Firefox which says, "[Javascipt Application] Error: Syntax Error"

Sometimes the message keeps repeating up to 6 times despite me clicking"OK" to dismiss it.

What does that even mean? If it provided a bit more detail I might be able to isolate and troubleshoot myself!


Expected results:

This is the first time I have ever experienced Firefox throwing up this error, repeatedly; web pages previously have just loaded with no JavaScript Syntax errors at all and I expect they should continue load without me seeing a JavaScript Application error each time I navigate to a website.
