Bookmarks are broken!!
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: Firefox 2.0.0.1

After upgrading to 2.0.0.1 my bookmarks are not working properly.
When I first start Firefox and go to my bookmarks I and see them all and choose anyone I want. If I then click on Bookmarks again NOTHING HAPPENS, Bookmarks will NOT open. If I close Firefox and re-open it all is fine for ONLY ONE BOOKMARK CHOICE, then again, if I click on Bookmarks it will NOT open. Close Firefox and re-open it and I can again choose only one. This is the first BAD build I've experienced with FireFox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Open Bookmarks and choose a URL
3.Bookmarks will not open again during the current session and must be closed and re-opened in order to access Bookmaks again.

Actual Results:  
Start Firefox, go to bookmarks and choose a URL then try to open bookmarks again and it will not open.

Expected Results:  
NOTHING.. NO bookmarks until I close and reopen Firefox
