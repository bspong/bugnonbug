Firefox Menu Items Stop Working
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux i686; rv:13.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/13.0
Build ID: 20120601173917

Steps to reproduce:

There is a definite problem with Firefox, since I upgraded.  It says Firefox 13.0, and also for Ubuntu Canonical 1.0.  

It works OK for awhile, but then the menu bar with the FILE, EDIT, etc. cannot be accessed.  I also cannot right click in the window to perform functions.  Sometimes I see the outline of the menu selection show up as a block for a fraction of a second, while on other occasions, nothing happens at all.  When I shut down the browser and reopen it, things work fine for awhile.  It is weird, in that the browser works fine otherwise.

On many occasions, I have at least two browsers open in separate windows.  I don't think that has any effect.  This causes a problem for me, since I like to copy and paste stuff between browser windows, word processor, etc.  

This will not clear up by itself ever, as I need to close ALL open browsers.

This is definitely a Firefox problem, as all other programs work fine, including a different name browser.  I tried various other programs while the offending browser was open, but they all worked alright.   As I said, this started once the new version was installed.
