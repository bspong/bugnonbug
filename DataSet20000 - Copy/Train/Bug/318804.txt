When right-clicking on an image and selecting "Properties" the "size of file" properties is fetched from the current cached image at that location.

This will happen when e.g. an image has been changed under the same file name and the page is reloaded in another tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create two pictures of different size (e.g. "small.jpg" and "large.jpg"). Copy "small.jpg" to "test.jpg"
2. Create a webpage displaying "test.jpg" and open the webpage in a tab.
3. Copy "large.jpg" to "test.jpg". Open a *new* tab and reload the page. The new picture will be shown.
4. Go back to the old tab with the old picture. Right-click on the image and select properties.

Actual Results:  
The "Size of file" shown is the size of the new picture (corresponding to "large.jpg").

Expected Results:  
The "Size of file" should be the size of the original/actual picture on the current page (or "Unknown" if the information is no longer available).
