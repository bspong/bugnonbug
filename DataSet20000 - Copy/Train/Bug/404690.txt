When you go into Preferences -> Security -> Show Passwords, you are given the usual dialogue box for your logins. If you try to scroll through your logins by clicking on the scroll bar and dragging, it will not scroll down. Instead, it drags the window as if you had clicked on the titlebar and dragged downward. A scroll can be achieved by clicking on the up and down arrows above and below the scroll bar or by using a scroll wheel or on a mac, a 2 finger drag, or up/down arrows on the keyboard.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Firefox -> Preferences
2. Click on the Security tab
3. Click on "Show Passwords"
4. Click on scroll bar and drag down as if to quickly scroll through the list of saved passwords.
Actual Results:  
The window is dragged down and the passwords are a bit "glitchy" (technical term, I swear).

Expected Results:  
The scroll bar should have scrolled through the list of saved passwords.

I am using Mac OSX 10.5 Leopard, just installed FF3b1 using the default theme and I have installed the Adblock Plus application since then
