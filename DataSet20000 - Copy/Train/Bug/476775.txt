contribute Firefox 3.0.6 release for Solaris 10 SPARC will not run
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; SunOS sun4u; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008110415 Firefox/3.0.4
Build Identifier: firefox 3.0.6 release for Solaris SPARC in the contrim/solaris_tarball directory

Problem #1:  This is built with GTK+2.10.  Standard Solaris 10 has GTK+ 2.4.  I have GTK+ 2.12.3 installed in /opt/csw/lib, but this build cannot locate it.  I had to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the firefox launch script to get it to find the library.  Some releases (3.0.4 for example) do not exhibit this problem.  People submitting these builds should have a procedure for addressing this issue.  No one should have to muck with LD_LIBRARY_PATH to get this program to run.

Problem #2: With LD_LIBRARY_PATH, attempts to start the binary result in:

ld.so.1: firefox-bin: fatal: relocation error: file /x/opt/local/X11/lib/firefox_3.0.6/libxul.so: symbol sqlite3_enable_shared_cache: referenced symbol not found
Killed

I wish there were some quality control team responsible for monitoring these Solaris releases.  3.0.5 also did not work.

Reproducible: Always




I'm running on a recently pached SPARC SunFire V250 with Solaris 10 8/07 s10s_u4wos_12b SPARC
