Can't search maps

After loading Google Maps to my default location, the Search Maps feature ceases to work. The map doesn't display any of the location "pins", and it will not refresh the map to any location entered in the Search Maps field. Google Maps works just fine in IE 7 and had worked just fine before the 3.0.1 Firefox upgrade. I reloaded Firefox suspecting that a file had become corrupt, but the reload produced the same results. I am running XP Home SP3 on a Dell Inspiron 6400 with 1GB of RAM and an Intel Centrino Duo T2050 at 1.6 Ghz

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://www.maps.google.com
2.Enter a location in the Search Maps field
3.Click on the Search Maps radio button
Actual Results:  
The hourglass cursor appears for about one second then disappears. The word "Done" appears in the lower left corner of the screen, but no results are shown and the map does not refresh at the new location

Expected Results:  
The map should have refreshed on the new location, and the location "pins" should have appeared at the appropriate places on the new map. In addition, the Search Maps details should be displayed along the left side of the screen associated with the corresponding location "pins".

I have only begun to experience this problem since upgrading to 3.0.1.
