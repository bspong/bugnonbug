Browser freezes when calling any media content from the above page

When navigating to any media content link on the portal zshare (the above link is just a random example; content is of course non-offensive) an standard windows xp error sound is heard, but no error message box shown. After that the browser has to be terminated by using the task manager, because it does not react to anything at all anymore and uses 100% CPU power. I have also tried this with all my addons disabled, so it should be a real firefox issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to the above link
2. crash
Actual Results:  
I have to terminate the browser via the task manager "end task" option; firefox does not try to contact mozilla.org to auto-report the bug (which would make my life easier)

Expected Results:  
The media content hosted on zshare.net should have appeared and run.

I am using the default theme; there is no error message boxes so I cannot give specifics about crash IDs or module names; the crash affects ALL of firefox in ALL tabs and ALL open windows of it, but (except for the 100% CPU usage) does not seem to affect the rest of my windows XP system; the bug occurs indiscriminately at very low (20MB) and very high (1000MB) cash size settings; the bug occurs with and without Java activated; I did not test if it still occurs with a NoScript plugin to block JavaScript, because I dont usually need such an addon - maybe that helps to locate the bug?

If there is problems reproducing the bug or any other kinds of questions, just let me know what you need to know or want me to do to help locate the problem.
