After rapid and massive changes on bookmarks (deletion, moving, adding), the bookmarks are all messed up, they sometimes diseappear, sometimes stay registred, but are impossible to modify

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. new profile, select a few bookmarks in one folder (see http://ffsearchplugins.free.fr/bugzilla/select.png)
2. copy them (Ctrl-V)
3. paste them and cancel very quickly (Ctrl-C and Ctrl-Z immediatly after).

Actual Results:  
bookmarks are messed up : see http://ffsearchplugins.free.fr/bugzilla/messed-up.png
In that special case, after closing and reopening Firefox, those bookmarks have been deleted.

Expected Results:  
should not happen

The problem can occur at any time when you do massive and quick changes on the bookmarks. In the case I presented, the bookmarks are deleted after Firefox is restarted. In other cases, it can happen that bookmarks are not deleted, but are impossible to modify. It can also happen that when you want to move them, they are moved, but not to the right place.
