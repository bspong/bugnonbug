Flash movie loads fine on opening window when Firefox is first opened but not if window is closed then reopened without quitting the browser.

To get the movie to load I have to quit Firefox and open it again

The flash movie is held on my own server and is loaded when I open the homepage - It is currently the first item on the home page but will work its way down as new items are added. The url above is for the individual page. Same problem in both instances.

I am using Joomla! 1.1X - the latest version of 1.1 - to create my site

I have tried turning caching off but the problem persists

The problem does not occur in Safari
