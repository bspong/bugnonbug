Hi,
 I have firefox.app on a server. I have mounted a share where firefox.app is located on the client machine.
When I double-click firefox.app, it crashes twice before it starts (It takes good 7 minutes to start on dual core 2 Ghz machine). I have tracked down the problem. It seems that it is looking for a profile in ~/Library/Application\ Support/Firefox. When it is available (after 1st start), firefox works fine. However, for the very first time, when it is unavailable it takes ages to create one and that too after crashing twice. 

  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have firefox.app on the server. Mount that share on client.
2. Make sure there is no profile. Delete one if it exists in ~/Library/Application\ Support/Firefox
3. Double click on firefox icon.
Actual Results:  
It crashes twice and starts after 7 minutes.

Expected Results:  
It should start immediately.
