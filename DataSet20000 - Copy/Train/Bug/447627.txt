Pop-Ups in AT&T Web Mail Dead, radio buttons not functioning
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.16) Gecko/20080702 Firefox/2.0.0.16
Build Identifier: Firefox Fix 2.0.0.10 on Linux Suse 10.0

Suse 10.0 Online update through YAST last week gave me 2.0.0.10 fix for Firefox. I was at 2.0.0.6 previous to this fix. After applying 2.0.0.10 my pop-up windows for COMPOSE (new e-mail)and REPLY in my AT&T webmail no longer function. To remedy I re-installed Firrefox 1.0.6 from my installation Cd's and these functions are restored.
Before reverting back to 1.0.6 I tried to install Firefox 3.0.1, but my GTK was backleveled and there were too many inconsistencies to go on with the install.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Using SuSe Linux YAST Online Update apply Firefox fix 2.0.0.10
2.Launch webmail.att.net or any other site that supports opening new windows from radio buttons.
3.
Actual Results:  
If in AT&T webmail click COMPOSE button or viewing an e-mail click REPLY button. Normal behavior is to open a new window to type your message, with FireFox fix 2.0.0.10 nothing happens when you perform this.

Expected Results:  
Expect new window to type message into, but this fix prevents it.

Should have opened a new window in which one could type a message or e-mail.
