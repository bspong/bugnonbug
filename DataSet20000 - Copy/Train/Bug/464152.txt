If you log in to facebook (I am sure one of you have an account)

and try to comment on someone's status  (hit the comment link to someone's status on their profile news feed)

it will come up with a text box (text area) and Comment (button). Once you enter the comment (text in the text area) and hit the Comment (button), nothing happens i.e. the AJAX fails. This works fine in IE and Firefox 3.0.3

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Login to facebook
2.Go on your friend's profile who has updated their status recently
3.In their profile's news feed, try to find something (like a recent status) that you can comment on
4. Text box and comment button are now visible
5. Put your comment in the text box and hit the comment button
6. Nothing happens and AJAX fails (work in IE and Firefox 3.0.3)
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens and AJAX fails (work in IE and Firefox 3.0.3)

Expected Results:  
The comment should save i.e. the AJAX should work

Saved the user comment (you can reproduce the correct result in IE or Firefox 3.0.3)
