download script (PHP/ASP) source code in certain conditions
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3

I found that if the cache was corrupted whilst loading a script and firefox shut down, whenever trying to access any page under that domain would allow you to download the source code of the script file used to generate the page.

The problem is fixed by deleting the cache files, however, this could allow someone to maliciously gain control of a website by allowing them to download sensitive information (such as database username and password).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Begin loading a website from a script (in my case PHP)
2. Instantly shut down the machine whilst it is loading, power off. (Or manually corrupt the cache yourself)
3. Reload the script under the browser without restoring the session
Actual Results:  
Allows the download of script files direct from the webserver as firefox now seems unable to recognise "application/x-httpd" files from the webserver.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should not allow me access to the source code. The page should have displayed properly.
