I have installed Firefox 4 b10 and was able to use it the first few times without much of a problem.  there were a few times when it froze and I had to manually end the process after closing. However, I am now unable to do anything with the new beta because it is unresponsive immediately from startup.  I have switched back and forth between 3.6.13 and beta 4 in order to close tabs and see if that is the problem.  Once I was able to get the Session Manager to open up the tabs I had before the hang, but it then froze again.  I am not sure if switching versions, having over 10 tabs open, or incompatible addons are the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get Frifox 4 b10
2. Open with several tabs and navigate until it freezes
3. Switch to firefox 3.6.13 and repeat step 2
Actual Results:  
A firefox 4 beta 10 which is frozen from startup (AKA useless)

Expected Results:  
Not frozen! :)

I have tried reinstalling the beta, and a similar problem occurred in beta 4 (though not to its current extent, because after you closed the current tab in ff 3, the problem was solved).  No themes were used, but I have several addons as well as the addon tester which allows incompatible addons to run.  It worked fine the first few times with the same settings.  When I close the program, the ff window disappears, but the process is still there, but takes up 0% cpu power.
