User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux i686; rv:32.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/32.0
Build ID: 20140830211128

Steps to reproduce:

In Firefox version 35, on Windows XP SP3, download the nvd3 library and run the example program named "line chart with viewfinder". Same as the one on this page: http://nvd3.org/examples/lineWithFocus.html
OR
Try the last path transition problem in this page: http://bost.ocks.org/mike/path/ by copying the code into an html file on your local PC and running it with a black background to be able to see the blotches.

This problem doesn't seem to happen with Ubuntu's Firefox version 32.


Actual results:

When dragging the "viewfinder" of the line chart that's below the chart (provides the zoom functionality), there are blotches formed on the screen as shown in the attached file firefoxRefreshProblemWithSVG.PNG. This problem happens when I click the "holders" of the viewfinder and move them. On releasing the holders, there are no blotches on the screen. The blotches seem to appear only when there's some animation happening on the screen. Like in the path transition graph I mentioned above, the x axis keeps moving leftward, and the blotches appear on the moving parts of the x axis.


Expected results:

The animations should have happened without any of those blotches appearing on the screen.
