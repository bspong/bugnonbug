"Manage Search Engines" accesskey breaks quick menu navigation to engines beginning with "M"

When opening the search bar menu (using Alt-Down) you can choose search engine by pressing the initial letter of it's name. This does not work when trying to choose  a search engine with the same initial as the shortcut for Manage Search Engines (which in the English version is M)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Make sure you have are using an English version of Firefox and have a search engine with initial M installed (such as Mathworld or Mycroft)
2.Open search bar menu (by either clicking the icon or pressing Alt-Down when the bar is active)
3.Press M

Actual Results:  
Search Engine manager is opened

Expected Results:  
The first search engine with M as initial should be choosed.

If several engines have a common initial you can walk through them by repeatedly pressing the letter. With this mechanism you should be able to eventually choose "Manage Search Engines".

The letter M is specific to the English version of Firefox. A solution should of course work for other languages as well.

I have verified the existence of the problem in Linux and Windows 2000. I has existed in all Firefox 2 versions.
