Opening link intended for new tab opens in new Window
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9b3pre) Gecko/2008012304 Minefield/3.0b3pre
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9b3pre) Gecko/2008011604 Minefield/3.0b3pre

Issue started with build 2008011604 and continues through latest trunk as of this report.

When opening link intended for new tab the following behavior ensues:
1. New tab in current window opens, but is blank
2. New full (toobars included, not pop-up style) window opens with desired content.

The behavior does not exist with a clean profile (i.e. no extensions installed).

From my observation it is not linked to any particular extension as I have tried narrowing it down, but rather occurs after the 8th or 9th extension is installed.  Others have indicated the behavior being resolved by removing a specific extension (though I do not use that particular extension) so is not valid in my case.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install latest trunk (2008011604 or newer)
2. Set browser options to open in new tab
3. Test link intended to open in new window to ensure desired behavior (e.g. google reader link to full article).
4. Install 9 extensions and restart browser
5. Test link intended to open in new window to see undesirable behavior.

Note: Right click on link, open in new tab works as desired
Actual Results:  
new blank tab in current window opens
new window opens with intended content

Expected Results:  
new tab in current window should open with desired content.
