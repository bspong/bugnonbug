Pop-up menu reappears after clicking link.

When clicking a link simultaneously with both buttons, the pop-up menu will load
on the new page. When that menu is gotten rid of (by clicking elsewhere on the
page), another one will briefly pop up and then disappear. Not really a problem
or really irritating, but it is something going wrong.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click link with both mouse buttons (or left quickly followed by right)
2. when new page loads, pop-up menu should be open; scroll through options by
mousing over them.
3. click off the menu.

Actual Results:  
New menu briefly shows up, then disappears.

Expected Results:  
Not shown this menu. I think this may happen because the menu loads on the first
page, and then the page swaps to the second. When the user clicks off the menu
on the new page, the second menu (relevant to the second page) loads and then,
sensing the mouse click, disappears.

Using Lune (new version). A couple of menu-editing plugins (view page in IE,
that may be it...).
