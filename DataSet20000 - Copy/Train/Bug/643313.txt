Session restore with multiple tabs also opens blank windows

After a crash with multiple windows open, when I restart FF and do a session restore, it reopens all of the tabs I had opened correctly in the main FF window. However, it ALSO opens a new, blank FF window for each tab I had open.

Example:
When crashed, I had 4 tabs open. If I re-open FF and restore the session, I'll end up with:
- 1 window with the 4 tabs correctly restored
- 4 other FF windows, each with one tab, opened to a "New Tab" blank page

It seems FF isn't sensing the existing window is open, and creates a new window for each tab (but doesn't use it?!)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Can't reproduce "on demand", since I don't know how to cause FF to crash. However, starting with FF 4 beta, this has occurred consistently on each crash. It still occurs with FF 4.0 RC2 as well.
Actual Results:  
See above - multiple empty windows are opened - one for each tab that was open when FF crashed. These are IN ADDITION to the 'main' window with all the restored tabs.

Expected Results:  
One FF window, with the restored tabs, and NO extra, empty FF windows.

Straight up FF 4.0 RC2 install, with normal add-ins.

I also noticed that if I try to drag a single tab out of the FF window (to 'split' it off to its own window), a new FF window is created, but the tab stays in the main FF window. Something is hosed between the windows and tabs communicating ...
