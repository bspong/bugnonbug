Form syncing increments score for changes it is applying
In some users logs I see:

> 1471705079830	Sync.Engine.Forms	DEBUG	Switching local ID to incoming: 1vOTfjCxQg2wtw+y -> 0UDcvyWDQRC2dP4m

etc. The forms engine's tracker remains active during a Sync, meaning that as we apply incoming records we also increment the score and attempt Syncs. IIUC nothing really bad happens due to this other than extra work done during a Sync (making the browser slower than normal) and that at the end of the Sync we may be left with an elevated score causing the next Sync to run before it otherwise would have.

I think this is a simple fix - the tracker should be looking at this.ignoreAll.
