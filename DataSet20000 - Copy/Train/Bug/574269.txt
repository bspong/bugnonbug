half way through multipage form, validation errors occur due to unfilled in fields which were filled in

I click on radio buttons and tick boxes.
Half way through the site says 26 validation errors and asks me to start again.
I did this 3 times and errors continued till gave up.
I assume cookie problem.

I redid the form OK using Opera Mini 4 on Nokia 6230 (Java MIDP) so the browser has a bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. answer every question (click radio button or tick box)
2. 1/2 way through 26 validation errors due to site seeing fields not entered
3. restart at question 15
4. repeat ad infintum or quit
Actual Results:  
26 validation errors - question 15 (multiple radio button question) has red star next to all parts of question (about 20) saying not filled in which I did fill in and redid several times.

Form is never finished.

I assume cookie is not being handled correctly so form data is lost when click 'continue' for each page.

Expected Results:  
Form goes from page to page  and no error and form submitted after about 10 pages

Cookie should save state between pages so the form is submitted as one long data entry.

Opera Mini 4 on Nokia 6230 (Java MIDP) works fine with no validation errors.
So it is the browser not the form or Website. The form is crossplatform.

I can't upgrade Firefox on my EEEPC 701SD as ASUS is not maintaining a compatible build. Debian builds do not work on ASUS build of Linux.

Browser is set to accept cookies and 3rd party cookies but error still occurs.
