Not able to connect to a Hamachi device
With adb helper addon, I cannot connect to the phone again.

This error is flashing, from time to time it works, but in certain situations, don't know when, is impossible to connect to the phone.

I already checked that in developer options remote debugging is enabled for adb and Devtools

Here is the log that I have in the console next to the connnect buttons:
