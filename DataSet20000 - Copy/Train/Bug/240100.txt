Browser sometimes hangs on keyboard "tab backwards" command

This is an intermittent problem, but a consistent one - I probably reproduce it
once per day or so.

Occassionally, when using keyboard commands to navigate tabs (ctrl-tab,
ctrl-shift-tab), if I tab backwards, the browser hangs, consuming 100% of the
CPU. After 1-2 minutes of hanging, it GPFs. This seems to be most reproducable
when I submit a form and then quickly back-tab to another page. It does not seem
to be related to any given number of tabs (I've produced it with 2 tabs open as
well as with a full toolbar), nor does it seem to be limited to any given page.
I cannot say for certain if I have ever experienced the problem without form
submission, but I know that at least the majority of the time, it occurs upon
tabbing immediately after form submission. I don't believe I've ever observed
this behavior when using forward-tab. However, even if the browser freezes, it
seems that the data that I posted in the original form still gets posted
successfully.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open two or more tabs, with a form (maybe with a POST method?) somewhere
besides the leftmost position.
2. Post some form data.
3. Immediately after pressing the submit button, use the ctrl-shift-tab key
command to tab to the previous page. This isn't a 100% surefire reproduction,
but seems to occur at least semi-frequently.

Actual Results:  
The browser will sometimes lock up, the CPU pegs at 100%, and the browser GPFs
after 1-2 minutes if I don't kill the process.

Expected Results:  
The browser should have displayed the selected tab without freezing.
