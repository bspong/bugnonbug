After restarting firefox with a few saved pages reopened, Firefox froze and I check the windows task manager. It's a surprise that firefox is running with 50% CPU and 500MB+ of memory and increasing. The biggest memory usage was 1.2GB, that's crazy. A few seconds after reaching that number windows alerts the system is running out of memory and firefox application is terminated.

There were actually 3 pages: wildguns.co.uk, gmail.com, worldofwarcraft.com/account in the first time. The first 2 pages do use a lot of javascript (which in my guess can cause all of those). But javascript wasn't really the problem because I tried opening wildguns.co.uk and this page bugzilla.mozilla.org it's the same. The number 1.2GB memory useage actually happened with these 2.

Take a look at 2 screenshots:

I use firebug, this has been causing me a lot of problem too. Not sure if it's because of this addon.

FF version is 3.0 RC1
