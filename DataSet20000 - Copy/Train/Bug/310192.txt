large bookmark file freezes Firefox UI for 30 seconds

A large bookmark file apparently causes the Firefox UI to freeze for
approximately 30 seconds the first time Bookmarks is selected after startup and
when the position of any bookmark near the beginning of the file on the top
level is changed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  2 GHz P4
2.  2500 line bookmark file (475 kB with no icons)
3.  Firefox disk cache setting to 0 kB
4.  start Firefox
5.  click Bookmarks

For additional freezes:

6.  open bookmark manager
7.  choose a bookmark on the top level (not in a subfolder) and near the top of
the display, and move it up or down one position

Actual Results:  
The Firefox UI freezes for about 30 seconds.  Sometimes the opening of new Win2k
windows or starting of Win2k applications is blocked as well, but this is not
predictable.

Expected Results:  
Remained unfrozen.

The Firefox UI does NOT freeze under the following conditions:

1.  subsequent clicks of Bookmarks after the first time after startup
2.  in the bookmark manager, when bookmarks near the bottom of the display or
below the top level (in subfolders) are moved
3.  when the bookmarks sidebar is opened or used (except to move bookmarks as
previously noted)
4.  when the bookmarks file contained significantly fewer entries

It occurs to me that my bookmark file top level is significantly larger than any
of the sublevels (folders), and if the problem were related to the number of
bookmarks per level rather than the total number in the file, that could explain
why manipulating the bookmarks in the subfolders does not (yet) cause a freeze.
