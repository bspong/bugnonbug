i recently updated my Firefox from version  3.6.8  to 3.6.9 

now when i view 'Show Update History' from  Tools >  Options > Advanced > Updates and then click on "Show Update History" section  the correct date is not getting displayed for installation
it displays Date as 01,January 1970 and time as 5:30:00 Am whereas actually its 09,September , 2010 and time is 1:50:00 AM 

This is also valid for the date on which it was installed i.e. for version 3.6.2 (from Show Updates section)it displays value as 01,January ,1970 time as 5:30:00 AM     

Reproducible: Always

Expected Results:
