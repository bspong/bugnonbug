Session Restore is broken due to recent regression in FF53 & FF54
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/56.0.2924.88 Safari/537.36 Vivaldi/1.8.755.3

Steps to reproduce:

STR:
To reproduce the problem Use FF50 & FF54.

Also set setting: restore tabs & windows on restart
e10s on /off doesn't matter

now use this session-store file

https://1drv.ms/u/s!AqDeaDGj6aTxgb4MpSkzyOsD5grHNg

might not be totally sfw.

use FF50 and open the session.

to the right there are 75tabs & 2tabs to the left.

now click open tabs to the right, especially the tabs labeled new-tab.
They have sites stored in them(NO DATA LOSS!)

now open the same session in FF54 and click tabs and they are restored properly that is even new tabs with data/no data loss.


But now the problem can be reproduced

now open the same session in FF54 and then close FF54 and start again

see the total number of tabs they are reduced from , all tabs which sometimes shown as new-tabs even with data are removed
IMPORTANT DATA LOSS

Now this is fairly common with default profile(except restore tabs at start)
and a low speed/crap connection.
Like open multiple tabs quickly on a page and the connection of isp has low response and some pages fail to load and tabs are labelled as newtab(but stil contain data as they should of url and etc),
restarting FF50 does not loose those tabs but FF54 does loose them.

Please Fix this to work like FF50 does so none of the important data is lost due to improper connection or renaming to not properly loaded tabs etc

I am sorry if was not clear in my explanation.
if any more question are there i'll try to answer them.



Actual results:

This is a major regression and users updating will unknowingly  suffer data loss!!

just use the same session in FF50 no loss of data
in FF54 no loss first time with same session(sessionstore file is ok and working properly)


but just use the same session in FF54 & restart FF54 twice and data loss.

And FF54 does not save data which is incomplete/not totally correct
but is important still like 
improperly loaded tabs / not completely loaded tabs/ tabs stopped loading for some other reason 
and named new tab.
FF50 does this properly & so did FF53 just before this bug was filed & session store was modified




Expected results:

https://1drv.ms/u/s!AqDeaDGj6aTxgb4NQiu_HtoNHAK0YA

Open in FF50 : 58 tabs open and session is loaded properly.
Click on the tabs named new tab & data is loaded properly=NO DATA LOST

open in FF53/54 : restart again
from 58 tabs it goes don to 19 tabs=IMPORTANT DATA IS LOST

58 tabs to 19 tabs

IDK why but FF50 data restore is VERY RELIABLE & FF54 is just not up-to the mark.
In normal browsing , incomplete tabs and websites which do not load properly or some reason FF crashes etc then FF54 looses data & info unlike FF50 which no matter what keeps all info & restores properly

The bunch of patch (Bug 1323987 and Bug 1306294) should be backed out.
