HI,
I am running mac 10.4 mac preview and appleworks.
I am now moving over to using Ebay selling manager pro to produce my 
invoice/packing slips.
I can do single slips no problem.
But,when I try to do multiple slips all the information is correct on 
the (firefox)page with the invoices one below the other,then when I go 
to preview print
The first invoice is fine, then ,on the rest only the address of the 
recipient  appears not the content of the invoice.
I have tried it with word but no change.
I have emailed Ebay they have told me to change to a different browser. I changed to Safari  it works fine printing multiple pages.Bt I prefer Firefox and it is a hassle to keep opening Safari
 I would appreciate your help please.
