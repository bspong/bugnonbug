After dragging a local file to the bookmarks toolbar and attempting to rename
the bookmark the CPU load goes to 50% (on HT cpu) for ~5 sec, then I am greeted
with "A script on this page is causing mozilla to run slowly. If it continues to
run, your computer may become unresponsive. Do you want to abort the script?".
It I click cancel then the situation repeats. If I click OK (abort the script)
then the bookmark remains with its old name.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create file c:\temp.htm with the following content(4 lines):
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/strict.dtd">
<html lang=en>
<head><META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<TITLE>title</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><H1>h1</H1></body></html>
2. Open windows explorer and drag file c:\temp.htm to the bookmarks toolbar. You
will end up with a button captioned "file:///C:/temp.htm"
3. Right click on that new button, select Properties and change the name to
"temp". Click OK

Actual Results:  
The CPU load goes high... see the details. 

Expected Results:  
Rename the button, i.e. change it's caption.

Note that there is no script in the htm file.
Workaround: Bookmarks -> Manage Bookmarks -> open the Bookmark Toolbar folder,
Right - Click -> Select "New Bookmark...", enter the name you want and
"file:///C:/temp.htm" in the location bar. Note that the bookmark created that
way is not renameable as well.
