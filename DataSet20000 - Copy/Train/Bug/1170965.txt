Back and forward button not properly working on Linux since v38.0.5
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0
Build ID: 2015052300

Steps to reproduce:

Open any web page in a brand new profile with Firefox and click on any link.
Example: http://www.spamhaus.org/


Actual results:

The back button remains disabled. By right-clicking the back button the history menu pops up, though, and is navigable.

Also, I have opened local pages which use iframes and by means of javascript manipulate the browser history and suddenly the back and forward buttons did appear and remained there for the rest of the session. However, it was still not quite normal behaviour, as both buttons remained visible and active even with an empty history list.

I haven't been able to reproduce the code that leads to the activation of these buttons (it's not as simple as putting a mere history.replaceState statement somewhere in a script).

But anyway, these buttons should work as they did up to v38.0.1 without any tinkering.


Expected results:

Back button visible but disabled on opening an new browser window; the button's state changing to enabled once a link has been followed and the forward button showing up as soon as the active back button has been clicked. 

I don't have the same problem on Windows 7. My Linux distribution is openSuSE 12.3.
