Firefox does not release system to open InDesign CS4 document

Seems to be an issue with InDesign only, as far as I can tell. It takes many clicks and a few minutes to toggle from Firefox to an open document window in InDesign (version CS4). Firefox menu bar persists over the InDesign open document even when the Firefox application is hidden. 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Indesign CS4 document and then a Firefox window
2. Click on the CS4 document to bring the InDesign window to the front 
3. 
Actual Results:  
Cannot access (edit, navigate etc) the InDesign document for several minutes even though the document window is front. Firefox toolbar persists.

Expected Results:  
I should be able to access the InDesign doc and Firefox app should go to the background  

maybe webpage specific, happens at least with many webpages. haven't tried to troubleshoot because I've been frustrated trying to get to my document. have had to close Firefox several times in order to edit my document.
