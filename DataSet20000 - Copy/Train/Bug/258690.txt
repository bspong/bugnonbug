When you activate a tab that has a long title (where the text is longer than the
tab), then there is a brief moment where the text exceeds the boundaries of the tab.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up two tabs in your browser
2. In the first tab, go to http://forum.osnn.net/showthread.php?t=40713 or some
other site that has a title longer than the tab shows.
3. Click on the second tab to bring it to the foreground.  (This will cause the
tab with the long title to go to the background.
4. Click on the first tab (the one with the long title).

Actual Results:  
In the split second while the tab is activated, the text (the title) overlaps
the boundaries of the tab.


The order of events seems to be as folows:
1. User releases mouse button to activate tab.
2. Text turns bold (and exceeds boundaries of the tab if long enough).
3. Tab redraws as the active tab.
4. Text is resized to fit the tab.
