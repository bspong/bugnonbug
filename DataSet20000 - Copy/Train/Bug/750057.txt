Cookies that have "Expire: At the end of the session" get deleted after FF restart since FF11.0. Doesn't happen on FF10.0
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:12.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/12.0
Build ID: 20120420145725

Steps to reproduce:

Since v11.0 Firefox doesn't remember those cookies that have "expire at the end of the session" after session restore. It was working on v10.0. I noticed it because of the youtube player. I always have it set to large size, and on v10.0 after Firefox restart it always stayed that way. But since v11.0 (and now also v12.0) the cookie that holds the player size gets deleted on session restore.
What did I do? Go to youtube.com, open any video, set the player size to large. Now close the page and close Firefox, saving the session (it's important to close youtube.com, otherwise the cookie doesn't get deleted). Reopen Firefox (restoring the session), go to youtube.com, open any video.


Actual results:

After restarting Firefox the youtube player is again of small size, because the cookie "wide" didn't get saved.


Expected results:

The cookie "wide" should have been restored with the session, just like it was working on Firefox 10.0.
