This is not in the batch operation, this is in single photo mode. Firefox doesn't remember the last group you added a photo to (in a current "send to group" session) but MSIE does. Each time you send a photo to a group and then click "send to group" again to send to another group, the drop down reappears, but displays the beginning of the alphabetised list, it does not go down to the last group you assigned the photo to like it does in in MSIE.

Also, when in "send to group" drop down, FF won't let allow page up/down keys to scroll through the drop down, it moves the whole page. But in MSIE it moves just the drop down.

Not sure if the two issues are related so I put them both here.

I started another report for the "page up/down key" issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open individual photo
2. Click "add to groups"
3. Add to any group, prefferably down a few page scrolls
4. Click all confirmation buttons to return to photo
5. Click "add to groups"
6. Notice list starts at the top, does not at the group you last chose.
Actual Results:  
The drop down does not reappear showing the last group chosen, it just starts at the top. 

Expected Results:  
In MSIE, when the drop down reappears, it scrolls down to the last group you added the photo to.
