Popup menu in bookmarks sidebar disabled during first page loading
With the bookmarks sidebar open, just after opening Firefox, if you click on a bookmark to replace the home page and then try to right-click on another bookmark while the first bookmark hasn't finished loading, the popup menu on the second boomark has all its options disabled. If you wait until the page corresponding to the first clicked boomark has finished, popup menu appears normally, as it happens if you try to repeat the process with a third boomark while the second is loading.

Tested on Firefox 3.0.1 es-ES Linux, Firefox 3.0.1 en-US Windows and Firefox 3.0.2pre es-ES Linux nightly.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open Firefox 3.0.x (not tested with 2.0.0.x).
2. Open bookmarks sidebar.
3. Expand boomarks tree until you can directly access to at least two boomarks.
4. Left click on the first boomark so it replaces the current (hidden or not) tab content.
5. While the first bookmark page is still loading, right-click in the second boomark to try to choose "Open in a new tab". All options in the pop-up menu will be disabled.

Expected results:

At least some options in the pop-up menu should be enabled, just like it happens when doing the same operation with a second and third bookmark.
