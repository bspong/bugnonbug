With the lattest version of Firefox (downloaded 26th January, 8 a.m. CET,
english version), if you click in the Bookmark menu and change a bookmark's
address by rightclicking on it and choose "Properties", it's ok.
But when you try to use the Bookmark menu again after that, it doesn't work
anymore (precision: I also use the "Compact Menu" extension and I'm not sure the
bug happens without it).
If I restart Firefox, the Bookmark menu works again.
