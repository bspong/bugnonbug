when Firefox crashes  big Temp files are automatically created under windows temp folder

Due to plugin incompatibility or may be due to other bug, whenever I close firefox, it crashes. Firefox then prompt to send crash report. I allow it to send the report. This happens every time I close firefox.

Windows gave me low space error. I didn't install any software and I knew there was plenty of empty space earlier. 
I then checked Temp folder under Local Setting folder unders User's folder in Document and setting folder.  

C:\Documents and Settings\USer A\Local Settings\Temp

There were above hundred folder. a group of folder I noticed occupied more than 7 GB of space and I wondered what that would be. more than 7 GB of 15-20 folders. They all had similar names. beginning with 'ww'. Opened few of them they contained Mozilla firefox files DMEZ or something . Without collecting more info I deleted them and then I thought of writing here.
