Setting Firefox as default on Windows 10 can sometimes open a windows dialog instead of the defaults app.
In Bug 1175293 we added the ability to set Firefox as the default browser via UITour. We then built a welcome page for Win10 users in Bug 1186485, which makes it easier for the user to set Firefox as their default browser. 

When clicking the "Let's do it" CTA button on the welcome page, one of two things happens:

a.) Firefox is set as the default browser in a single click, if possible.
b.) Firefox opens the Win10 default settings app, where the user can set Firefox as the default browser themselves.

During QA we noted that a third scenario can also sometimes occur:

Clicking the "Let's do it" button brings up a Windows message "To change your default apps, go to Settings > System > Default apps [OK]", instead of going to the system file. [1]

I'm not clear on when this scenario happens or it's already a known issue, however I felt we should still open a bug for this. Given the copy on the page I think this can add to some confusion for users. 

Both myself and rbillings have seen this message occur. It definitely occurs sometimes for a), not sure about b).
