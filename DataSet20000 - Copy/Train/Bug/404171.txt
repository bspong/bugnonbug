Recently I've compressed my Firefox history using mozStorage Explorer executing some SQL queries on places.sqlite database.

The most common was

DELETE FROM moz_places WHERE url LIKE "%somesite.com%";

After that I cannot manage my bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add some bookmarks
2. Actively visit many pages from the above bookmarked sites
3. Clean your history by executing SQL queries against places.sqlite.moz_places table

Actual Results:  
"Organize bookmarks" spills many errors and almost doesn't work.

ASSERT: empty URL spec
Stack Trace:
o:PU__uri(null)
1:PTV_getCellText(10,[object TreeColumn])

Expected Results:  
Working bookmarks.

Deleting history entries is NOT an option 'cause Firefox deletes entries one by one thus trashes your HDD.

In the case I've presented I manually deleted around 7000 history entries based on their url.

It's plain impossible to do that via history browser.
