bookmark folder keeps disappearing, i dont know why. at first, i thought it was
minor, however, i have had to import bookmarks from IE 3 times already today. i
dont know what the problem is. i also noticed that when i attempt to log in to
my website, at http://www.00freehost.com, once i am logged in, the browser fails
to respond. i think there is some link (connecting to thefreesite.com or some
site like that) that is causing that to hang. the problems might be tied,
because when i had to kill the firefox process, the bookmarks were gone when i
restarted it. 
i used to always be able to log into my webhost from firefox. this has just
started happening.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.i dont know how to lose the bookmarks.
2.i can make it hang by logging in to my web site host, http://www.00freehost.com
3.

Actual Results:  
the browser will stop responding.

Expected Results:  
i used to always be able to log into my webhost from firefox. this has just
started happening.
