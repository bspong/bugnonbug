Two Inches of blank screen at bottom; App locks up; Use 'option' 'apple' 'esc' to exit
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/523.12 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.0.4 Safari/523.12
Build Identifier: Firefox 2.0.0.11

On launch and continuously thereafter there is approximately two inches of blank screen below the word 'DONE' at lower left corner of window/screen. 
After entering web address and 'enter' key to begin browse, Firefox locks up. To escape I must use the 'option' 'apple' and 'esc' keys simultaneously.
I have tried downloading a new Firefox and installing it but that has made no change.
My Macintosh is: Using Mac OS X Version 10.4.11; Processor: 533 MHz PowerPC G4; Memory 640 MB SDRAM
I love Firefox and have been using it for a couple years now. After I downloaded this present version I began having problems. I have not ever gotten this version to function correctly.
HELP!
