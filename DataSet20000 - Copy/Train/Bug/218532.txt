a misconfigured web server can redirect a browser somewhere completely
unexpected instead of delivering a directory index.  Firebird caches this
weird redirection even after the server has been reconfigured.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. configure a "boa" web server on a debian woody machine named "kewanee" with
default boa.conf
2. look at an existing directory in your web space, with no final slash, so you
get redirected to kewanee/yourdir/
3. Thanks to firebird keyword expansion, you are now looking at the web page for
Kewanee, Illinois, instead of a directory index
4. edit your boa.conf file so redirections take you to the directories like they
are supposed to.  -HUP to reload configuration.  Full kill and restart, too.
5. attempt to reload the directory which was misdirected earlier

Actual Results:  
i got the cached page even though the server was no longer misconfigured

Expected Results:  
requested the redirection again instead of believing the earlier
"permanent redirection" instruction (or whatever boa told it)

"Hog day" (from misdirected web page) looks like a fun festival
