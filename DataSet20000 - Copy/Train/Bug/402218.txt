I am using the google personalized as my home page. When i try to open a new tab (right click on link and click on open as new tab) the browser freezes. When i try to open the page under the current window the browser does not seem to freeze as often but does at times. The specific link on www.digg.com that i'm trying to open at the moment is the following (http://digg.com/world_news/Venezuelan_troops_use_tear_gas_on_Chavez_protesters_but_CNN_ignores_why)


I have seen the same problem with other links on digg as well. I'm unsure if i have seen this problem in opening tabs from other sites but i'm not able to reproduce this at the moment. I'm also using version 2.0.0.9 and have seen this problem with earlier versions as well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Mozilla with google IG as home page.
2. Add Digg 'window' to show links which are popular on digg.com
3. Try to open a new tab with one of the linked pages
Actual Results:  
Expected page to open as new tab. Found that browser freezes. In some cases when i open the link in the current window it works at other times it does not but at this time i'm not able to reproduce the browser freezing when opening page in current window. Because of this i feel this may not be due to tabbed browsing but i'm not sure.

Expected Results:  
It should not have frozen and should have just failed to open the page.
