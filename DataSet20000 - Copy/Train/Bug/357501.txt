When trying to scroll a web page using the edge of the touchpad on my laptop, the cursor changes to a "scrolling" cursor but the page does not actually move.  This happens in all windows within Firefox including "View Page Source" and the Java Script console, however scrolling works fine with all other applications including Internet Explorer and I am able to scroll firefox manually by using the scrollbar on the edge of the window.

My Laptop is an Acer Aspire 1693WLMi and the touchpad is a Synaptics TouchPad V5.9 I have downloaded the latest drivers for this touchpad from the Acer website and this has not solved the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ensure Virtual Scrolling is enabled from mouse properties and check it works in another application.
2. run Firefox and open a URL with a page long enough to be scrolled
3. try scrolling the page using the virtual scrolling feature of the touchpad

Actual Results:  
Mouse pointer changes to a "scrolling pointer" (which looks like a scrollbar with a normal mouse pointer over the top of it) but the page does not scroll.

Expected Results:  
Page should have scrolled.

I've rated the problem as minor because it's probably specific to my hardware and there is an easy workaround as I can still use the scrollbar.
