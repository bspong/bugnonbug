everytime i execute program i get an error,and i either starts with firefox 3.6 or it installs firefox 4 beta all over again.
it´s annoing,i have to wait everytime i acces the program.
allso,i get error on firefox persons alldough they work just fine.
and last but most annoing is the fact that all players,jwplayer,adobe,divx webplayer take a lot of time to charge,and it blocks firefox rendering it useless for at least 10 minutes...
allso,the 3d graphics crash,and are reverted to classic firefox,at best,the program has restarted several times and repeats installation process..
hope you can do something about it,i really like firefox,i use it constantly as my main browser,i´d hate to have to use i.e. or anny other program.untill today i found firefox to be the most stabile and reliable browser.
sorry about anny grammar mistakes,i´m livving inn spain for some time now,i´m out off practice:(...
have a nice day

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.acces program
2.repeats installation or starts as non3d or version 3.6
3.gives errors and crashes players alldough they finally work after 5-15minutes
Actual Results:  
simply access program adn it starts acting crazy

Expected Results:  
exactly as described above,reinstalls or starts as firefox 3.6
allso with the players it´s a constant bugger,i can´t even watch youtube:|

well,this is a dumb question;))...it should have worked propperly,no errors,no unnecessary reinstalation(atleast not automatic),no fake errors on addons and programs that work and most important no conflict with web players...
i fully understand it is a beta version,but it is firefox and all versions including beta have worked just fine in the past.
oh,and wtf,why does it show my passwords????i know it should remember them but to show them?i happend twice in the last cuple of hours:|
not to speak about the fact that when it freezes it shutts down,and so causing the loss of the data or page i was on,and that it literally refuses to load anny page at all untill i restart the pc or shut down firefox from task manager:|
