Java Problems: Gotomypc (Other Java apps as well?) do not resize

When I open a gotomypc computer with firefox, the window with the remote pc opens, and the new window automatically spans both of my monitors (xinerama is enabled).
The desktop is displayed in the middle of the two, making it extremely annoying to use.
Furthermore, any attempts to resize the window to one of the two monitors results in loss of ability to view the remote desktop, which is viewable only in the center of the display, regardless of the position of the firefox window.
This does not happen with opera.
I have tried this under both gnome 2.8 and kde 3.3 and it does not appear to depend on any window manager.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to Gotomypc
2.Sign In
3.Access a PC


Actual Results:  
Remote desktop appears in center of screen, unmoveable, unresizeable.

Expected Results:  
Browser should pick one screen or another and display the desktop there, preferably allowing the window to be moved/resized and having the desktop still be visible.
