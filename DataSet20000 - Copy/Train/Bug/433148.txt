This message from my Trend Micro sucurity system opens within 5 min of my using Firefox in Win XP.  This is despite fact that I have stopped any saved foms on Firefox.  This has been happening over the past 10 days or so.  i usually use Fedora 8 but am in Windos most days for a short while.  It also happnes when I use Firefox on another computer in the house.  Note my system is protected by a linux firewall operating on a separate computer with two ether net cards.  That system uses shorewall and is secure.  So, the google iste muust be replying to a request form firefox, sine otherwise the firewall would prevent the incoming call. Note too, that the message comes up without my using google (I now do not!)  Presumably therfore there is code in Firefox that calls google even when i do not want that to happen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox in Win XP and wait for a few minutes.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
As above

Expected Results:  
Trend Micro states that the site attempted to access my credit card details and asks if I want that to happen

How about not sent a call to google when I am not attempting to contact that site !!
