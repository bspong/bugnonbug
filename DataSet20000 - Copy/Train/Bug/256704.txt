I was gonna by these 4 CDs ("Astma Presents", "PLANET EUTHANASIA",
"Gatumusikanterna", "Helt Off") and added them one by one to my shopping cart.
When you have done that, on the left frame on the page, you have this red button
saying "Till kassan" ("Check out" in swedish). When you click that you are taken
to a page where you are supposed to log in and finish your order. However, when
I click the button I'm taken to the log-in-page but I can't fill in my username
nor my password and Firefox freezes and I have to end it from the task manager.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Add some CDs to your shopping cart
2.Click the "Till kassan"-button in the left frame
3.Now Firefox freezes when it has taken you to the log-in-page

Actual Results:  
Firefoz freezes

Expected Results:  
Not frozen, it should have let me log in

The page uses a secure connection when you log in (SSL I suppose). Perhaps that
is what's messing things up...also, I have successfully ordered things from this
page in Mozilla, so this might by a problem only affecting Firefox.
