While working on bug 1205898 we noticed that some code in tabbrowser.xml is calling TelemetryStopwatch.timeElapsed twice for the Histogram FX_TAB_SWITCH_TOTAL_E10S_MS, where as TelemetryStopwatch.start("FX_TAB_SWITCH_TOTAL_E10S_MS") is only called once. 

According to callstacks, here is the place where it happens: 
https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/tabbrowser.xml#3535

After the patch for bug 1205898 lands this will cause a similar message to appear in testing logs and possibly in browser console:

13:24:23     INFO -  3 INFO TEST-INFO | (browser-test.js) | Console message: [JavaScript Error: "TelemetryStopwatch: requesting elapsed time for nonexisting stopwatch. Histogram: "FX_TAB_SWITCH_TOTAL_E10S_MS", key: "null"" {file: "resource://gre/modules/TelemetryStopwatch.jsm" line: 303}]

STR:
0. if bug 1205898 is still open modify 
https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/telemetry/TelemetryStopwatch.jsm#153
to include some debug output as for example:
dump("*** ERROR ***: TelemetryStopwatch: requesting elapsed time for nonexisting stopwatch. Histogram: " + aHistogram + "\n");

1. ./mach test browser/base/content/test/ --e`0s | grep "TelemetryStopwatch"
2. Observe the error reports.

See the attached file for a sample output obtained by running:
./mach test browser/base/content/test/general/browser_action_keyword.js --e10s > tabbrowser-telemetry-stopwatch.log
