fonts reset to defaults on dual-boot machine (both Firefox and Thunderbird)

I am running an Ubuntu 7.10/Windows XP Professional dual boot machine with shared profiles for Firefox and Thunderbird. I changed the fonts in Linux to match the defaults in Windows. However, any time I use the Windows system, when I boot back up in Ubuntu the fonts have been reset to the Linux defaults instead of keeping the user settings. I assume this is because the program reads the settings as the defaults in Windows and assumes it is set for default fonts. If I change to some other font or boot back up in Linux without using Firefox/Thunderbird in Windows the fonts stay as they were set.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Boot in Linux.
2.Start Firefox (or Thunderbird) and set fonts to Windows defaults (Serif=Tahoma, Sans Serif=Arial, Monospace=Courier New)
3.Reboot in Windows and open Firefox (or Thunderbird)
4.Reboot in Linux
Actual Results:  
The fonts have reset to Linux defaults (Sans Serif/Serif and 16 point).


Expected Results:  
It should have kept the actual fonts rather than assuming this was set to the default. Actually, I really wonder why 16 point is default in Linux to start with, but that's not really a bug.

Both operating systems are using Firefox 2.0.0.13 and Thunderbird 2.0.0.12. Other than this problem, the shared profiles work great.
