As I said in the nightly build thread (http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=3163663#3163663), I used to be able to hover over a URL to see the whole thing in a pop-up box. Now, I cannot do that.  Take, for example, the below URL.  It is impossible to see the entire thing on my screen.

I can see "...&postord", then it cuts off.  I should be able to hover my mouse over the URL and see the whole thing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type a really long URL into the URL box.  Make sure the long URL is already in the drop down.

2.  Do you see how the URL is too long?

3.  Hover over it.  A yellow box should pop up with the whole URL.
Actual Results:  
Only part of the really long URL is shown.

Expected Results:  
The entire URL should be shown in a yellow tool-tip box.
