Remove legacy generator from browser/.

If the code fits into async function and also it's test code, replaced legacy generator with async function.
for other cases, just replaced legacy generator with ES6 generator.

some notes:

* browser/base/content/test/chrome/test_aboutCrashed.xul
  Task.jsm and Promise.jsm are no more used.

* browser/components/downloads/test/browser/browser_libraryDrop.js
  |drop| function (previously |task_drop|) now returns promise, so
  |yield*| in caller is changed to |yield|

* browser/components/privatebrowsing/test/browser/browser_privatebrowsing_DownloadLastDirWithCPS.js
  all functions called by |runTest| can return promise, so changed |runTest| to async function and just await for them.
  also, checkDownloadLastDir and checkDownloadLastDirNull didn't return value.  fixed them.

* browser/components/privatebrowsing/test/browser/browser_privatebrowsing_downloadLastDir_toggle.js
  what |testHelper| does is Task.async, that can be just replaced with async.

* browser/components/privatebrowsing/test/browser/browser_privatebrowsing_windowtitle.js
  |testTabTitle| is also used like Task.async, so replaced with async

* browser/components/sessionstore/SessionMigration.jsm
  this can also use async, but I used ES6 generator since it's not test.
  also, replaced |throw new Task.Result(state);| with |return state;|,
  since ES6 generator can return value.

* browser/components/sessionstore/test/browser_capabilities.js
  |createTab| returns a promise that is resolved to tab.
  so that can be rewritten by async that returns tab.

* browser/components/sessionstore/test/browser_formdata_format.js
  this test waits for the all tabs to be closed,
  so created an array of promises, and pushed all promises that is resolved
  when the tab is closed, and the test finishes when those all promises are
  resolved

  |testTabRestoreData| function does partially Task.async, so replaced whole
  function to async.
