browser_google_behavior.js & browser_bing_behavior.js fails when run in chunks on Cedar
We are currently running mochitest-bc on Cedar in chunks and with the devtools tests split out into their own suite. One consequence of this work is that we are seeing test interdependencies come to light as failures when things don't run before or after that were expected. These failures are blocking our ability to get these big improvements into production.

One common failure we are seeing is the following in browser_google_behavior.js on Linux and Windows:
