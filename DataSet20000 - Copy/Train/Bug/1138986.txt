Tab Utilities and Tab Utilities Lite 1.5.28.1 break location bar input
Steps to reproduce:
1. In a brand new profile, install either Tab Utilities or Tab Utilities Lite, then restart Firefox when prompted.
https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tab-utilities/
https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tab-utilities-lite/

2. Type an address into the location bar, then either press the Enter key or click the Go button.

Actual results:
Nothing happens. The Browser Console shows,
ReferenceError: params is not defined tulib.js line 99 > eval:63:6

Expected results:
The typed address should load. The aforementioned error shouldn't appear in the Browser Console.

Notes:
In the description for Tab Utilities, the author notes, “Stop at Fx28 to get full TU functionalities.” Therefore, I suggest marking both add-ons as incompatible with Firefox 29 and later. Also, I don't know if there's any policy about add-on authors telling users to shoot themselves in the foot, but it seems reckless to have that sentence there.

Also in the same description is mentioned, “Note: There will be no update before Oct.” which refers to October of last year. The support link for Tab Utilities Lite points to a Mozillazine thread. The author last posted there on 2014-10-26. Since then, bug reports have accumulated there and in the reviews section, and there's also a mention of an e-mail support request going unanswered.

For the first add-on, there's an alternative called Tab Utilities Fixed.
