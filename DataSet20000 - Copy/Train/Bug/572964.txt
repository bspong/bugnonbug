Normally the keyboard alt-leftarrow should return FF to the previous page. Previous versions did this error-free, but the last two have had this bug. If the new page has not finished loading BEFORE pressing alt-leftarrow, then the screen is erased and replaced with a gray screen. Keyboard inputs are no longer accepted by FF. Refreshing the screen with the "Refresh" button cures the issue, but one cannot press F5 to fix it.

Same behaviour on two x86-64 machines both under windows-7-64. 

Behaviour is normal if the page has finished loading. I do this a lot on craigslist.org so try it there.
