Crash because of memory access error during play try of Real media files

I would like to listen to some music examples from the album "Tägliche Landschaft" of the group "Ruben Cossani". Unfortunately, all open firefox  windows vanish if I click on links in the section "Hörbeispiele".
(I assume that a SIGSEGV error was triggered.)

I can listen to the referenced RM files if I try the same with applications like the following on my openSUSE 11.0 system.
- SeaMonkey 1.1.11
- xine plug-in of Opera 9.50
- RealPlayer 10.0.9.809 (gold)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
elfring@Sonne:~> firefox http://real.amazon-de.eu2.speedera.net/ramgen/real.amazon-de.eu2/phononet/B/0/0/1/4/G/A/K/F/4/01.01.rm
Gtk-Message: (for origin information, set GTK_DEBUG): failed to retrieve property `GtkTreeView::odd-row-color' of type `GdkColor' from rc file value "((GString*) 0xb06aa0)" of type `GString'
/usr/bin/firefox: line 123: 16041 Speicherzugriffsfehler  $MOZ_PROGRAM "$@"
Actual Results:  
Music example from Amazon is not played because of a memory access error.

Expected Results:  
I would like to hear a few seconds of music without application aborts.
