According the mockups, the Firefox button should be like this on WinXP : 
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/4.0_Windows_Theme_Mockups#Large_Button_Mode_with_Firefox_Button

So far, the button just look like a Vista/7 button, i.e. a button from Aero theme : http://img543.imageshack.us/img543/4846/firefoxmenu.png

Hacking title bar is not usual on XP applications, therefore it should be done wisely.
IMO the aim of the mockup is not only to show the button should be enlargen, it is to focus on the fact that it should _fit_ the OS, i.e. the Firefox button should just look like the close/minimize/maximize buttons and should not touch the top edge of the title bar (quick example on attachment 483125 )
By extension, the button should also be different on Win XP w/ classic theme, and on WinVista without aero.

If UI developpements still continue in this direction, there will be inconsistencies on other systems than Win7, because currently the button just fits this OS.

Reproducible: Always
