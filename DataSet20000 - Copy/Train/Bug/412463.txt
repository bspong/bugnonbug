XML Feeds/Live Bookmarks - Not Loading As Expected When Imported From a FF 2 Generated Bookmarks.html
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86_64); en-US; rv:1.9b2) Gecko/2007121016 Firefox/3.0b2

NOTE: URL Given is an example. 

There are two behaviors in this issue.

1.  Feeds won't load at all - If FF 3.0b2 is installed and uses a ~/.mozilla from Firefox 2.0.0.x, live bookmarks/xml feeds will not load even if the user prompts FF to reload the live bookmark.  Live bookmarks imported if .mozilla already exists exhibits the same behavior.

2.  Feeds Load, but only manually - If FF 3.02 is installed and uses a fresh (does not exist at first run) ~/.mozilla, feeds imported from a bookmarks file will load, but only manually.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Behavior - Not Functional

 a. On a system with Firefox 2.x loaded and XML feeds bookmarked, export the bookmarks.
 b. Install and run FF 3.0 b2  Note the feeds are not loading
 c. Import the exported bookmarks
 d. Attempt to reload the feeds

2. Functional with user prompting reload
 
 a. Export bookmarks from a previous install of FF 2
 b. rm -rf ~/.mozilla or rename it to another name
 c. Install and run FF 3.0b2
 d. Import the bookmarks
 e. Attempt to load the feeds

NOTE: FF 3.0b2 might need to be restarted 
Actual Results:  
In the first behavior, I cannot get FF to reload the bookmarks.  Old data appears in the XML feed.   In the second, I can get FF to reload the bookmarks if I ask it too, unlike FF 2 behavior.  

Expected Results:  
The feeds should load regardless of being imported from a file or by virtue of FF 3.0 using the same profile dir.  This has the potential of confusing users that frequently use XML feeds.
