Deleting an account does not clear the Sync Prefs account information.
Going through the FxA/Sync account deletion flow does not update the FxA/Sync preferences page.

I can delete an account, but the email listed on the Prefs page is still the old account.
Even if I create a new account or sign in with a different current account, the preferences page will still show the old email.
I even tried to restart the browser to clear this field, but it did not clear.

Now if I attempt to create a new account, I still see the old account email in the prefs page. The only way to "clear" this appears to be by clicking on the "Forget this email" link.
Once I do that, I get the nasty yellow bar and a 401 before I am switched over to the new account info so that I can complete a sync.

STRs:
1. Delete the current account
2. Restart the browser
3. Sign in with a current account or a new account
4. Go to Prefs > Sync and note that the old account is still listed.
5. Try syncing - this is successful even though the logs show that sync appears to be happening with the old/deleted account
6. To clear the old account info, click on Prefs > Sync > "Forget this email"
7. Get a yellow bar and a 401
8. The new account will now work for syncing.
