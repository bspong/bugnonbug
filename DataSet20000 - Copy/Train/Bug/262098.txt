Links in Outlook Express don't work
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10

After setting Firefox as the default browser, when I click on an underlined link
in an Outlook Express message (OE is the mail program I use), nothing happens. 
If I open Internet Explorer and set it back as the default browser, and close
it, the links work just fine -- but in Internet Explorer, of course, which is
what I'm trying to get away from.  Now, when I set Firefox as the default
browser, the URL filetype was still set to open with IE; I changed it to
Firefox, and the links still didn't work with Firefox as the default browser. 
So what I have done is set IE as the default browser but I use Firefox for
everything beside email links.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Default browser:  Internet Explorer 6; mail client, Outlook Express 6.
2. Install Firefox 1.0PR.
3. In an email message that has an uderlined link with a URL, click on it.
(Nothing happened.)
4. In Windows Explorer, changed the URL filetype to open with Firefox.  Went
back to message, clicked on link.  Again, nothing happened.

Actual Results:  
After step 3, nothing happened.  Opened IE and reset it to the default browser,
and link functioned properly.

Expected Results:  
After setting Firefox as the default browser, a link in an OE message should
open the link in Firefox.
