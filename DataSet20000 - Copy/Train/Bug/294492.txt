Sidebar bookmarks don't load even though they show they are checked off to load
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

This happened only in the latest version 1.0.4, as soon as I updated to that
version. The sidebar is blank (not greyed out or otherwise defective, just
blank). If I go to View, and then to Sidebar, it shows a check next to
Bookmarks. I can cure this only by unchecking the sidebar bookmarks, letting the
screen reload, then going back to view and rechecking bookmarks. Then they
appear normally, as in previous versions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Shut down firefox with sidebar bookmarks checked off and functioning properly.
2.Reopen firefox, usually after shutting down computer
3.Sidebar is blank, requiring steps noted in "Details" to correct.

Actual Results:  
Sidebar is blank even though bookmarks are checked off and even though last
session it had the bookmarks (due to manually unchecking and rechecking the view
sidebar bookmarks choice as explained above in "Details")

Expected Results:  
It should load with the bookmarks in the sidebar.
