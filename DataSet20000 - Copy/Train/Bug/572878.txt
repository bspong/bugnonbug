Unchecking "Load images automatically" would not work on Google search.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I want to turn off image displaying in Firefox so I tried to disable that function by unchecking the "Load images automatically" in the Content tab of Firefox's Options. I unchecked it (there are not any exceptions) and click OK.
When I surfed the web, I saw there are not any images appeared on the webs I went in.
However, it does not seem to work well on Google search.
I went to Google.com and I did not see the logo. It was nice, however, when I typed in a key word (for example, in this case, I used "tiger" for testing). I pressed enter and looked at the results. I was so amazed when I saw there were some pictures displayed on the Google search results.
I think there are something technically wrong here . :)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.google.com (do not go to search Images, this is search Web).
2. Type in the search textbox a key word. Not all key word will make Google display the images this way. For example, a good keyword for this case may be "tiger" or "pictures". Press enter or click Search.
3. Now you would see Google search result as usual, but Google would display some images related to the keyword. Those images are not hidden as expected.
Actual Results:  
Some images of Google still appears on Google search results.

Expected Results:  
Those images should not be displayed due to unchecking "Load images automatically".
