Bug 392870 - Easy discoverability of Tabbed Browsing for new users introduced the closing of the browser when clicking on the close ("X") button of the single tab. This has "caught out" many users who were unable of this patch being landed.

The adding or enabling of a dialog box to confirm the closing/exiting of the browser regardless of whether the browser is set to restore the previous browsing session would be a nice way to avoid annoying (antagonizing?) users. It would be OK if it were the same as the existing WarnOnClose and/or WarnOnQuit including having the option to disable it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browser with just a single tab.
2. Click on the single tab's Close ("X") Button.

Actual Results:  
Browser closes immediately and without warning.

Expected Results:  
A warning or confirmation dialog box should come up asking if the user wants to close the browser.
