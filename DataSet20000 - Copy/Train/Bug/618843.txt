"Session restore" not available after OS crash.

After initiation of the system shutdown, Firefox offered a dialog box with the option to "Save and quit" button which was pressed. System crushed immediately after. On the next reboot Firefox opened just the home page, without any option to restore previous sessions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I believe that crushing the system immediately after pressing "Save and quit" button might reproduce the behavior.
2.
3.



Having an explicit option to "Restore Last Session" in the drop-down menus would be prudent.
"Two phase commit" concept employed for the "Save and quit" button would likely eliminate possible racing condition against the OS actions.

Because some of the pages opened in the multiple tabs were not bookmarked and subsequent attempts to search for them failed, a significant loss of information occurred.

Even though an unrecoverable loss of information/data resulted, I believe that rating Major instead of Critical would be more appropriate.
