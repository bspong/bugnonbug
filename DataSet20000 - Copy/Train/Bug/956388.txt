To trigger entering customization mode, you can just call `window.gCustomizeMode.enter();`. The transition is complete when the 'customizationready' event is fired.

To exit customization mode you can call `window.gCustomizeMode.exit();`. The transition is complete when the 'aftercustomization' event is fired.

Avih, can you look in to this?
