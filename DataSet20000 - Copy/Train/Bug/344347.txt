When you have enough search engines in your list that you have to scroll, go to a page that offers OpenSearch plugins. They are recognized and added to the bottom of your list. Scroll down the list as far as possible, close the list, switch to a tab with a page that doesn't offer OpenSearch plugins, open the list with the search engines again and you'll find an empty area at the bottom of the list according to the number of plugins the other page offered.
