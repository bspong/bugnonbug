Clear history when Firefox closes: cookies, doesn't clear session cookies in Firefox 4+
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0

In Firefox 3.6.x, checking 'Cookies' inside 'Clear history when Firefox closes' does what it's supposed to do: clear browser cookies on Firefox exit.

Since Firefox 4, this preference no longer clears the locally cached browser cookies. Closing, then starting Firefox shows previously set cookies despite having the aforementioned preference enabled.

I have read that since Firefox 4, work has started on supporting clearing plugin cookies when the preference is set, e.g. Flash LSOs. But starting Firefox 4, this preference no longer clears browser cookies, at least in Linux.

Perhaps this might be a side-effect of the problems with the ongoing work on supporting cookie cleaning for plugins, unless I missed a change in policy concerning this preference.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Check 'Clear history when Firefox closes' inside Preferences -> Privacy.
2. Check 'Cookies' inside 'Clear history when Firefox closes' settings.
3. Close, then start Firefox.

Actual Results:  
The browser cookies that were supposed to be cleared are still present when viewing cookies.

Expected Results:  
The browser cookies should be cleared and viewing cookies should show up empty.

I do have the browser remember opened tabs when it exits. At the same time I have browser.sessionstore.max_concurrent_tabs set to 0. But even so, I have a blank tab selected when the browser restores its session, so viewing cookies should still show up empty, save for extensions that I have allowed to set cookies via exceptions.
