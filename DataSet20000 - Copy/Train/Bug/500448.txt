The browser hangs indefinitely when visiting pages containing a particular form of windows media embedding (mac-only).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the attachment or mentioned site in the browser
Actual Results:  
Browser hangs indefinitely

Expected Results:  
Browser does not hang

This is also reproducible in Safari 4, so my initial response was to assume the windows media plugin was at fault. I verified that I was running the latest version of "Windows Media Components" (version 2.2.3.7), reproduced it there, and then contacted telestream support (desktopsupport@telestream.net). 

Telestream support booked this as case 1-61142.

Their support person responded to me that this was not a plugin error, but instead was a site design issue. So, because I don't think it's acceptable for the browser to hang for any reason, I am booking it here.

I have already contacted the site owner to correct their page, so the linked page might start working in the near future (for this reason I will attach a demo page).

This problem also occurs in safe mode.
