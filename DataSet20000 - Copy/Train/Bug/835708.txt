User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:18.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/18.0

Steps to reproduce:

i am doing normal activities when for the last 2 months i get this very annoying interruption:




Actual results:

My 18.0.1 Firefox gets me this page  http://127.0.0.1:10029/public/dapster_regexs.js every 5-10 minutes without any warning ..nothing, just this can happen any time .... sometimes it happens consecutively 2-3 times ...and normally every 5- 10 minutes. 
and because the system tries to automatically find this webpage using the default search engine it takes me to yahoo search engine while it says that it couldnt load the http://127.0.0.1:10029/public/dapster_regexs.js page. Then apart the fact that usually i have lost what i was doing, i have to press the back button to go back to what i was doing hopefully! 

i have several add-ons and plug ins installed, i tried the safe mode of firefox and i didnt had any issues so probably the problem lies somewhere there? I dont know how to make a list of  the extensions and plug ins that are installed in my browser!!


Expected results:

this is an interruption so it shouldnt happen
