Constant high CPU usage with nothing loaded

My Firefox got into a state today where it was pegging my machine. I thought I had a flash tab open, so I closed down all possible tabs until I was just left with a small static png image as the only open tab.

My memory CPU usage is constantly fluctuating between 25% and 35% for the FireFox process, and has been doing so for about 20 minutes now with no signs of stopping. I killed the plugin-container.exe process thinking that it would help, but nothing. I showed which addons I have loaded in case you want to lay blame on those.

Now I am a big fan of FireFox, but I see this happening a lot. I leave the browser up, and my computer fan starts to get crazy. Normally I hunt down a flash ad, but in this case, there is nothing I could do. I hate to rip a page out of the Chrome book, but a task manager would help greatly in situations like these.

The screenshot should point out a couple of problems with FireFox actually. One small png image open, 250MB memory footprint, 30% CPU load, and no way to track down the issue on hand. Hopefully work on Electrolysis is progressing along, as I am on the verge of switching to Chrome. I just love firebug, noscript and true adblock too much to do so in it's current state.
