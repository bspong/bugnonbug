comes and goes - right now I have 2 browsers open with multiple tabs - both have a weather.com page open and one looks good and the other is all expanded...
The page format seems to get's lost, the dropdowns & listbox(s) are all expanded (dropdown list is not compresed into the box),  (scrolled listbox data not concealed within box)
I have opened new browsers both before and after a re-boot and sometimes the new browser will look OK, other times (more often than not) it will retain the 'expanded' look - - - I just ignore it
Then 2, 3, 4 browsers later all is back to normal for a while?????

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Actual Results pane = page source of good page
2.Expected Results pane = page source of bad "expanded" page
3.
Actual Results:  
Page Source of another tab in this browser - looks OK:

TOO Big 65K max - I got cut off...


Expected Results:  
Page Source of another tab in a different browser that is all "expanded":

TOO Big - same as above...

I entered my zip code 77095 on the home page, then on the zip code page I used the MyNeighborhood tab to select Local Schools, then CyFalls .  Error comes and goes.  If you get to happen try to hover over the expanded list on the top left of the screen and portions dissapear - takes a page re-load to get them back and so far they have always come back expanded.  Is this just me?
