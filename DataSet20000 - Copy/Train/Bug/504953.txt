Clean up firefox branding in the build system
The organization of the branding stuff irks me every time I touch it... The Firefox (release) bits are in /other-licenses/branding/firefox, and the generic (pre-release) branding is in /browser/branding/unofficial, but the nightly (Minefield) branding is scattered all over. This leads to a number of special cases in the build for nightly vs release/prerelease. And I'm always scared that make some change that works for nightly builds but will explode in release builds.

So, I've reorganized things to make this simpler. There should be no differences in the bits users get; this is all just build-side changes.

* All the scattered nightly bits move into /browser/branding/nightly (which is currently emptys sans 1 file). This tree now becomes identical (in layout) to /other-licenses/branding/firefox and /browser/branding/unofficial.

* MOZ_BRANDING_DIRECTORY is now always set. It defaults to /browser/branding/nightly. This also removes the need for the OFFICIAL_BRANDING and MOZ_USE_GENERIC_BRANDING hacks.

* Simplify $MOZ_BRANDING_DIRECTORY/Makefile.in. All it really does is copy files into $dist/branding/. There were a few cases of files being renamed as they're copied, I've moved that into browser/app/Makefile.in (so it's done in one place instead of each branding flavor).

* Fixed a few file permissions that didn't need to be executable (their different color in my shell's ls output was irritating me).
