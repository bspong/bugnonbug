Visiting a page or site which is not functioning properly (like, currently, the one provided) Brings up the 'problem loading page' error page with a "try again" button.

If you do this on a clean window/tab with no browsing history, no matter how many times you hit "try again" either the problem page comes up again or, if the page starts working, the page comes up.

However, if you do this in a window or tab that you've previously visited other functioning sites with, then click the "try again" tab more than twice and the page you are looking for does not function, it will take you back to the page that you were previously viewing in that window/tab.

NOTE: This also affects firefox nightly x64 on windows 7 as well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.mozilla.org
2. Visit http://www.gloelloriginals.com (or any site experiencing DNS problems)
3. Click the "Try Again" button a few times...

Actual Results:  
Page went back to mozilla.org

Expected Results:  
Either gloelloriginals.com should load if it comes back up or the problem page should continue to show.
