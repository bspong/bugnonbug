Testing environnemnts:
-DSL connexion 11Mbits/s (home) + LAN connexion 100 Mbits/s (office, government network),
-websites hosted on different level 1 domain names and different country to eliminate national/regional/local ISP access problem.

Accessing several web sites (each one in a separate tab) trigger the pages loading process (wheel animation on tabs). The loading process seems running forever like if there was traffic jam (like a DNS/routing problem).
Multiple repeated (on a really short period of time) aggressive access request clicks sometime make the targeted pages display instantly.

There is a significant "burst like effect":
traffic is blocked, loading process seems loop, and suddenly the jam disappears.



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a bookmark folder containing several bookmarks pointing on different websites (hosted in several countries and level 1 domain names to eliminate country/regional/local ISPnetwork problems)

Actual Results:  
Wait up to almost 1 minute before the "traffic jam looking like" symptom disappears and the pages ALL loads in a "burst effect".


Expected Results:  
The web sites complete page loading in a short delay thanks to DSL/LAN speed.

The pages start loading and the loading process runs forever, looping.
