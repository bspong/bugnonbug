Have only one "Chinese, Simplified" item (gbk) in the Character Encoding menu
Currently, gb18030 is a superset of the gbk decoder and if bug 959058 is fixed, they'll have the exact same decoder.

This means that right now, if the user sees mojibake and expects the page to use a legacy Simplified Chinese encoding, it always makes sense to try gb18030 instead of trying gbk. When bug 959058 is fixed, this means that the distinction between choosing gb18030 and gbk will be too subtle for user to know about and even when users do know about the distinction, they can't know what a particular site requires.

We should remove one of the menu items. If we did did it right now before fixing bug 959058, we should remove gbk and leave gb18030. However, if we wait  until after bug 959058  is fixed, we should probably remove gb18030 and leave gbk  to prefer the more conservative encoder behavior for misauthored pages.

Either way,  we should probably make the remaining "Chinese, Simplified"  item be checked when the user looks at the menu regardless of whether the encoding of the current document in the the top-level browsing context is gbk or gb18030. (While implementing that, we should probably make the "Hebrew" item checked even if the encoding of the page is iso-8859-8-i.)

emk, annevk, opinions on which one to remove and which one to leave?
