Installed Firefox 1.5 on desktop, but when "Run" was clicked, a box came up that said "unspecified error".
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/

1. I downloaded Firefox 1.5 onto my desktop. (We have dial-up so it took 40 min.) 
2. I clicked on the icon on my desktop: "Firefox Setup 1.5.exe" 
3. A box came up with this text: "Open File - Security Warning - The publisher could not be verified. Are you sure you want to run this software?"
4. I clicked "Run"
5. Then a small box came up that said "7-Zip" at the top and "Unspecified error" below that. The only thing to click was "OK" which made the box disapper.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download Firefox 1.5 onto desktop
2. Click on the icon on desktop: "Firefox Setup 1.5.exe" 
3. Box comes up with this text: "Open File - Security Warning - The publisher could not be verified. Are you sure you want to run this software?"
4. Click "Run"
5. Small box comes up: "7-Zip" at the top and "Unspecified error" below that. Click "OK" - box disappers, nothing else happens.

Actual Results:  
Nothing.

Expected Results:  
Enabled me to run and use Mozilla Firefox 1.5.exe

Wanted to install Firefox because in trying to access www.12DailyPro.com, a possible virus caused the page I was trying to access to be blank, with "Done" in the bottom left corner. This happened to another person also, which led me to believe that there was a virus present, and if I used Mozilla rather than Internet Explorer, that would solve the problem.

Thank you very much for your help.
