After some of the upgrades unsure if it's 2.005 or 2.004 have noticed that if i have lots of tabs opened and after pc comes from hibernation,firefox seem to be incapable of resolving those websites or new ones without me having to close it completely and restart firefox. I don't believe this is a problem with router or my dns server cos internet explorer works fine. The pages would just be saying loading and will never completely load and after a while(long time 5mins+) i finally get page cannot be found(normal dns error). The only i can take care of this is to open a brand new firefox after making sure the previous one and all it's tabs are closed . This seem to happen after several hibernation sessions.

1.hibernate pc

Expected Results:
