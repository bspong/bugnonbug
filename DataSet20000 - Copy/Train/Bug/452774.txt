Jetty Server unable to update the URL of Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

Hi i as using Firefox/2.0.0.14, i have deployed a J2EE Struts 1.3 based web application using Jetty 6.1.6.

in the application i have used hyperlinks (for orders) to redirect to a page that displays the details of that order. the "orderid" is passed in the url in the format "http://localhost:8080/EZSM/OrderDetailInformation.do?status=inprocess&orderid=4".

on the order detail page i have written Javascript to extract the orderid and repost the page. when the page is reposted the URL remains "http://localhost:8080/EZSM/OrderDetailInformation.do?status=inprocess&orderid=4" and does not change to "http://localhost:8080/EZSM/OrderDetailInformation.do".

the action page is unable to change the url using action mapping.

The url gets changed in case of IE6 and above. i am experiencing this problem on other pages also.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Displayed order list
2.clicked on Order id (hyperlink)
Actual Results:  
The page keps posting (happens on Firefox not on IE) and no data is displayed on the page.

Expected Results:  
The page should post only 2 times and then display the detail information of the order.
