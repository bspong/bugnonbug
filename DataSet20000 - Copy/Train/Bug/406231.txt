The FIRST (and potentially most important) image on page WILL NOT DISPLAY if "Real Player Browser Record Plugin 1.0" is enabled AND there is no <link> with Type= included in the <head> of the page.

Succeeding images display correctly.
Turning off the Real Player add-on resolves the problem.
Adding a link in the headder resolves the problem.
(The links don't even have to work, they just need the "text=" attribute.)

Try the following html.
