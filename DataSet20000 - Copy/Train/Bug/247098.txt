if a few of the items in a <select> are pretty long the drop down will resize to
fit them accordingly causing the scrollbar of that drop down menu to find itself
out of the viewable area on screen.  possible solution would be to move the drop
down menu to the left until the scrollbar is within the area of the browser
window   and to restrict the maximum width of the drop down to the width of the
browser window viewable area.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. build a select box with a few <option> with very long descriptions
2. view the page containing that select box
3. click on it to view the drop down options

Actual Results:  
the scrollbar will be out of the viewable area if the descriptions are long
enough, rendering the ability to scroll in the menu inexistent.

Expected Results:  
relocate to the left the menu so that the scrollbar fits in the viewable area of
the browser and restricting the maximum size of the drop down menu to the
viewable  area of the browser window.

while this bug is minor, fixable by using shorter descriptions, it renders one
of our web application unusable in Mozilla Firefox.
