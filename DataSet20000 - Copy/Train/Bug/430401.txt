After the last update to Firefox we found that there was no longer any sound at the Webkinz URL above. I checked my sound preferences, speakers, volume controls etc. and all were working fine (with iTunes, etc.)

Also, after the update certain textbook CDs for my wife's classes no longer had sound. The CDs were created to be used with Firefox as the browser for the course material (click on the icon, it opens in Firefox and you navigate through the lessons that way); we have Flash and Shockwave installed and the CD program verifies that the browser is good before we start the lessons, but there is still no sound.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the URL above
2. Login
3. Play

The CD course:
1. Insert CD ROM
2. Click on icon
3. Click verify browser compatibility
4. Click on lesson to view
5. Lesson progresses, but there is no sound
Actual Results:  
Graphic-wise, everything worked as it should.
Sound-wise, there was no sound.

Expected Results:  
Expected to hear the sound from the website, and expected to hear the sound from the course CD.

The problem with the course CD will probably be hard for your staff to reproduce as you would need the edition of my wife's coursebooks. Could the problem be with Flash/Shockwave? Does this version of Firefox need different versions of those two plugins? I'm pretty sure we have the new versions, but am not savvy enough with computers to really troubleshoot past what I've provided here.
