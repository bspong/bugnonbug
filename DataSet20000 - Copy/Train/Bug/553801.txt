Crash is occurring every 12-24 hours after launch. This began after upgrading from Firefox 3.5.x to Firefox 3.6.2 beta. Under Firefox 3.5.x I hit the 2GB barrier after about a week with a regular bad_alloc crash due to abusing too many tabs, but this is not the same cause. I have not been able to identify the cause.

As you can see from the attached crash report from 3-20-10, it appears that there is a runaway XUL loop triggered by JavaScript:

NS_GetComponentRegistrar_P + 37978
NS_InvokeByIndex_P + 88
NS_GetComponentRegistrar_P + 57341
NS_GetComponentRegistrar_P + 36247
JNIEnv_::CallStaticObjectMethod(_jclass*, _jmethodID*, ...) + 272922
(repeat)
