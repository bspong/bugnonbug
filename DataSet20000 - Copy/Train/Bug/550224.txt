Insufficient time for reopening session may give error message.

The error message suggesting removing pages from session restore may not initially be required.
When I reopen a session I always get this message and used to give up at this point since removing pages did not seem to help.  However when ignoring this error message eventually the pages all open.
Perhaps an alternative error message or different instructions could allow the system more time.  Or perhaps the system could be changed to open one page at a time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Opened firefox after forced closure
2.Restored session fails and gives suggestion to cut out some pages - of course although I have no idea which pages might have failed all I can do is close them one by one, trying to remember which relates to which information I want to look at again on the web sites (THIS IS THE REASON FOR THE SESSION RESTORE).
3.Even closing pages did not allow the other pages to open.
4.Using restore seemed pointless so I stopped using firefox - other browsers do cope with restoring.
5.At some point I just ignored the error message - the pages DO eventually load.

6.Changing the error message OR the time sequences in the opening program may enable others to use the restore feature.
