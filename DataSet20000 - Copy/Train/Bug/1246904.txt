Consider turning all eslint warnings into errors
I just realized that the ES job that runs in our CI environment only fails if there are ESLint errors.
ESLint warnings are fine, they don't fail the build.

This means that it's possible to land a patch that removes some exclusions in .eslintignore even if the corresponding files still have warnings.

And this happened in bug 1242278.
Since that landed, all ESLint jobs report the following warnings:

TEST-UNEXPECTED-WARNING | devtools/client/inspector/markup/markup.js:667:15 | "prev" is already declared in the upper scope. (no-shadow)
TEST-UNEXPECTED-WARNING | devtools/client/inspector/markup/markup.js:680:15 | "next" is already declared in the upper scope. (no-shadow)
TEST-UNEXPECTED-WARNING | devtools/client/inspector/markup/markup.js:958:25 | "added" is already declared in the upper scope. (no-shadow)
TEST-UNEXPECTED-WARNING | devtools/client/inspector/markup/markup.js:1504:1 | Line 1504 exceeds the maximum line length of 80. (max-len)
TEST-UNEXPECTED-WARNING | devtools/client/inspector/markup/markup.js:1519:13 | "container" is already declared in the upper scope. (no-shadow)
TEST-UNEXPECTED-WARNING | devtools/client/inspector/markup/markup.js:2852:14 | "val" is already declared in the upper scope. (no-shadow)
TEST-UNEXPECTED-WARNING | devtools/client/inspector/markup/markup.js:2892:17 | "name" is already declared in the upper scope. (no-shadow)

I would like to argue that if we're going to turn a rule ON, we might as well make it report errors, not warnings.
I see very little purpose in having warnings only if they're not going to be reported anywhere visible to developers.

When you're *writing* code, having warnings and errors in your IDE seems fine. As a developer you could use this information as: an error is something that just won't work if I test my code now (syntax error), and a warning is something that isn't really nice, and that I should fix before committing the code, but I can still work on my own thing before doing that.

This only works if both errors and warnings would fail the CI ESLint job.
If only errors do, then we should just forget about warnings.
