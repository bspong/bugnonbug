location bar autocomplete should take word boundaries in account
Since bug 389491 was fixed, typing in the URL bar results in a case-insensitive search in the URL and title is done and the results are sorted by visit_count, visit_date.

Here's a problem with this approach:

There are two often-visited places in my history, among others:
1. http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Special:Recentchanges, with a huge visit_count, and the title="Recent changes - MDC".
2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Watchlist, with a large visit_count, which is much smaller than the first place's visit_count.

Before the patch, I could type "e" or "en" to get the autocomplete popup with the wikipedia page being first. Now "en" matches "changes" in the MDC page's title and it's the first. The first time I saw this, it took me a minute to figure out why the MDC page was even matched, it certainly looked broken.

Another example: I used to have one letter shortcuts for many of the pages I visit regularly (say, 't' for firefox tinderbox), now most of them bring up https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/process_bug.cgi

I suggest the algorithm should be tweaked to avoid matching in the middle of a word like this. So for example 'en' shouldn't match 'Recent changes', or xen.org, but should match 'en.wikipedia.org', 'subdomain.english.com' (?), 'Learn English in 21 days'.
