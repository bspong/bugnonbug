In previous versions of Firefox, the Bookmark Keyword feature was more useful than the Search Box because it was configured by default to quickly search the web using only keyboard commands. ie: typing in "g firefox" in the location bar would search Google for 'firefox'.
This was no longer included with Firefox by default in favour of including these search capabilities in the Search box feature. This however is not as good as the keyword as it requires a mouse click (or Press F4, then up/down)to select an alternative search engine which is more time consuming and not as 'quick' as going to the actual search engine website to do it.

The feature enhancement request is to move the 'Bookmark Keyword' feature to apply to the Quick Search, and for the Quick Searches bundled by default to include the keyword, and for engines added later to also include a keyword if the addon was configured for one.
