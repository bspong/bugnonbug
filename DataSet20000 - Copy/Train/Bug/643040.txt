Odd error appears in error console on URL Hover or click with no A:hover style

I was correcting style and other errors on my website, by paying attention to the error console in Fox.  I then noticed this following error, which I can't decipher, which occurred on my local home page [not the web site].

Error: preview is undefined
Source File: file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Mozilla%20Firefox/modules/WindowsPreviewPerTab.jsm
Line: 352


The above "error" appears in the error console, and has various instigators.   They appear as an error, and not warning or etc., and the error is always identical -- nearly.  I've seen an error "preview is defined", and which seem to land on line 267, but I'm not sure if that is absolutely right ... can't reproduce that one.  I've also seen 2 other occurrences of the error with other line numbers, and I can't regenerate those.   They all seem to have similar ideology:

I have a local html page which is defined as my home page.   
The style for that page includes a:hover, to change style over URLs I have defined with <a href...>

How I can trigger the error:  

I open FOX, and the home page appears; I then move over the URLs with my mouse, before clicking on anything.  If I move the mouse over to the FOX window, and the error triggers with a hover over the URL.  It triggers, again, if I move off the URL.   I can generate a long list of these errors by moving the mouse around and over all the URLs on my home page.

If I remove the a:hover [I used firebug to kill the command], these errors no longer appear....however,

If I click and hold on a URL, the error triggers; and triggers again if I move off the URL and release the left mouse.

If I click on Google, opening a 2nd tab...   I can trigger the error by moving from the first to second tab.  Or clicking the tab to return.

I can trigger it, too, by moving to another application, and then again by returning [merely moving the window focus using the mouse click] [before clicking on content on the window].

This one is better:  If I open a new tab with the home page [a 3rd tab] and I move to the error console, and back, nothing happens.  If I move, with focus on Fox, between the 3rd & the 1st tab [both home pages] the error occurs moving each way.   If I move from the error console to Fox, when the tab focus is on the first tab, I can generate the error

Actually, moving between any tab, and the first tab, generates the error.

I -don't- suspect this for critical, but then, you never know...   Seems like when something is undefined, all sorts of odd, unintended things could happen, eh?


Reproducible: Always
