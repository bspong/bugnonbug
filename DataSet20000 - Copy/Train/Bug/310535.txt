firefox (all) hangs when viewing pages with a lot of text
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20050929 Firefox/1.6a1

I wish I could get more details on why this is happening, but here's what I've 
got. When I'm using any version of Firefox that I can find (nightly builds, 
alphas, bettas, stable releases) I consistently run into a problem where it 
will open normally, load the homepage normally, and then as soon as I start 
browsing around to different sites it will (seemingly) randomly lock up for as 
long as a minute. In that time, the window does not respond AT ALL. I can't 
scroll, I can't exit, minimize, open links, new tabs, etc. The only page I 
have found that consistenly does it is the "Most Frequently Reported Bugs" 
page for bugzilla. Does not happen exclusively on https pages. Tried 
uninstalling and reinstalling, installing different versions with new 
profiles, still no dice.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open browser
2. go to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/duplicates.cgi?

3. scroll up and down until it hangs

Actual Results:  
browser hangs, cant close the window at all

Expected Results:  
should have continued to respond

pretty high end machine. no stability problems with any other programs.
