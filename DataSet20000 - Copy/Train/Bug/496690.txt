Build Identifier: ff 3.5 betta 4 & the version before that

Okay.. for me this has been going on for over three weeks & the latest 2 versions of FF... FIREFOX CONSTANTLY OPENS WITH UPDATE PAGE & MY HOMEPAGE, MULTI TABS.... I used to think FIREFOX was great, so much faster than IE.... now... I have had enough of FIREFOX... It takes forever to load, constantly shows "FIREFOX NOT RESPONDING "  MESSAGES & FF opens with the update page & my homepage.... IS ANYONE GOING TO FIX THIS ??????  I WANT A TRUE FIREFOX SUPPORT... 
N O T some forum where 10 people give you 20 different reasons for stuff & wind up argueing amoung themselfs.....

in three weeks I have gotten NO help from  the forum sites... leaving me & I'm sure  others feel this too as just left by the wayside, just left hanging... WHERE IS SOME TYPE OF PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT

Firefox sure ain't what it used to be... far from it &  to be honest, I have had it, I'M TOTALY DONE WITH FIREFOX..
