Unclear error message when importing bookmarks with bad permissions

<background> I use Google Browser Sync to sync my bookmarks.. I installed a new laptop thanks to my hard drive dying.. I installed FF2, ran the GBS and downloaded my bookmarks, thne I upgraded to FF3 RC1 (which you can't install GBS onto)
Next I realised I created my user account with the wrong name, so I created a new account, then I was stuck with FF3, and no GBS, therefore no bookmarks (darn!), so I exported the bookmarks from UserOld to the root of the hard drive. Firefox CORRECTLY (I think) created this with my own user permissions (only readable by UserOld). so I logged in to UserNew, </background>

<bug bit>and used the import bookmarks file. Firefox reported "Error processing bookmarks file", which I thought was odd, since the same copy of firefox had exported them.. The problem was that the PERMISSIONS were wrong...



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.export bookmarks file
2. Make non-readable to the current user (chmod bookmarks 000 should do it)
3.try and import this file
Actual Results:  
Firefox reported "error processing bookmarks file"

Expected Results:  
Firefox should report "could not open bookmarks file", or even better asked for authentication like programs such as Smultron do.
The above message implies that the file is corrupt.. Had I been less able to look around the system (thinking someone's granny), I would possibly think that bookmarks export / import was broken.

Not a show stopper I know, but anything that lowers barriers to adoption is nice right??
