Problem first occured when I was starting Firefox 3.6.1.15 after a upgrade. It instantly crashed during addon check. Thought it was a problem with the addons, but even trying to bring firefox's safe-mode option window crashed. So I removed it from my computer and re-installed. Same thing here. Finally downloaded Firefox 4.0 full and tried, crashed instantly. But now I could get the safe-mode option window up. Disabled all addons. It actually loaded up and worked to surf on! Amazing I thought. Wanted to check if I could remove all my installed addons from the Addon tab, but then it instantly crashed and started reproducing the same crashes I had from the beginning.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox

Actual Results:  
It crashed almost instantly after loading.

Expected Results:  
Worked in a proper way and not crash instantly.
