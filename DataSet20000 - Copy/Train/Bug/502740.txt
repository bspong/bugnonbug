after closing firefox process is not being killed and it stays in memory and it takes lots of cpu usage

when i close firefox process is not being killed! it's still on a windows task manager process list and it takes 50pc of cpu usage. when i open again firefox windows task manager processes list's shows another firefox process which takes 0pc of cpu usage and the previous firefox process which still takes 50pc of cpu usage. when i close firefox and open it again windows task manager process list shows me on windows task manager processes list's 3 firefox process which 2 out of 3 take 99pc of pc usage!!!
the only way to deal with it is to kill processes manually 

i've noticed this happening after upgrading firefox to 3.5 and i've always been upgrading to newer versions once after it shows up

here is the list of my extensions:
-adblock plus 1.0.2
-british english dictionary 1.19
-download helper 4.5
-downthemall! 1.1.4
-flashblock 1.5.11.2
-foxytunes 3.5.5
-java quick starter 1.0
-microsoft .net framework assistant 1.1

and my theme is default 3.5



Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
after finished using firefox process should have been killed
