A popup window containing form submitting code doesn't seem to work.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Open the URL provided. Find the form at the bottom right of the page. It's a
loan application type of thing. Enter a number - 100000 and press the button
labelled 'Beregn din ydelse'.

A popup window appears. The html has an onload spec in the body tag that says to
submit the form, but nothing seems to happen. No warnings either.

Actual Results:  
Blank popup window


Expected Results:  
Results from form submission appearing inside the popup window. Try in Internet
Explorer - works fine there.


As far as I can tell this should really work. If I am mistaken and this turns
out to be a problem on the web site of the url provided, I naturally apologize.

I took the liberty of setting the severity up one notch from a trivial bug
because I've seen it on a couple of other web sites as well, and it really is
annoying because you have to start up IE to get the expected results.
