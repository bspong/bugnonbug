Bookmarks Toolbar disappears when RealPlayer is running.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1

Whenever I run RealPlayer, and then close Firefox, when I open Firefox again the Bookmarks Toolbar icons *disappear* even though "Bookmarks Toolbar" is still checked under "Options."  The Bookmarks Toolbar bar is still visible, but has no icons.  By unchecking "Bookmarks Toolbar," and then rechecking "Bookmarks Toolbar," the icons reappear.  This happens even when I have all the RealPlayer plug-ins disabled, and run RealPlayer through Internet Explorer.  (This sort of problem does not occur in Internet Explorer, so the conflict must be between Firefox and RealPlayer.)
