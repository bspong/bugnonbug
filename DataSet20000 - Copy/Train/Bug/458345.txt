flash objects from the top of a long page are redisplayed further down the page, covering other content

Sometimes, on long pages containing several embedded YouTube objects, the objects not only appear in their proper places on the page but are also repeated elsewhere on the same page where they clearly do not belong. I first noticed this on some Salon.com pages (with Firefox 2.0.0.16 or possibly earlier). This time I can provide an easier to access example:  

The Think Progress article http://thinkprogress.org/2008/10/02/vice-presidential-debate-live-blogging/
contains six flash objects, all in the top fifth of the page (the article proper) and all displayed normally. The article is followed by many (currently 523) comments. Starting in the vicinity of comments 434 and 435 (currently about 4/5 of the way down the page), the same objects recur in the same order covering and obscuring the text of the comments. 

Reminiscent of bug 373016 which reports (also on long pages with flash objects) 
"rectangular blocks" (rather than additional copies of the objects) "covering parts of page". That's Mac, though, and this is PC.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://thinkprogress.org/2008/10/02/vice-presidential-debate-live-blogging/
and note the five Flash objects and one Flash JavaScript near the beginning of the page.

2. Scroll down the page to the vicinity of Comments 434 and 435. Note the first Flash object redisplayed over the text of the comments. Between there and Comment 480, note the other Flash objects redisplayed in their original order.

The position of the redisplayed objects does not seem to depend on the total length of the page. As the number of comments grew from 523 to 526, the repeats occurred in exactly the same positions.
Actual Results:  
Same objects repeated in same places. The page now has 527 comments total.

Expected Results:  
Should have displayed each object only once, near the top of the page where the HTML actually calls for it.
