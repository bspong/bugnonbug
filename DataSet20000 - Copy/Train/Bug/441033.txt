Address bar and Search tool bar - its typing in reverse - mirror image
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; InfoPath.1)
Build Identifier: Firefox 3 - Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

When I start typing an address in the Address bar or a string in the (Google) search bar (right of the address bar) - it's typing in reverse.

e.g.1: "wikipedia electric car" in the search bar types out as "eltrrac cice aidepikiw" - so its garbled and also in reversed!

e.g.2: Typing "firefox"+Shift+Enter in the address bar types out "http://www.xoferif.com/" and takes you to the http://www.xoferif.com/ website too!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a new window of Firefox
2.Start typing out an URL or a search string!
3.
Actual Results:  
Well this did not happen the first time I started using Firefox 2 days ago. Just started happpening all of a sudden today.
I will next try restarting Windows to see if it is reproducable.
I will then try reinstalling Firefox 3 to see if it is still reproducable.


Expected Results:  
you are not able to type straight any more!

Not sure if one of the webpages I opened prior to seeing the bug caused this!
But all the webpages opened were clean webpages - Google, Wikipedia, Yahoo, etc.
