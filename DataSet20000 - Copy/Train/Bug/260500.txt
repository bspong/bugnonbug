Browser requests favicon.ico on every page view

Recently Firefox was changed so that by default, it will search for /favicon.ico
(in the root web path) on every page request, where a server doesn't have a
/favicon.ico file.

However, under this new behaviour the number of HTTP transactions is effectively
doubled.  For instance, every time I go to a new site Firefox will request the
current URL as well as favicon.ico, getting a 404 error for favicon.ico.

Unfortunately, it appears that this behaviour was implemented for compatibility
with sites designed for Microsoft Internet Explorer.

Firefox's current implementation of it is over-agressive and ultimately worse
than IE's.  Firefox sends a request for /favicon.ico file on every page load,
rather than just once when the page is bookmarked.

In my opinion, if we are going to add features in order to be compatible with
sites designed for Microsoft Internet Explorer, then at the very least these
features should not be excessively resource-intensive.

Reproducible: Always
