Firefox goes to 90-100% CPU use, hangs, and locks up my computer every time I view a flash movie of browse Google Maps.  FF (3.0.10 on Windows) switches itself to Above Normal thread priority, which is probably related to the computer lockup.  I have had to cold reboot my computer 5 times today because of this.  I have tried waiting 30 minutes, but it totally hoses my computer, with lots of data loss.  There of so many of these kinds of hang-related bug reports, it's hard to know where/how to report them.  I can't even get a trace or error log out of my computer, since it completely freezes up.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.load a few tabs in FF
2.load google maps, and move/zoom the map for a few seconds
3. Computer freezes up
Actual Results:  
First, FF switches its thread priority to Above Normal, while using 90-100% CPU.  Then computer becomes intermittently unresponsive, then freezes.  Uses 0.5 to 1 GB RAM in task mgr.

Expected Results:  
It should have displayed the web page, kept thread priority at "Normal," or contain the problem on a single tab, or as a last resort, crash gracefully, without computer lockup.

Problem started with this new version of FF.
