create email opens a new message and inserts email address

I am using Windows Vista on a computer purchased from Vision Computers in Georgia. 
This problem only happens when using Firefox. If I am using IE the create mail new message opens and the email address that I wish to send to is inserted on the TO: line.

I queried Vision tech support and the technician said the same thing happens on their computers running Firefox but does not occur when using IE.

This is a major problem because sometimes the email link does not spell out the email address but may only show, for instance: "send an email to us" therefore the email address cannot be copied and pasted.
