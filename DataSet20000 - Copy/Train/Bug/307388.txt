A web based e-mail. After logging in and clicking on INBOX on the left, a list
of messages appears on the main page. Clicking 'Other Mail' near top right
corner should produce a small new window (in IE6). Nothing happens in Firefox.
Clicking the other links next to it produce correct responses in Firefox. The
working links have the codes
javascript:MakeActive(document.showfolder.MoveToLink,document.showfolder) and
javascript:MakeActive(document.showfolder.DelMsgLink,document.showfolder) and
the one which doesn't work in Firefox (but alright in IE6) has
javascript:MPopWindow('Inbox');

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log onto www.medscape.com/px/mail. (I'm sorry you will need to have an account!)
2. Click INBOX in left column.
3. Click 'Other Mail' near top right.

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens in Firefox.

Expected Results:  
A (small) new window pops up when I use IE6.

I have disabled 'Block Popup Windows' in Tools/Options/Web Features, and have
tried all 3 options in 'Open links from other applications in:' in
Tools/Options/Advanced.
