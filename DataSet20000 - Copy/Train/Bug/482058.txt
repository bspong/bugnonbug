My computer has a Windows XP Professional tower. Normally it'd work fine. Well today it lagged because of two open programs. I manually turned it off with the button. Then I pulled out the microphone strand and restarted it (I pulled out the microphone because I wanted to test it on my piano). 

When it was booting up, it wanted to go over my hard drives because it said one of them wasn't functioning properly. While I was waiting, I plugged the microphone back in. 

It finished loading, and everything looked normal from the desktop. When I went to Mozilla Firefox, it was normal, or so I thought it was.

First, when I went to multiple sites, it didn't allow me to go back; the back button was disabled. It also seemed to remove a toolbar row I used to have. All my bookmarks were GONE. Also, the history had disappeared, and it shows no record of me going to any site, even the one I'm on right now.

The theme of Firefox and everything else works okay. All my files that aren't on Firefox are still there.

I've tried System Restore, and it still didn't give my things back. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Computer being on for an extensive period of time, and lags greatly on open windows.
2. Turn off computer and back on (depends on if computer scans hard drives)
3. Open new window and found unable to do many things.
Actual Results:  
Found out I can't use Firefox to go back, look at history, or use bookmarks and add bookmarks.

Expected Results:  
I expected everything to be normal with Firefox as it previously was.
