I have a new webpage, with videos, and when in Mozilla browser, the videos won't play (Microsoft Media Player). So, I am informed that I probably don't have the most current plugins for the the media player. So I go to Mozilla support, I look at the instructions for downloading the plug in. I follow all th einstructions, download the plug in, install the plug in. But when I check to see if it is installed, it isn't. And I still can't play the videos. So, I have tried this multiple times, removing the installed plug in each time, and despite the fact that my computer reports that it is installed, and I have gone through the installation procedures, the "test installation" fails, as does trying to view the video in my website. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open mozilla
2.go to my webpage lifeskills4parents.com where videos are supposed to play as soon as sign opens (and they do in Internet Explorer)
3.videos fail to play
Actual Results:  
Go to support page, frequently asked questions, Microsoft Media Player. Click on download plug ins from Firefox or from Port 25. Click download. After downloaded, go to C drive to which I downloaded it, click on exe file. Takes me through the installation process. Go back to support page, frequently asked questions, Microsoft Media Player, click on test installation. Fails - says it isn't installed. Tried it multiple times, never installed; browser won't play videos on the website

Expected Results:  
plug in should be installed; test should indicate that it is installed, and videos on the website should play from the Firefox browser.
