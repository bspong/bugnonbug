FF unresponsive, does not release memory when tabs closed
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20070515 Firefox/2.0.0.4

After using 7-12 tabs and leaving open overnight, Firefox became unresponsive. I could open new tabs but they would indicate "Loading" and never change after that.  I could get drop down menus and make selections but they did not produce any action. In Windows Task manager, FF shows about 115MB memory in use when it became unresponsive. I could right click on tabs to close them but no red X was usable because tab did not display red X when selected. After closing all tabs except one, Taks Manager shows 112MB memory still in use and browser unresponsive as before. I started 2nd instance of FF to compare memory usage but it would not start & did not appear in Task Manager.  IE works normally under same conditions.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Be active in browser, open close numerous tabs, leave 7 tabs open overnight.
2.Attempt to use Firefox one or two days later
3.
Actual Results:  
O experienced the (non)performance described in section "Details" above.

Expected Results:  
It should have behaved like a functional browser; respond to menu choices, open URLS in new tabs, open new blank tabs, launch a second instance or the browser when commanded to do so.

My experience has been described to the best of my ability.
