Dragging the scrollbar or any part of the web page causes entire window to be dragged

If I drag the page's scrollbar, the bar does not scroll but instead the entire window drags, as if I were clicking and dragging on the frame. Likewise, if I click and drag anywhere on a page, e.g. to highlight the words in the bug report, he entire window drags.

It appears to be a focus issue. If I double-click on the bar quickly, and then drag, the scrolling works. If I click once or twice without double-clicking, it does not work but drags the frame.

Similarly with the page dragging, if I just click anywhere on the page a drag, the frame moves, but if I double-click and keep my mouse button down after the second click, the frame does not move.

Also, the dragging of the window is not as smooth as when I click and drag at the top of the frame -- the web page slips up and down slightly as it it dragged, as if it's scrolling a tiny bit and then the window is being dragged down and catching up.

Similarly, if I click and drag very quickly across words, I may succeed in highlighting one or two letters by the time the frame has caught up with me.

This is the first time I have seen this bug, but it is absolutely occurring - even with the inner scroll bar in the form's text window.

If I open a new Firefox window, the issue does NOT occur on that window.

I had several tabs open and it was happening on all those tabs, and now that this bug report is my only tab it is still occurring.

I have no new or weird plugins that might be causing this (just Adblock and similarly common ones).

A similar bug seems to have been reported here for Firefox 1.5. Or rather, the effect is the same, I don't know if it was the same bug.
