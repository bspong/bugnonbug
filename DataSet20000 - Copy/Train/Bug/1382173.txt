DevToolsShim should differentiate between installed and initialized states
With Bug 1359855, devtools can be installed without being initialized/started. The shim relied on devtools-browser.js being loaded in order to "detect" devtools. This needs to change.

Additionally, :ochameau suggested the following strategy in order to detect the DevTools installation without having to rely on the AddonManager. We can check if the devtools resource path has already been registered, which means that devtools files are ready to be loaded (being addon or not does not make a difference here).
