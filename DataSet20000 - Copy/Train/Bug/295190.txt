SSL Client Certificate missing in Firefox / Java-Plugin
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de-DE; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

When establishing a ssl connection via a java applet, I cannot select
my ssl client certificate from the "Client Authentication" list because
the list is empty.

--
java version "1.5.0_03"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_03-b07)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_03-b07, mixed mode, sharing)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Import your ssl client certificate into firefox
2. Run a (signed) applet which uses ssl itself to communicate to a secure webserver
3. The "Client Authentication" popup list appears and asks you to select your
certificate

Actual Results:  
The "Client Authentication" popup list is empty. The Java-Plugin cannot see
which ssl client certificates were imported into Firefox.



Expected Results:  
My ssl client certificate appears in the list, I select it, click on "OK" and
the applet can open the connection.
Works fine for Java JRE/Plugin 1.4.2_08, but not 1.5.0_03.
