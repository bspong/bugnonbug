Improving firefox's tabbed browsing architecture (not just UI improvements)

This bug gives some suggestions to how firefox could improve its underlying
architecture in tabbed browsing for Firefox 1.1.

First of all, I think firefox should implement two modes on the UI level, tabbed
browsing mode and traditional browsing mode (aka. new window mode). User just
select their preferred mode and the appropriate settings will be selected. This
simplies the tabbed browsing preferences in "Options.../Advanced" and make it
easier for novice users.

On the underlying level, we should implement the following preferences
Browser.open.opennewfor.bookmarks (this option allies to the bookmarks sidebar,
the bookmarks toolbar and the bookmarks menu)
Browser.open.opennewfor.history (this option applies to the history sidebar and
the go menu)
Browser.open.opennewfor.DDEcall (this option should also apply to the firefox
help system and the extensions manager)
Browser.open.opennewfor.externallink
Browser.open.opennewfor.home
Browser.open.opennewfor.javascriptcall (if false is selected, popups will be
opened in the current tab)
Browser.open.opennewfor.middleclick (shift+click and ctrl+click should dod the
same thing under this: either they open a new winodw or a new tab)

Browser.open.opennewtab
Browser.open.openinforeground (this option also applies to new window mode. It
specifies whether or not the newly opened window will receive focus)

I am sure this bug duplicates the ideas of other bugs and some of the ideas had
already been implemented. It would be nice if these bugs are cosolidated into
one meta bug to be resolved.

I believe the proposed changes will make fx's architecture less confusing and
will solve the tab browsing problems once and for all.
