In the table shown, there are different number of cells per row.  The cells do not span columns so the rows below the top row have fewer cells (columns), ie  each row has one fewer column than the row above itself.
Dangling vertical lines extend below table cell (column) borders.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Dangling vertical lines extend below table cell borders.

Expected Results:  
No dangling vertical lines, I expect the table to look like it does in IE8 where the same bug is absent.

Also, try scrolling up and down to hide the dangling lines and then reshow them.  They will change length and maybe even become little stubs.
