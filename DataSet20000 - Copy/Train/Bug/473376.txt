I listen to WDRM radio via streaming audio while at work. This has worked fine in version 2 of Firefox; does not play, no audio, using version 3.0.5. I tested at home a few weeks back using ver 3.0.1 and found that Clear Channel (WDRM) radio stations did not work but other stations did. Tested with ver 3.0.4 recently and no station's streaming audio would produce an output. Is this a compatiblity issue in Firefox ver 3 or was there something else to do on upgrading to ver 3?

I am not a Microsoft expert; do not know what utility is playing audio. Have WMP ver 11; RealPlayer Enterprise 6.0.11; QT 7.5.5. At home have RealPlayer not the enterprise version
