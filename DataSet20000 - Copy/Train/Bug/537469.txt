What happened to SHOW IMAGE??

You had one good tool that I tripped over. When attachments load as a page of images - and I do this often - they never finish loading before the browser times out, so I end up with a bunch of little square boxes and the image file name on the page. Till now I could always right click on the icon and say SHOW IMAGE and it would immediately go out and load that image refreshing the page. A pain considering it should have loaded in the first place, but a godsend since it didn't. The NEW Firefox that I was forced to upgrade to changed all that. Now you right click and the menus shows a "RELOAD IMAGE" listing which DOES NOTHING AT ALL. Just sits there and lets you click it. 

Oh and an aside, I STILL get that nuisance window when I use the back button on any compiled page. It's been three years now and that still isn't fixed. Lets hope you can figure this one out.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.download multiple image attachments in GMAIL to a page
2.firefox quits downloading them before they all arrive
3.your new menu listing RELOAD IMAGE doesn't work at all
Actual Results:  
I just told you. Read the description.

Expected Results:  
See Above.

This is nothing special. Just a simple feature that worked on Firefox and someone screwed up in your last revision. Since this was the workaround, there is no workaround now. For that reason it's a major feature problem.
