downloading images of documents causes Firefox to have a problem reported by Windows
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404 Firefox/2.0.0.14

If one goes into the BMD records at Ancestry (for example, the same happens with other records) and request an image of a document th system loads the image then windows reports 'Firefox.exe has encountered a problem...' The summary information is: AppName: Firefox.exe; AppVer: 1.8.20080.40413; ModName: ntdll.dll; ModVer 5.1.2600.2180; Offset: 000111de. I could find no way to capture the more detailed information other than send it to Microsoft! Reloading Firefox allowing it to open the existing pages always works.
This problem is intermittent and I have found no common thread. One can look at many images with no failures, and then (reloading Firefox as above) get several fails in quick succession or another run of successful images. I have not noted anything about the images that might cause it or noted if the same image always causes it to happen.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.log into Ancestry
2.go to BMD section and call up some indices
3.repeatedly download images of documents until failure occurs - can be quick or very slow!

Expected Results:  
properly displayed pages with no Windows error screen!

This is not a new bug. I have noted it for some time (probably a few years!) but not got round to reporting it.
