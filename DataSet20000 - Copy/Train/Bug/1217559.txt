Can't reload the toolbox on windows 10
This might totally be me doing something wrong because I have never tried this before, but I encountered some weird things when trying to reload the toolbox on Windows and thought I'd file a bug.

Please let me know if some of these things are problems on my side, or if we want to have separate bugs for each:

- `tools srcdir` only worked with this path for me: "C:/Users/Patrick/dev/fx-team"
Trying to use this failed: "C:\Users\Patrick\dev\fx-team" although that's the path you'd actually see in a windows command prompt.
It fails with:

C:\Users\Patrick\devx-team does not exist or is not a mozilla-central checkout.

- Once I execute `tools srcdir "C:/Users/Patrick/dev/fx-team"`, the toolbox closes and doesn't re-opens. I would expect the toolbox to just stay there until I enter `tools reload`.

- `tools reload` didn't seem to work. I made a simple change in markup-view.xhtml (adding some inline style so it would be easy to see if the changed worked), then entered `tools reload`: the toolbox closed and didn't re-open. And when I reopened it manually, my change wasn't there.
Update: I just tried ith markup-view.js and reloading did work for this file (but as I said, it'd be nice if the toolbox would re-open on its own).

- I then tried the keyboard shortcut, it's supposed to be accel+alt+r, but this didn't do anything for me. I made sure the toolbox had focus before.
