Chromeless windows are not shown when using 3rd party themes

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download and apply a random skin
2. Open Tools -> Error Console
3. Type:
   window.open ('about:mozilla', 'test', 'chrome=yes,width=320,height=240');
   in Code: box and click Evaluate
Actual Results:  
No window is shown, although a new [object ChromeWindow] is returned, and new window is shown in the task bar. Sometimes, a scrollbar is displayed.

Expected Results:  
New window should be open and made visible.

window.open ('about:mozilla', 'test2', 'chrome=no,width=320,height=240');
shows desired behavior.

When using default skin, chromeless windows can be opened and work as expected.

I was using Aquatint Black Gloss theme, but using any other skin yields the same results.

Problem was reported on Firefox 3.0.7 on both Windows 2000 and Windows XP
