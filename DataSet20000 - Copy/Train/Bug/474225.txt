Windows 7: Firefox uses between 150,000 and 200,000 k of memory
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5

Firefox (v3.0.5) regularly uses very large amounts of memory (200,000k) when running in the Windows 7 Beta. 
Note: This problem occurs with other programs so it may not be the fault of Firefox. 
Another Note: I recieved a notice that Sxipper and Stealtehr were incompatible, but I ignored it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Boot into Windows 7 Beta
2. Start Firefox
Actual Results:  
The windows task manager reported that Firefox was using 174,572 k of memory. This number fluxuated and after leaving firefox running for several hours with only the download window open I reported memory use of over 200,000 k. This contributed to my computer running slower.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should use a lot less memory
