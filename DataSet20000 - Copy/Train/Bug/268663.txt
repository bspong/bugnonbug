Autocomplete via setAttribute ignored on forms if focus() has been called

It appears that setting autcomplete to off via js setAttribute, for both forms
as well as an individual text box, doesn't work if the textbox has received focus.

For a simple example, see:

and
  http://www.kennwhite.com/mozilla/autocomplete_works.html

It's a non-issue if one sets autocomplete in the form or input tag itself, but
then, that won't validate as XHTML strict.  FWIW, this same behavior can be
reproduced in doctype-less quirks mode too, as well as when called from an
external js script.  The examples above are inline for clarity.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a valid form, with an input (type=text) name="q", id="q"
2. Set focus on the element: document.getElementById('q').focus();
3. Use setAttribute to disable autocomplete: 
document.getElementById('q').setAttribute('autocomplete', 'off');
4. Enter "asdf" followed by Enter, to go to the Get/Post page
5. Go back (or flush cache, stop/start browser), and type "as" -- autocomplete
will drop down with "asdf"

Reverse 2 and 3, and autocomplete is disabled.


Actual Results:  
someTextBox.focus() reliably disables setting autocomplete off downstream.

Expected Results:  
Maybe this is to prevent an event race condition, but it wouldn't seem like
focus should override autocomplete.

This behavior is particularly problematic for login forms (i.e., username/password).
