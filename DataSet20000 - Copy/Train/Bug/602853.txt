profile on NFS4 makes bookmarks and history system unusable, cannot goto URL's
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2.9) Gecko/20100930 Gentoo Firefox/3.6.9
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2.6) Gecko/20100728 Ubuntu/10.04 (lucid) Firefox/3.6.6

I am getting the error "The bookmarks and history system will not be functional because on of Firefox's files is in use by another application. Some security software can cause this problem." while on an NFS4 mounted home directory. Not only are the bookmarks and history gone but I also cannot go to a URL by hitting the ENTER button or clicking on the green 'go' button. I am getting this on two different versions of firefox on two different Linux distrobutions:
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2.6) Gecko/20100728 Ubuntu/10.04 (lucid) Firefox/3.6.6 and Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2.9) Gecko/20100930 Gentoo Firefox/3.6.9
I've tried deleting the entire .mozilla directory but to no avail.
I really don't know if this is an NFS issue or firefox (although I do remember testing this a while back on the same NFS4 server but on a different version of firefox 3.6.3 maybe? and it worked fine) but no other programs including openffice experience file locking problems. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Put entire .mozilla config directory on an NFS4 mount.
2. Restart firefox
Actual Results:  
Bookmarks and history gone, cannot enter URL's.

Expected Results:  
This should only happen if another program is accessing the offending files, but nothing is.

NFS4 is on a NETAPP appliance so traditional troubleshooting may be a bit more difficult.
