The folders on the prior Firefox toolbar were all deleted when the Vers. 1.0.3 was installed.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.3

I received notice that a Mozilla upgrade was available.  I clicked on the bubble
and nothing happened.  So, I finished what I was doing and closed my Word 2000
program.  I couldn't find any indication that a download was occuring.  All of a
sudden Firefox popped up with a Google Home Page.  When I went to HELP / About
Mozilla Firefox I noticed that Vers. 1.0.3 had been installed.  I changed the
Home Page to the regular Home Page that I use.  That's when I noticed that the
Bookmarks Toolbar Folder wasn't my custom one, but one that contains Getting
Started and Latest Headlines.  All on my very important bookmarks are gone.

Can you tell me if I can find my old bookmarks in a file somewhere?  This
upgrade has turned out to be disasterous.

Thanks,

Mike Dennehey

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start up Firefox and the custom folders in the toolbar are missing.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
The custom folders are missing.

Expected Results:  
The custom folders and all bookmarks should have been transferred from the Vers.
1.0.2 I had previously been running.  They have always been transferred in prior
upgrades.

Please tell me where the custom toolbar folder information is stored so I can
hopefull reclaim my old information.
