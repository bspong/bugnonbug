If a message is sent by a pdf (on pdf object a messageHandler with function "onMessage" is set) to its host container only a part of the message is received. After which amount of characters the message is cut depends on the length of the original message. Special about that is that the message is very large, because it is the whole pdf as a base64 coded string, so the message could consist of more than 10000 characters. With short messages this proplem did not occur.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. add message handler to an embedded pdf (pdfObject.messageHandler = {};)
2. register function (pdfObject.messageHandler.onMessage = myFunction;)
3. define function "myFunction" with array parameter
4. send message from pdf to host container --> myFunction should be called
Actual Results:  
The passed parameter is cut after some characters

Expected Results:  
The message should be the same as the original message which was sent and not only a part of it.
