Hypercosm plugin sometimes fails. Always works in MSIE

Using Max 2009 on Vista x86, SP1, I created and exported a simple scene with a knot, 3 lights and a camera.

Here is the scene on this website.  http://www.windyweather.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Blue_knot_01002/Blue_knot_01002.html

The model does not play in Firefox 3.0.13, or 3.5.x either from the file system or from this website.

It does play in MS IE 8 both from the file system or from the website.

The samples on the hypercosm website play in both MSIE 8 and Firefox 3.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a hypercosm file by exporting simple geometry from 3dsmax.
2. Attempt to display the file using Hypercosm in Firefox. Fails.
3. Samples do work in firefox, so the plugin is ok from Hypercosm. ALso the exported file works in MSIE, so bug is in Firefox somewhere.
Actual Results:  
Plugin did not work under some circumstances in Firefox.

Expected Results:  
Plugin works in firefox, as it does in MSIE.
