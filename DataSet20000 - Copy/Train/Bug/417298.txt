In some circumstances, location bar autocomplete will offer previously visited URLs even though that site has been completely removed from the history via the history window's selective delete functionality.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type URL "bbl.tv" into location bar (will immediately redirect to sportdigital.tv)
2. Go to history window (no "bbl.tv" in history, only "sportdigital.tv")
3. remove sportdigital.tv entry
4. begin typing "bbl" into location bar
Actual Results:  
Location bar autocomplete will offer "bbl.tv" as an option.

Expected Results:  
All URLs related with "bbl.tv" should have been removed, especially as the user has no option but to perform a complete "clear private data" to remove this entry, which takes all of the "cool" out of Places/selective history removal. It is against user expectations and compromises privacy!

Apparently this effect is triggered by entering URLs that do not load html but redirect immediately to somewhere else. Has also been observed with direct links to video files that launch a plugin. A layman's analysis of the places.sqlite "moz_places" table appears to indicate a connection with "hidden" "typed" URLs.
