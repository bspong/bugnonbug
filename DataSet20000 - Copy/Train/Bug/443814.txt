after sound is played via a plug-in, status bar updates become very slow

I created an index page that plays a short sound clip (i.e., a wave file) using the embed element when the page loads. In my case, the xine plug-in is what plays the sound. Whenever I load the page, the plug-in starts normally, and the following text is displayed in the status bar:

xine-plugin: ...playback started

After the sound clip has finished playing, the following text appears:

xine-plugin: ...playback finished

After this occurs, however, the status bar updates become very-sluggish, taking 5 seconds whenever I move my mouse over or out of any link in this or any subsequent page; I then have to restart firefox in order to get it to return to normal behaviour. If the first page I load is without sound, the status bar updates normally; however, as soon as I load my index page, the problem occurs again. 

I haven't tested this using other plug-ins; however, I did test this using Konqueror, which uses the same plug-in, and appears to display the plug-in's status in exactly the same manner as Firefox. Konqueror does not have this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load Web page that has background sound embedded using the embed element.
2.The plug-in that handles the sound file plays it automatically, displaying its status in the status bar.
3.Try moving the mouse over any link; the status bar would take 5 seconds to update. Then try moving the mouse away from the link; again the status bar would take 5 seconds to update.
Actual Results:  
same as above

Expected Results:  
The status bar should have updated immediately after the sound has finished playing, as it does in Konqueror.

I have disabled the ability for JavaScript to change or hide status bar text in both browsers.
