Orientation reverts to "Portrait" when I specify Page Size

I want to print a calendar on legal-size paper in "landscape" mode. I have a printer "usausljp,simplex,legal" which I use to do this. It is not the default printer. So I have to set the orientation to "landscape", then select the printer. But FireFox sets the page size to "letter" by default, so I have to adjust the printer properties, and then FireFox flips the job back to "portrait" mode!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. File -> Page Setup -> Orientation: Landscape
2. File -> Print -> Printer Name: (change from default)
3. File -> Print -> Properties -> Paper Size: Legal

Actual Results:  
Orientation reverts to "Portrait".

Expected Results:  
Page should print in "Landscape" orientation on Legal-size paper.

Note that I don't have this problem using the "opera" browser.

Part of the problem here is that the "Page Setup" is decoupled from the "Print" menu, so I can't just make all the settings in one place and make sure they're all correct before I hit "ok".

Also, the printer I'm using is set to print *only* on legal-size paper in CUPS. I would expect FireFox to have a default paper-size of "legal" for this printer, but it defaults to "letter" and I have to set it manually. I looked at the "prefs.js" file but didn't see any place to set the default paper-sixe for the printer. Is there a place I can set this, since it's apparently not extracted from CUPS?
