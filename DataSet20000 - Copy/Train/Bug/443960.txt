FF3 fails to open when called from within Thunderbird via url link.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052912 Firefox/3.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052912 Firefox/3.0

Upgraded to FF3. When I open a message in Thunderbird (2.0.0.14) and it has a link to an http or https link and I click on it, FF3 does not open at all. This happens with all themes and addons disabled. In FF2.0.0.14 the link opens without a problem. After each attempt to open the link a running process is left behind which needs to be killed.
This is despite the fact that FF3 is set as the default browser in KDE and Gnome. Thunderbird has as its network.protocol-handler.app "xdg-open". If I call a url from the console with /usr/bin/xdg-open while FF3 is the default browser, the url does open in FF3. It just never works from within Thunderbird.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set FF3 as default with or without addons
2.open email in Thunderbird
3.Click on link within an email in Thunderbird
Actual Results:  
Appears to be calling a program as an Icon "bounces" for a while next to the mouse cursor, then nothing. Checking processes reveals a process running for firefox and firefox-bin

Expected Results:  
FF# should open to the url chosen.
