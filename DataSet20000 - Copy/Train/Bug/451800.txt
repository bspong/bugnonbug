SPNego on Mac OS 10.4 Tiger
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1
Build Identifier: Firefox version 2.0 and 3.0 (the lastest). Donwloaded from: http://www.mozilla.com/products/download.html?product=firefox-3.0.1&os=win&lang=en-US

The issue we’re facing is that SSO via SPNego/Kerberos it’s not working in Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger) using FireFox 2.o or 3.0. We’re not facing this issue with FireFox 2.0 or 3.0 on Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard) and Windows XP. SSO works as expected in Safari in both Tiger and Leopard.



We’re using Microsoft’s AD for authentication.

Thanks in advance for any help that you can provide on this issue, 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure FireFox to allow Kerberos authentication by configuring 
network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris and network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris 
2. Connect to an web application that uses Kerberos for authentication in a Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger)

Actual Results:  
Authentication Fails

Expected Results:  
Authentication should succeed

The negotiate settings network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris and network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris  are properly set.  The Kerberos ticket is set to be forwadable in the Mac.
