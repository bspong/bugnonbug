Browser prevents page from loading if another page is still loading from the same site on a different tab/window
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092414 Firefox/3.0.3

If a web page is taking a long time to download, Firefox will not let me view any other pages from that same site until the first page has finished loading.  I am a webmaster, and I frequently process photos on a website--a process that can easily take 10 minutes or more per batch.  While the site processes the photos, the web page loads slowly, notating in text the progress on the photos, to prevent any timeouts from nonresponse from the server.  While this is happening, I cannot load any other page from this same site on a tab or separate window until that page has finished.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Find a site that has a page that takes a few minutes to load (the html portion of the page should take a while to load--not talking about large images, etc).  
2.  While that page is loading, try to visit another page from the same site.
3.  Any link that you click to visit another page will result in a browser hang until the first page has finished.  By the way, another browser (Camino for example) CAN communicate with the site while Firefox refuses, so it's definitely a browser specific issue.
Actual Results:  
All communications with this site are a no-go until that long-loading page finishes loading.  Once that page finishes, any other links you've clicked suddenly come to life and those pages will load properly.

Expected Results:  
Links should just always work.  Period.  Why artificially slow the browsing experience just because a page is loading?
