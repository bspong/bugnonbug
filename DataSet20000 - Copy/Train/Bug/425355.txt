90% CPU utilization while shutting down

I spent a few minutes looking at a site I'm developing and playing with Firebug, then tried to shut down Firefox. It won't shut down. It's at 90% CPU utilization. (At this point, I'm not sure if it was eating CPU before I shut it down, but I think it was.)

I attached WinDbg to the process. Thread 0 seems to be busywaiting in an infinite loop. Every time I let it run, then break into it, I see this callstack:

I've uploaded a 25KB debugger minidump to http://www.georgevreilly.com/temp/firefox3b4-shutdown-1.dmp.

I also have a full memory dump that I can upload tomorrow, if need be, but it's 88MB.
