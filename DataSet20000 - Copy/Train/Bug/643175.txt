Hey,
while testing Minefield, I noticed that I can't use the Restore function of Windows 7, with dragging the window away from the top. This is because there's no space between the tabs and the top (Same with other buttons, i.e. Menu, List Tabs...). So I've to search for space (i.e. several px between the tabs or on the right side of the window), to use the function. I think this could easily be fixed with a space of one px appropriate to the windows edge, because I easily put the cursor on the top. This only refer to the full screen view of Minefield with tabs on top. I see that there are two px of space, but it seems to belong to the tab and if I click on them, I'll drag the tab.

P.S.: Sorry for bad English, I only learned at school.
