[GC] image added via CSS content in userContent.css is not displayed

I have the following in userContent.css

a[target~="_blank"]:after
{
  content: url(new.png);
}

When I load a local file that has <a href="" target="_blank">, the image
"new.png" is placed just after the linked text.  However, the same remote page
does not load the image and throws a security error in the JS console.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Place the above code into userContent.css (and get a suitably named new.png file)
2. load a local HTML file with a link having target="blank"
3. watch the little image show up after the link
4. now load a similar remote HTML file
5. watch the missing icon and notice an extra space where the image would go.




The following error shows up in the JS console.

Security Error: Content at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=151249
may not load or link to
file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/nieder/Application%20Data/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/profilename/chrome/new.png.

The error indicates that the image was not loaded to prevent remote files from
loading local files.  While this makes 100% sense for a remote page doing
something like <img src="file://image.png">, it does not make sense that this
logic gets applied to content generated via userContent.css.

This worked fine until about 2 weeks ago, and then it stopped.  Searching
suggests the fix for Bug 69070 caused this.  This is not a dupe of that bug
because that bug deals with http: documents loading file: images, while this
report is specifically for userContent.css being able to load file: images.
