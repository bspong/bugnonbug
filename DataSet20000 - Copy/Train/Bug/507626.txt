When I open multiple tab then I found that after sometime firefox eats up memory and cpu. AFE, I opened 32 tabs and after that I feel cpu hog and not able to do anything, while my notebook is Thinkpad T61 with windows XP sp-2. I closed the firefox and again restarted it. Now, it works fine. But again after sometime it starts to eat memory as well as CPU.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Opened six FF windows
2. each window has an average 5-6 tabs open. FYI, All these tabs have opened light weight pages. Not much media based.
3.
Actual Results:  
CPU hog. 

Expected Results:  
no need to explain it :-)

I have taken snapshot of CPU+MEMORY uses, but don't find way to upload here. So, you can see the result. If you need then I can send through mail.

Anyway summary of CPU+MEMORY uses:
When problem occurs: CPU: 56% MEMORY: 1,261,309K
After reload with all tabs: CPU: 03% Memory: 413,130K
