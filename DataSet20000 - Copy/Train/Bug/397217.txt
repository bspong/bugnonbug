printing geocache pages sometimes inserts improper page break

Note: I believe this is a rebirth of a bug I entered awhile back (now resolved) 257991

At geocaching.com, some of the cache pages print a first page of mostly empty content.  From the DOM inspector, I see a FORM element (id="Form1") that appears to be forced to the next page, leaving only left-side border content on the first page.  This only happens with some cache pages - presumably based on how large the element is.

Reference these 2 examples:  (unfortunately, you must create a free account and log in to see all the content to cause the problem)

example1: http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=7ef8697f-a6c3-4793-b8da-ea6435419960
example2: http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=aeb8bed2-fb6c-4c1e-8aac-1a6f3506a180

The behavior is inverse between latest released Firefox and latest Minefield.
Firefox exhibits the problem with example2, whereas Minefield exhibits the problem with example1.  (Note, neither page exhibits the problem unless you are logged in).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create free account at geocaching.com
2. log in
3. open problem page (see examples above) [not all pages show the problem, but for that pages that do show the problem, it happens every time]
4. select Print Preview
5. see empty space on first page of preview
Actual Results:  
Too much whitespace in print preview.

Expected Results:  
I expect the print and print preview too look more like the screen.

I don't know of any workaround.
