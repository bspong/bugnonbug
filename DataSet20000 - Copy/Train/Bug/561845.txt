Appears that Acrobat products are having issues with both reading and and streaming files.  On attempt to Full Screen applications, Acrobat Player locks up and will not allow for a a <ESC> press to return to its normal state until the chunk in the buffer has played out completely or the stream has run its full course.  This is especially bad when viewing files on YouTube or other video sites.
Acrobat reader shows black screen when multitasking either in the tabs or off screen and only a mouse movement over the icons will cause the reader to refresh those icons with a tab-stop.  A press of the scroll bar will bring the whole document and tab back into focus and all items on the tab will become visible.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.log in
2.play files / open files
3a.[for video] full screen the stream
3b.[for documents] tab looses focus and window looses focus
4b.<TAB> OR <CLICK> Acrobat related tab
Actual Results:  
the error mentioned above where either the stream is buffered and locks out control or the document interface goes black

Expected Results:  
A stream where the video screen should return to its normal state, embedded into a web page OR a document which can still be viewable

returned the full screen to embedded stream within a page OR presented a document where the interface is not blacked out and unreadable.
