Smart cards (pkcs#11 tokens) and server-side only SSL
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.2) Gecko/20060308 Firefox/1.5.0.2

Starting with 1.5.x, if you have a pkcs#11 HW token defined in Mozilla Firefox and the physical token inserted into the client computer, when you connect to any server-side SSL protected only web sites, such as Amazon, Yahoo, etc, you get prompted for the security password to the cryptoki token, even though there is no client-side certificate SSL authentication occurring in these connections. If you remove the token from the reader slot, then you don't get prompted, and the server-side SSL session is still established (indicating that this is a server-side SSL session, not a mutually authenticated SSL session requiring client-side certificate authentication). This problem did not exist in pre-1.5 Mozilla Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure Firefox to support a PKCS #11/cryptoki smart card device
2. Insert the PKCS #11/cryptoki smart card device into the computer and make sure it is recognized
3. Connect to a server-side SSL protected website such as Amazon, Yahoo, Citibank, etc and you will be prompted to enter the security password to the cryptoki token, even though this is not a mutually authenticated SSL session requiring client-side certificate authentication.
Actual Results:  
you will be prompted to enter the security password to the cryptoki token, even though this is not a mutually authenticated SSL session requiring client-side certificate authentication.

Expected Results:  
Unless this is a mutually authenticated SSL session requiring client-side certificate, then even with the cryptoki token inserted, there should not have been a security password prompt to login to the token.
