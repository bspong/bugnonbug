for (node in nodes) changes the nodes

This alert never gets triggered and there are 3 nodes in nodeArray:

for (node in nodeArray)
{
    if (node == nodeArray[1])
    {alert("match")}
}

It seems like the nodes in the node array are changed by using a for in loop.  I caught this by looking for a type one node in the array.  I know that nodeArray[1] is an instance of a type 1 node.  However, when I look for it like this:

if (node.nodeType == 1) ... it is never found.  If I do an alert for node.nodeType for each iteration of the loop, all of the messages say "undefined".  Before doing this I tested that nodeArray[1].nodeType == 1, so I was expecting the second alert to say "1".






Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Just create an array of dom nodes with 2 or more nodes and try this:

for (node in nodeArray)
{
    if (node == nodeArray[1])
    {alert("match")}
}

The alert will never be triggered.  Also the type of the nodes will not be "undefined", even if they are type 1 nodes.
