Using an Adesso EKB 2100W keyboard Page Down/Up have no effect for scrolling a page, though will open/close the location history when text focus is in the location bar.
Arrow Down will initially jump to bottom of page ("End" key behavior) then stops working (along with Page Up) for scrolling altogether.

Behavior in form elements and other textual input boxes appears normal.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Plug in the noted Adesso keyboard
2.  Load any page that is longer than the browser window can display at once.
3.  Try Page Down and/or Arrow Down to scroll the page.

Actual Results:  
Page Down does nothing, no matter if I try to "force" focus on the page by clicking inside it or not.
Arrow Down usually jumps to the bottom of the page, as the "End" key would, after this it never seems to do so again and both Arrow Up and Down have no effect.

Expected Results:  
Page Down should scroll 1 page-length down, arrow down should scroll down by line. 

Using a standard Apple keyboard works fine in Firefox and the Adesso keyboard works fine in all other applications that I use.
