When running firefix 0.9.0,1,2 with macromedia flash if the info does not appear
when expected or maybe before?; Windows explorer locks up. I can't do a three
key salute and have task manager show up; or sometimes when it does, Ican't get
the application window to open or running tasks to open. I have the latest
"patches" from Microsoft, and Ieven deleted outlook thinking it may be in there.
I have webroot spysweeper, regrun, zone alarm, and adsubtract. The reason for
allthat, I thought it might be my machine was the problem; but it wasn't. I also
have logitech mouse and keyboard with itouch, and donot have desktop messenger.
Some times when I hit the "my home" on the keyboard after I close firefox( i can
close it  when the lock occurs) instead of the caption from logitech being in
green letters, they are white. It's almost as if a pointer is getting framissed.
