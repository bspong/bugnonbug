Hello!

I have a problem with huge amount of input-fields (hidden, text, checkbox) to submit since upgrading to Firefox 3.0. I administrate a onlineshop based on xt-commerce. We use the attributes system excessively so there are about 1300 input-fields in one form. Submitting this form results in a freeze/hang of Firefox 3.0. No tab or anything else can be selected for about 60 seconds when submitting the form. After the form is submitted (after about 60 seconds), everything is fine again.
The same error appears in a self-programmed web-application for our internal use, also with a huge form with about 350 input-fields. Firefox hangs/freezes about 30 seconds here when submitting the data. In Firefox 2 everything works fine and the data is transferred instantly! I tested this behaviour on different machines with different operating systems (WinXP pro, WinXP pro 64Bit, WinVista Business) ... on all OS the same problem!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Take a form with a huge amount of input fields (text, hidden, checkbox).
2. Submit the form

Actual Results:  
Firefox 3.0 freezes/hangs

Expected Results:  
Firefox 3.0 should post the data instantly!
