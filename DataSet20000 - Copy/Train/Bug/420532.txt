Incorrect "XML Parsing Error: mismatched tag."; sensitive to exact number of bytes before supposed error.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080201 Firefox/2.0.0.12

I can't give exact details, because I don't understand them, but for me, when Firefox loads the test-case I'll attach in a moment, it shows this error message:

XML Parsing Error: mismatched tag. Expected: </head>.
Location: file:///C:/Firefox-parser-bug.xml
Line Number 59, Column 4:

 </head>
---^

This bug is very sensitive - for example, adding or removing a single byte from within the <style> element will fix the file. Changing a byte won't fix the file - though sometimes the error will switch to being about </html> instead of </head>. (I haven't detected a pattern in which one it will barf on.)

Incidentally, the test-case is likely Windows-specific, in that a newline appears to be equivalent to two hyphens. (Anyone on a Unix system can probably run dos2unix on the test-case and get the same effect, but who knows?)

By the way, the Error Console also shows two copies of a "missing ; before statement" error during the DOCTYPE declaration, but only on this version of the file; other versions of the file that also trigger the bug do not all cause that error, so I'm not sure it's relevant.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Come visit me at home, and ask to use my computer. (This may or may not affect anyone else's, though I don't think there's anything particularly special about my system.)
2. Load the soon-to-be-attached XML file in Firefox.
Actual Results:  
XML parser error, complaining that it expected one thing and got the same thing.

Expected Results:  
A blank document.
