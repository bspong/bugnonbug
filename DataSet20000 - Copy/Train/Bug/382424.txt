Firefox is extremely slow while loading large text files

I was viewing 44mb log file in text format with 436,771 lines some lines with width of 300 chars. This file is pushed by IIS Server. Firefox was very slow while viewing the page. Firefox crashes while searching for a string in that page. 

Once the file is downloaded completely, it was quite fast. But when I open multiple firefox window/tabs, some times other tabs/windows looks good. But often crashes because of the tab with a page of 400,000 lines. 

I tried with the latest nightly build, it looks little fast. But it crashes like 2.0.0.3r. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open text file with more than 440,000 lines 
2. Search for string in the page, scroll up & down. 
3. Open multiple tabs(2 or 3)  

Actual Results:  
Firefox turns extremely slow. 
Crashes often. 
Task manager shows firefox.exe hitting with 500,000 & peak memory usage of 600,000kb in 512mb ram system

Expected Results:  
Should have optimal performance while viewing large pages. It should cache large files & make user view experience smooth.
