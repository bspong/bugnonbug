Location bar does not auto-complete URL from keyword
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:6.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.1
Build ID: 20110830092941

Steps to reproduce:

Type a keyword into the location bar such as "mozilla", "microsoft", etc. then hit Enter.


Actual results:

The 'Awesome Bar' pops down with suggestions as you are typing, then when you hit Enter, a search page (Google for me) shows likely links.


Expected results:

Upon hitting Enter, the 'Browse by Name' search feature should have automatically taken me to the corresponding web page (i.e. "www.microsoft.com", "www.mozilla.org").

This is related to the following previously reported bugs:

This issue began for me with a previous update to Firefox - probably version 5.  I did not have this issue with versions of Firefox before the affecting update.  I finally found the fix at this link:

At some point during one of my updates, my 'keyword.URL' configuration field for the Browse by Name feature was made blank.  After putting the Google browse by name service link into this field for my configuration, the Browse by Name feature works again.

It appears that during a previous update, my configuration file was adversely altered or corrupted.  I'm not a programmer, so it took me quite a while to figure out how to fix this.  If I might make a suggestion - if you guys would like to allow people to choose their 'Browse by Name' search provider, make the option available in the Options menu or as a customization of the "Awesome Bar".
