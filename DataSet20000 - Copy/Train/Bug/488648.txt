Sometimes upload file picker that is activated automatically when you click on any "file" form element or its browse buttons slows down entire browser greatly. It seems to happen after long period of work or with many open windows. When file picker is opened, it either responds to mouse and keyboard actions very slowly or doesn't respond at all. Since dialog is modal, entire session with all open tabs is affected as well, often leaving you to either blindly pasting file name from clipboard and hitting "enter" and then waiting for a minute for those actions to be recognized or forcing you to terminate Firefox completely.

Restart often solves the problem for some time, but it seems I've recently managed to capture a session state with "Session Manager" add-on that make this incorrect behavior to happen every time.

Other file pickers, such as one called with "Save as..." command seems to be unaffected.

Same problem is also described by another user on support forum: http://support.mozilla.com/tiki-view_forum_thread.php?forumId=1&comments_parentId=290809
