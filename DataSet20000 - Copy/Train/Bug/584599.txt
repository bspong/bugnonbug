since upgrading to 3.6.8, have been unable to make full use of google maps.

since upgrading to ff3.6.8 when i enter an address for maps.google.com, once the map comes up, i am unable to move the map with the mouse or use the magnification/demagification function on the maps.  i get the google "slow uploading" and "troubleshooting" notes. i checked all google's troubleshooting and even changed one of the config components to 0 as they suggest...but it didnt make a difference. i am, however, able to use these same functions in
maps.yahoo.com. thank you so much for evaluating this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to maps.google.com
2. enter any address
3. map loads slowly.
4. unable to use the +- [magnification, demagnification] functions or move the map around.
Actual Results:  
NOTHING. can not utilities/function on google map. it just sits there.

Expected Results:  
expected to be able to magnify or demagnify the map, move it around.

the only work around is to use other map sites on the web. it maybe there is some incompatibility for ff3.6.8 with maps.google.com
