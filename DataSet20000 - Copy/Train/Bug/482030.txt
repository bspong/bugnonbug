Firefox provides no way to define a virtual folder for bookmarking.
A virtual folder should work like this:
1) if an entry is added to this virtual folder, then this entry should be in fact added to the referenced real folder (the virtual folder is defined as a reference that real folder).
2) during navigation (into the bookmark panel), if I click on a virtual folder, then I may be moved to the referenced real folder. Or, the virtual folder may just displayed as a mirror of the real folder (any virtual folder action should happen on the real folder content).  

Reproducible: Always




Folders into bookmarks may contain related content, and for different reasons, it could be interesting to create links between such folders. For example, let's imagine I define 2 folders named "Java Performance" and "Architecture Design". While Java performance could be impacted by architecture design, I don't want to duplicate my "Architecture Design" folder into the "Java Performance" folder. So, I would like to be able to create a (folder) link into the "Java Performance" folder in order to (1) enable me a better navigation (as those related folders could be away from each other) and (2) set a logical link between these folders to help me remember their contents are related (and if one forget to remember why these folders are connected, the description field attached to a folder(-link) could help to detail why the link has been defined).
