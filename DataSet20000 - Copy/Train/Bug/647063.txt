value of keyword.URL in about:config resets on each restart of Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

I would like to have keyword.URL always set to http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sourceid=navclient&gfns=1&q= , as described on the following support page: https://support.mozilla.com/nl/questions/801004 , so I can search from the location bar in the manner that I'm used to from the previous version of Firefox. Unfortunately, each time that I restart Firefox, its value resets to: chrome://browser-region/locale/region.properties  This does not result in a location bar that automatically searches for whatever I type into it, which displeases me.

I would like to know how I can permanently modify keyword.URL.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type "about:config" in the location bar.
2. Search for "keyword".
3. Right-click "keyword.URL".
4. Left-click "Modify".
5. Enter the string value: "http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sourceid=navclient&gfns=1&q=".
6. Left-click "Ok".
7. Restart Firefox.
Actual Results:  
The value of keyword.URL is now "chrome://browser-region/locale/region.properties"

Expected Results:  
The value of keyword.URL should be "http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sourceid=navclient&gfns=1&q="
