Links are hidden behind Shockwave Flash

There is a few Shockwave Flash objects in http://soccernet.espn.go.com/?cc=4716. You will see a few links under "ESPNsoccernet Headlines". Despite visible, the first 4-5 topmost links are not clickable because they're transparently hidden by the SWF object on top of them. The problem usually happens the first time I browse to the site. After a few browser refresh, it disappears.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a new instance of Firefox and go to http://soccernet.espn.go.com/, and you will be redirected to http://soccernet.espn.go.com/?cc=4716
2. Search for the word "ESPNsoccernet Headlines".
3. Try clicking on the first 4-5 topmost links under "ESPNsoccernet Headlines"
4. Most of the time, you will end up hitting the SWF object instead.
5. Try hover your mouse on the next few links and you will see some HTTP links.
6. Refresh Firefox a few times (it never took me more than 4 times) and you will be able to click on the topmost links under "ESPNsoccernet Headlines"
Actual Results:  
I am not able to click the first few links under "ESPNsoccernet Headlines"

Expected Results:  
I should be able to click on the links. This is proven with the fact that I could click on the links after a few browser refreshes. I am unsure if this is a bug with Shockwave Flash or Firefox itself.

Instead of click on the links, you can also hover your mouse and see if they turn into HTTP links. If they don't, the problem is reproduced. If they do, the problem is not being reproduced successfully. You may want to try clearing the cache, close Firefox, and try it again.
