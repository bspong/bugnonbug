I have been unable to find a way to start or stop this behavior. I also am not sure I have the correct Firefox vocabulary, so I must be more verbose than I'd like.

The rightmost widget of the tab bar is a downward-pointing arrow. Clicking this should show all tabs.

When I click the button, a window without titlebar or grab area appears. This window has a search bar in the middle. Below it in a grid are thumbnails of my tabs. I will call this the Tab Preview window.

Normally, the Tab Preview window has its top anchored to the bottom of the tab bar, its width matches the width of the tab bar, and its height fills most of the browser window below. When the browser window is not very tall, the tab window has height greater than the window size, in order to display all the tabs.

Sometimes - and I have not been able to determine what triggers this - the Tab Preview window appears in the wrong place with the wrong size. It appears anchored in the top-left corner of the Firefox browser window. Its size matches the size of the toolbar and tab bar region. This is basically the opposite of where it should appear! It is completely unusable in this state. 

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
* Click the Show Tab Preview button (or whatever it's called).
* The Tab Preview window might or might not appear in the right place.
Actual Results:  
The Tab Preview window appeared sized to the toolbar.

Expected Results:  
The Tab Preview window appears over and sized roughly to the displayed tab.

I also can't figure out what makes it stop doing this. Sometimes, showing the Panorama and going back makes it stop, but sometimes it doesn't. It is very frustrating. I will attach a screenshot of the misbehavior.
