Horrible frame drops with Netflix fullscreen
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_8_5) AppleWebKit/537.77.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/6.1.5 Safari/537.77.4

Steps to reproduce:

Watching any video on Netflix in fullscreen creates unbearable lag, within 2-3 seconds of switching to full screen, frames are dropped like crazy, everything becomes choppy and even the mouse becomes unresponsive for a few seconds. When fullscreen mode is exited it returns to normal. Under both Safari and Chrome, Netflix is buttery smooth in HD, so there's something going on with Firefox. Also--while the lag is happening, if you hit cmd-shift-4 and then space (entire area becomes highlighted to take screenshot) the lag disappears, unwatchable because of screenshot overlay, but it's something.

So I went back and started trying older versions of Firefox, the last version where netflix works for me in fullscreen mode with firefox is 3.6.28. 

Not seeing anything useful in logs, did see these 2 entries at the same time of a lagspike, but doesn't seem serious

I can reproduce this 100% of the time
