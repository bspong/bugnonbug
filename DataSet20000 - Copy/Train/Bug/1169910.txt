Build ID: 20150415140819

Steps to reproduce:

In iMacros for Firefox (I'm using the latest v. 8.9.2) I have a macro which logs into my broadband router, changes some settings and then logs out.  It worked fine before I upgraded FF to 38.0.1 but in 38.0.1 the macro doesn't work any more.




Actual results:

The macro hangs when trying to fill in the user and password in the 'Authentication Required' popup window.  Attached file shows the window.  The macro is below:

TAB T=1
SET !ENCRYPTION NO
ONLOGIN USER=****** PASSWORD=****** (I masked these for this report)
URL GOTO=http://192.168.0.1/sky_firewall_rules.html
...
TAG POS=1 TYPE=A ATTR=TXT:Logout 

The login works fine manually using FF - it's just the macro that hangs.  

I tried to re-record the macro, in case the issue was that the router was asking for different login information, e.g. due to an upgrade of its firmware, but then iMacros failed even to record the login actions (user name and password) at all, something it could definitely do before.

I downgraded FF to 37.0.2 and the macro works and it can also record the login actions properly again, so I think the issue is with FF 38.0.1, not iMacros for Firefox.


Expected results:

1. The existing macro should have been able to fill in the details in the 'Authentication Required' popup window.
2. iMacros should be able to record the login actions (user name and password) on this kind of popup window.
