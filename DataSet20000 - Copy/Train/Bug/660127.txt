Doesn't remember username for Hotmail login even though box checked. No longer displays Zynga game bar (Facebook games) even though game bar is installed. Unable to play "Petville" - displays script problem message. All problems started after downloading latest version.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click bookmark from Mozilla start-up page (2 - Hotmail, 3 - Facebook)
2. Hotmail username not shown even though remember box is checked
3. Click Petville tab on Facebook home page

Actual Results:  
#2. Must manually enter username every time I log into Hotmail
#3. Page starts to load and then script message appears and Mozilla generates a not responding message and I must end program to exit. 

Expected Results:  
#2. User name should appear in appropriate box
#3. Installed Zynga game bar should appear, showing games status, and Petville should load enabling play.

This situation began when I installed the latest version. I am not sure how to determine which version I am currently running.
