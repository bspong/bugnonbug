I think In the Private Data section,after uncheck "Ask me before clearing
private data",the "Clear Now" button should be disabled either.
In firefox preferences dialog,select Security tab,in the Passwords
section,please notice if we don't check "user a master password",the "Change
Master Password" button is disabled,this is correct.
Maybe the "Clear Now" button behaviour should like the the "Change Master
Password" button.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch firefox
2.Go to Edit->Preferences
3.In the Preferences dialog,go to Privacy tab
4.In the Private Data section,uncheck"Ask me before clearing private data",then
close the dialog
5.Click Tools->Clear Private Data

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens,no dialog pops up

Expected Results:  
The menu "Clear Private Data" should gray out
