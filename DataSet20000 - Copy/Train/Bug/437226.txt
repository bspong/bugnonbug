WebSENSE requires authentication through the web browser for Mac users since the users don't authenticate through Active Directory.  Firefox intermittently prompts the user for credentials but it seems to prompt every 3-8 times the browser is opened.  This is not a forms login prompt it is the actual Firefox login box that needs to appear.  This authentication needs to happen every time Firefox opens. Unless this prompt appears user will only see "Connection was reset" page.

The prompt for authentication appears 100% of the time in Safari

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn on manual authentication in WebSENSE
2. Launch Firefox
3. "Connection was Reset" page will appear
4. Close and reopen the application until the authentication prompt appears
5. Authenticate and browse the web
Actual Results:  
No authenticaion prompt

Expected Results:  
Authentication prompt would appear and user could authenticate

From WebSENSE KB about process to authenticate users.

# The browser creates an HTTP session and Websense software receives the request.

# Websense software sends an HTTP 401 request for authentication to the browser at the client machine.

# The user receives an authentication prompt. The prompt is browser-specific and is not generated by Websense.  <--// This is the prompt that is only appearing intermittently. 

# The user enters his or her network user name and password.

# Websense software receives confirmation from the directory server and adds the user name and IP address to a table.

# The browser caches the user's credentials, and then creates an Internet session.
