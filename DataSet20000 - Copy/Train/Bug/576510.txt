When a nsplugin is used that shows a top level window, then the browser will crash on exit even if the page is no longer shown.

This was reproduced using a modified example from the QtBrowserPlugin (which is also referred to the in the URL (this URL also utilizes this plugin when its used).  However since this does not crash with Opera using the exact same plugin then the bug appears to be with Firefox.

This is also a Windows specific issue as it does not crash on Linux.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to the page that utilizes the plugin
2. Click on the button that shows the top level window
3. Close Firefox
Actual Results:  
The browser crashed

Expected Results:  
The browser should have exited cleanly

I can provide the plugin in binary form and also in source code form if necessary if it helps to to solve this problem.  Just contact me for it.
