Hey All,

I've got some JavaScript code that has stopped working with FireFox in version 2.0  Still works fine in 1.5.0.x line.  I'm not sure where to turn to about this as its just a baffling issue.

I'm using the prototype library and the first attempt the script makes at using the Object.extend() function it gives me the error "Object.extend is not a function  pklib.js Line 554"

While I would ordinarily think it was a problem with my code, if you do a page refresh it works just fine.

Anybody have any idea what could be going on?  Its like its ignoring some of the JavaScript while starting up.

To see the issue, go to http://www.epitunes.com/Music and click on any of the Play buttons.

The music player code also works everywhere else on the website where it is embedded into the page (not standalone).

Thanks for any ideas you might have! 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to http://www.epitunes.com/Music
2.  Click on Play button (Launching popup music player)
3.  Note javascript Errors
4.  Refresh page and note there are no errors

Actual Results:  
Unusual errors (Object.extend is not a function)

Expected Results:  
No errors on first popup

Again this code was works fine with FF 1.5.0.x, not with 2.0.

A few people on mozilla.dev.apps.firefox have noted that these bug numbers may be involved:  343417, 355161

This sounds like it could be caused by bug 355161, a regression in
Firefox 2 that is scheduled to be fixed in Firefox 2.0.0.1.

Hmm, it looks like it is a regression in Mozilla then.
I'm getting a regression range between 2006-07-07 and 2006-07-08 on trunk:
http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsquery.cgi?treeid=default&module=all&branch=HEAD&branchtype=match&dir=&file=&filetype=match&who=&whotype=match&sortby=Date&hours=2&date=explicit&mindate=2006-07-07+05&maxdate=2006-07-08+07&cvsroot=%2Fcvsroot
and I'm getting a regression range between 2006-07-25 and 2006-07-26 on branch.
So that makes it likely a regression from
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=343417 somehow.
A simplified testcase of the problem in question would be very helpful here.
Also, I think you should file a bug about this.
