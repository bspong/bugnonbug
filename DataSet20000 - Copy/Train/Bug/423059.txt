A cool Mac OS X feature allows one to hide the navigation bar in Firefox. It's a systemwide feature, but Firefox has one issue with it. The Proto theme forces Firefox to show no dark line between the titlebar and the content. Go to a site and use the top-right button. There is no dark line to separate the titlebar from the content.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any website.
2. Use the top-right button (Mac OS X).
Actual Results:  
There was no boundary between the titlebar and the browser content.

Expected Results:  
There should have been a line between the titlebar and the content, like most Apple applications.

This may be an issue related to how Proto implements a Unified theme: by not separating the titlebar and navigation bar. iSafari Leopard was not Unified (for Firefox 2.0.0.x only), but probably worked with this feature because it had a line. Could this be a limitation in the UI department?
