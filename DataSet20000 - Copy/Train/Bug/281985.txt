When i first open in the morning i have no problems but when i disconnect from
the internet and then hours later i reconnect it comes up with this document has
no data but if i shut down my computer and then reboot it it will work again but
i don't want to have to shut down my computer everytime i want to use my
computer when i am not online.

And this has started a few weeks ago and i tryed to re-install firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I boot up my computer in the morning and check emails and talk to people .
2.Then i disconnect from the internect and go offline and let the computer sit
for several hours.
3. And when i re-connect that is when i get the notice that this documment has
not data but if i shut my computer down and re-boot it, it will work again.
4. and it will happen again when i shut the window to firefox and if i reconnect
to firefox it has the pop up again and i have to shut down my computer.

Actual Results:  
Just as i described above.

Expected Results:  
I should not have to shut down my computer everytime i want to reconnect to the
internet after letting my computer sit idle offline it should just connect back
to firefox so i can go to where i want to go when it happens i can not go anywhere.
