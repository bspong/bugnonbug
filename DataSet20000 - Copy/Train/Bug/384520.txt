tabs, other features don't work right (some features are third-party)

I installed FF 2.0.04, but neither FF nor IE would open (possible firewall conflict, since resolved) and my theme (blue cats) not compatible, so I used System Restore. Discovered I've got 2.0.0.4 anyway, which is good. Still got blue cats theme, which is good. Yahoo toolbar still works, but address bar often shows previous page's address, not current one. All my search engine links disappered from Yahoo or Google toolbar (not sure which had them).
The tabs are not good, though. When I hop from a page, blank tabs open, but nothing is displayed. Can't close 'em, even though dialog pops up and button presses. New pages open, but not tabs. Pages aren't represented in XP's taskbar on bottom of screen, but sometimes they are in ALT+TAB.
Sometimes destination tab never opens. Not often.
If I close an open page, sometimes ALL pages close, as if closing down FF instead of just a tab.
ALSO: Yahoo bookmarks drop-down list from toolbar is incomplete. Doesn't scroll like it used to, so bottom part of bookmark list doesn't display. Goes only as far as the R's. Is this Yahoo's bug or yours?
OH, and Bookmark Manager won't Import or Export. Dialog box for file picker never opens.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just click on any hyperlink in web page or email when any page is already is already open. Works as pre-tab brower days, except blank tabs also open, but can't be closed.
2. Try to Import or Export bookmarks. Picker doesn't open (ignores command to open).
3.


Expected Results:  
Want my tabs back!

What should the software have done instead? Acted like a tabbed browser. 

BTW, I went to the Reported Bugs list; I found similar problems, but nothing exactly like it. Plus, I couldn't figure out how to add to a report, rather than making a new one like this. I'm an intelligent person, but I can never figure out how to use Forums. I like to correspond directly to the company, like this. I hate forums, especially when companies use third-party forums, instead of soliciting comments directly. It's a cop-out
