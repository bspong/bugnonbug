Double tabs opening, left click not working properly

Before I start, this is not a problem with my mouse and it is driving me crazy. 
I have a number of problems which all began a few days ago:

*When opening a link in a new tab, two tabs will open for the same link.
*When single clicking a tab, it will close. 
*When left clicking on buttons or in a text-box I will have to click a number of times before it works because strangely the navigation arrows appears and then suddenly it will be okay for one click, this also applies to clicking desktop items and buttons in the toolbar such as bookmarks, tools etc.
*Previously I had a problem where single clicking anywhere on the page would enable cursor navigation (caret browsing?) yet when clicking f7 it would ask me if I would like to switch caret browsing on.
These things are pretty much making my internet unusable/unbearable!
The problem's don't appear until about 10mins of browsing. I have tried other browsers and the problem persists but as I had FF when it began I figured it should be reported here.

Any help appreciated!
