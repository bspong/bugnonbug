I have created links and folders on my Bookmarks Toolbar. These folders contain subfolders with links and folders.  I can drag a Bookmark within a folder to another position in the list of Bookmarks and folders. For example, 
Bookmarks Toolbar has the following items:

NYT (link)   Lookup (folder)     WP (link)    Steps (link)   Home (folder)

The Lookup folder contains the following items in the orger shown below:
Myweb.com           (Link)
Yourweb.com         (Link)
Street              (Folder)
USA.com             (Link)
Canada              (Folder)
MeetMe.com          (Link)

I can drag the Link Meetme.com to any position on the pull down bookmark list.

I cannot drag the Folder Street to a different position on the pull down bookmark list.

I can drag elements(folders or links) within folders on the Bookmarks Toolbar using that other browser.  

I think Firefox is the best browser that I have ever used.

Thanks for a the efforts of of the volunteers who have vreated this very fine product.
