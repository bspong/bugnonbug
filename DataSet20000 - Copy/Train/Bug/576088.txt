Use any forms with Firefox and try to print non-english text using the Windows method of non-US characters entry, for example Alt-1-4-8 for "ae" or a-umlaut. Fireforx discards the window, the entire work vanishes and cannot be recovered. 

I have just typed in an essay, approx 300 lines of text, and than it happened yet again: paradoxically while typing the word "possible", what is "moeglich" in German. Poof... all is gone. All my work has vanished because Firefox sill processes alt-4 in some nefarious way! Please please please, its a simple fix, please DO IT AT LAST: Do not execute any action on any Alt-digit! Its the very standard way to enter special characters. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enter any form in Firefox for free text input
2.Type any amount of text
3.Press Alt and while holding it down press 4
Actual Results:  
The form is discarded, text lost

Expected Results:  
Special character shall be appended to the form. For example, Alt-0-1-6-9 copyright character. Alt-1-4-8 small "ae", a-umlaut etc. etc.
