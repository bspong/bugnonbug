browser-chrome: browser_600545.js (and _601955.js) intermittently times out
The browser chrome test browser_600545.js intermittently times out and then causes a few other errors afterward saying "found a tab after previous test timed out"

Zpao was saying that it might be a listener being removed too late when a tab is closing. The test was found to be flaky in running solo mode as well on bug 600545.

also there are some odd warnings scattered about the logs: "NetworkPrioritizer.jsm, line 117: reference to undefined property aBrowser.webNavigation" too, which may not be related.  Filing a separate bug on that too.

                aBrowser.webNavigation"
