Possible memory leak/exhaustion bug in FF 1.0.3.

I've been using the HTML Manglizer from
http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/soft/mangleme.tgz to test my 1.0.3 FireFox
installation on Windows XP SP2.  I came across a page which seems to result in a
memory exhaustion bug.  I don't have details on the source of the problem.  The
page is designed to repeatedly reload itself.  According to the Windows task
manager, every time the page refreshes, FireFox memory usage goes up, and never
seems to drop.  I uploaded the page to http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~laplam/exhaust.htm
so you can view it live.  I've also attached the source code for the page, so
hopefully someone with greater knowledge can locate the source of the problem.

I'm going to mark this bug as critical because it seems that it could very well
cause a hang or crash on systems with limited resources.  Feel free to correct
me if I'm wrong.  I'm not aware of any security implications of this, but who
knows what may be found...
