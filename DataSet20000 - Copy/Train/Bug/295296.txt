If you go to http://www.popuptest.com/ you can test out all kinds of different
popup techniques, mainly to test your popup blocker's capabilities. Now, some
issues I've noticed are the dropdown popups (
http://www.popuptest.com/popuptest8.html ) still appear, as well as the
sticky-note style of popups that stay in their location even when you scroll
down ( http://www.popuptest.com/popuptest6.html ). 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clicked one of the links on www.popuptest.com to test Firefox's built-in
popup blocker.
2. Had nearly perfect results accept for the dropdown banners and sticky-note
style popups.
Actual Results:  
The popup blocker fails to block these forms of popups. 

Expected Results:  
The built-in popup blocker should be able to catch these styles of popups and
effective prevent them from appearing.

I normally use the Silver Skin theme, but have tested this bug with the default
theme as well. I am using a laptop running Windows XP Professional with 851MHz
Intel Pentium III processor, 512MB of RAM, 18.6GB hard drive.
