What looks like two separate problems seem to be linked in that one shows up iff the other does. Problem is with Firefox 3.0 and 3.0.1 not version 2. Installing latest versions of Quicktime has not fixed it. Problem does not show up with Firefox 3.0.1 / Quicktime 6.5. Problem occurs on two different machines, different hardware and configurations, different add ons. Can send you copy of code that produces quicktime bug, but any embedded quicktime movie shows up the probelem.
