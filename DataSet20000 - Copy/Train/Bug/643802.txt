With QuickTime Pro installed, can't download track by clicking downward-pointing triangle
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

The URL is for an MP3. Ordinarily, with QuickTime Pro installed, I can click on the downward-pointing triangle on the right end of the QuickTime scrubber bar and download the content to my local hard drive. This triangle is not responsive.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to cited URL.
2. Wait for track to fully load.
3. Try to click on downward-pointing triangle for downloading the track.
Actual Results:  
The downward-pointing triangle is unresponsive. In the last version of Firefox 3 it wasn't.

Expected Results:  
When clicking on the downward-pointing triangle a contextual menu is supposed to appear. On that menu I have the option to "save source to" or something very similar in wording. When selected, this option presents me with a file dialog allowing me to pick a download location on my local file system and a file name.
