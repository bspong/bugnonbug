I use Comcast web mail to access my mail.  I often save my email by going to print, which opens an new window.   I cancel the print, and then do a 'Save As'.

If I do this multiple times in a session (somewhere over 40 emails saved), Mozilla tells me that it cannot open the separate window.  I cannot tell Mozilla at this point to allow a pop-up to this window, since it has told me it is allowed to open windows.

If I log off and log back in, everything works properly, until you try to save another 40 or so emails

It looks like an overflow of a parameter.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Comcast web mail
2.Go to print an email, cancel the print and do a 'save as' to save the email
3.Do this multiple times until the failure happens (over 40 times).
4. Log off and log back in; the problem goes away until the next 40 or so emails are attempted to be saved.
Actual Results:  
The errors still occurs

Expected Results:  
I should be allowed to save as many emails as I want, without having to log off.
