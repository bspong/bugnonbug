McAffee Reports "Exploit-IFrame.gen.c" Vulnerability Upon Visiting Certain Websites
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

After doing a Google search I followed a link to the above website, at which point McAffee popped up with a real-time detection of "Exploit-IFrame.gen.c" in Firefox's cache (removed successfully).  Firefox then proceeded to close, a MsgBox (similar to the Windows Messenger vulnerability a long time ago) pops up about "your computer may be infected with a virus" or whatever [fake] and when I pushed cancel, it directed me to another spyware-related website (antiviruspowerfulscan.com, with a referrer id).  When I closed that window, everything seems to be back to normal, but I attribute this more to McAffee than anything else.

I will produce additional information upon request.  Please excuse my reluctance to attempt to reproduce this as last time McAffee encountered an infection, I had to speak with University ITS on the phone about my virus scanning habits...
