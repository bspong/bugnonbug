Steps to reproduce:

Using nsINavBookmarkService I did the following:

1. Created a folder titled "Bookmarks" under the bookmarks menu
2. Added a bookmark titled "Wired Science" to the folder created in step 1
3. Removed the folder created in step 1
4. Created a new folder titled "Science" under the bookmarks menu
5. Created a new folder titled "Blogs" under the folder created in step 4

The following code snippet duplicates the steps above:

var bs  = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/browser/nav-bookmarks-service;1"].getService( Components.interfaces.nsINavBookmarksService );
var ios = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/network/io-service;1"].getService( Components.interfaces.nsIIOService );
    
var folder = bs.createFolder( bs.bookmarksMenuFolder, "Bookmarks", bs.DEFAULT_INDEX );
bs.insertBookmark( folder, ios.newURI( "http:/www.wired.com/wiredscience", null, null), bs.DEFAULT_INDEX , "Wired Science" );

bs.removeItem( folder );

var folder1 = bs.createFolder( bs.bookmarksMenuFolder, "Science", bs.DEFAULT_INDEX );
var folder2 = bs.createFolder( folder1, "Blogs", bs.DEFAULT_INDEX );

// folder2 title should be "Blogs" but is "Wired Science" instead
if (bs.getItemTitle( folder2 ) != "Blogs") alert( "Folder name incorrect" );



Actual results:

The folder created in step 5 gets the title "Wired Science"


Expected results:

The folder should have received the title "Blogs" that was specified in the call to createFolder. In fact, this is what happens under Firefox 5 but not under Firefox 6 betas.
