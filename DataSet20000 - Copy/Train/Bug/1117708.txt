[e10s] Using the element picker on a new tab tile results in highlighter.js errors and an unresponsive toolbox
Reproducible on: Nightly 37.0a1 (2015-01-04) *only with* e10s enabled.

Affected platforms: Windows 8.1 64-bit, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32-bit, Mac OS X 10.9.5.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox with a clean profile.
2. Make sure e10s is enabled by looking at the "Startup" section from about:preferences.
3. Open a new tab.
4. Click the wrench button from the toolbar and click "Toggle tools".
5. Click the "Pick an element from the page" button from the left side of the toolbox and then select a tile.
6. Check the Browser Console.
7. Click the "Pick an element from the page" button again.
8. Try to close the toolbox.

Expected result:
6. There are no errors thrown for this action.
7. A new element from the page can be selected for inspection.
8. The developer tools pane is closed without causing any issues.

Actual result:
6. Two errors are thrown by highlighter.js:
> TypeError: this._walker is null in highlighter.js:247:4
> TypeError: actor is null in highlighter.js:264:4
7. The same errors are thrown again, multiple times and the "Pick an element from the page" button is no longer working.
8. Clicking the close button from the developer tools is no longer working.

Notes:
- This issue is not reproducible with e10s disabled.
