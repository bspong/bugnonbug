Steps to reproduce:

Not sure how to answer this question lol...


Actual results:

For alittle while now whenever I want to save an image or file to the folder I choose on
my Windows Vista, it automatically adds another folder within the folder I want to save in.

An example would be... I would click on 'Save Image As...' then select the folder:

C:\Users\SpazRaven\Downloads.... and then when its done saving the file will appear in the new automatic folder called C:\Users\SpazRaven\Downloads\Downloads\.

In my FireFox options on the General tab my 'Save Files To' is set at:

C:\Users\SpazRaven\Downloads so there shouldnt be any reason why when saving a file whatever folder it is, it always adds a new folder within the selected folder with the same folder name.

Also at first I thought it was just the add-on DownThemAll that had this problem creating duplicate folders it turns out that FireFox itself as been doing it all along.

An example image is below downloading through DownThemAll as it adds another folder.


Expected results:

It should just save in the folder I selected and not add a new folder within the selected folder with the same name.
