When restoring a 3-windows session, some toolbar buttons disappear on some windows
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b11) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b11

I customized firefox' navigation toolbar; I dragged the search terms highlighter and search words from my google toolbar to the right of firefox' search box on the navigation bar (and hidden google's toolbar). When I close my 3-windows session and restart firefox, 2 windows restore with the correct customization, and 1 with the default firefox navigation toolbar layout. It reproduces consistently.

This looks like a firefox issue rather than a google toolbar issue, since i'd expect firefox to restore customized buttons consistently across windows.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install google toolbar
2. open up 3 or more firefox windows
3. search for anything, see the search terms in google toolbar
4. customize toolbars, drag search highlight tool and search terms from google toolbar to firefox navigation bar
5. hide google toolbar
6. restart firefox
7. buttons do not restore correctly and consistently across firefox windows



I tried disabling all addons and extensions but google toolbar, still reproduces.
I erased the file in my profile directory holding the user settings, which reset all toolbars to the default (i forget its name), started off from a "clean slate", didn't help either.
