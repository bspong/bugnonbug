show tag results in url bar autocomplete

As an intermediate step between where I am with it right now (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=395161) and faaborg's mockup (http://people.mozilla.com/~faaborg/files/granParadisoUI/places_UnifyingSearch_i1.png), here's what I'd like to propose for m8 (meaning, something I think I can finish and get reviewed today.)

Upon typing in the url bar:

    * prioritize exact (case insensitive) tag matches to the top, and use the tag icon instead of the star.  among the tag matches, sort by frecency.  The reasoning here is to promote tagging, to make finding tagged items easier, and now users can use tags for the additional purpose of affecting search results.  Say I want g to be google.  I can tag google.com with g and if that is the only page tagged with g, it will always be first.  I'd rather users use tags to do this, than just bookmarking.

    * after the tag matches, the frecency results for bookmarks + the first chunk of history.  the reason for this is so that unvisited bookmarks will be "near the top", yet not completely outweighing unbookmarked visits.

    * after all that, continue on with the rest of history (in the current asynchronous fashion). 

Note, this should be as fast as things currently are, as tag searching and bookmark searching fast as those are typicallly several orders of magnitude less than history.
