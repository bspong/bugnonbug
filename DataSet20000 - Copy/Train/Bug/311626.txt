Installer should not delete searchplugins without permission

Installing 1.5beta2, I deleted most of the FF directory, leaving only plugins
and search plugins.  As the installer automatically overwrites files, this
usually updates plugins which have changed.  I assumed the same was true for
searchplugins.  However, while plugins was simply updated, searchplugins was
deleted and replaced.

Although bug 123315 means that by default new search plugins are added to the
user profile, this is not how I (and I guess many others) use FF.  I often "zap"
my profile for testing reasons, rescuing oly my bookmark file.  Having to do the
search plugins too would be a pain.  I also don't want all of the default
plugins (I'm not in the US, so things like ebay.com are of little interest). 
Finally, te sort order of the plugins has the user plugins and program file
plugins separated out.  But I like a simple alphabetical list.  I guess in a
corporate-type environment the default search plugins is also likely to be
highly modified.

I don't see why plugins is simply overwritten, preserving any additions, but
searchplugins is deleted and replaced.  This is annoying to me, but is also
inconsistent.  If the installer is going to clean out the FF directory, it
should do the lot, and probably give a warning too.
