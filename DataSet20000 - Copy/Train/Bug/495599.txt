when having  various bookmarked tabs open (internet radio  included)
there are two ways this occurs 
1. atotal crash and a fault window  with a request to send detail and restore with  a failure to send the fault
2 Total crash and  dissapearance of firefox with no fault  message
Both of theses are regular  4-5 times a day and  started 2 weeks ago for no identifiable reason. Firefox was aalway the prefered  browser owing to it stability and a healthy dislike of Microsoft, this has never happend  before
