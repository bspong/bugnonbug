Various sites won't load, can't scroll or change tab with mouse

My browser is not loading sites that constantly update, such as Twitter, Facebook or Gmail, although Gmail does load in its html version. The browser says "Done" in the bottom left corner but the status bar in the bottom right never quite finishes and the content is missing (in both Twitter and Facebook the bar along the top with some options did load, but the main content did not, with Gmail it just said that it was loading my account and never did).

I also cannot scroll using the scroll pad in my laptop mouse, even though it still works in other programmes, and I can't change tabs by clicking on the tab top, I have to use Ctrl+tab.

I have also just noticed that when I try to close smaller dialogue boxes (for example the one that appeared when I clicked "Help" -> "Search for updates") they do not close. Nor will the "Do you want Firefox to remember this password?" drop-down disappear, even after clicking "Not now" and the X.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to go to www.facebook.com, www.twitter.com, or www.mail.ncf.edu
2. Log in
3. Notice that no constantly-updated information loads

1. Go to any website
2. Use the scrolling part of laptop mouse
3. Make a new tab and try to change back to the old one by clicking on its title
4. Notice that neither works
Actual Results:  
As described above

Expected Results:  
Websites should load, scrolling should work, clicking should work

I am using the default theme, I have a persona loaded, still happened when I disabled the persona extension.
