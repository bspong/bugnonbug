Stops loading videos after watching several videos

After watching several videos (about after 10 videos), the next video will not load up. After clicking on the next video, source code of the page shows up and the download completes with the source code on the screen.
It is not possible to watch any video after that instance unless firefox is completely exited and restarted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to www.youtube.com
2.Start watching (any)videos
3.After about the 10th video, only the source code of the next video page will load after clicking on the next video (link) to watch.
Actual Results:  
No special steps. The steps I described above are exactly the steps to reproduce the bug.

Expected Results:  
What do you mean by expected results here in this form field? I don't get it.
After I perform the steps above, the source code loads up (is downloaded). I can only watch Youtube videos after this point by ONLY restarting Firefox.

This happens always and on any/all Youtube pages after the steps I described above.
To me it is a major bug to be fixed. I don't like using the stupid Internet Explorer, but only with Internet Explorer I can watch Youtube videos without problems I described here. (I'm sure If I used that pathetic IExploerer, other problems would arise but I wouldn't know since I only use it with Youtube and certain Firefox incompatible sites such as banking and other official sites.)
