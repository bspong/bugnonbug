"Tile Tabs" add-on and Greasemonkey together with e10s makes browser unresponsive, slow to load pages
Well, technically it does work. With e10s activated the add-on still behaves exactly the same way as before.
BUT: the browser itself becomes pretty much unusable. It takes very long for pages to load, and when they're finished, it still says "Connecting..." in the title. It can take several seconds to completely switch from one tab to another and then it gets rather messy. Only one tab at a time will be displayed properly, all other tabs become either black if the browser is maximized, or white if it is not. The elements are still there, i.e. the cursor changes its appearance when hovering above text or links, but they aren't shown and cannot be interacted with. Only when switching from maximized to windowed mode the current tab will be displayed properly and all other tabs will turn black/white instead. Also tabs cannot be closed.
Other items like the menu or the bookmarks seem to work just fine.

And one last thing regarding tile tabs: When I first tested it's functionality with e10s enabled it worked pretty well. After experimenting with the behaviour of tabs as described above I again tried to tile some tabs. Specifically, I was at wikipedia.org and wanted amazon.com to be above it. After a couple of seconds, in which the displayed tab flickered (sometimes showing both tabs, sometimes none), Nightly started opening new tabs. Then it asked if I wanted to stop a script that was executed by amazon.org, but it didn't help. I restarted Nightly in safe-mode, closed amazon and all blank tabs and restarted again. Since then, every time I start Nightly with both e10s and tile tabs active, it immediatly begins to open about one new tab per second.

Ok, that is pretty much all I found until now. I might comment again when I solved the new-tab-issue.
