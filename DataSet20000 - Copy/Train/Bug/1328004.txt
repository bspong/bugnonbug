This is regression. So far Alexandre Poirot doesn't care about quality at all. Hopefully he'll
pay attention to this bug and fix it ASAP. If you do care about quality, please talk to him.

Wording:  (added, because some people may misunderstand)
1) "Alexandre Poirot doesn't care about quality at all" - that is true. Explanation:
   For any person, tracking new bugs (especially serious ones) that are set as blocking for bugs he
   implemented is a trivial task. If a person implements "improvement" like bug 1161072 (and therefore
   hang in bug 1197789, that was present for ONE YEAR with zero activity), that can only mean A or B
   A) he was aware of bug 1197789 => he intentionally added hang in browser (by keeping patch from
      bug 1161072 in browser) => therefore he doesn't care about quality at all.
   B) he wasn't aware of that bug => he didn't even care tracking whether he broke something =>
      had no intention of creating reliable product.
2) `"improvement"` - this expression contains quotes, because bug 1161072 only added hang.
