Larger numbers of RSS feeds cause Firefox to send out LOTS of packets at once

I have 50+ Live Bookmarks (RSS Feeds) in my Bookmarks list.  When Firefox first runs, Wireshark (packet sniffer) reveals it sends out 50+ HTTP requests simultaneously, and somehow saturates the local network bandwidth (I didn't do the packet capture myself).

If I also believe the same source that told me about the packet capture, it also manages to do this at 6am in the morning when I'm sleeping and Firefox isn't running... O_o

Although I can't verify THAT, I did SEE a packet dump, and I am very close to being banned from my network for using an application that sends out "thousands  of packets a second" (his words).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add lots of feeds to Firefox.
2. Hook up Wireshark or some packet sniffer
3. Restart Firefox.
4. Profit?
Actual Results:  
Firefox will (hopefully?) send out a large number of packets in a very short time.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should limit the number of feeds queried at once or cache queries from past sessions and refresh different feeds in a staggered order (IE: If we have 30 feeds, and we want to refresh feeds every half-hour, we refresh one different feed a minute).

It would be nice if there were at least options to reduce the number of RSS Feeds queried at once or something... I'm sorry I don't have more concrete facts or a Wireshark dump but I can't test this myself on my network.
