Add query for getting Highlights (recent bookmarks and recent history with metadata)
This query will be used by Activity Stream Highlights section to be implemented https://github.com/mozilla/activity-stream/issues/3147

The desired functionality there is to show up to 9 highlights with the most recent bookmarks from the last 5 days followed by recent history that has metadata from bug 1393924.

mak, I see there's `Bookmarks.getRecent` that calls `fetchRecentBookmarks`:
https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/places/Bookmarks.jsm#1684-1712

We could just call that to get 9 bookmarks and filter out those that are older than 5 days, but it looks like that query isn't optimized:
> 0|0|0|SCAN TABLE moz_bookmarks AS b
> 0|1|1|SEARCH TABLE moz_bookmarks AS p USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid=?)
> 0|2|2|SEARCH TABLE moz_places AS h USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid=?)
> 0|0|0|USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY

It looks like it might just want an index on dateAdded for moz_bookmarks? But we might put this behind a cache/timer anyway (top sites only updates once every 15 minutes unless there's deletions), so performance might not be totally critical. And we'll use notifications to detect added bookmarks.

Activity stream would still need the metadata for those bookmarks if available, so that will require re-querying or having a dedicated query for activity stream in the first place.

So, does it make sense to just have a custom query somewhere in NewTabUtils's ActivityStreamLinks/ActivityStreamProvider to get bookmarks and history (by last_visit_date) with `description` and `preview_image_url`?
