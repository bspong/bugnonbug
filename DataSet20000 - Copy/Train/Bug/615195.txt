Hi, I have set the http://webmaildomini.aruba.it how start page but every time I open firefox and login I get a blank page then I have to reload with the home button and remake the login.
Besides, when I try to save a contact from a message which I replied from this webmail I get an internal error system message, if I press again save it resend me another message impossible to make this operation. I checked the webpage with safari and it doesn't happen it besides I contacted aruba.it assistence to check if existed some serverside problems but it works correct.
I am acquainted with your browser but it's slower than earlier version and often goes in crash or hangs, today 5 times.
I wish you can fix it or I have to try another browser faster that also works correct with html 5
Regards
