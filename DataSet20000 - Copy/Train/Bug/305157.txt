Hindi is written in devnagari script which is much more complex than Roman.
Here, the Vowels are added as an symbol above or below the Consonent. Also
alphabets may be used with half tones (like a silent K in knowledge) with a
symbol called 'Halant'. Let's say block letter 'K' is an alphabet and '*' is a
halant. So a half tone 'K' will be 'K*'.

For some alphabets, instead of using halant, they use a different alphabet
itself e.g. if I write small 'k' instead of 'K*'

IE6 for example, can recognize the characters where if needs to display 'K*' and
where to display 'k'. Same thing is true for applications like Word 2003. but
Firefox can't display the same thing properly

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the following page in Firefox and IE6
http://www.bbc.co.uk/hindi/science/story/2005/08/050818_nasa_delay.shtml
This is a news article on BBC hindi website
2. Look at the title of the article
3. Compare the second word of the title in Firefox and IE6.


Actual Results:  
In Firefox, there are three alphabets and a halant (oblique line below the
middle alphabet).

Expected Results:  
In IE6, there are two alphabets and a small arc like symbol above second
alphabet in this word. This is the correct way to display it.

There is another problem with the use of vowels which I will post as a separate bug
