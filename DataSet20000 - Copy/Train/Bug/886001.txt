User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/27.0.1453.116 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

most of the sites that I visit , loads weirdly , for example, multiple images are loaded or the content is wrapped and if it contains social networking icons , it gets messed and displayed multiple times, I formated my system, did re-install even, the pages gets loaded properly in Chrome , and IE , but problem with FF, this happened after the upgrade only.
Example : http://www.templatemonster.com/
Upgrading from older firefox... I observed that the problem was corrected when the pop was enabled . 

I will attach the screen shots...

In older version , thought the pop up is disabled the page used to get displayed properly .



Actual results:

Explained in steps to reproduce. 

When pop up is blocked major sites content is not being displayed properly .
The older versions are fine.


Expected results:

Though pop up is disabled, how should it impact the loading of page, and why should it mess with the content, there were many sites , where the buttons are being displayed in other parts  ...
