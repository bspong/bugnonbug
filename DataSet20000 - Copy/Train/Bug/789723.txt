All Firefox menus disappear after a indeterminate period of time
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux i686; rv:15.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/15.0
Build ID: 20120825192214

Steps to reproduce:

After using Firefox for a period of time, which seems to be entirely random, the drop down menu's Search, Address Bar as well as the Firefox Menu and even right click become either invisible or appear and disappear very quickly, certainly too swiftly to click. 


Actual results:

I have attached a video demonstrating this problem, although it is difficult to convey in a video how something does not occur so I will try and explain. The video starts off with my trying to select a search engine other than the one displayed, when this problem manifests itself this is impossible as can be seen in the video. I am left clicking constantly, but the drop down does not appear. Next I try typing, again, no suggestions appear. In the address bar, clicking on the drop down does nothing, the resulting menu is invisible and/or unclickable. Typing in the address bar as seen in the video, has a similar effect. 

Next I try right clicking in the various boxes on the video, and at no point does the right click menu appear. Then I try clicking on the Firefox menu itself, which seems to flash but displays nothing, the same thing happens when pressing F10 to attempt to display the menu bar. 

Finally I try selecting a word and then right clicking on it, the menu appears to display but is invisible and/or unclickable. 


Expected results:

Normal menu behaviour should have occurred, i.e. the drop down menu's appearing. 

The only way to resolve this problem is to restart Firefox. 

Things I have tried:

Disabling/Enabling Hardware Acceleration
Ticking/Not ticking disable or replace context menus
Starting in Safe Mode
Creating a new profile

None of these had any effect, the problem still occurred.
