When navigating a web site, once the back button has been used, the browser will return to that page when a link ( not just for that page, mind you ) is hovered over.  If you are quick, and preposition your pointer ( after hitting the "back" button again) you can navigate to a different link, and set that is the new "persistent page".

Also, if you are careful not to bring the cursor over any other links, you can keep the behaviour at bay.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to www.cuddletech.com, navigate to blogs, read posting, consider ideas.
2.Navigate to comments for that blog entry
3.select URL of any given commentator.  Read page, consider ideas.
4.hit the back button
5.just TRY to navigate to anywhere else;  hovering the cursor ( actualy just brushing the cursor over a link) sends you back to tbe page of the previous commentator.

Actual Results:  
steps to reproduce done interactively with the site.  see above text box

Always happens at sites for which this is a problem, not all sites are.
does not always happen right away, response times tends to decrease, 

Makes firefox almost unusable
