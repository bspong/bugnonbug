Browser hogs CPU, when visiting a page with lots of form controls

Large slashdot discussions (with more than ~150 messages) causes firefox to hang (become unresponsive) and hog the CPU (1xCPU at 100%). 

This is an indicative URL:

You will need to check the "I am willing to help test" checkbox if it is not checked.

About one in 5 times when the browser crashes, it also makes the entire system unresponsive requiring me to reboot the computer.

I'm running a dual core with an nvidia gfx card and the "nview" system turned on.

I also filed a bug with the slashdot project on sourceforge:

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/01/10/1546223 or any other discussion that has a large number of articles (~150+).
2. Make sure you have "I am willing to help test" checkbox set.
3. Wait until page loads and browser becomes unresponsive.





Actual Results:  
CPU usage spikes to 100% on one CPU and is no longer responsive.

Expected Results:  
Should not use 100% of CPU and should be responsive.
