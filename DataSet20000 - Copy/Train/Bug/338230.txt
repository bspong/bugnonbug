Java applet error in loading MAC OSX firefox 1.0.7

hi,

i am devloping banking application for my customer.

while devloping the web page we do have a applet on the login page for customer to login. it is for encryption use of password and user id.

i do not have a problem in loading the applet if the web page is on the production server, meaning with the valid SSL cert from verisign. and 

most importantlly both the applet are the same. i have checked them many time & compare them already. 

the production site

https://internet-banking.dbs.com.sg

you can both the user id & pin input box and the applet loads nicely.

but on my test site with self sign cert.

https://sib2.dbs.com

somehow it doesn't load up but with error of java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: XXXXXX (XXXXXX=my applet name).

i think most probable cause is the self sign cert. i don't know how to disable the warning for self sign cert, maybe bypassing the self sign cert the problem will not be there ? 

i am using the following browser. (netscape 7.02 well you can d/l from here http://browser.netscape.com/ns8/download/archive70x.jsp) 

netscape 7.02 for mac and j2se 1.4.2, mac osx 10.4.6
firefox 1.0.7 for mac and j2se 1.4.2, mac osx 10.4.6

here you guy can try the site, it is open to public.

please help me out here.

thanks
