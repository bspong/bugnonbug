The method 'setTheme' in shared/theme.js doesn't trigger a live theme change
STR:
1. Open the Developer Tools
2. Open browser console.
3. Type following commands to the browser console:
 let { devtools: { require } } = Cu.import("resource://gre/modules/devtools/Loader.jsm", {});
 let { setTheme } = require("devtools/shared/theme");
 setTheme("dark");
 // OR setTheme("light") if you are using the dark theme

Expected results: The theme changes for the active toolboxes.
Actual results: The theme is not changed until you reopen the toolbox.

The reason for this problem is at [1] which updates the pref first and then reads it again to the oldValue field. Then at [2] the theme switching returns early as the old value was incorrectly set to the the new value in [1].

A fixed version of this method has already crept to few places around the tree [3], [4].
