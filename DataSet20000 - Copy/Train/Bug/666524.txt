This is a bug in your processes not a software bug.

A recent exploit, screen-scraping via WebGL, was discovered in FF4 resulting from an FF bug. A fix was quickly made but only in FF5. This is unacceptable as a bump in the major version number will almost certainly make some add-ons fail to work, some which may be vital to a person's work. This happened in my case.

Fixes to important security issues need to be made to the major version current at the time the exploit is discovered and possibly one previous as well so that people do not have to choose between a security hole or breaking their environment.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install FF4
2. Install the Google Web Toolkit plug-in.
3. Upgrade to FF5
4. Try to use the Google Web Toolkit plug-in.

Actual Results:  
The browser behaves as if the GWT plug-in is not installed.

Expected Results:  
n/a
