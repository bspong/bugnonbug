Can't access many pages with javascript:void(0) access

With one of the recent upgrades (maybe from April 1st, 2009) I am not being allowed to enter various pages which I previously could. I get to a page for a site and then click on link and cannot enter. Putting the mouse over the link, the status bar says "javascript:void(0)." This happens on many different websites but not on all of them. Both JavaScript and Java are activated in options and I have the latest java installed. I have unblocked pop ups, I have downloaded windows updates and have reinstalled Firefox with no success.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Occurs on most websites but not all.
Actual Results:  
When I click on the link the mouse changes to an hourglass for a few seconds as if it were waiting for the new page to open in the same tab/window or a new one. Then the mouse changes back to a regular pointer and nothing happens to the page (as if I never clicked on link).

Expected Results:  
The new page should have opened up in either a new window/tab or the same one.

This started to happen about a month ago. Also happening simultaneously is that many of my installed add-ons (approved ones) are not working or are unconfigurable. These add-ons are Adblock Plus, Dictionary Tooltip, Download Status Bar, DownThemAll, Read It Later, Tiny Menu, CS Lite. The icons disappear from one restart of Firefox to the next, many of the features don't work and one (Adblock Plus) caused major problems with the program so I uninstalled it. I believe all this started with 3.0. HELP!!!
