OOM crash on code.org tutorial running in a VM
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/50.0.2661.94 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

Firefox is experiencing a browser crash (full crash, not just an error) on a Code.org tutorial that worked fine in past versions and which works on other browsers.

The exact point of the crash is somewhat unpredictable but the following sequence of steps crashes very reliably in FF 46.0 and FF 46.0.1 running on a Saucelabs Windows VM.  (It does not crash in OSX.)

1. Go to
https://studio.code.org/s/allthethings/stage/4/puzzle/4?noautoplay=true
2. Click OK
3. Drag the "Get nectar block" inside the if block and click Run.
4. Refresh the page when you get to the completion dialog.
5. Click Run again.


Actual results:

Browser crashes at some point in the repro steps above, display the "Firefox has crashed dialog".  Before the crash, sometimes errors are visible in the console, suggesting memory corruption.  At different times I have seen errors about "out of memory", "corrupted PNG", and also invalid scripts, while in fact these resources all appear to be be valid.  

I note that FF 46.0 includes security fixes to the Jit; is it possible that one of these introduce a memory bug (use after free, double free, etc.)


Expected results:

Browser should not crash.
