Automatically hide/show the downloads button by default, providing an option to have it permanently visible
Per some looong discussions, we'll:

- automatically show/hide the downloads button by default, based on whether that session has downloads or not
- have a hidden pref to turn that behaviour on/off
- have some TBD UI to toggle said pref (maybe in customize mode footer, maybe context menu, maybe in the downloads panel itself, maybe in a separate dropdown panel that appears when moving the item in customize mode... or maybe something else)
- show the item in customize mode even if auto-hidden "normally" (but maybe with a "ghost"-ish dotted icon, if it's in the toolbar), with users able to put it where they want
- the default position of the button will be next to the urlbar(/searchbar)(/spacer(s)), as before. We will probably add a migration step to put the button there, given that it now auto-hides. Users can obviously move the button if they don't want it there (similar to the sidebar/library/bookmarks menu migrations we've already done).


edgecases:
- it could be confusing there's an extra icon in customize mode that isn't there when leaving. Hopefully the added UI toggle for the hidden pref and/or the ghost icon and/or an updated tooltip (TBD, depends on UI) will help make this clearer to users
- the overflow panel is a bit awkward - toggling the overflow button based on whether there are downloads as well, if auto-hide is turned on, would be a bit nightmarish. Instead, we will practically speaking not autohide when the button is in there, and any UI (see above) would be greyed out as long as that's where the button was.


I'm going to start work on the implementation side of things, and hopefully UI will firm up in the next day or two and we can still land this in the next week or so.

This will likely need 1 or 2 strings for UI, but not too much change given that the previous attempt to do this was already backed out so generally speaking what we need will be in the tree already. Still, CC'ing flod so he's aware. I'll do my best to move as quickly as possible here to give l10n maximum space (though, again, it shouldn't be a lot of strings).
