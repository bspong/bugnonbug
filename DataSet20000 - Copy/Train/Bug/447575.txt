It seems that certain frames webpages (ogame) cause the 'link hand' to show for a url from the framed site even on other tabs containing sites from other domains.  Maxing bandwidth may be a related issue.

I generally keep ogame.us and ogame.org open in the first two tabs.  ogame is a frames based site.  After some amount of time, being in a non-ogame tab, say google.com for instance, when the mouse cursor comes to rest on a non-hyperlink, the hyperlink 'hand cursor' appears, and an ogame url shows in the taskbar.  After this starts happening, it seems my bandwidth usage (monitored via Windows XP Task Manager's Netwoking tab) is maxing my bandwidth.  With similar usage under FF2 this did not happen. Closing FF3 will drop bandwidth usage to zero.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.login to http://ogame.us and 'play' the game for a few minutes.
2.do the same at http://ogame.org
3.Open several more tabs (with arbitrary websites loaded int them), close some, open some others
4.on my machine, and eventually the above symtoms will occur.
Actual Results:  
After some amount of time, being in a non-ogame tab, say google.com for instance, when the mouse cursor comes to rest on a non-hyperlink, the hyperlink 'hand cursor' appears, and an ogame url shows in the taskbar.

After this starts happening, it seems my bandwidth usage (monitored via Windows XP Task Manager's Netwoking tab) is maxing my bandwidth.

Expected Results:  
No bandwidth saturation. Not showing non-existent urls in the tab containing a site from another domain.

As yet, it has not crashed the browser.

I will check the security checkbox as there could be a potential for denial of service on the client.
