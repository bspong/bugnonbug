Norton Confidential Firefox crash [@ coFFPlgn.dll@0x2e2f1] and general instability in coFFPlgn.dll
looking at a one week sample of crashes for 3.0.9 I'm seeing over 1200 crashes at:

1209 coFFPlgn.dll@0x2e2f1 

about 1/3 of these have the url:about blank possible indicating some relation to open new tab, but a variety of other urls are also listed.  comments also indicate many users encountering crashes with this signature at shutdown.

if you add in all the other possibly related crashes in this .dll at other address it would point to a general instability problem.  

there is also a long running thread on the norton support forum
