Firefox 1.0 hangs with a javascript .focus() before an alert() when called from an onblur event
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0 StumbleUpon/1.999

Inside of a javascript function defined in the above url, I call a focus on an
object passed in. In this case it is a <input type="text"> and I have not test
it with any other type of DOM object. After calling focus(), I call alert() as
if I am popping up an error message. As soon as this is actived through onBlur
event(I have not test with any other events), Firefox pauses, then accepts no
input or gives any output, even displaying the dialog from the alert() call.
Checkin in the taskmgr, Firefox is maxing out my CPU and I am forced to End Task
it. I tested this on the linux Debian build, 1.0+dfsg.1-2 using sarge and I have
 a similar issue, however I instead get the alert() dialog over and over and
every time I click OK it reappears. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to above URL or download the file to your local system
2. Click into the provided text box
3. Click or tab off of the text box
4. Check the taskmgr under windows, or click through endless dialog boxes under
linux



Expected Results:  
Using the Windows build, you should have a hang with Firefox trying to max out
your CPU. Under Linux, you get a series of endless OK dialog boxes.
