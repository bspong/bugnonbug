Copy/Paste is Broken When Focus is Shifted Using 3rd-Party GUI Navigation Programs

While using Otaku Software's TopDesk application-switching program (http://www.otakusoftware.com/topdesk/), if focus is given to another window, then returned to Firefox, the Copy/Paste functionality is broken:

1) Copying text from an outside application to Firefox works
2) Text copied from within Firefox is not added to the clipboard, and when one tries to paste, it usually refuses to paste anything
3) Pasting into the Search box at all is impossible when such symptoms are being exhibited after changing focus
(Sometimes these symptoms seem to manifest themselves differently, ex., pasting into the Search box pastes text onto the focused page instead)

Minimizing the Firefox window using the Windows GUI and not TopDesk fixes the problem instantly.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. With a Firefox window open, copy test from a page ("test1")
2. Switch windows using TopDesk to any other application
3. Switch back to Firefox in the same manner
4. Copy new text ("test2")
5. Try to paste it

Actual Results:  
1. Refuses to paste either text into the text box on this page
2. Same result for the Search bar
3. Newly-copied text DOES copy into other applications correctly (formatting and all)
4. Text copies into FF from outside applications just fine as well

Expected Results:  
New text should copy-paste into all FF windows/boxes the same
