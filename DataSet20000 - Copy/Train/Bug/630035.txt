You can't maintain your existing FF when you install FF 4 BETA10.

When you install FF 4 BETA10, it literally takes over your existing FireFox installation. While it doesn't install over it, it automatically finds your existing directory where you keep your extensions, bookmarks, etc. This, of course, leads to losing a lot of the functionality in FF 3.6 -- some extensions are turned off, your Persona disappears, your customizations disappear.

Installation should allow users the choice of establishing a new FF 4 setup or taking over your existing FF setup.

I do want to add, however, that FF 4 BETA 10 is excellent. Fast, stable, and a joy to use -- except for pretty much disabling too many features I've got set up in FF 3.6 (fortunately I had a clone of my hard drive and could restore my directory with all my FF 3.6 settings, extensions, etc.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install FF 4 BETA 10 on a computer with FF 3.6 already installed
2. Run FF 4 BETA 10
3. Close FF4, then run your old FireFox



The new FF 4 should leave your existing FF 3.6 alone and not take it over. FF 4 should give you a choice of establishing a new profile or installing into your existing profile.
