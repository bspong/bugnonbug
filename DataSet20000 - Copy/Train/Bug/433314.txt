"No proxy for" wrongly interpretes a dash in a domain name

I'm working for a company called let's say  XYZ.
From inside our network, we can access the company internet site xyz.com and its subdomains (news.xyz.com , sports.xyz.com  ...) without using the proxy server. This is defined by putting XYZ.com in the "No proxy for" field. So far, everything works great.

Now, I'm the webmaster of a private website called  abc-xyz.com . It is independent from the company, but the characters after the dash are the same than our company name !
With Firefox, I cannot access my private internet site from within our company network. 

On my PC, I worked around the problem by simply taking out the 'xyz.com' from the "No proxy for" field.
But as other people in our company simply import those settings from their IE, they can't access my pages and just get a message that the server takes too long to respond. As I can't control what other people have in their "no proxy for" field,
Firefox should recognize abc-xyz.com as a different domain name. For the moment, it seems to be considered as part of the domain xyz.com


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Put  xyz.com  in the "No proxy for" field
2.Browse to the internally reachable website xyz.com
3.Browse to an also existing, but foreign domain abc-xyz.com
Actual Results:  
xyz.com could be correctly reached on the internal network without using a proxy.
abc-xyz.com cannot be reached.

Expected Results:  
Reach xyz.com without proxy.
Reach abc-xyz.com through the proxy.

Neither with Internet Explorer nor with Netscape 8, installed on the same PC and using the same proxy settings, this problem appears.
