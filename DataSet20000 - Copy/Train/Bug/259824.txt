I was developing a small javascript design desk and I had trouble with my
mainpage beeing refreshed when I was setting the src of a image to 'null'. I
tried it both in IE and Netscape7 but it seams like those browsers did
understand the 'null' keyword and did not try to load any content into the image
whose src I was changeing. However, each time I set the .src property of the
image to 'null' (image_element.src=null) firefox automatically loaded the parent
window's url into the src of the image, thus causing the mainpage code to be
executed.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. create an image into an empty page and set an id on it
2. run a small javascript command to load some content into the image and on the
onload event, run a command to set the src of the image to null
3. if the empty page was generated by a script and that script had a command to
send an email for example, you will notice that each time you set the src of the
image to null, you will get an email, meaning that the script has been executed.

Actual Results:  
My mainpage was runned again. Wich is not a problem for ordinary pages but it
just happened that the mainpage was used to reset the configuration and database
content of the opened project so this problem made whole site inoperable.

Expected Results:  
Well, as normal and also as noticed in IE and also in Netscape7, when set to
null, the image should not take any action.
