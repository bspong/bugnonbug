On any sort of file upload, i.e. drop.io or email attachments, firefox will crash; same happens with "Save As" right-click function.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5
Build Identifier: Firefox 3.0 / 2.x

When attempting to upload a file from my hard drive to a specific website (this includes myspace, facebook, drop.io, gmail, yahoo mail, flicker, etc.) firefox will immediately crash. Most of the time I am not given the option to send an error report, the process simply terminates itself. On restart of the application,I am given the opportunity to restart from the previous session, but without uploading the desired file. So far this has only happened with my computer, on my Asus laptop running 32-bit Vista SP1.
The same bug has recently begun occurring with the right click "save as" function.
This has been a recurring theme that I let lie for the last few builds, but when it did not go away in this version it led me to believe that there is something legitimately unnoticed so far. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up an email document
2. Click attach file
3. If firefox doesn't crash then, select a file, and hit Ok.
4. Firefox has crashed at this point.
Actual Results:  
Firefox crashed

Expected Results:  
A file should have been uploaded as an email attachment

I have reinstalled firefox from the ground up on my machine, and the problem reoccurs before any add-ons or themes have been downloaded / installed.
