consistent warning bar about Firefox preventing redirection to another window and an ALLOW button; I cannot find anything in  Options to disable this annoying warning. Is it fixable?
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:20.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/20.0 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:

I have checked my Option cfg; I have read your known problems and Fixed Issues. I hope this is just a brain fart and I can just modify some setting to prevent it. 


Actual results:

Every time I open a tab or click to another URL, this warning bar appears under the toolbar saying that Firefox prevented redirection to another site; there is an Allow button and an X. I always smack the X white muttering profanities. The consistent appearance does seem to impact performance. I have a 64-bit quad core processor with 6GB memory and running a stable version of HP Windows 7.


Expected results:

Smacking the X does make the bar go away until the next time I open a tab or go to another url; sometimes there is actually a whole new tab opened with the bar. Now I have loaded a bunch of coupon and money-saving apps, and I wonder if one of those sneaky little POS might be the culprit. Whaddya think?
