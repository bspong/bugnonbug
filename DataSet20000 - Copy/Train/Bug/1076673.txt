Steps to reproduce:

Start Firefox. (Version 32.0.3) Open 7 sites. Open Facebook. Monitor memory use over an hour during casual use. Split off FB into MSIE and only use Firefox for other sites. 


Actual results:

Firefox went from 166,532K of ram to 737,460K in 45 minutes. I had been monitoring memory use for a couple of months because Firefox would get to memory consumption as high as 1,800,000K which grinds my computer to a halt. After running these tests and seeing that after 2 months and some updates it wasn't fixed, I thought it must be FB. I tried closing the browser tab for FB, and for other sites. Memory might fluctuate, but it isn't let go. So, I started using FB in MSIE. MSIE does not do this. So, I thought it was bad programming in FB. But after using MSIE exclusively for FB, and Firefox for almost everything else, Firefox creeps up in memory use for other sites as well. I've been monitoring it and when it gets to 750,000K or more, I just kill it using Task Manager. That was 4 or 5 times today. 


Expected results:

Pretty obvious. Firefox should not act like it has  memory leak.  Facebook is doing something pretty active, I'm sure of that. But apparently MSIE doesn't have a problem.
