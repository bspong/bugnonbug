Windows error opening Internet shortcut or local HTML file
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.13) Gecko/20060414
Build Identifier: Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.11 for windows XP

when Firefox is launched by double-clicking an Internet shortcut icon (or by entering the url via "Start -> Run") you may see an error dialog similar to: "http://kb.mozillazine.org/images/Windows_cannot_find_url.png".
Is not a problem of firefox exention, I have already tried to change type of file on option folder menu, as from other parts recommended. 
the following workaround doesn't work:
1. Open Explorer
2. Select Tools and then Folder Options
3. Select the File Types tab
4. Select Extension: (NONE), File Type: HyperText Transfer Protocol
5. Click Advanced toward the bottom of the window
6. In the Edit File Type window, select open and click Edit
7. Clear the DDE message box (which should contain "%1" or similar)
8. Click OK, Click OK
9. Repeat for File Type: HyperText Transfer Protocol with Privacy and FTP

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. double-clicking on local HTML file 
2. the default web browser firefox, under Windows, in my case it opens, BAT:
3. Firefox opens with the error dialog, "Windows cannot find <url or path to file>
