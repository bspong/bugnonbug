FF slows down, becomes harder to use, then crashes. Task Manager shows 1Gb+ memory usage.

Since installing 3.0.6 FF crashes every time it is opened. Extreme memory usage is shown in Task Manager after the crash, before FF actually closes. Over 1Gb in use. Before the crashes FF slows down in its response time, taking longer to open DL windows, and the tab show very jerky and spasmodic indications of loading data. The more tabs you open to download, and close on completion of download, the quicker the crash happens. I allwed crash reporter to report one instance of the crash, but my resources are scant so I can't report every instance.

It seems that the crashes are happening more rapidly now, but I have no reliable measure of that.

Had no stability issues before this time and have not installed any plug-ins or extras to FF since latest update except for update to Flash Video Resources Downloader which happened after this behaviour commenced. It is so bad that I am considering returning to the hated IE7, because I keep losing downloads and I am on a very limited Broadband link. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open FF
2. Open several tabs
3. DL anything.
4. Sooner or later CRASH
Actual Results:  
All open windows and tabs closed with no warning and crash reporter opened.

Expected Results:  
Previous versions have had no problem with many open windows and tabs and multiple downloads. That is what I expected of this update as well.

I have made no changes to the computer except the adding of a 1Tb External HDD.
