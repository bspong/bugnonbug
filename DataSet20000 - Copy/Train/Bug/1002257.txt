ff28 debugger won't debug, doesn't always load files
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:28.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/28.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140314220517

Steps to reproduce:

http://jesusnjim.com/bugs/ff-debugger-wont-debug.htm
ctrl-shift-i
click debugger
F5
(some sort of code view should be there now)
click file
right click file to see if there is context menu
click all the buttons in the debugger toolbar





Actual results:

- lists files, but shows no code (has no code view) - tried all the buttons and right clicking and clicking I could.
- can't edit or debug any files, the bars containing the filenames stretch across whole window and are dead to the world
- earlier when code was buggy(er), it gave a strange error message about a reference error: x is undefined. there was no "x" in any related file. I did have variables.
- earlier and many times in the past, it also refused to load buggy js files, seems like js was "dead to the world" because of my sometimes bad syntax. a debugger should always load files and debug, even with buggy code. that's its purpose, right?


Expected results:

- debugger should always load files
- debugger should have some sort of some sort of code view
