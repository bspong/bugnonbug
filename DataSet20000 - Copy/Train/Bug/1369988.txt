Loading a specific account in Google Drive crashes Firefox
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:53.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/53.0
Build ID: 20170518000419

Steps to reproduce:

On Firefox 53.0.3 (32-bit) on Windows 10.0.15063:
- Open Google Drive.
- Wait for the Google Drive main page to load completely.
- Wait a few seconds.


Actual results:

Firefox 53.0.3 (32-bit) crashes hard with an access violation. If Electrolysis is enabled, only the tab crashes; otherwise, the whole browser crashes.

This is fully reproducible, even on a different computer, every single time I attempt to open Google Drive with that account. However, it only happens with *that specific Google account*. Google Drive with other accounts works just fine. I have no idea what's so special about this account that it manages to make Firefox crash.

Interestingly, the crash does not occur when Google Drive is loaded in a Private Window. However it does still occur on a fresh new Firefox profile.

Breakpad doesn't seem to be able to catch the crash. However, I did catch it manually with a Visual Studio debugger and saved a dump file. I also captured a Process Monitor trace at the time of crash. For privacy reasons I will only provide these files on direct request from someone from Mozilla.

According to the Visual Studio debugger, this is an access violation in some "DOM Worker" thread. The stack trace of that thread seem to have been corrupted somehow - I can only make out a "xul.dll!EnterBaseline(JSContext * cx, js::jit::EnterJitData & data) Line 159" call.
