Wrong display of search results when using a country-specific Google search page

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to google.co.uk
2. enter any search terms 
3. press search
4. do NOT leave the results page
5. refine the search and press search again
6. watch the line below the input field in the new results page
7. repeat steps 2 to 7
Actual Results:  
When using a country-specific Google site (i. e. google.co.uk, google.fr) and specifying the research even further (i. e. results from the UK only), the result page shows a strange behaviour: The line just below the input field is repeated and doubled, i. e. the first search returns ONE line, the second already TWO lines and so on

Expected Results:  
The line just below the input field is repeated and doubled multiple times, forcing me to load a new/blank search page

- behaved normally like when doing a search with (e. g.)yahoo.com

- behaved normally like IE 7 does when using google.co.uk
