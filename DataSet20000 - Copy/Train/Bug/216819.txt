Font size when printing is too large

The font size is too large when printing from Firebird.  I have the same problem
in Netscape, but not in Internet Explorer.  If I have the same web page with the
same font size on the screen in both Internet Explorer and Firebird, Firebird
will print the page using much larger fonts.  This problem can be worked around
if I go to Print Preview and scale the print size but I forget to do this, then
it prints big.

On a perhaps related note, the margins are wrong.  If I set the margins at .5
inches, I get about 1 inch margins.  I have to set them to be about .2 inches to
be .5.

There were lots of discussion about this problem.  I couldn't find this
particular bug in Bugzilla, though I found similar ones (Bug 213179, Bug 120800)
and voted for them.

Thanks for the help! :-)
