Out of control pop-up browsers since downloading latest version of Firefox.

Since I downloaded the latest version of Firefox I have been experiencing continuous pop-up browsers of various websites, most of them dating sites or porn.  They are not the standard pop-up window but an entire new browser opening.  I checked my options and Firefox is supposed to stop any pop-up windows but it isn't stopping these.  I have also checked my Norton and it is all working fine and not recognizing a problem.  The only thing I have changed is the new version of Firefox.  How can I make these browsers stop (sometimes there are several at a time and the just keep coming!) or go to a previous version of the program.  I have tried eliminating cookies, clearing cache, dumping history and everything else I could think of.  As my kids occasionally use my computer it would be best if porn didn't pop-up to them from Facebook.  Thank you for checking into this for me.
