When i try to log in to a router or control panel of a web server the login window appears and suppose we get the user name or password wrong, the login window goes on a loop, till you get it right and clicking the cancel button does not have any effect, when its supposed to show a "401 Unauthorized" page. The only way to close the login window is to end firefox process from the task manager of "Windows". In firefox 2, Opera, IE, and Google Chrome, if we click the cancel button, it displays a "401 Unauthorized" error page. As we need to close firefox itself to close this Login Window, we lose all the pages opened in other tabs, especially if its email or other important document.
