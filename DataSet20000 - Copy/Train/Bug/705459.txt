Nightly reloading Tabs on startup has no History for FTP, results in 425 Error and no way to reload.

Error "425 Can't open data connection." on restart with TM+.

With Nightly 11.0a1 and TM+ (if you save a Session that has a Tab with a ".PDF" File that was obtained with the FTP Protocol) upon reloading Tabs on startup the Tab no History for FTP and a popup for a 425 Error results. 

With a blank Tab and no History there is no way to reload the Tab.


STR:

1. Visit: http://www.panasonic.com/business/security/megasd_networkcameras/index.asp .

2. Right-click and "Open in Foreground Tab" (using Tab Mix Plus' Menu Entry) the Link named "i-Pro Product Line-up Chart" (ftp://ftp.panasonic.com/Pub/Panasonic/business/security/productlineup/i-Pro_productlineup%20_9-09.pdf), it is the fourth down in "Related Links". Alternately you should be able to right-click that Link from _this_ Page without visiting that Site.

3. Exit Nightly and save your Session.

4. Start Nightly and reload your saved Session.

5. With many Tabs reloading the Network gets jammed with requests and it takes a while to reload "http://" Pages (BUT they DO eventually reload OK and have a 'single Page History' (no back or forward Buttons BUT Firefox does know what Page it is on and you can use "Reload"). 

6. Your Tab containing the FTP Page will be blank and can not be reloaded (and you can't right-click at all - to check "View Page Info" or "View Page Source", etc.).


The BUG is:

A. You get an "Alert /!\ 425 Can't open data connection. [OK]" popup.
B. With "ftp://" Pages there is no 'single Page History' (just a blank Tab, that never had visited anywhere) and you can not type CTRL-R or use the "Awesome Bar" 'Reload Button' (backwards curved arrow) to retry the Page.
C. If the Tab were an "http://" Tab (even without back or forward History) you WOULD be able to type CTRL-R or use the "Awesome Bar" 'Reload Button' to reload a blank Tab (assuming this same problem ever did occur on "http://" Pages, which it does not).
D. You are left with a blank Tab and have no means to reload it (or know where the Link came from (IF you did not also keep the Site with the FTP Link open in another Tab)).


Adding Attachment of the 425 Popup.

Thanks.
