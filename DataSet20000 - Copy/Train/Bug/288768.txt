When trying to manually enter the port for a proxy in the
preferences:general:connection settings, it does not remember the informaiton,
and instead I have to use about:config (which most people do not understand, but
will work nonetheless).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.In the preferences:general dialog, go to connection settings
2.Choose "manual proxy configuration"
3.Enter a proxy's IP and the port
4.Say "OK" and close the preferences
Actual Results:  
Nothing. That is the problem. When I re-opened the dialog, the port was 0 again,
not 8118 as wished.

Expected Results:  
It should have kept the port as 8118 and then allowed me to use the proxy.

I did change my widgets with "Firefoxy", but that only changes the images in
there. I could get it to work by changing the options in about:config, but
normal users would probably appreciate using a preferences dialog.
