Thunderbird theme gets added to Firefox not Thunderbird when using Firefox on Mozilla's addon/theme website.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.12; rv:56.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/56.0
Build ID: 20170617030206

Steps to reproduce:

I went to both of the following sites using Firefox and clicked on the add button of the Thunderbird theme suggestions. https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/themes/?src=thunderbird 

And on this website I clicked on the "Add to Thunderbird" button.
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/ladybug_red/

Here are the details of the Thunderbird install I have:
    Name: Thunderbird
    Version: 54.0b3
    Build ID: 20170531163242
    Update History: Show Update History
    Update Channel: beta
    User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.12; rv:54.0) Gecko/20100101 Thunderbird/54.0
    OS: Darwin 16.6.0

Here's the details of the Firefox install I have, in case it is relevant:

Name: Firefox
Version: 56.0a1
Build ID: 20170617030206
Update Channel: nightly
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.12; rv:56.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/56.0
OS: Darwin 16.6.0
Multiprocess Windows: 1/1 (Enabled by default)
Google Key: Found
Mozilla Location Service Key: Found
Safe Mode: true

Both Thunderbird and Firefox were running with addons disabled.


Actual results:

The theme gets installed on Firefox, not Thunderbird.



Expected results:

The selected new theme should have been added to my Thunderbird app but was added to Firefox.
