Quite often - at least once a week - I notice that Firefox is no longer accepting the correct spelling of words such as "colour" and "practise".  Invariably, the problem is that the language has reverted to "English / United States", and the "English / United Kingdom" dictionary is not only unselected but completely missing from the context (sub)menu, as well as from the list of installed extensions.

I have never knowingly removed this dictionary.  I have, however, had to reinstall it (and restart Firefox) dozens of times.

I also have the "English / Canada" dictionary installed; it doesn't disappear, but I only tend to use it when the UK dictionary has disappeared and I need to finish spell-checking a form before submitting it (and don't want to lose my form entries by restarting Firefox).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install "English / United Kindgom" dictionary.
2. Restart Firefox.
3. Select dictionary.
4. Wait a few days/weeks.
Actual Results:  
Dictionary selection is "English / United States", and that UK dictionary is completely missing from list of extensions.

Expected Results:  
Expect dictionary to remain "English / United Kingdom" until I chose otherwise.
