I submitted a comment on this page on the 24th.  I have cleared the cache and browsing history twice and restarted the PC. Whenever I access the page it show my comment and "Your comment is awaiting moderation", and the form I filled out.  The form contains my name and email address but nothing else.

When I access the same page with Netscape 9 & IE, the comment and form don't appear.  They shouldn't.  Firefox keeps loading an out-of-date, unrefreshed page.  What do I do?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.clear cache & browsing history
2.restart PC
3.type in URL
4) hit <enter>
Actual Results:
