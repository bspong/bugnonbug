Confirmation dialogs unresponsive
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:35.0a1) Gecko/35.0a1 Firefox/35.0a1

Steps to reproduce:

A1. Navigate to http://user@example.com
A2. A confirmation dialog pops up ("You are about to log in to the site "example.com" with the username "user", but the website does not require authentication. This may be an attempt to trick you. Is "example.com" the site you want to visit?")
A3. Click "Yes"

OR

B1. Enable E10S
B2. Uncheck "Enable E10S (multi-process)" in preferences
B3. A confirmation dialog pops up, asking to restart firefox for changes to take effect
B4. Click "Yes"

In both cases, clicking "Cancel" or "No" dismisses the prompt as expected.

Probably happens with other builtin confirmation dialogs too. Javascript confirm() works as expected.


Actual results:

A. Nothing happens, dialog stays open.

B. Nothing happens, dialog stays open. If cancel is clicked, E10S checkbox reverts to enabled state, preventing user from disabling E10S unless disabled via about:config




Expected results:

A. Dialog should close, browser should navigate to the given address

B. Dialog should close, E10S should become disabled, browser should restart.
