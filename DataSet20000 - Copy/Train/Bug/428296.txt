As I go through CSS files working on my theme, I have discovered that the same CSS instructions for the same bookmark objects show up in multiple CSS files and that bookmark panel specific style instructions are scattered across three stylesheets.

For instance there is a expander.css for expander buttons, but the same CSS instructions for expanders is actually contained in both the editBookmarkOverlay.css and organizer.css files instead of expander.css.

In another example, I have found CSS instructions for IDs that start with #editBookmarkPanel in the browser.css and editBookmarkOverlay.css files.

For the sake of cleaning things up and making theme maintenance easier for Firefox developers and theme developers this type of duplication needs to be eliminated.  All expander specific CSS instructions should be maintained in the expander.css file and all instructions for IDs that start with #editBookmarkPanel should be maintained in the editBookmarkOverlay.css.

Reproducible: Always
