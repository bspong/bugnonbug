i have ubuntu 5.10, sun jdk 1.5.0_06 on a pentium m laptop. when i use firefox 1.5.0.1 and azureus 2.4.0.2 simultaneously, the laptop becomes not-responding after maybe 10-20 minutes. and then heavy hard disk activity starts as the laptop becomes not-responding. the mouse hardly moves and ctrl+alt+backspace doesnt work. after maybe 3-5 minutes, both firefox and azureus exit and the laptop becomes  normally-responding again, or none at all and i have to turn the laptop off and on. i have observed this more frequently when there were many tabs open at firefox, and each tab has some web page with multimedia content like videos/music. when using only firefox or only azureus, everything is fine; even when azureus & firefox with a few tabs of simple web pages. it may be something with java. (my firefox has plugins for java, pdf, flash, multimedia(mplayer)).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start azureus
2.start firefox and open 10+ tabs with web pages containing multimedia
3.in about 10 minutes, laptop becomes not-responding, 3-5 minutes later azureus and firefox exit
