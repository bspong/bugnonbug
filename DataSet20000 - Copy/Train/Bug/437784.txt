When you save an html page with "File/Save As", a folder which name is "name-of-the-page_files" is created (name-of-the-page_fichiers in french). If you perform a "File/Save As" again, an error message box is raised specifying an "unknown error". In french : "Le téléchargement ne peut pas être enregistré car une erreur inconnue est survenue. Veuillez essayer de nouveau."


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a very simple html file with a single "img" element to display a valid picture.
2. Perform a "File/Save As". Wait for saving completion.
3. Perform "File/Save As" again to overwrite the previous local file and folder.
Actual Results:  
An error message box is raised telling that an unknown error is raised.


Expected Results:  
No error message and the saved html is consistent with what Firefox displays.

It seems that a content is actually saved but it looks like any content created after the page was loaded (through javascript) is not saved.

I found the bug with a simple local javascript application I wrote to manage a list of items. It consists in a page I regulary modify with the help of javascript+dom functions. I cannot overwrite my previous page anymore with Firefox 3 with my new updated page.

Worked fine on Firefox 2.
