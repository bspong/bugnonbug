when changing character encoding to central European ISO 8859-2 in order have a web page display properly, it looks great, but as soon as I go to another page, it defaults back to unicode or some other which requires me to change the character encoding again.  Is there no way to default the character encoding to what I need in order to view pages on the web?  The two web pages that don't display properly are the weather channel and accuweather. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to weather.com
2.text runs altogether
3.change character encoding from whatever it is to Central European
Actual Results:  
text is displayed properly

Expected Results:  
I should be able to default the character encoding for web pages that don't display properly and have Firefox remember

very annoying to have to change the character encoding every time I visit a page.  I understand that firefox 2 did not have this problem.  Firefox two remembered the setting. I even tried to find firefox two to download so I wouldn't have this annoying problem.
