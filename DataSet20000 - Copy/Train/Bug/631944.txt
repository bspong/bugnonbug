A spurious horizontal line is draw through the buttons of
forms with sites such as gmail, when using Firefox custom
color schemes:

Note that the buttons now have a line drawn through them,
as though the text has been struck-through.

I've seen something similar with mail.yahoo.com.

This is a fresh profile, with no other customizations.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new firefox profile.

2. Go to gmail.com and log-in.

3. Edit-Preferences-Content-Colors
   Change text to light green
   Change background to black
   Change links to light purple
   Change followed links to light maroon

4. Uncheck the "Let sites choose their own colors" box.

Actual Results:  
Immediately, without re-loading the page the problem with the
"strike-through" horizontal lines should appear.


Expected Results:  
Text colors should change, button colors (probably) should change, but no horizontal line should appear written through the button text.
