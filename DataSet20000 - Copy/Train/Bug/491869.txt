[this problem isn't new, and I'm almost sure this is a duplicate, but I can't find a matching bug report]

The open/download dialog tries to display a "user friendly" description of the file type instead of the content-type. If the content-type isn't known it tries to guess from the URL. This leads to very unhelpful and confusing messages like 
"which is a: CGI file", or, as shown in the attached screen shot, "which is a: PDF file", when the content-type is actually "application/octet-stream". Since the actual content-type isn't shown, the user has no idea why the browser chooses an inappropriate helper application (gvim instead of a PDF viewer in the example), and even worse, may change the helper application for the (invisible) content-type and then be surprised that the other file type stops working.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
The dialog should show the content-type, not some guess. It may show a user-friendly description *in* *addition* to the content-type (e.g., something like "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument (MS Word 2007 File)", but the content-type is important and must not be hidden.
