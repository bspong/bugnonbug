Web Console can cause scripts in the page to throw
STR:

0. Make sure you have the Error console enabled. (about:config#devtools.errorconsole.enabled)

1. Open the Error console.
2. Open www.robodesign.ro.
Notice no errors are shown, nothing is broken.

3. Open the Web Console.
4. Refresh the page (F5 or whatever).
Notice all network requests are nicely logged by the Web Console. Also, no exceptions are shown in the Error console, nothing bad.

5. Press F5 and quickly press Ctrl-Shift-K (the shortcut to toggle the Web Console), hold the keys down or press them as fast as you can while the page loads. Rinse and repeat this step a few times (the refresh and quick toggling of the Web Console).

Expected result: the web page loads nicely while the Web Console opens and closes like a beserk.

Actual result: the Error console shows:

Error: Cannot get outputNode by id
Source File: resource://gre/modules/HUDService.jsm
Line: 4621

Error: myAddEvent is not a function
Source File: http://www.robodesign.ro/js/index.js
Line: 1446

The first error is clear: it comes from the window.onerror handler of the HUDService which is not removed and which tries to show exceptions in the Web Console which is not open. This is bug 597136.

The second error is the point of this report: myAddEvent is not a function?? If you look in the JavaScript file, it's always defined. Why does it break now? Why does the code throw?

I once got google-analytics.com/ga.js to throw: Math.random is not a function (or undefined, I can't remember exactly, seen this only once). Weird.
