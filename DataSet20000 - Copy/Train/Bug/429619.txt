Before newest release, 2.0.0.14, I had yahoo toolbar, google toolbar, megaupload toolbar and foxy tunes add-on, now I have nothing of it.Unsuccessfully tried to reinstall them. When I uninstall them, message appears that next time I restart firefox they will be no more in list. But, after restart I go again to extension manager, they are still there, cannot reinstall when I download them again, don`t show up in View/Toolbars, and even I uninstalled them from PC (CP/Prog&feat./any toolbar). I repeat, it happened last night when I upgraded from 2.0.0.13 to 2.0.0.14. I am afraid of losing passwords.
