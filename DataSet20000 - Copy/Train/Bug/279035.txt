The canonizeUrl() function in browser.js is responsible for automatically adding
the "http://" prefix and ".com", ".net", or ".org" suffixes to what is typed in
the Location bar, depending on what keyboard shortcut is used. This is useless,
however, when the user wishes to also enter some subdirectory or specify a
remote file for viewing (e.g., "google/scholar" + Ctrl + Enter should generate
"www.google.com/scholar" [subdirectory], and "google/images/logo.gif" + Ctrl +
Enter should generate "http://www.google.com/images/logo.gif").

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type in an domain name without its accompanying "http://www." prefix or
".com" suffix, followed by a slash and a directory name or file 
2. Hit CTRL + Enter

Actual Results:  
The resulting URL has its ".com" suffix appended after the directory name or
file, ont before

Expected Results:  
The resulting URL should have its ".com" suffix placed before the first slash
and the directory name or file
