Taskbar previews disappear and reappear

When using Firefox 3.6 Beta 3 (no specific website), it will randomly freeze (spinning blue ring).  I have used about:config to enable Windows 7 Taskbar Previews.  Initially, they work (after launch).  However, one the browser freezes the Firefox icon in the taskbar collapses into a single icon and the preview only shows the browser window.  When the browser freezes again (it just did), the browser icon in the taskbar will "un-collapse" back into its tabs.  This alternating pattern continues ad-naseum.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox 3.6 B3
2. Use the internet
3. Wait for the browser to freeze, note state of taskbar icon (should have working taskbar previews)
4. Wait for the browser to freeze again and note state of taskbar icon (now it will have a single icon)
Actual Results:  
Browser temporarily freezes and the taskbar previews collapse into a single icon.

Expected Results:  
Not freeze, and the taskbar previews should work.
