Actual Results:  
Get popup warnings/confirmations, see details

Expected Results:  
User should not be prompted for information.

I believe it is a bug to have warning message boxes, after all warnings have been disabled by the user.  These are usability issues that detract from an otherwise excellent product.

If a browser advertises a pop up blocker, it should not cause them itself, especially if the user chooses to turn them off.

If user requests a page refresh, he should not be asked "are you sure".
