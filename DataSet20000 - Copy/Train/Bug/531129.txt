I took down DAO (which I thought to be a totally Unrelated program)FF CRASHED IMMEDIATELY! When I tried to bring FF back up; it took SEVERAL times clicking on its icon. Brought a couple of EXTRA windows each displayed only 1 tab stating (untitled); finally it brings up the 'restore session' window/tab (which is ALWAYS 'THIS IS EMBARRASSING... -NEVER just restores). I keeps bringing up a long ago discarded tab: igoogle "http://www.google.com/ig?refresh=1" which hangs up the entire FF restore and always displays "Warning: Unresponsive Script" I always check the box "Don't ask again"; then click the "stop script" button but it continues to re-appear until I can race it to take down the page YET AGAIN AND AGAIN! That's why it was removed from being 'UP' many, many months ago. Why does it keep coming back after taking it down over and over again? Is there a way to blacklist the page?

Reproducible: Didn't try

Actual Results:  
same as details, but I finally get it back up and running like it should and always should --after losing about 30 minutes EACH time!

Expected Results:  
I expect it NOT TO CRASH when I take an unrelated program down. I expect stability --not to crash and take unnecessary time to recover -to get you back to where you were Before CRASHING
