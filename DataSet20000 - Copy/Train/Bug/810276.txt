Firefox intermittently crashes when portfolio and or intra day charts in Barcharts.com automatically updates
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:16.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/16.0
Build ID: 20121024073032

Steps to reproduce:

This problem began after I upgraded from version 13. When Firefox 15 loads I have 11 tabs open. I get intermittent crashes during the day whether I'm using Firefox or not. It does not seem to make any difference having more or less tabs or windows open. I've isolated the problem to my barchart.com tabs. Barchart.com refreshes the charts every few minutes and the portfolio every few seconds in the background. Once I remove those tabs and load them in IE 8 instead, Firefox is stable. IE is not affected. I also have a portfolio at finance.yahoo.com that streams quotes only when the page is active. That is not causing a problem.

I had tweaked the config file to increase the number of requests from 4 to 100. I changed "network.http.pipelining.maxrequests" & set “network.http.pipelining” to “true”. I backed it down to 20. No change.


Actual results:

You may be able to replicate the chart behavior by loading the links below. The portfolio behavior (if it is a factor) will require that you set up a free account and establish a portfolio. I'm watching about 30 symbols.
