Accessibility issues on Show Cookies dialog
Test environment:
   Windows XP, Firefox 2 (Bon Echo) build 20060802, Inspect Objects
   Optional: screen reader (JAWS 7.1 or Window-Eyes 5.5M (latest beta))

Description: 
Accessibility issues found in the Show Cookies dialog, found on the "Privacy" tab of the Tools-Options dialog.
1. Missing MSAA Name property for all cookie properties

Steps to recreate:
1. Open Tools-Options dialog (press Alt+T, then "O")
2. Select the "Privacy" page  (Press Tab or Shift+Tab until focus is on one of the icons at the top of the page, then press Right Arrow or Left Arrow until "Privacy" is selected.)
3. Press Tab to move focus to the "Show Cookies..." button in the Cookies section.
4. Press Spacebar to open the Cookies window. 
5. Tab to the list of cookies press arrow keys to select a cookie in the list.  (This assumes you have cookies stored on your system.)
6. Press Tab to move to the cookie properties (Name, Content, Domain, Path, etc.)
7. Note the Inspect Objects output for each of the properties: The MSAA Name = "" (null).  Each property should contain a meaningful label.  The Name property should be the same as the field label, i.e., "Name", "Content", "Domain", "Path", "Send For", and "Expires".
8. If running JAWS screen reader, note JAWS does not read the label.

Expected results:
1. The MSAA Name property should be set for all User Interface elements.
