on www.flasmar.com, main page, the short tittles of Featured products move right and description moves on top of where tittle should be. You can check easily the different behaviour on short names (as Hornet, RKB R2, Neo or Sirius) with the other longer name products. 
On previous versions of Firefox or on IE8 it shows correctly, so there is something you changed from 3.5.0

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. type www.flasmar.com
2. see the difference on Featured Products on short name ones and long name ones
3. as they are random, if any short shown please press F5
Actual Results:  
The long names products are shown correct, short names products move tittle right and description moves up till tittle level

Expected Results:  
Show all of them as long names ones.

I have tried on 4 different computers, and this just happens with Firefox version 3.5.0 and 3.5.1
With previous version of Firefox or IE8 it shows correctly so you can compare.
