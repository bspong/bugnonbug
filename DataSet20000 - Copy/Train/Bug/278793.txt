unable to navigate firefox browser on any web site
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: firefox 1.0

When using mozilla firefox 1.0 as browser, response to cursor, text input, 
scrolling and "general navigation" (not specific to a particular site or 
function) is very slow, or freezes and IE task bar indicates that program is 
not responding. uninstalled and reinstalled program, both through mozill.org, 
and zdnetdownloads, still same problem.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open firefox
2.attempt to scroll, click on link, or type in text on any website 
(mozilla.org, amazon.com, etc)
3.

Actual Results:  
After approx 30 sec.of navigation, program does not respond to mouse or 
keyboard for at least 60-90 sec., then unfreezes, then pattern repeats again 
within a few seconds of the next attempt at navigation.  

Expected Results:  
Normal navigation

I have found similar bugs after doing bug search, but nothing matching this 
exactly.  I am running Intel pentium 4 processor, windows XP pro,dsl 
connection, just reformatted harddrive. No problems navigating using IE as 
browser. Firefox was faster (although still a bit slower than other browser)
when running windows 98 on a 2 pentium w/dsl). I have not downloaded any of the 
firefox extensions, using just the basic firefox 1.0.
