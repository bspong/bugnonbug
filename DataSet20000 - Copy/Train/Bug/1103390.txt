Developer Edition theme in Nightly has more padding on standard buttons than on aurora/devedition; want developer edition buttons to be just as tall as search/url field
The Developer Edition Theme in Nightly is a bit inconsistent with the Developer Edition Theme in the actual Developer Edition browser. By inconsistent, I mean to say that the standard actions buttons next to the URL bar have more padding on them when compared to the Developer Edition browser. Example buttons are the bookmark button, sync button, home page button, etc. This causes Nightly to take up more vertical space than the Developer Edition version.

Here are two photos to illustrate the differences.

Notice how the Nightly version's buttons have more padding, which results in more vertical space being taken up by the browser. I suspect this was just not noticed, as the URL bar takes up the same space in both browsers, but the buttons next to it were overlooked.

The buttons in the Nightly version of the Developer Edition Theme should take up the same vertical space as the URL bar, otherwise the UI looks inconsistent.
