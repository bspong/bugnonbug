Firefox froze after a uploading a photo immediately following Firefox update instigated by user (me) via browser help tab.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.12) Gecko/2009070611 Firefox/3.0;MEGAUPLOAD 1.0 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.12) Gecko/2009070611 Firefox/3.0;MEGAUPLOAD 1.0 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Was uploading a profile photo right after I restarted when I checked for Firefox update from Firefox's browser tool bar I have on additional tool-bars by my own design.

Site did wish to access my email account, Google blocked by my instruction.

To be accurate, I had to terminate Firefox in the processes list via the task manager. No window, no response running at 175,000 K of memory usage (I have 2.5 GB RAM).

Currently running at 110,380.

Firefox became Ice-sloth.

(Sorry, a little humor helps lighten the serious)
