Subject: [Tilesathome] Osmarender strength points?
Hi to all :)

You know, I love Osmarender/Tiles@Home, having worked with them for Osmarender Frontend during SoC08, doing MyTaH Firefox extension and now beginning to develop a or/p porting in JavaScript (or/js, not yet completed and with many bugs to fix :), but live example can be found here[0], Firefox 3.0 required... thanks thousands times to Frederik for guidance :)), to verify if, also thanks to TraceMonkey, the new JS engine Firefox 3.5 will have, we can achieve faster rendering times in the browser beyond the XSLT.

What I was trying to figure out is, beyond my own love :), what are the reasons why an user should choose Osmarender, for example, to browse the slippy map. Mapnik maps, e.g., are objectively more eye pleasing and (even if it needs a whole infrastructure to have it working) way faster to render.

So, what I would like to point out and ask the mailing list for opinions is: which are the _real_ strength points we have "against" Mapnik? What we can do to "advertise" Osmarender better and what can we do to expose cool opportunities with it?

What I would like (or would have liked) to do, with Osmafrontend and or/js, is to show that one of the strength points is that Osmarender can do, for example, live rendering in a browser without any infrastructure, and this should be before or then in some way evident in the web site, or at least it can be a starting point for this discussion and/or further/new development, if someone wants to join :)

Cheers,
Mario Ferraro
