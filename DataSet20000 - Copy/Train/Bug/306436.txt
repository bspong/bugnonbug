I visited www.ati.com and got garbage displayed. See screenshot.

Cause : FF uses UTF-16 instead of correct ISO-8859-1 encoding.

I remember the same happening with certain gigabyte sites a while ago.

I tried to open the URL in a new tab, in a new window, in a tab that was showing
some other page. I all cases the page was displayed wrong. I all case I entered
the URL manually into the URL bar.
Then I went to google, searched for "ati", clicked the first result
<http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=1&q=http://www.ati.com/&e=9797> and it was
shown correctly!

Details:

encoding used by FF : URF-16 Little Endian
encoding used by page : ISO-8859-1
FF autodetect option : OFF
