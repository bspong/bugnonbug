Firefox 32 Only - Permission denied to access property '_wrapped'
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/38.0.2125.101 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

1. Go to www.walmart.com
2. user Selenium (latest) webdriver to access the site.
3. as soon as you try to locate any element using selenium webdriver using following api : browser.driver.findElement(by.css('a.logo')); , you will see the error : 
Permission denied to access property '_wrapped'.    (If you open the site manually in browser, it opens fine)

4. I have tried to locate different elements using css selectors and xpath and I keep getting same results.

5. I downgraded my Firefox to 31 and the same execution from Selenium webdriver worked fine. 



Actual results:

When firefox was upgraded to 32, we started seeing this error when running our tests from selenium webdriver version 2.43 :
