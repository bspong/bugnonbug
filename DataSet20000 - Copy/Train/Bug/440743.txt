Cannot login to Yahoo Sponsored Search accounts on FF 3.0. Other browsers are able to login with same username/password

I downlaoded FF 3.0 on 6/18/08.
Prior to downloading 3.0, I was able to login to Yahoo Sponsored Search accounts on the previous version of FF.
After downloading 3.0, when using the same valid username & password, I am receiving an error msg: "Invalid username or password. Please try again."

I have also doubled checked Yahoo to make sure their system is not down and unable to recognize logins at this time.
I was able to login on Safari and IE with the same exact username and password.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to https://marketingsolutions.login.yahoo.com/adui/signin/displaySignin.do?
2.Enter a valid username and password for Yahoo Sponsored Search account
3.Click Login
Actual Results:  
Error message show up in the login area: "Invalid username or password. Please try again."


Expected Results:  
Get into the yahoo account as usual and load the dashboard.

I am not using any themes.

I do have multiple tabs open (about 6), but this never causes secured site login issues in prior versions of FF.
