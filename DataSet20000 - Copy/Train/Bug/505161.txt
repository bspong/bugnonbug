"st" pop up application, octet-stream pops up in Yahoo mail each page after log in.

Every time I open my yahoo accounts in Mozilla Firefox and then each email I go to open (well, each new page in the account), I get an annoying pop-up box saying "You have chosen to open st which is an application/octet-stream from ad.yieldmanager.com" and it has to be closed 4 or 5 times at once. I'm not about to "Open with" or "Save file" but it is on every next page so it's hard to ignore. It's only my yahoo accounts that it appears on and only in Firefox. I've done spybot scans and virus scans but it just keeps coming up. Any suggestion as to what can be done about it would be greatly appreciated.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Mozilla Firefox
2.Log in to Yahoo
3.Go to mail
Actual Results:  
Several copies of the pop up box appear, at every page I turn to in my yahoo account.

Expected Results:  
No pop up box at all.

I can't tell if it's Firefox or Yahoo that the pop ups are attached to but it doesn't happen to my Yahoo in Opera.
