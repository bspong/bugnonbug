Cannot compile Firefox with Clang: hidden symbol `_Unwind_Backtrace' isn't defined
It seems like I can't build Firefox anymore with Clang. The build failure I get is:

../../xpcom/base/nsStackWalk.o: In function `NS_StackWalk':
/home/decoder/LangFuzz/mozilla-central-llvm/xpcom/base/nsStackWalk.cpp:1647: undefined reference to `_Unwind_Backtrace'
../../xpcom/base/nsStackWalk.o: In function `unwind_callback':
/home/decoder/LangFuzz/mozilla-central-llvm/xpcom/base/nsStackWalk.cpp:1624: undefined reference to `_Unwind_GetIP'
/usr/bin/ld.bfd.real: libxul.so: hidden symbol `_Unwind_Backtrace' isn't defined
/usr/bin/ld.bfd.real: final link failed: Bad value
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
make[5]: *** [libxul.so] Error 1


This seems to be related to this bug landing:

Clang is a dependency of many static instrumentation tools (the most important one being address sanitizer), so it would be good if this could get fixed so I can continue working on Firefox+Asan.
