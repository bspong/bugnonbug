DOMCharacterDataModified is not fired correctly in DesignMode with consecutive spaces

enable designMode for an iFrame. When type in two consecutive spaces, for example "ab  ", the first and second space generates lots of DOMCharacterDataModified events inserting and deleting spaces (with #160 or &nbsp; character).

However, when typing in a letter after those two consecutive spaces, for example, "ab  c", the only event that is fired is removing the consecutive spaces (replace "ab__ " by "ab", where _ stands for &nbsp;). It seems that only the last event of the adjusting sequence is fired.

It should be consistent, either fire the white space adjusting sequence in all cases or don't fire at all. 

Or maybe I'm missing something here? thanks

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.enable designMode for an iFrame
2.type in a few letter and two consecutive spaces, the first and second spaces should fire a lot of DOMCharacterDataModified events, showing the white space adjusting sequence (I think only the final event should be fired as it's the only event that matters)
3.type in a letter after the two spaces, the only event that fire is DOMCharacterDataModified, which is removing two &nbsp; and a space from that whole text, while the whole action is inserting another letter.


Expected Results:  
fire all or don't fire any of the white space adjusting sequence
