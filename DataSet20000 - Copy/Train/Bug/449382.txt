Firefox hangs when tries to save a file on a not-connected network share
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30)

I have two computers, one of them is my "downloader" machine and torrent files are saved always in a folder there. When I click to download if the network share is connected the "save as" screen appears within 3 secs. if the network share is not connected (that is, after a reboot) firefox hangs for 5' more or less.
If I realize the problem and connect the share (that is, give the user and passwd to Windows through explorer.exe) the "save as" screen suddenly appears.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a network share on other computer (I have \\destination-computer\c$ on M:)
2.Save some files from the internet (but not directly in M: but in M:\folder) until you click and firefox goes directly to your share
3.Reboot the computer (the source) and try to save some file from the net.
Actual Results:  
Firefox freezes until it can display the "password" screen or you reconnect through explorer and put the password.

Expected Results:  
Should be faster asking for the remote share user and password, or at least not freeze
