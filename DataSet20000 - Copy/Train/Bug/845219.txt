HTTPS not working properly with Outlook.
I believe this first started happening about a week ago using Firefox 18.0.2. I waited for Firefox 19 and the issue still exists. 

I went to sign in to https://outlook.com and I noticed that it stays on HTTPS "Connection Encrypted: High-grade Encryption (AES-128, 128 bit keys)" for a few seconds then changes to "Connection Partially Encrypted". Usually it stays on HTTPS "Connection Encrypted: High-grade Encryption (AES-128, 128 bit keys)". 

I tried removing history and cookies and it stays on HTTPS "Connection Encrypted: High-grade Encryption (AES-128, 128 bit keys)" for one sign in but when you log-out and sign in again at any time the same thing happens until you remove history and cookies again.

I also tried a nightly build of Firefox 22, running Firefox 19 in safe mode, reinstalling Firefox 19 and making a new Firefox profile, different email accounts and on another computer running Firefox 19 and Windows 7. I can't rectify the issue on the same Windows 8 PC using IE.

My email account is set to "Always use HTTPS when I sign in to Hotmail". I have asked a Microsoft rep and they said they can't see any issue.

At the moment I'm using Outlook as a app tab so it stays on HTTPS "Connection Encrypted: High-grade Encryption (AES-128, 128 bit keys)".
