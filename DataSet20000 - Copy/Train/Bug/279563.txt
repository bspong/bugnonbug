After hiding Firefox and I want to come back by clicking on the icon in the Dock, Firefox hangs forever with a spinning wheel.

100% reproducable on  Mac OS X 10.3.7 and earlier, Powerbook 800 MHz. Search for
any band or musician, all displayed pages seem to have this behaviour. I tried
as well Mozilla (I switched to Firefox and had Mozilla still installed) which
has the same behaviour. 
As the site looks beautiful when online, but the saved offline pages look
terrible, it might as well be very bad site programming, though firefox should
not cease working ;-)
Good luck and thanks a lot for your excelent work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.allmusic.com/
2. Type in a search for example 'Genesis'
3. Choose one of the discs
4. Hide Firefox and switch to ITunes for example.
5. Return to Firefox and watch the spinning wheel (in my case forever)
6. Force quit to become happy again ;-)

Actual Results:  
The spinning wheel would stay on for at least one hour (never tried longer
though ;-)

Expected Results:  
Just come back to the page I've seen before
