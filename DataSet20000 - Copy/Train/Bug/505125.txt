With multiple Tabs open Firefox stops responding at some point, unpredictable when
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1

Have seen multiple times since upgrading to 3.5.1 where I'll have several Tabs open and then Firefox stops responding and nothing I do can get it working again short of going into Task Manager, and then trying to kill it causes it to spawn new processes, and it takes many attempt to finally get it to kill it. Re-opening Firefox gives me the pop up window asking if I want to restore all previous windows and saying yes will restart everything and it will all work for a while and then just stop responding. It has also done this on occasion when the PC has been hibernating, though it isn't consistent. Before 3.5.1 I wasn't seeing this kind of activity. It is not something that happens when I go to a particular website, it just seems random, though almost always happens at some point when I have 4 or more Tabs open. I have 4 gigs of memory and typically may only have Thunderbird running as well. I use AVG Anti-Virus and Zone Alarm, and am on a wireless connection with a Buffalo router.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just opening up at least 4-5 Tabs will cause it to happen
2.
3.
