Problems has happened twice now, seemingly random. All of a sudden, each keystroke produces double text output. For example, typing "car" will produce "ccaarr". I'm working with a MBP 2.0GHz with 2GB RAM, and the version of Bon Echo 2.0a2 listed above. Mac OSX 10.4.6, all updates current.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type in text box (I've seen it in forum reply and username/password fields)
2.Each keystroke produces double output
3.

Actual Results:  
Each keystroke doubled

Expected Results:  
Keystrokes should produce normal, single output

I've just been using this version for a short time; I've come across this issue twice now in two days. Seemingly random. 1st time was logging in to community college e-resources site. User-name and password fields produced double text output. Same thing tonight attempting to reply to a post in the Camino forum at Mozillazine. Closing the affected window and opening a new one makes the issue disappear.
