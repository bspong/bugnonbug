[10.4] Browser chrome missing metal-style bezel on Tiger

Tiger's dark gradient metal style differs from later OS X versions in that it has a slight bezel running around the top and sides of the window. However, Firefox uses the Leopard/Snow Leo style which is missing this element.

This means that, application-wide, the titlebar containing the bezel joins the rest of the chrome which doesn't have it and the visual styles clash.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run on Mac OS X 10.4, or:
2. disable the NSUseLeopardWindowValues global preference on 10.5 and run Firefox;
3. disable the NSUseLeopardWindowValues and AppleUseCoreUI global preferences on 10.6 and run Firefox.
Actual Results:  
The titlebar has a distinct native visual style as opposed to the rest of the window which looks like it came from Leopard, creating an ugly result which is especially noticeable on the Add-ons and Preferences windows.

Expected Results:  
A different style titlebar that matches the rest of the window (like Safari), or a Tiger style on -moz-mac-unified-toolbar (which causes the issue on all themes that use it) and the rest of the theme elements.

The issue occurs on all windows with a metal style, as long as the theme uses -moz-mac-unified-toolbar and disregards the bezel on the rest of the elements.
