Dialog Buttons and Mouse Wheel taking a long time

Clicking on buttons to close/confirm dialog boxes takes 5-10 seconds for them to
actually close. The button still "clicks" after the first time.

Apparently related issue: Scrolling via the mouse wheel or keyboard works fine
once per web page, then does the same as above. Takes 5-10 seconds, then
performs its action. If you throw more movement in while it's waiting, it will
do all at once, though it doesn't seem to affect the time it takes. Very jerky
as well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any dialog box. (About will work.)
2. Click close.
3. Sit for 5-10 seconds while it makes up its bloody mind.

1. Scroll with keyboard.
2. Scroll again.
3. Sit and wait.

Actual Results:  
Dialog closed, eventually, but after a much longer wait than normal. Or screen
scrolled.

Expected Results:  
Closed immediately.

Right now, I'm only sure this is happening with Win2k Advanced Server. I only
used this build for a few minutes in Professional, so I can't remember if any of
this occured.
