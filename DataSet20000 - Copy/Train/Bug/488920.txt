crashes linux gdm if you click the source link with out greasemonkey installed.

I was following a link for a review about a greasemonkey script (googlefx) and thought that the source link would show the source not try to install it (what I believe it tried to do). When I clicked the link instant crash of the gnome display manager, as if I had pressed Ctrl+Alt+Backspace. If you open the javascript file directly it does not crash. I knew I did not have greasemonkey installed and was only interested in seeing the javascript code. I have only tried this twice with the source link for the googlefx script, as this seems to be a major security risk, so it may well happen with other greasemonkey script links.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open userscripts.org page 'http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/31950'
2.click the source link 'http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/31950'
3.watch it crash!
Actual Results:  
When I clicked the link instant crash of the gnome display manager, as if I had pressed Ctrl+Alt+Backspace. Then brought to a login screen.

Expected Results:  
If the script was trying to install a greasemonkey script with out greasemonkey installed it should have failed gracefully. As greasemonkey is not installed it is up to firefox to handle this, and is not a problem with greasemonkey!

The strange thing is I use noscript and this site was not allowed to execute javascript. The site was completely blocked and not just partially.

The actual greasemonkey script location is 'http://userscripts.org/scripts/source/31950.user.js'

P.S. I HAVE FLAME RESISTANCE->
I knew I did not have greasemonkey installed and was only interested in seeing the javascript code.
