the installer gets stuck with the following error.. i created this installer from the source which is compiled locally on my machine.. i created the installer by issuing the command make installer in browser/installer/windows/ directory.. and the make says that it has created the installer and placed in {sea/stub}.. i got a copy of the insataller from the cd directory and tried to install which gives the error mentioned above..

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.create installer by issing the command make browser/installer/windows/ installer
2.copy the installer from the sea directory located in /dist/install/
3.run the installer.. and accept either standard or custom installation.

Actual Results:

"Error occured during installation- Cross Platform COM: -322 INIT_STUB_ERROR"

Expected Results:
