I was redirected to http://yellowpages.superpages.com when I open this website
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008101315 Ubuntu/8.10 (intrepid) Firefox/3.0.3

When I opened www.kapook.com (One of the most popular website in Thailand) and clicked some links, after the page was loaded successfuly, I will be randomly redirected to http://yellowpages.superpages.com with NO REASON. I also noticed that Back button is disabled, so that I couldn't go back to the right page. 

I have tried to open this website in different platforms on different machines, and the problem occurs in all combinations. I found this problem when I not only use Firefox 3 but also Firefox 2.

I firstly think all the machines that I used might be infected by malwares or is not clean, but when I used Ubuntu Live CD, the problem still exists. 

Something became more weird when I asked my friends in Thailand if they had the same problem as mine, and they said they didn't have that problem.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://www.kapook.com
2. Click one of the six pictures located in the middle of the page (below the Flash area)
Actual Results:  
The page will be loaded, and you will be redirected to http://yellowpages.superpages.com when the page is completely loaded. Once you are redirected to superpages.com, notice that your Back button will be disabled.

Expected Results:  
I should not be redirected to another website.
