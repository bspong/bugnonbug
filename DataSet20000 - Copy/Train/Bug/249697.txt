Submit an html form which takes you to the next page, click 'back' to the page
you submitted, then click 'refresh'.  The form fields do not refresh from the
serevr even though the server sends the correct data.  Hit enter in the address
bar and the 'refresh' happens correctly.  The refresh button is broken. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Submit an html form which takes you to the next page
2.  click 'back' to the page you submitted then click 'refresh'
3. The form fields do not refresh from the serevr even though the server sends
the correct data
4.  Hit enter in the address bar and the 'refresh' happens correctly.

Actual Results:  
 The form fields do not refresh from the serevr even though the server sends the
correct data.

Expected Results:  
Repopulated the HTML form with the data from the server which is usually blank
fields.  

I think this is a huge bug.  If its nto then what is the rationale for the
refresh by hitting enter in the address bar workign correctly and the refresh
button working diffently?  Either way its confusing to a user who is trying to
refresh a page because it simply doesnt refresh the form fields like it should.
