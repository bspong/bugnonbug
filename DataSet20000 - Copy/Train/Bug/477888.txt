Security: Url blocked on SSL sites with small fixed window width
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011913 Firefox/3.0.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I'm on the Bank of America help site with live chat. Their software forces the window to be about 200px in width. As a result the Green security certificate UI on the left of the URL blocks the entire URL, so I can't see what url I'm currently visiting. Its a little scary because I can't ensure I'm still on the bankofamerica.com domain.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a valid SSL site.
2. Resize the window to 200px.

Actual Results:  
Observe the URL is blocked by the secuirty certificate name in green by the URL.

Expected Results:  
Someway to close or resize the green certificate name so I can see the url. Right now its blocked and there's no way to tell if I'm at the domain I expect. This problem is really only a problem when the website forces the window to be a fixed width and prevents resizing it.
