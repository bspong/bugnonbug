Firefox starts only if previously run in safe-mode if some extensions are enabled
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100423 Gentoo Firefox/3.6.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100423 Gentoo Firefox/3.6.3

Firefox exits with -1 exit status just after running it with no error message (before any window shows up) . 

If you run Firefox in safe-mode (clicking 'Quit' button on safe-mode menu suffices), Firefox would load normally for 1 time. After closing FF you have to pass through safe-mode to run it again.

The problem is connected with extensions, as if none are enabled it does not occure at all. Specifically this extensions (if enabled) will cause Firefox not to start at all if not run after safe-mode:
ReadItLater, CookieSafe, DownThemAll, WiredMarker (all current versions).

Any other extension other than dictionaries would cause it to happen from time to time (I have checked TabMixPlus, Zotero, FireBug, DictionaryTooltip, AdblockPlus, each installed separetly on clean profile).

All the extensions work fine, if Firefox starts - i.e. once after each safe-mode.
