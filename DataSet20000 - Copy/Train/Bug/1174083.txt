STR required b2g:

1. Flash today's (6/12) master build in a Flame device
2. In the browser app, opens appA
3. appA registers a SW
4. about:sw in b2g shows up that SW
5. Install appA
6. Open appA directly, appA registers the same SW again
7. about:sw in b2g currently (once Bug 1168226 has been landed) shows up the SWs registered at step #2 and step #4 which is the expected behavior
8. Suddenly a crash occurs

It is 100% reproducible following the steps described above

The traces appearing in the console are as follows:
I/GeckoDump( 1415): Crash reporter : Can't fetch app.reportCrashes. Exception: [Exception...
