Mozilla LOGS ME OFF consistently from AOL Mail/ GET "UNDEFINED" email addresses when using my AOL address book, thus I can not email unless I have memorized my address book
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080201 Firefox/2.0.0.12

I use AOL Mail and for the last year have been bumped off regularly with the statement  "you have been logged off".  I can not long on again unless I close down AOL entirely and log into my mail again.  I spoke with AOL regarding this problem and they ran me through HOURS of "help" and the problem they said is not with them but with Mozilla and AOL not being able to be used together.

I also daily receive an "undefined" message when trying to use my AOL address book.  When typing in a friend's name, it will not find the address but call it "undefined".  Thus I have to completley log off of AOL and log in again inorder to use my address book.  AGAIN, I spoke at Length to AOL and they told me it was connected with Mozilla and AOL not working together properly.  No solution from AOL.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log onto AOL Mail
2. Send and write emails
3.  Switch to Yahoo and then go back to check AOL mail and have been told I am logged off and need to Log in again.  
4. Can NOT log on again unless I close out of AOL mail entirely.
Actual Results:  
After closing out of AOL and connecting to Mozilla and then back into AOL, I can stay connected and use my email for another few hours.

Expected Results:  
I should NOT be logged out of AOL unless I log myself out and I should always be able to use my address book.
