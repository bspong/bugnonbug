lockup (100% CPU) running on Windows XP. It goes non-responsive when pasting text
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Getting Firefox to lockup is reproducible by the steps described herein. My CPU meter goes to 100% utilization and Firefox no longer responds to Windows commands (Minimize, Close, etc). Close causes Windows to pop-up its dialogue “No longer responding to commands. Terminate” (whatever it says).
I can reproduce at will it with gmail (mail.google.com) when composing a new email message.

It has something to with word processing documents under the format "HTML Preformatted" text. It happens from either an OpenOffice '.odt' file or a Microsoft Word '.doc' file. Firefox does not lockup when normal text is copied and pasted. It seems particular to "HTML Preformatted" text. With other text formats, it seems okay although I haven't test them all.

IE version 8, does this okay when I repeat the same steps.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. compose new email in gmail.
2. paste in "HTML Preformatted" text from OpenOffice '.odt' or Microsoft '.doc' files. <<<It HAS to be "HTML Preformatted" data.>>>
3. go to top of text body and paste it again.
Actual Results:  
Firefox application goes into hard loop. ... have to terminate the process. No lost data other than within the gmail message I am composing....

Expected Results:  
It should NOT go into a hard loop. IE Version 8 works OK with same steps.

My details described herein say exactly how to reproduce it.

To me, this is not 'Critical' (i.e. I know how to work around the problem) But the severity choices on this bug report form forces me to classify it as critical. Firefox should definitely NOT lockup.
