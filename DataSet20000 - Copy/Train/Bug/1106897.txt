Steps to reproduce:

Tried to apply a CCK2 auto configuration collection of files to the Firefox.app bundle in the locations that have worked for previous Firefox versions ie
Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/browser
Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/defaults
Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/distribution



Actual results:

These file locations no longer exist in 34.0.5.
The location of these folders has been moved from the MacOS folder to the Resources folder.
As a result, the package used to deploy CCK2 autoconfig profiles to previous versions of Firefox, does not work on v34.0.5



Expected results:

Change of internal file/folder structure noted on release notes would have been handy to know in advance. 

As shown in the screen shot attached, the previous version of firefox is on the left, the new 34.0.5 is on the right. The structure of the folders has changed. This affects tools such as the CCK2. If this change is expected behaviour, then could notes be provided alerting administrators of this change
