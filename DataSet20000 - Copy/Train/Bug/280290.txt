common web-archiving format for opensource browsers

it would be nice if a common format for archiving web-pages ( or "Save As Web
Page, Complete" ) could be used by all/most/many opensource browsers ... 

being as konqueror & mozilla/mozilla-firefox are (probably!?!) the biggest
opensource browsers their developers could encourage this by agreeing to a
simple common standard that is easy to implement for themselves & other browsers
based on the gecko or khtml engines (including safari & camino on macosx) &
other opensource browsers in general ...  

below follows a verbatim quotation of KDE bug/wish # 98043
(http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98043) which i lodged yesterday:

#### START QUOTATION ####

it would be nice if a common web-archiving format could be used by all/most/many
opensource browsers ...

currently, the default linux install of firefox version 1.0 gives the option of
Save As "Web Page, HTML Only" or Save As "Web Page, complete", the latter saving
the html as a single separate file & a directory of the same name with "_files"
appended to it, in the old microsoft windows style ... this creates a
**terrible** mess of the logic of your directory structure ... so maybe firefox
needs a web-archiving format ...

... and because it is so simple, maybe konqueror's *.war format is a good choice
... and would be eay for other browsers to implement ...

... maybe kde/konqueror developers could work with mozilla.org on this ...

... at a minimum, it would be nice for konqueror & mozilla/firefox browsers to
be able to use (ie. read/write) any formats that the other implements, now & in
the future ... and i guess any microsoft formats aswell ...

#### END QUOTATION ####

i hope this gets some consideration because, like me, i'm sure a lot of people
would find this a great convenience ...

thanks,
Simon Reid
