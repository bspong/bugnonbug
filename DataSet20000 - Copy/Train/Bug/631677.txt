Lately I've been experiencing the following problem with Firefox 4b10 when restoring an heavy session (6 windows open,each with several tabs,up to a maximum of 35 -including apptabs- in a window ,two of them with flash content) : the browser start up is painfully slow,coincidentally the response to keyboard\touchpad inputs is very sluggish and there's a huge and prolonged disk activity,spanning several minutes-in the exact same situation(i.e. exactly the same session),none of these happened before this b10 update.
In safe mode it's marginally better:less sluggish response,still very long start up time and intense disk activity.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create an heavy session,e.g. 6 windows with many tabs each,up to a maximum of 35 (apptabs included),flash content in two tabs
2.close session with File--->exit
3.Restart Firefox
Actual Results:  
Firefox starts very slowly, for several minutes response to keyboard\touchpad inputs is sluggish and noticeably delayed,during all this there is evident disk activity each time.

Expected Results:  
Start within a reasonable time frame,response to keyboard\touchpad should be immediate after start up,disk should not be writing for such a long time on each start.
