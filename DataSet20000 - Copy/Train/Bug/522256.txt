Firefox shouldn't try to authenticate without kerberos tickets when browsing smb shares
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; fr; rv:1.9.0.12) Gecko/2009071200 SUSE/3.0.12-0.1.2 Firefox/3.0.12
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; fr; rv:1.9.0.12) Gecko/2009071200 SUSE/3.0.12-0.1.2 Firefox/3.0.12

Using firefox to browse SMB share in a AD environment lock the user account, if
this user don't have kerberos tickets.

This problem happens only If there is a authentication for the share, firefox
use kerberos to authenticate, but when there is no tickets he always try to
authenticate with "null" credentials and failed without displaying any error for
user.
If this user try 5 time to access share (by only pressing F5, refresh),
he's locked by the Domain Controller.

Firefox should prevent users from trying to authenticate without tickets and
being locked, by :
 - not trying to authenticate without tickets
 - (optional) displaying warning
 - (optional) asking for login/pass (fallback in NTLM auth. mode).

Let me know if you need logs or something.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use a Linux machine (OpenSUSE, ...)
2. Join a Active Directory domain
3. Create a share with a restricted access (only for your account for example)
4. Open a session in your linux machine with your AD account
5. Open a terminal console and type "klist" to check that you have kerberos
tickets (TGT) in your cache
6. Type : "kdestroy" in your console. That should remove kerberos tickets.
5. Start Firefox
6. Browse the share (ie URL : smb://<server>/<share>)
7. nothing happens
8. Press F5 (10 times)
9. Look in your AD for the state of your account : you are locked !
Actual Results:  
The AD account is locked.

Expected Results:  
The AD account should not be locked. Firefox should prevent this by checking if there is kerberos tickets or not.
