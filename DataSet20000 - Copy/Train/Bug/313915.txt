The problem occurs when you use javascript to remove an entry in a select box that is being populated by the user. Im using it for a list of emails. When the user activates the click event it calls a javascript function that removes the selected item(email address) from the select box. The problem is that when you try to add another new entry to the select box it seems to be 'locked' meaning it wont allow a new entry. I cant show you the site but here is the delete function.

function deletesomeone()
{ 
  var theIndex = document.update_alert.emails.selectedIndex;
  var selLength = document.update_alert.emails.length;
  if(selLength>0)
  {
    document.update_alert.emails.options[theIndex] = null;
	
  }
  
}
update_alert - form , emails - select box

It does remove it but it wont let the next entry into the box. The problem doesnt exist in 1.0.4 (it works for everyone in this) but the new version will not allow the new name to be added. Ive tried many variations of this function with no success.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.build a text box for user input
2.pass a value from the textbox into a select box using javascript
3.create a button to remove the selected value from the select box
4.remove a value
5.try to add a new value

Actual Results:  
the select box cannot be added too once a value is removed without a page refresh

Expected Results:  
should have allowed a remove of an item and then allow the user to immediately input another value
