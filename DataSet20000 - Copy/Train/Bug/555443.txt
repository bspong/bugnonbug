Crash while search with google, crash while going to websites all since last update.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_2; en-us) AppleWebKit/531.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.3 Safari/531.9

Since updating all I do is crash when going to different sites-random-no pattern-seems to be working too hard-takes much longer to open websites that used to be quick, easy and smooth. It feels ragged. It crashes during goole searches as well, I can barely keep it open anymore. I reinstalled several times, I deactivtaed extra stuff- no luck. Then sometimes it might be fine for a little while. I have the most recent system software for my MAC. This never happened before I updated. It was always rock solid

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open website
2. crash
3. try again
4. crash
Actual Results:  
keep crashing, then close and open safari

Expected Results:  
Not crash, work smoothly all the time. I depend on this for my job-it's critical.
