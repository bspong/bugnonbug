Steps to reproduce:

using bookmarks to get to saved places and when that didn't work I type in the page url. this has happened on several websites. this one is using credit.ford.com. all the sites that i experience this problem with are credit sites.


Actual results:

initially the page i want shows for a second but then switches to an error page showing Error 404 with this text: 

page works fine in Safari 

Error 404--Not Found
From RFC 2068 Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1:
10.4.5 404 Not Found

The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI. No indication is given of whether the condition is temporary or permanent.

If the server does not wish to make this information available to the client, the status code 403 (Forbidden) can be used instead. The 410 (Gone) status code SHOULD be used if the server knows, through some internally configurable mechanism, that an old resource is permanently unavailable and has no forwarding address.



Expected results:

what used to happen before I did your update to 28.0 which is the page behaves as it should.
