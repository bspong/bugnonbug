the internet banking page of bank above generates the details of transmissions by database (of course). printouts are OK with all parts of the form they use but with all variable fields preview is OK while print shifts all codes by 29 positions down, e.g. code 68 (D) turns into code 39 ('). if i save the page as html and load the saved page into firefox, the reloaded page works OK.
this is replicable on 2 machines and different printers, and it does not occur with an older firefox or with internet explorer. sorry, don't know which script language the bank uses to fill out those fields.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go into internet banking
2. send money
3. print transmission (either directly or by printout routine)
Actual Results:  
All codes in variable fields in the bank's form print out garbled, i.e. converted into codes which are 29 positions down in ASCII table whereas they looked OK on screen. Saving the same printout page on disk and reloading the saved page into firefox prints OK

Expected Results:  
print the same as the preview on screen
