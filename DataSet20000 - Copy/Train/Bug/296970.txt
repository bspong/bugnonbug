Drag-and-drop of background tab changes focus
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050607 Firefox/1.0+

Using the now-built-in drag-and-drop capabilities in Firefox (see <a
href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=179656">Bug 179656 - Allow
drag-and-drop reordering of tabs</a>).  When I try to change the tab position of
a tab that is in the background, the tab is focused on mousedown (see <a
href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=295721">Bug 295721 - focused
tabs in tabbox behaviour tweaks</a>).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open www.google.com in the first tab
2. Open www.yahoo.com in a second tab
3. Focus the second tab (Yahoo).
4. Drag the first tab (Google) to a new position so that it follows the second
tab (Yahoo).

Actual Results:  
The Google tab has focus.

Expected Results:  
The Yahoo tab has focus.

I understand from the comments 5 and 6 in Bug 295721 that the mousedown focus
was the intended behavior.  However, I believe that they did not consider the
effect that this change would have on Bug 179656, and therefore I have filed
this bug to request a change.
