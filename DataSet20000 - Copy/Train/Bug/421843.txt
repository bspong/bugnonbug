Location bar and Go-Button stop responding

From time to time (meaning there does not seem to be any factor directly causing this) the address bar does not react to the enter key anymore and the go-button does not react to a click. I can still type text into the address input field and autocomplete/places still work, but I cannot actually go to any new address. 

When this problem occurs, it affects all tabs in the current window. Opening a new window fixes the problem for the new window, but not for the existing one.

This happens about once per day (with heavy Firefox use).

This problem also occurred with Firefox 2. I completely uninstalled Firefox more than once (keeping my profile directory though) and the problem persists.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
I know this doesn't help too much, but it seems like this problem occurs randomly from time to time.

Type URL into address bar
Actual Results:  
Go-Button does not respond, enter does not take you to URL.

Expected Results:  
Should load URL after pressing enter or clicking go button.
