multiple try again to get web page

Most times when I type something as simple as Mozilla Firefox into the
Google search I have to click on the try again icon on the page not found
error message, as many as five times to get the expected page to load, then
it sometimes three min. for the page to fully load.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Had older version Firefox

2.Cleaned out Avast anti virus downloaded Microsoft Essentials computer ran
very fast and presented almost every page instantly.
3.Downloaded Firefox 3.5 three days later now have to hit the try again icon on
the time out warning five times to get a web page to enter. 
Actual Results:  
Completely removed Firefox from registry and reinstalled 3.5 and now still
have the same try again page load problem as above. The contacting message
seams to go to a different server and many times a server from a different country. This has turned my high speed into slower than dial-up.  

Expected Results:  
Need a patch or instructions to get my high-speed downloads back.
