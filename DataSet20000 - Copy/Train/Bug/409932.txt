the permissions.xul needs to be redesigned to allow for modification of hosts in the tree and the permissions.js file needs a few modifications

There are many problems with the current permissions window.  Many of them are listed on the following page.

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=334363

To summarize a few of the issues:
1. It is not currently possible to click on an item in the permissions tree and then click a button to change it's capability.  At the moment users have to manually type the domain name in the url box and then click the Allow/Session/Block buttons to change it.
2. The url box needs to be changed to accept only domain names.  Perhaps changing the description and url box label would help by indicating to the user that they should enter only the domain name and not the full url.  The code used to parse the url for a domain name needs to be changed as well since it does not always retrieve a valid host name.
3. The rawHost property needs to be scrapped and the hosts need to be displayed exactly as they appear in the permissions.sqlite file.
4. There is currently no observer for 'cleared' notifications
5. There is currently no observer for 'deleted' notifications which can cause problems for users who are using an extension UI to manage the permissions.
6. There is currently no way to add a cookie permission for a file:/// url from the permissions.xul window.  Although since the scheme:file feature has been removed from the latest trunk this probably needs to be filed as a separate bug.
