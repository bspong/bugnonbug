Hello, 

i've looked in my AVAST Antivirus Programm an i see, that firefox realy reads hunderts of thousends of small files... that really bad for hardisk performance. 
I think on the low speed harddrives in notebooks... and not good against fragement building on harddisk...

why firefox doesn't store the content of the Plugin in DB like SQLlite? (for places for exampled quite fast (with my 1.400 bookmarks :-))

firefox has really many extensions i use and this slows down the starup performance extremly! (because of loading so many files, before the window is shown) 

the layout of firefox should be cached (Traybar and so on) then you could show the main window really fast, because the functions could be load later, i think firefox use late binding? 

only some minds about performance... - never forget performance is the key! :-)
