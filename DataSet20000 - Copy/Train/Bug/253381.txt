- open a website and then another website (to make sure that that the "Go back
one page"-button is enabled)

- open the history sidebar or the bookmarks sidebar

- click one sidebar item (so the sidebar item is focused. if you have opened the
boomarks sidebar please select a folder or separator because links open on
single click)

- press BACKSPACE

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:

Actual Results:  
Although the sidebar is focused, goes back to the last visited site. After this,
the website area is focused, not the sidebar anymore.

This also works for SHIFT+BACKSPACE.


(I think I remember (but I'm not sure anymore) that 0.92 final also has had a
similar problem that FastFind has worked if a sidebar item was focused. But I
can't reproduced this with current nightlies anymore.)

Expected Results:  
(SHIFT+) BACKSPACE should do nothing if a sidebar is focused and the sidebar
should keep its focus.
