A certain script sporadically causes vast memory leakage that results in Firefox crashing.

Sample Script

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/534.30 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/12.0.742.122 Safari/534.30

Steps to reproduce:

The leakage is witnessed after opening a new Firefox window, dragging the sample script from it's directory into the window, and then pressing the “Start Leak” button. Firebug is disabled, and the  leak page is the only tab open. Memory usage is monitored using Process Explorer. This is merely an artificial stress test, but when the major leakage is present, Firefox crashes without fail. 


Actual results:

While running a simple script that creates and destroys a large amount of DOM nodes, vast and somewhat runaway memory leakage is observed sporadically in Firefox 5.0.1. So far, there is no pattern recognized to definitely produce these results, but the leakage has been reproduced on different machines and has been observed many times. 

Firefox 4.0.1 and Beta 6 both show similar memory patterns, in which they typically ramp up until 600 MB and then release the memory and  stick around 120 MB (see screenshot_ff4 and screenshot_ff6). 

Generally, Firefox 5.0.1 follows the same pattern. Occasionally and intermittently, though, the memory is not released and instead of dropping off around 600 MB, it continues grow until the browser stops responding. screenshot_ff5 and 2screenshot_ff5 show two separate occasions in which the memory leakage grew past a manageable point. 

Alternate and altogether less common behavior for Firefox 4.0.1, 5.0.1, and Beta 6 is a slight spike followed by a steady, but not increasing, fluctuation between 115 and 125 MB. screenshot_alt depicts that behavior.

Finally, Firefox 3.6 behaves in a very different manner. On average, it appears to use more memory for a longer period of time, but it does not seem to leak or gradually increase the amount of memory in use. screenshot_ff3 and 2screenshot_ff3 show this behavior on two separate occasions.
