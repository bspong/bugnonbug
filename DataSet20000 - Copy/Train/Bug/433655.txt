In re to the lower part of the subject URL; reference the two weather.com boxes side-by-side; each represents one of the two domains this web host uses; both default to the link only; one should display the 300x250 weather.com graphic (with the usual content and links therein); the same page displayed with IE7 or Safari 3.1 displays the right-hand box properly; not tested on any Apple gear (sorry, don't have any yet).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open www.bfllb.org home page
2. scroll down to weather.com boxes
3. there we are
Actual Results:  
Two weather.com boxes with links to external pages are displayed.

Expected Results:  
One of the weather.com boxes should have displayed a 300x250 graphic with the usual weather info and links therein.

Everything is default Firefox 2.0.0.14 installation-wise; the only extensions are DOM Inspector (1.8.1.14) and Talkback (2.0.0.11); the theme is the default Firefox 2 theme; the only plugin is MoveNetworks Quantum Media Player (1.0) [which I don't remember installing!]. I let Firefox automatically update itself as it sees fit. I did search for "weather.com" but only results were unrelated and older.
