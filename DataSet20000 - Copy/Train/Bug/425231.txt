Firefox 2.0.0.13 hangs up/crashes when trying to open MS Word files from intranet

This just happened today for the first time after I okayed the upload to 2.0.0.13.  In order to see our intranet sites, FF automatically switches to IE engine for these bookmarks.  I have many files uploaded onto Sharepoint portals and have had no problem in the past, when I tried to open them but today, it refused.  I had to control-alt-delete shut down and then restarted FF more than 5 times and it continued to hang up for Word docs.  It opened pdfs just fine.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start program
2.open new tab
3.scroll down bookmarks to select portal
4. click on Word doc of interest
5. get hourglass and program hangs indefinitely
6. Control-alt-delete to end program
7. cycle endlessly through these steps.
Actual Results:  
FF hangs and fails to respond to any attempts to end the hangup

Expected Results:  
normally, I get a dialogue box asking if I trust opening the file from this site as some files are hazardous to my computers health etc.  I click on "open" and the document opens in MS Word with a Sharepoint connection to the storage location of the file on teh intranet

The only other thing I did after FF started up this morning and installed the 2.0.0.13 update was to uninstall Stumble as I don't really use it.  Then I restarted the program.
