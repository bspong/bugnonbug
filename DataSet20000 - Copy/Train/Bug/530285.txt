Filesaving seems to share last-saved file between profiles

This crash is present from 3.54 to Minefield, and if you have multiple installs, as per http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=1588505&start=0 on MozillaZine, and save a file in Minefield in a folder you created, then go to "Open File" in your regular Firefox installation, it opens the file/folder that was last saved in your other Firefox install/s.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Save a file using one Firefox profile - not your regular one
2. Open using the -no-remote with shortcut on desktop (Google this)
3. Then go into your normal Firefox profile
Actual Results:  
Firefox always opens the file you last saved in the other install when you go back to your regular profile.

Expected Results:  
It should recognize the file/folder saved/opened by the profile in browser.download.lastDir but has not recognized this.

I am using 3.55 and Nightly builds, and the error is prevalent to both versions.
