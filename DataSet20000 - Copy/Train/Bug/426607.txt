Firefox/Win mouse coordinates are incorrectly handled in IFRAME
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.8.1.13) Gecko/20080311 Firefox/2.0.0.13

Here is what I have in my page:

A DIV element which takes the entire page (left=0, top=0, width=100% and height=100%)
This DIV also contains the Flash outputted by the attached Flex project
The z-index of this element is 10
The Flash has wmode=transparent


Another DIV, which has the left=0, top=90px, width=100% and height=100%
This DIV contains an IFRAME (which loads a web page  e.g. http://www.google.com)
The z-index of this element is 5


The problem with this setup is that on WIN Firefox 2/3 the mouse coordinates sent from Firefox to Flash are not the right ones. Normally, the mouse coordinates Flash expects are relative to the top-left corner of the browsers view port. But when the mouse gets over the IFRAME (even if the Flash takes up the entire page  so you are still hovering the Flash component, not the IFRAME), the Firefox sends back to the Flash the mouse coordinates relative to the top-left corner of the IFRAME and not of the browsers view-port.



The result is that when expanding the color picker in the attached example, when hovering the colors from the first row (you are still hovering the Flash, and not the IFRAME) the highlighted color is the one just under your mouse pointer). But when going downwards as you start hovering the IFRAME, the X coordinate of the mouse is correct while the Y coordinate is reported as being 90px upper (90px is the same as the top property of the IFRAME). Also, the right click is displayed upper in the page when clicked over the IFRAME:
