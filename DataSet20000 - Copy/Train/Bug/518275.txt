Page elements behavior in Linux version of firefox

https://www.edline.net/Index.page - the text boxes are at different height on linux. It shows fine in windows. If you start typing in the username box on linux, you see only about 3/4 of the characters' top (you don't see the bottom of the typed character)

https://www.google.com/adsense/login/en_US/ - Google Adsense's site does not show properly on linux's firefox. Now you cannot say that this is bad coding because this is a billions $$ company and it CAN afford to hire the best web designers out there. Plus I emailed them about this issue long time ago and they don't / can't fix it.

There is probably an infinite number of websites I can list here that don't behave properly when opened via Firefox on Linux. 


Reproducible: Always




I am listing this as a Critical issue, for on some websites (not listed here) it prevents you from logging in because the username and password boxes are on top of one another for example. Or another situation is when you have a cluster of a dozen links and you cannot click the one you want because there are others on top of it. And similar situations have also occured to me in the past.

Why doesn't this type of problem occur in Windows?
