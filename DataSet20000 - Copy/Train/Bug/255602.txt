This behavior is in windows and kde... and it wasn't in firefox (as far as I
remember) but now it's there... and I have one less reason to use firefox..

basically, When I am downloading a web page, I must find a place to save it! 
and that involves lots of file managing, and mouse wrangling,   If I click on
the wrong file (not a folder)  the file name in the save as dialog will switch
to that file!  I might be wanting to overwrite one file, but If I clock on
another file, I'd be expecting the overwrite dialog.. and BLAMMO  lost work

I've lost work in kde because of this behavior of having a single click change
the file name...

It's absolutely wrong behavior, and I woudn't even have double click do it, but
the proper way to deal with this problem is to:

1. have double click a file change the to be saved as filename
2. have the option to have single click in about:config
3. have the option to have a button on the side change filename to selected file
name.
4 have option to do nothing on double, and single click...

this is highly important, as support for the disabled, (in this case everybody)
is so important to the choice of a platform.

if 5 percent of the people can't use it
but only 2 percent of the people can't use the competetor, the 95 percent will
likely work with the software that supports that additional 3 percent of the
population...

this is major, because it causes loss of work...  LOTS of work on occasion I
lost an important file (yes I should be backing up) due to this bug, and I'm
scared to think of how anybody else can deal with the save as dialog without
overwriting something...
