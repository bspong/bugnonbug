java plugin  (jre1.6.0_u03) is installed but not recognized, firefox says additional plugins are required.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071008 Firefox/2.0.0.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071008 Firefox/2.0.0.8

The example site above, and others that require java to display the page correctly
do not display correctly. The browser tool bar says "additional plugins are
required to display all the media on this page." Various boxes on the page e.g.
the upper left corner, which should display moving menus or advertisements instead
say "click here to download plugin." Clicking here takes you to the sun java site
and invites you to install the latest jre1.6.0_xx.  The problem is that firefox
does not understand that the plugin is installed and working. It does not see
it and will not use it.
The plugin is installed correctly because the sun java site test says it is and
because the plugin works perfectly well with other browsers e.g. opera and also
firefox 1.5.0.7 which I still have on the computer. I have never had a problem
with the plugin working with firefox 1.5 but have never had it work with
firefox 2.0.
Other details: I am using the kde3.5 desktop with slackware 11.0 (2.6.17 kernel.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.turn on browser and make sure enable java is checked in the preferences
2.go to the above referenced web site and observe.
3.
Actual Results:  
web page is displayed but incorrectly. Several boxes are empty except for the 
words "click here to download plugin.

Expected Results:  
The empty boxes would normally have moving menus or other moving things in 
them. There should be no messages about additional plugins.

I have updated java several times and updated the os several times but have not
had the problem occur with firefox 1.5. It was only when I upgraded to firefox 2.0
that the problem occured.
I tend to do basic things with the browser, no special themes and usually only
one window or tab open.
