So ATM the Vista users get blue buttons, XP users get green buttons etc. for the toolbar. But what if Vista and XP (and maybe Linux & OSX) users could change the button color according to the window theme?

Like, if I have white Windows theme, I could get white-themed buttons (maybe even linked with the Aero interface)? And on XP -- Luna Blue could get blue buttons, Olive Green could get green buttons & Silver could get .. silver buttons.

There should be like two options: one is a color picker for manual selection, the other is a button "automatically assign colors from the windows theme" or something like that.

I hope you understand what I mean :D

Reproducible: Always




I think this image shows it the best :)

Here I've added some notes: (Color adds to recent colors only when pressed OK not just selected; The "Apply" button should be unnecessary if the colors update dynamically/automatically)
