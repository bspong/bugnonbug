I was searching for 1940s fashion--clicked a link or 2, the tabs that opened started "scanning" my machine very quickly!  I tried like 5 times to close the tab but it would not close.

Then all evidence of Firefox momemtarily VANISHED !  Only a a popup box remained from the rougue? Antivirus 2009 remained visible with options to install (or something).  

 I hit "X" so it disappeared & Firefox did come back up with all my tabs intact HOWEVER, from that exact moment, I continued to browse for 1940s fashion on the currently open web pages --when I click "EDIT" , then "FIND" from Toolbars at top to search for a word in a page, the SEARCH Bar that usually pops up at the bottom of my screen won't work.  So I have no ability to search for a word in a page anymore.  

THis has happened 3 times in the past 2 weeks.  I have to close Firefox then restart to get the Find function back.
