Have ebay.ca and ebay.com on Bookmarks Toolbar
Clicking either of these buttons, opens up ebay/ebay.com in a left hand framed
page.
Clicking properties on the bookmarks button associated with these sites, I "uncheck" the Open in left hand frame page option
after cruising various sites, or several different sites, when I click on ebay/ebay.com it reopens in a left hand frame. 
Checkmark is being replaced every so often.
It's not consistent, and something is re-checking the box as a default option

This is an upgraded Firefox, and this didn't happen with previous version.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click Bookmark Toolbar button for ebay.ca or ebay.com
2. Frame opens on left hand side of firefox
3. Cannot slide frame to full page
4. Right click button, and choose properties, and uncheck "load this bookmark in sidebar
5. proceed to other pages, not related to ebay, mail/news/yahoo/etc
6. Click ebay.com/ebay.ca buttons again and page try's to open in sidebar
7. Typing page into navigation toolbar (www.ebay.com) opens page in full browser

Actual Results:  
See above.
Typing URL doesn't produce the problem
REbooting computer seems to reproduce the problem
Seems that something is tagging that empty box as needing to be checked by default
This does NOT happen with any other bookmark button that I have

Expected Results:  
Click button, go to page. either open page in existing window or if you have the option checked for opening a new tab, then doing that

Previous verson of firefox worked fine.
Updated, (by default, it auto checks for newer versions) and problem started happening.
