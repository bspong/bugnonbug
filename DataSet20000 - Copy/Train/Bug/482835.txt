When loading about:config in a new tab, focus is set on the "Filter" allowing one to start typing immediately. However when loading about:config in a previously-used tab then this does not occur. You have to click in the "Filter" field before typing.

On Firefox 3.0.7, focus is always set on the "Filter" field when about:config is loaded so this is a regression.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press ctrl-T to open a new tab, type "about:config" and press enter. Note that focus is set on the "Filter field" and you can type in the field right away.
2. Press ctrl-T to open another new tab. In this tab enter "about:blank" and press enter.
3. In this second tab, type "about:config" and press enter. Note that focus is NOT set on the "Filter field" and you can NOT type in the field until you clikc in it.
Actual Results:  
In step 3, focus is "nowhere"

Expected Results:  
In step 3, focus should be in the "Filter" field as in step 1.

Bug does not occur on Fx 3.0.7
