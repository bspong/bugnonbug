I'm am not certain if this is an issue with Firewall or a change with Facebook.  The Facebook News Feed keeps refreshing, which is a pain in the butt when you are attempting to make a comment on a post.  I would imagine that this is a feature of Facebook?  I am willing to accept the refresh in the News Feed and click on the post and update/comment from the user's page.  However, even when clicking on the post and going to the user's page, the page will still refresh after about a minute and take you back to the News Feed.  This is the part that is simply unacceptable.  This issue just started less than a week ago.  I have loaded the Refresh Blocker add-on, however it did not resolve the problem.

Thanks,
Mark
