Auto-complete creates duplicate entries in several fields:
1) login (and associtated password)
2) Name
3) e-mail
4) address (usually only Address Line 1 if form supports 2 lines)
5) telephone


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. fill out a form
2. fill out the form again
3. fill out the form again

Actual Results:  
Firefox collects and stores two entries in auto-complete

Expected Results:  
One entry would suffice


it varies from site to site, and is hard to duplicate with a fresh profile since
you usually need to re-visit a site.
Sometimes, it carries over login/password from another site (assuming you use
the same password).
It doesn't seem to matter which auto-complete entry you select to auto-fill
passwords (but if you have the same login with a different password, it goes
with the most recently typed password--non-duplicates don't suffer from this).
It only seems to collect two of any field.
Sometimes, even though it auto-filled the password, it asks if you want to save
the password.
