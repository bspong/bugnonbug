URL /admin/misc/xyz, infinite loading if computer offline.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:30.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/30.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140605174243

Steps to reproduce:

Firefox last version (30) / Windows 7 and Windows 8.
Unplug internet cable or desactivate network card.
Try to access: http://www.domain1.fr/admin/misc/xyz
(xyz can be whatever)

I try with disabling all extension, all plugin, start in safe mode, ... same pbl. Same on others computer too (always Windows OS).

Further test and this is why the bug is critical for us and so we cannot use firefox offline on our local web application:
install a lamp de environement, trying to access to my local application (always offline) to the page http://www.dev-domain.fr/admin/misc/xyz, nothing happen infinite loading. If i plug back on the network it reach the local computer page.

Problem only occurs with no network (and no internet) (firefox can be in connected mode or disconnected, the same)


Actual results:

The tab has infinitely the loading animation and never reach destination.


Expected results:

Normally Firefox should at least say "Page doesn't exist, or not reachabled, or a message..."... and in case of lamp application locally installed it should resolve the page.

It seems there is a deep inside link in the code for /admin/misc/* preventing offline to access to those URL.
