Runaway memory leak on specific web page

Steps to reproduce:

Opened this web page:
http://understandingsociety.blogspot.ie/2015/09/range-of-reactions-to-realism-about.html


Actual results:

Firefox had a runaway/endless memory leak, going up to 2GB before I closed it.


Expected results:

No memory leak...if this is an issue with the web page javascript (discussion with someone on Firefox IRC suggests that it is), then Firefox should detect this entire class of potential issues and prevent/handle them, so that it is impossible for any website to trigger this kind of memory leak.

In my opinion, this is a security issue, as it is effectively a Denial of Service attack on the browser. Imagine for a moment, if javascript ads (ubiquitous across the web) suddenly got used to exploit this issue with Firefox - if that is possible, it could be used to make seemingly any version of Firefox have a runaway memory leak, on almost any website, by ads with this exploit being injected into ad networks (a very common occurrance for dodgy ads to end up on mainstream websites).

The issue may turn out to be more benign than that, but the mere possibility is bad (I work with exploit testing other software, and this is definitely something I'd class as Bad).
