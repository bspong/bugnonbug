Copy & Paste has stopped working under certain circumstances
I'm filing this for information's sake, since it's already been fixed, but might be interesting to someone.

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.9a3pre) Gecko/20070227 Minefield/3.0a3pre ID:2007022714 [cairo]

1. New profile, start firefox.
2. Visit http://msforums.ph/forums/thread/191600.aspx
3. Left click on one of the securitywatch.eweek.com links (firefox does not follow link and link jumps up, bug 372048)
4. Left click on the link again (browser now follows link)
5. Double click on one of the text words in the article
6. Press right mouse button

Expected: Context menu that allows user to copy the selected text to clipboard
Actual: Different context menu that does not allow user to copy selected text to clipboard

I don't know which checkin fixed it, so I'm resolving this bug WORKSFORME. But if anyone knows for sure, could they add a comment and mark this bug RESOLVED FIXED?
