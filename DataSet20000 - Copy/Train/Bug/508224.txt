Hi I updated from 3.0.5 on a Slackware-12.0 box. The box is a fairly bare-bones thing just for using mail and openoffice and of course a browser. Every startup I get this up when it comes up. The accompanying message tells me it can't open all the tabs that were there.

I am inclined to close the box by a button in xfce which offers a power off. I used to get a choice to restore, or start anew with 3.05. Now I get the above. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.get a tab or tabs open in firefox (any tab)
2.Shut off X by "Power button in xfce
3.startx and firefox
Actual Results:  
Big Sign "Well, this is Embarassing" and  a message that they couldn't restore all tabs. I am offered the new session / restorwe choice. The browser behaves normally after that.

Expected Results:  
Start new session, or restore old one, or offer the choice.

I don't like my linux box saying it is embarrassed about itself, like as if it's fly was open. I have 2 M$ windoze nerds in the house who occasionally use it. I don't want to give them ammunition.
