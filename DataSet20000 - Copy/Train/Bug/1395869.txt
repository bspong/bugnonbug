session history issues [crashing on start-up in 54 and in 55 not even saving sessions any more]
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; rv:55.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/55.0
Build ID: 20170824053622

Steps to reproduce:

In Version 54 I found Firefox crashing when launched on a very, very frequent basis.
In the recent Version 55 it is no longer even saving sessions since 27th August. 
I had 9 windows with over 1100 tabs.  One window seems to have been lost unless I can get a proper recovery from a session possibly as far back as 13th August. 



Actual results:

Version 54 would hog ridiculous levels of CPU 60-70% at leak but constantly >50%) and I'd have to stop doing anything else on the laptop for it to stand a chance of not crashing! 
Since going to Version 55, I seem to have lost the contents of one window and it always opens with just the Google home page tab i.e. any extra tabs opened are lost.  The other 8 windows recover but if I open new tabs in them they are not saved either.


Expected results:

Firefox should recover the 9 windows with a total 1100 tabs between them. If there is a limit, it should warn the user and they will do some house-keeping finding what really can be ditched or archive off data such as putting URLs in a word file. I have so many windows/tabs because it keeps a thorough audit trail of key info I've found in some cases I'm investigating and I can readily look at the info.
