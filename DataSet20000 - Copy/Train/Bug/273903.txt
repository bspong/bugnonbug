The Bookmark manager should offer a functionality to keep bookmarks in order. -
To offer tools to place them in folders, add separators etc is just finde, but
not enough (imho). Why not to let ist assist the user by auto-ordering bookmarks
that relate to each other?

A functionality that would place bookmarks from one site/domain to one folder
would be a starting point. That woul take a lot of work from the user to keep
his/her bookmarks in order.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Hm, this is a wish. Should i have put it somewhere else?

Well, if you want to reproduce it at all, then:

1. In sequence go to a set of web pages
2. add their addresses to the bookmarks collection

Actual Results:  
3. look at that collection: the bookmarks won't be auto-ordered. You'll have to
do that by yourself.


Um, i tried firefox last week and removed again; if your bookmarks manager does
this service yet, then sorry for the entry here.

Expected Results:  
Bookmarks manager should order the bookmarks automatically in a senseful way
