I am monitoring the windows clipboard to automatically archive any data I copy
to it. My program joins the clipboard viewer chain to recieve WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD
messages indicating the contents of the clipboard have changed.

Whenever a copy operation is performed from firefox, the WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD
message is recieved three (3) times. No other application I have copied data to
the clipboard behaves in this way.

All copy to clipboard operations in firefox cause this problem. Copying from the
address bar, from page in browser and from form entry fields.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Monitor the clipboard (SetClipboardViewer API)
2. Watch for WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD messages
3. Copy some text from firefox and observe how many WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD messages occur.

Actual Results:  
WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD immediately fires three times in a row

Expected Results:  
WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD should only occur once for each data change in the clipboard.
Firefox seems to be copying everything three times.
