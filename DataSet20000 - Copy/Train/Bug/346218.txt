Hang when accessing an applet via Javascript with Java 1.3 installed but disabled
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.5) Gecko/20060719 Firefox/1.5.0.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.5) Gecko/20060719 Firefox/1.5.0.5

After installing the Java 1.3 JRE (j2re-1_3_1_18-windows-i586-i.exe) I use the Java Control Panel to disable the Java plugin. After that pages that contain applets come up with the grey applet background (where the applet should be) and  contain the text 'Java is not enabled'. However if that page attempts to access/manipulate that applet with javascript Firefox appears to go into an infinite loop (full CPU) the close button does exit firefox but the Microsoft Error Reporting dialog is displayed.

Using the attached test page which is based on a sun sample applet http://java.sun.com/applets/jdk/1.4/demo/applets/BarChart/example1.html It allows the user to initiate some javascript:
alert("doTest");
var elm = document.getElementById("app");
alert("Test done");

Where 'app' is the id of the applet embedded in the page, the first alert fires but then Firefox chews up all the CPU and never returns. Menus still can be opened but tabs cannot be used. 

The bug still exists in the latest trunk build of firefox:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20060609 Minefield/3.0a1

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install a Java 1.3 JRE
2. Disable the Java plugin from the Control Panel (Windows)
3. Load the attached file chart.html
4. Click on the bold text 'Click on this text to test.'
5. Dismiss the alert 'doTest'


Actual Results:  
Firefox uses full CPU and doesn't respond.

Expected Results:  
A second alert 'Test Done' should be displayed.
