Bookmarks deleted with Firefox update, unable to restore to any of dates listed, bookmarks deleted again each time I open Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.7) Gecko/2009021906 Firefox/3.0.7

I didn't even notice that Firefox had updated, but all of a sudden I noticed that all of my favourites were gone. I tried looking in profile folders for a file that might contain the information, but was not successful.

I tried doing a restore through Firefox since 5 restore dates are kept; but after accepting to proceed (which would replace my current favourites), I got an error: "Unable to process the backup file".  Hopefully my favourites will still be accessible.

Furthermore, after closing Firefox, any new favourites I saved in my last session are not there when I open it.

Firefox doesn't autofill addresses I've been to in the address bar when I type in the address bar.
