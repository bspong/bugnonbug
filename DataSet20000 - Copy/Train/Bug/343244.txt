Firefox is experiencing multiple freezes - from every 30 seconds to a few minutes. I didn't believe it was the browser at first and thought I must have been bugged by some maleware, did some scanning cleared some cookies, did some virus scans - nada, and still freezing. I then re-downloaded and re-installed - still freezing. I then checked the other browsers on this system, Netscape, Opera, and Maxthon (IE) - they all work fine except for Netscape and Firefox. Thunderbird also is running fine on this system. No other program is experiencing freezes or hangups. This started around a week ago.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start browser
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
hangs ever minute or so

Expected Results:  
no freezes or hangs - smooth sailing like I've come to expect
