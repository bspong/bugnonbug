modern.jar is packaged in zip builds
There are a series of problems here, and it's all rather complicated:

1, primarily: packages are being built (venkman, chatzilla and inspector in the
developer builds + embed-sample in the release builds) that supply contents.rdf
files that have assertions referencing "modern" - this causes the Themes panel
to check the name arc on whichever of them it finds first. 

One (or more, or all) of these packages is wrongly providing a "Name" arc when
it identifies itself as supporting the modern theme, as a rule extensions should
not provide names of existing themes because when the extension contents.rdf
file is aggregated into the chrome registry datasource the order of assertion
retrieval is undefined in the interface of nsIRDFDataSource (it may not be in
implementation, but we can't rely on that). Only the 'global' package should
have the Name arc. If these packages did not provide a displayName arc, the
content builder would never find a value to put in the tree cell and
theoretically a row would not be built. (If this does not happen then the
preferences themes panel should be modified to use the new template syntax to
make the presence of a "displayName" arc required via a condition).

2 - as a corollary, release builds are getting embedding-sample built. This is
not something that means anything to release builds, and it should be ifdef'ed
out somehow. ifndef MOZ_PHOENIX in mozilla/embedding/browser/Makefile.in seems
one option (although it doesn't fix it for Mozilla)

Issue (1) needs to be fixed.
