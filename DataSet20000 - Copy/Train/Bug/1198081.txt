v40.0.2 has now made Facebook, Google Calendar and lord knows what else not display properly.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:40.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/40.0
Build ID: 20150812163655

Steps to reproduce:

Firefox was working perfectly earlier today...I even think it was 40.0.2, but not sure.  I ran it in safe mode to rule out add-ons, but still the same problem.  Then with a bit of research, I read that Mozilla decided to make Java NOT run by default and the only way to make it run was to use about:config and also actually go to the directory on my computer and choose Java.exe to run and it still doesn't show pictures and several buttons are missing...What are you thinking?????  I have used Firefox and Thunderbird for more years than I care to remember, but this ridicules stunt makes Chrome look allot more appealing by the hour.  Do you even test your product BEFORE you release it????  Can you tell, I am NOT happy???


Actual results:

Still doesn't display properly, even in safe mode.


Expected results:

Not to have been bothered by you screwing up a browser that I count on daily.  You need to get  v40.0.3 out to fix your previous screw-ups (which this version was supposed to fix...)  You have truly disappointed me and I am sure THOUSANDS of others as well.
