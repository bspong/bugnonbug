Cursor fails to advance while typing an entry in a text box in an on-line form.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

When I enter text in an online form, the cursor frequently fails to advance to the next position, leaving the characters that should have followed in a position inserted before the previously typed character.
The result is a string of garbled letters and numbers, although they are the letters and numbers that were typed, but not in the order in which they were typed.
I noticed someone reported a similar problem on an earlier version, but I just loaded this version of firefox for the first time yesterday.
They used the following example of what might happen when typing the phrase “Hello Mozilla” with | representing the cursor:

|
H|
He|
He|l
Hel|l
Hel|ol
Hel |ol
Hel M|ol
Hel M|ool
Hel Mz|ool
Hel Mz|iool
Hel Mzl|iool
Hel Mzl|liool
Hel Mzla|liool

I typed the above in word, as I encountered the problem here as well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to a text box like this one.
2.Just start ypngit.
3.You see the result above in the word "ypngit" which was typed as "typing".
