[e10s] All browser tabs crash simultaneously when one of the tabs loads heavy stuff
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0

Steps to reproduce:

I restarted my Nightly after the 18 Jan 2015 update and ever since the tabs (all) were crashing very frequently. Almost like every 15-20 minutes. One of the tabs crashes and a domino effect causes all other tabs to crash simultaneously (or I guess its probably because e10s is running the chrome element of all tabs in the same web process so when one crashes, all crash). Sometimes right before a crash, i see an information bar (not unlike IE8's) at the top of the page informing me that one of the pages is slowing down Firefox but before I can respond to it, all the browser tabs crash and the message obviously disappear.
I did some more testing. The one thing I noticed was that pages that load flash plugin are pushing the browser over the edge. Happened when loading facebook and a couple of other websites that had embedded flash in their header. Also, the number of tabs open matters. So if FB is the only tab open then the browser happily chugs along but once you go over maybe 7 or 8 tabs, then the crash starts happening. In fact if you have 15 or more tabs open (as I normally do) then simply switching back to the fb tab after a gap of maybe 10-15mins is sufficient to crash the browser tabs (when e10s tries to repaint the page). Rapidly switching between tabs also initiates the crash.
Turning off e10s improved the situation and as far as I could see the problem did not recur. Turning on safe mode also helped but then the flash content doesn't load at all.
I also tried creating a fresh profile but running it in a normal e10s window caused the crash symptoms to recur.


Actual results:

All browser tabs crashed.


Expected results:

Crash should not have happened
