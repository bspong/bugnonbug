Firefox only runs if it's started twice

Firefox only runs if it is started twice, then proceeds to open two windows. Happens after a period of inactivity (after system wakes up from standby), or after an initial system boot or restart.

Also, when I started Firefox and the 3.5.6 download came up, it installed successfully, checked for add-on updates, but did not start Firefox afterwards. (I gave 5 mins). I then started Firefox again and two windows opened (including the Mozilla homepage from the download complete).

If the computer is active (for example now I'm typing this report) I can restart Firefox or open a new window without a hitch.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. After a system boot, start Firefox
2. Wait 5 mins to check if it will start up
3. Start a new Firefox
4. Two windows open
Actual Results:  
As above

Expected Results:  
Start first time, preferably immediately.
