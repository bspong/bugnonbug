Massive memory leak

I was doing a number of things at once when I found my computer running slowly. This shouldn't be happening, I thought, I bought a hexacore for goodness' sakes. So I ran "top". It reported that Firefox was using a massive 2 GB of virtual memory and 1 GB of resident memory. I have 2 GB total so that is quite concerning. I had about 10 tabs open, in which most were just blank (I have problems connecting to the Internet). I'm not sure what the problem was, I had no extensions installed at the time, and I'm having a hard time reproducing it. I was doing a CPU-intensive task at the time, but it didn't use up a lot of memory (running make -j6) but that shouldn't have locked it up. Additionally, I found desktop responsiveness drop to an all-time low, and my mouse was frozen for a few seconds. Possibly it may have been a problem with the Flash plugin.

It could be the same thing but Firefox occasionally just crashes now with no error I can find. Does it log errors to a file I could attach?

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce




Default Firefox, version 3.6.6 from the 64-bit Ubuntu repositories, with 32-bit Flash 10.1 installed via the "Click here to install plugins" manager (which incidentally runs videos but then does not accept clicks in those videos).

Severity critical because the software hangs and crashes.
