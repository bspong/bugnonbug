Memory release failure

I am using Windows Vista Ultimate x64 SP1 with 2GB single Channel RAM.
I use tabbed browsing alot and everytime I open a new tab and close that tab when finished, it is not released from memory. It just stays there holding it's position. I can start with my tabbed pages and that takes up 200MB RAM. Whenever I see it using 900MB in one session with about 7-10 active tabs, I see the memory is still being left filled. I am forced to reclaim this memory by closing Mozilla and waiting for the session to be released from Task Manager. Unfortunately, I have to End Task as it seems to fail to stop altogether. I've had this problem since 3.0.4 and I use facebook and always using tabs for the games such as "http://apps.facebook.com/metropolisgame"

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Tabs from last time active
2. Open new tabs
3. Once tabs finished with close
4. Watch memory management not go down with "firefox.exe *32"
5. Close to reclaim memory
6. Watch Task Manager for "Firefox.exe *32" to disappear
7. Wait
8. Become impatient after a few minutes - End Task
9. Resume and everything operates faster
Actual Results:  
Memory usage increases when new tabs that are opened, then closed repeatedly never release the memory to the user.
Firefox slows down (or at least in my experience)
Firefox has to be ended to reclaim the memory in use


After a tab is closed, the tab should release the memory to the user or have it paged.
When Firefox is closed to sort the memory, and NOT ended with task manager, and try to restart it will state "Firefox is already running"

I would like to be able to continue using Firefox without having to close and force to close. Compared to IE, it is much better and easier to use

--I feel a 64bit version would be a good investment--
--I do like the fact, version 3 can be adjusted to look like version 2 without any 3rd party enhancements. Thank you--
