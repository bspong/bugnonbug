Hi,
I have two simple html files, FirstPage having a meta tag to redirect to SecondPage after some seconds.
If the option "Warn me when web sites try to reload or reload the page" is checked then the wait time is not considered before redirecting to new page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have two simple html files like below
FirstPage.html
===============
<html>
	<head>
		<title>
			ReDirect Testing - First Page
		</title>

		<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
		<meta http-equiv="Content-Language" content="en" />
		<meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="120;url=SecondPage.html" />
		<meta name="copyright" content="Testing" />

	</head>
	<body>
		You are on First Page. The page will redirect automatically to Second Page.
	</body>
</html>

SecondPage.html
================
<html>
	<head>
		<title>
			ReDirect Testing - Second Page
		</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		Congrats now you are on the Second Page after page redirect.
	</body>
</html>

2. Check the option "Warn me when web sites try to reload or reload the page".

3. Open the FirstPage.html in the browser. As soon as page is loaded I am getting the message "Firefox prevented this page from automatically redirecting to another page", an Allow button and an "x" symbol; this is because the above option is checked.

4. Now I click on the Allow button, the request is redirected and the SecondPage.html is loaded.

Actual Results:  
The SecondPage is loaded after clicking on the Allow button.

Expected Results:  
In FirstPage.html we have meta tag like below
<meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="120;url=SecondPage.html" />

1. Why the browser is not waiting for 120 seconds before poping-up the error message and displaying the Allow button.

2. If the user has clicked Allow button, then also the browser is not waiting for 120 seconds as defined in the meta tag.

In short the time specified in the meta tag is ignored before displaying the error and also after clicking the Allow button. And the page is redirected to new URL without giving any importance to the time. I think this should not the case and browser should wait before redirecting to new URL.
