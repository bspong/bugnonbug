Mozilla Firefox crashes when we do a Google search
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.4) Gecko/20091016 Firefox/3.5.4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.4) Gecko/20091016 Firefox/3.5.4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When Mozilla upgraded to version 3, Firefox started crashing EVERY TIME we do a Google search -- either with Google on the top bar OR even going to the Google website. Both avenues will crash Mozilla. Even when Mozilla re-upgraded this version (a few minutes ago), it still happens. It's not a problem with Google because Google search works fine on the same computer with other browsers. It's only on Mozilla and after version 3 was installed. If I select "I'm Feeling Lucky" from the Google website, it does not crash Mozilla but that option does not give a list of results; it takes directly to one website, so it's not an effective tool.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type anything on google search bar (either on the top bar OR at the Google website)
2.Press ENTER
3.Mozilla crashes every time
Actual Results:  
Mozilla Firefox crashes. A Mozilla window opens requesting more information. I select to send a report to Mozilla. I try it again, it crashes again, a Mozilla window opens apologizing for still not being able to open the site.

Expected Results:  
It should have brought up a list of possible websites as a result of the internet search.

There is nothing special or unusual. The only variable is that Mozilla upgraded to version 3 and it started crashing every time since then, since the upgrade before the last one (today Oct. 29, 2009). Will this problem be addressed by Mozilla and fixed on the next upgrade? Or is there a solution that we need to implement? Thank you for your help.
