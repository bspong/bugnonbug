Popup dialog boxes steal the focus so you can't close the page your on... This has apparently been a problem since the stone ages and somehow has not been fixed yet.. If I have 40 tabs open, and one of them so happens to decide to open a popup and open a new one each time you close it, I lose my entire session. This is a critical flaw. Why is it 2010 and this still happens? Beats me, I highly doubt that any of the web standards dictate that you must let those annoying popups lock the browser focus, preventing you from closing them by pressing the close button on the window (or now, tab).

Why can't I click the close button on the window behind the popup who is locking focus? Is it a portability issue? If so, just make it work for the windowing systems that support it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to annoying site.
2. Infinite loop popup in your face forever.
3. Nothing you can do about it.
Actual Results:  
Annoying popup in my face locks the God damn browser focus and I lose my sessions.

Expected Results:  
Browser acts sane.

It's _2010_. This crap should have been fixed ages ago.
