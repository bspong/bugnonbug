I created a bookmark for the following link:
http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewforum.php?f=38.  I dragged it to the bookmark
toolbar, located under the navigation toolbar.  It created an item on the
bookmark toolbar.  I dragged it to a folder on my desktop called "New Favorites"
and it worked.  Later in the day I had forgotten I already placed that bookmark
to the "New Favorites" folder and attempted to drag it again.  After dragging
the item a Windows Prompt asks me (text inside <img></img> represent graphics):

"This folder already contains a file named 'Mozilla Firefox Support -
MozillaZine Forums'.

Would you like to replace the existing file
<img>firefox bookmark icon</img> 74 bytes modified: Today, September 09, 2005,

<img>IE bookmark icon</img> (unknown date and size)"

The window contained 4 buttons:  Yes, Yes to All, No, and Cancel.  The mouse
cursor was stuck at arrow and the drag bookmark graphic.  I could not click any
of the buttons.  I couldn't do any operation in firefox after this window dialog
appeared.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a bookmark in the bookmark toolbar
2. drag it to a windows folder
3. drag it to a windows folder again so it a window comes up asking if you want
to replace the file

Actual Results:  
I could not do any other operation in firefox.

Expected Results:  
Allowed me to push the buttons contained int he dialog.

I say this seems like a crash because there is no straightfoward way of being
able to use firefox again.  The only way I was able to resolve this was if I use
Windows Key + D which minimized all windows including firefox.  Then I was able
to push one of the buttons in the dialog I mentioned in the details.  After I
chose Yes, Yes to all, no, etc.  Firefox was working again.  It just seemed like
firefox stayed on top of the dialog and would not allow me to continue browsing
until I pressed the button.  I could not push the button because firefox
insisted on staying on top, unless doing the resolution I mentioned above.
