Firefox 1.0 crashes at the BBC World home page http://www.bbcworld.com
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Every time I attempt to open the url
http://www.bbcworld.com
OR
http://www.bbcworld.com/content/template_home.asp?pageid=1
either from the location bar OR from bookmarks,
Firefox 1.0 (downloaded and installed today, Sunday 5 December 2004) crashes
with no warning, no error message, and no core dump that I can find. 

I am running Firefox 1.0 on GNU/Linux Red Hat 8, standard Dell Precision
hardware with Intel 86.

Crash occurs repeatably when I attempt to launch Firefox from Gnome Panel icon.
Crash occurs repeatably when I attempt to launch Firefox from the command in the
installation directory (e.g., /usr/local/Firefox1.0/firefox).

Crash does NOT occur with Mozilla 1.5 on the same platform.

Crash does NOT occur with Netscape 7.02 on the same platform.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox
2. Direct it to the url htpp://www.bbcworld.com
3.

Actual Results:  
Firefox disappeared from the screen.

In fact, all instances of Firefox will crash simulataneously if one instance is
directed to that url. I mean, as I first attempted to file this bug report, I
had one instance of Firefox pointed to the bug report tutorial, and I attempted
to launch Firefox as a second instance from the command line, to verify that the
crash was not a side-effect of the Gnome Panel icon interface, and by golly,
both instances of Firefox disappeared from the screen, along with my
half-completed bug report. (Yep, I searched for the first half-completed bug
report among "bugs reported today" before I started this second attempt.)

Expected Results:  
It should display the BBC World home page as Mozilla 1.5 and Netscape 7 do. (I
know: BBC web pages are embarassingly Microsoft-centric, but I do look at their
schedule every week with Netscape or Mozilla.)

I did not find a Talkback crash ID. Where should I look for it?
