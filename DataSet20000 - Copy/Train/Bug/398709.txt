Firefox crashes after trying to add some information to this form and submit it

I built this form to allow users to create online Gradebooks.  For a long time, the form worked exactly as expected.  I have recently added some small features to the form (specifically an extra text input for each column of the form you see).  Now, almost every time I try to submit the form, the browser crashes completely.

I am unable to provide a Talkback ID for this bug as my internet provider appears to be blocking (? maybe?) the port that Talkback uses to send their information.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to http://www.unitorganizer.com/drupal5/node/add/gradebook
2.  Enter in the information to the form.  
3.  Click on 'Grading Categories' and fill in the 'Create New...' text input.
4.  Click on 'Update Categories' or 'Submit'
Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes.  Form information is not saved upon re-opening Firefox.

Expected Results:  
Form should be submitted and the updated information should be displayed.

This form works absolutely as expected in Internet Explorer 7 and Opera 9.
