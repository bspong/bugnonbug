Steps to reproduce:

I have a mid-2015 Retina MacBook_Pro with 16GB of RAM, purchased in March 2016, along with a secondary Apple Cinema 2005 DVI monitor, and I was running fine, under Firefox ESR v52.0.1 with MacOS Sierra v10.12.3, when, in the Apple App Store, I was offered the MacOS Sierra v10.12.4 Update, which I then applied .



Actual results:

The result of the MacOS Sierra v10.12.4 update, was that the 16-or-20-odd thumbnails in Firefox's topsites-like windows, were blankified, and the next crank-up of Firefox (and also of Safari), caused Firefox (and, also of Safari) to reload the thumbnails, which went pretty-smoothly, for most of the thumbnails, except ...


Expected results:

... the fifth-thumbnail in Firefox ESR for the Mac wouldn't re-load !
I thought that it was one specific website that was causing the problem, but then I un-pinned the fifth-thumbnail, so it tried to load, instead, another website, and that one did not produce a non-blank fifth-thumbnail, so I concluded that it is a bug in Firefox ESR for the Mac !
I have since updated Firefox ESR to v52.0.2, but the apparent bug, remains !
