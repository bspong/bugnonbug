(Mostly) 6.0.1 crashes with IdVault
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13 PhishLock/3.5.0.48

Steps to reproduce:

I upgraded to Firefox V6.01 about 4 days ago.  


Actual results:

Ever since I upgraded, Firefox has been crashing.  It seems to crash whenever a new tab is opened (not always,  but random) or when a hyperlink is clicked (the hyperlink doesn't necessarily open a new tab).  The crash happens about 2 seconds after the new tab is opened or the hyperlink is clicked on.  So the new site is displayed for about 2 seconds, then Firefox crashes.   I tried ALL of the items on this link:  https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Firefox%20crashes#w_the-crash-doesnt-happen-in-safe-mode .  None in these suggestions on this link fixed the problem.  The problem happens in safe mode also.
It has crashed 4 times in 11 minutes and another time 8 times in 60 minutes.  It is very frequent (and irritating).
One time that it could be reproduced repeatedly was logging onto facebook.  I tried it 3 times and it crashed all 3 times.  I just tried logging onto Facebook and Firefox crashed.  However, Facebook is not the only site that Firefox crashes on.  The other appear to be random.
I have never had problems with Firefox before this.  It has been a stable product for me.
Pleeeese help.  I would like to continue using Firefox.


Expected results:

I should be able to click on a new tab or a hyperlink without Firefox crashing.
