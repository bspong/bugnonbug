it's a variation of this bug that has been marked resolved worksforme
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=222003 and a bug i filed a while
ago https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=295874

it may be mac-specific, but i've always found unusual reactions between cookie
dialog windows and pages/other tabs not loading in Firefox. This usually effects
Firefox when opening 5 or 6 pages in the background (often sites never visited
before) when the preferences are assigned to always ask for cookies permission.

This is especially prevalent when opening multiple tabs in the background (for
example, directing an rss reader to open url's in your default browser and in
the background)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. 'Allow sites to set cookies' and 'keep cookies: ask me every time' enabled
2. Open multiple url's (5 or 6), in tabs, from sites previous unvisited in the
background
3. Wait. Leave Firefox to load the sites in the background and then accept or
decline cookies dialog

Actual Results:  
Most tabbed sites will not load if Firefox is waiting for cookie acknowledgement.  
Screen artifacts are often visible across tabs. 

Expected Results:  
Loaded other tabs in the background or wait for user to acknowledge each cookie
dialog and resume loading page(s)
