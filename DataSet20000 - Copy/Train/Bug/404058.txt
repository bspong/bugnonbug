Deleting cookies results in automatic entry on blocked site list -- should be selective

When I delete a group of cookies via View Cookies I don't want them automatically entered in the blocked site list all the time. I deleted a bunch of yahoo  cookies while debugging, not knowing this would happen and then had a devil of a time discovering that Firefox was now blocking the entire site (yahoo's dumb messages did not help much either). I sorta see why someone would want the reverse (delete the cookie when I block a site), but this approach seems excessive. I want to proactively block sites, not via deleting cookies. Can this be made an option -- or at least documented??

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go into View Cookies and delete one or more at the >TOP level: eg, yahoo.com
2. Look everywhere to see why you cannot log onto yahoo -- over and over you are returned to the login page with no messages; finally it tells you your browser is not accepting cookies. WTF? Another browser works. WTF?
3. Go into Firefox Exceptions and see the site is now blocked
4. Hit head on desk given you just wasted an hour trying to get into yahoo mail
Actual Results:  
Site was blocked

Expected Results:  
Site would be blocked.

Either ask me if I want all my deleted cookies to result in a Blocked site or at the least document that will do this when I delete cookies.
