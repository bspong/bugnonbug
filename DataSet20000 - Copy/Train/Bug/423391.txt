When I visit a website which has been saved to my bookmarks, it will be saved to history. Then this URL will be shown as visited URL in other websites. But I can not delete this history item. Even after deleting all history, this URL is shown as visited URL too. At this time, if I should open places.sqlite, the URL is there too. It will be shown as unvisited URL only when I delete places.sqlite file.
