first table-column is too expanded (unicode entities included), other pages are correct

The table lists unicode-entities in the first column. On some pages
(latin-extended-b.html, greek-and-coptic.html) the first column is extremeley
width, but td width='...' is not defined. Other pages created at the same way
are displayed correctly
(http://www.sql-und-xml.de/unicode-database/basic-latin.html,
greek-extended.html), the difference between the pages is only the Unicode-Block
which is shown and described.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. See http://www.sql-und-xml.de/unicode-database/latin-extended-b.html
2. Switch to http://www.sql-und-xml.de/unicode-database/greek-extended.html

Actual Results:  
Scrolling to the right shows, that the title of the first column is missing, the
other columns are shown correct.

Expected Results:  
The software should show the table correct, like the other files there.

All pages are XHtml1.1-valide. A user cannot use these tables because he can't
scroll every time from left to right and back. The very old browser Netscape 3.0
shows the tables correct (not the Unicode-entities), but a reader can see the
complete table and all the other informations. So 'major' as status.
