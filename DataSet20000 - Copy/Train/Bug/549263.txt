Firefox goes nuts after returning from Standby
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

If Firefox is open and my computer goes into standby mode, when I bring it back, the current open tab will bring up the page I was on and then immediately go blank, bring it back, go blank, over and over like it has the hiccups. The rest of Firefox is frozen at that point and the only way to stop the behavior is to close out Firefox and go through the whole reload process. This happens over and over again during a day and started when I upgraded to 3.6. 

Also, I've had it crash my system to a blue screen twice, which is the first time I've seen a blue screen in Windows in years. Obviously there is something very wrong.

Reproducible: Always




I am not entirely sure if it happens every time, but today it has happened 5 times already and yesterday several times also. Since I'm on my computer nearly all day, it doesn't have a chance to go into standby very often and it was only today that I connected the problem to standby mode.
