Firefox seems to revert my "caps lock as control key" system setting when laptop is asleep for a while with Firefox open (Mac OS X)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:10.0.2) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0.2

Steps to reproduce:

This is a weird one.

I've recently started using Firefox, from version 10.0.1, on my MacBook Air running OS X 10.6.8. In my System Preferences I have the caps lock key set to act as a control key. I've noticed that when I wake up my laptop after not using it for a while, if Firefox was active when I closed the lid, then my system setting is reverted so that caps lock acts as caps lock.

This happens daily; changing my system prefs back the way I like it has become routine. For several days I switched back to Chrome and this never happened. Then I switched back to Firefox (now 10.0.2) and it's happening again. I've tried to fiddle around with it to find a more precise way to repeat the problem, but to no avail. (Simply closing the lid, waiting a few seconds, and opening again does not cause this to happen. It only appears to happen when the laptop is asleep for a while.)

I use a few standard, innocuous extensions, none of which seem to have anything to do with this. I can elaborate if need be.
