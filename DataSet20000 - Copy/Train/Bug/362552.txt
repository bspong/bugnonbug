I have a bookmark in my Bookmarks toolbar that creates Technorati tags.  Its name always reverts to blank when I restart Minefield.  My other bookmarklets with bits of JavaScript (e.g. post to del.icio.us) don't have this problem.  But I get no error report on editing the bookmark, exiting the browser, or restart.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Right-click in Bookmarks toolbar, choose New Bookmark...
2.  Create new bookmark with
   Name: TEST NAME,
   Location: (paste in next line only, all one line)
javascript:(function(){var a='';var t=prompt('Enter Tags:','');var tr=t.split(' ');a+='<span class='+unescape('%22')+'technoratitag'+unescape('%22')+'>Categories:<a href=%22http://www.technorati.com/tag/skierpage%22> </a>';for(var i=0;i<tr.length;i++){if(i > 0){a+=', ';}a+='<a href='+unescape('%22')+'http://del.icio.us/skierpage/'+tr[i]+unescape('%22')+' rel='+unescape('%22')+'tag'+unescape('%22')+'>'+tr[i]+'</a>';}a+='</span>';prompt('Copy this code, press OK, then paste to your blog entry:',a);})()
   Keyword: testkw
   Description: Problem with this bookmark?
3. Click the bookmark (It pops up a dialog, enter "blabla", it creates some HTML that you can copy; just click OK to dismiss).
4. Note no errors in Tools > Error Console.
5. Exit browser
6. Restart browser
Actual Results:  
The name is gone!  The button is still there and works, and in bookmark Properties the location, description, and keyword are all still there.

After restoring the name in Properties, I exported my bookmarks from Organize Bookmarks and the bookmark's name is present between the opening and closing <DT> tag.  But when I later looked at my bookmarks.html in my profile, it was missing.  I renamed the exported bookmarks file as xml and loaded in the browser and the browser complained about i<u.length in the JavaScript not being well-formed.

Expected Results:  
Don't lose the name.
(And, if the JavaScript is bad, then warn at some point.
And maybe avoid problems by wrapping bits of JavaScript in CDATA blocks?)

Bugzilla has bugs about bookmark renaming and blank bookmarks, maybe those cases are also due to unexpected JavaScript.
