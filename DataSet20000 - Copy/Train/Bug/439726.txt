Viewing off-line html documents Firefox 3.0 does not know where it is in the directory tree. Resulting in graphics not being rendered because path is incorrect.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

Firefox 3.0 opens:
file:///C:/mydir1/index.html
Click link on index.html page to:
file:///C:/mydir1/mydir2/mydir3/index3.html
Click link on index3.html which pops up a new window showing the user a selected graphic using javascript to create the window.

The page loads but the graphic is not rendered. There are no errors.

At the same time, in the location bar of the new window Firefox shows:
file:///C:/mydir1/index.html
In other words, it is two directories up from where it actually is.

If the path to the proper directory is manually entered in the location bar to bring up a file view of that directory (ie: file:///C:/mydir1/mydir2/mydir3/), and the html doc clicked and opened, then Firefox 3.0 knows where it is and on the page link being clicked the pop up window appears displaying the graphic.

This bug did not exist in the final version of Firefox 2; it does not exist in the final Firefox 3 beta in Linux / Ubuntu. The process described above works without issues/errors in Safari (Mac/Win); Opera (Mac/Win/Linux); IE 7.

A possible indication of the same issue may be that the latest Html Validator plug in also doesn't know where it is, displaying the results of a previously loaded page.

And both cases refreshing the browser window does not help. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create three directories: file:///C:/mydir1/mydir2/mydir3/
2.In file:///C:/mydir1 create index.html with a link to ./mydir2/mydir3/index3.html. Place a graphic (mygraphic.jpg) in mydir3
3.index3.html has link to create a pop up window on the fly using javascript and displaying a graphic selected from a list on the page in the new window.
4. On clicking the link the page appears, but there is no graphic.
5. Look at the location bar in Firefox 3.0. It still thinks it is at file:///C:/mydir1/index.html
6. Enter file:///C:/mydir1/mydir2/mydir3/ in the location bar.
7. File view of mydir3 appears.
8. Click on index3.html in mydir3.
9. Document opens. Click on link to create pop up window using javascript.
10. Pop up window appears displaying link because Firefox now knows where it is.
11. Look at location bar: file:///C:/mydir1/mydir2/mydir3/index3.html is not listed.
Actual Results:  
Any html document elements without an absolute path do not display if Firefox 3.0 location bar does not change to the current directory, which it is not doing.

Expected Results:  
Obviously Firefox 3.0 should know where it is in the directory structure and display the correct location in the location bar. Since the incorrect location being displayed indicates that Firefox thinks it is elsewhere and does not display html elements such as graphics with a relative path or no path at all.

The Error Console and Html Validator do not display any errors.
