Seen in KaiRo's explosive report. Heavy correlation to http://neiron.ru/toolbar/setup.html, which seems to be used in Russia. There are some comments but I haven't been able to get a sense of what triggers the crash yet by using Google translate. I was able to install the extension in my VM but I have not crashed yet.
