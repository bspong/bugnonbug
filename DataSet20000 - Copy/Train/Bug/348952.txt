Some links show as visited when they aren't.

Since the most recent win32 official build (1.5.0.6) some links appear in the "visited" colour when I haven't actually visited them yet, I've been encountering this for a week or so and I wanted to make sure I wasn't mistaken before I submitted it. Now I'm sure - as I just visited reddit.com and links submitted within the last few minutes are marked as visited despite the fact I've been out for 4 hours.

I've downloaded the most recent nightly and the same thing occurs. 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. visit a site with a lot of links, e.g. reddit.com, preferably one that you have clicked a few links on first (this seems to matter tho I haven't convinced myself yet)
2. look at the text colour of the links

Actual Results:  
some of the links you haven't yet visited (e.g. on reddit, posts within the last few minutes) are displayed in the "visited link" colour. these pages don't appear in the browser history or in the cache. 

Expected Results:  
only the links i actually have visited are marked as visited.

this seems to be very recently introduced, most probably with 1.5.0.6.
