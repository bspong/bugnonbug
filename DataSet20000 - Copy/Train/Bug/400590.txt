I will describe my case and a case which i reproduced with a new firefox profile. View "Steps to reproduce" for the case with the new profile.

My case:

If I view Places/Most Used Tags/anyTag/, then none of the bookmarks has a title. However I can right click the entry and give it a title. My bookmark has then a new title in this view, but it has it's old title in Places/Recently Starred Pages view.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a new profile
2. bookmark a page using the star, and give it a tag.
3. go to Places/Recently Used Tags/yourTag and right click the new bookmark in order to edit it.
4. You will see that the bookmark doesn't has the title you gave it at creation. The title of the page tell you that the bookmark has the title "null", and the title field is empty.
5. Give the bookmark a title.
6. The title ofthe bookmark will change in Places/Recently Used Tags/yourTag, but Places/Recently Starred Pages will show the old original title.
