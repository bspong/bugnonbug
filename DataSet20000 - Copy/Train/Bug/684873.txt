Re-open previously closed window sometimes loses track of most recently closed window
On OS X 10.6, with the Aurora(8.0a2) channel builds I've noticed an intermittent issue with re-opening a window that I just closed.  If I have multiple tabs open in a single window and close them all in very quick succession with the Cmd-W shortcut resulting in the window itself being closed when the last tab is close then perhaps 15% of the time an attempt to re-open the window with Cmd-Shift-N will result in the penultimate closed window being open.

1. Open two windows, one on github.com, one on google.com, and one on bugzilla.mozilla.org.  Domains don't matter.
2. In the github window, open some random repositories or user pages in tabs.
3. In the bugzilla window, open some random bugs in tabs.
4. In the google window, search for any thing.
5. Close the tabs in the bugzilla window one at a time but rapidly with Cmd-W until the window itself closes.
6. Close the tabs in the github window in the same manner.
7. Hit Cmd-Shift-N to "undo" the close of the github window.
8. Some small percentage of the time, the bugzilla window will re-open instead and any subsequent "undo close window" will act as if the github window never existed.
