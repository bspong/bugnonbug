Video streams at this site keep playing.  There is no way to stop it. When you try to leave the site, Firefox crashes.

I use the Live bookmark to watch USATODAY videos.  When trying to leave that site, Firefox crashes.  If I try to restore the session, it locks up again.  I can go to the site and click on a video and the same problem occurs.  I have tried this for 2 weeks with the same results.  Videos work on Reuters and other similar sites like BBC.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to USATODAY.com
2.Click on a Video.
3.Try to stop the video or leave the page.
Actual Results:  
FireFox locked up.  I did control alternate delete and it brought up the applications screen.  I pushed end now and eventually FireFox shut down.

Expected Results:  
I started Firefox again and it asked if I wanted to restore the session.  I pushed restore the session, it locked up again.  I then started a new session and was able to surf the web.

I used to have problems at USATODAY.com with video in the past on earlier versions of Firefox.  Now this is the only problem that I have at that site.  Windows reports the restart of the program to Microsoft and they report back that you have no solution to the problem.
