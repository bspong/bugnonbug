Firefox 3 beta reloads some pages once

Firefox3 reloads some pages immediately after loading them. It reloads them only once, and it doesn't seem to reload them when the same page is visited again in the same session.

So far I have only noticed it at the site given in the URL, so it is probably something specific to the CGI scripts on that site, but it happens only with FF3beta, and I can't see anything in the HTML or the HTTP headers which could cause a reload.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://www.wifo.ac.at/cgi-bin/wzrp/wzrphome.cgi
2. Log in as dbguest with password dbguest.
3. Click on "KGEN" (the fourth entry in "Kataloge/Catalogs")
4. The page is loaded (takes a few seconds to complete). Immediately after the page has been completely rendered, it is loaded again.
5. Click on any of the subcategories (e.g. "A__ Arbeitsmarkt")
6. The new page is loaded, and immediately reloaded.
7. Return to the top by clicking on "KGEN". The page will be loaded twice (the URL has changed).
8. Now click on the same subcategory again. The page will be loaded only once.
9. Continue navigating through the catalog. Whenever you enter a page which you haven't visited before, it will be loaded twice. If you visit a page again, it will only be loaded once.
10. It looks like only "katalog.cgi" is affected, but "disreihe.cgi" isn't.
Actual Results:  
See above.

Expected Results:  
Each page should be loaded only once.
