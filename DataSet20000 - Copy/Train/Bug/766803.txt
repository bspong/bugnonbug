Firefox 13.0.1 crashes after installing Windows Defender 11.27.2061.0 update
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:13.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/13.0.1
Build ID: 20120614114901

Steps to reproduce:

Running Windows 7 Professional SP1 (32 bit).

Upgraded to FF 13.0.1 with no problems encountered. The next day I restarted the system and installed the Windows Defender definition update released on 6/15/2012 (11.27.2061.0 - KB915597) via Windows Update. 


Actual results:

After applying the update FF crashed immediately upon starting several times. I rebooted the system - no change. I then applied the restore point created just before the Defender update was applied, rebooted, and was able to start FF normally.
