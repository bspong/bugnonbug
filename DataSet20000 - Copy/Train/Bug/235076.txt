The new add bookmark dialog in Firefox is nice, however I'd like to see improved
bookmark filing.  I'd like to see the Baysian filtering from Thunderbird
integrated into Firefox, so that it could learn from your bookmark filing and
provide the most likely options for the folders to file the current page under.  

Ideally, filing a bookmark in a sub-folder would also produce an effect on the
learning of the parent folder as well.  For example, if I go to file my first
bookmark on Python programming, it may be similar to bookmarks in
Programming/C++ and Programming/Java, but not particularly biased towards either
subfolder, so the parent folder would be a good suggestion.

Now, I believe that similar suggestions have been made for email filing in
Thunderbird, so I imagine that this kind of thing will probably be worked on
there first, but I believe that it may be good to keep this suggestion in mind,
so that design decisions made there would allow for the message filing to be
ported over to bookmarks as well.
