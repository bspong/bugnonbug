Hi since updating to Firefox 1.04 whenever I visit
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/default.stm and click on watch video (any video)
RealPlayer will launch three seperate instances of itself and begin playing 3
seperate instances of the same stream. Equally anoying is that RealPlayer used
to play embedded within Firefox - but it no longer does this. I was originally
able to resolve this by deleting everything I could find to do with realplayer
from my PC 9including the realplay plugins from my mozilla firefox directory)
and starting with a fresh profile - but it has just remerged and this fix no
longer appears to work. I only have realplayer 10 installed. I do not have
realplayer 8 installed too, nor do I have multiple instances of real player 10
installed.

Does anyone have a clue how to fix this?

in consistantly and without error in realplayer 1.03.
