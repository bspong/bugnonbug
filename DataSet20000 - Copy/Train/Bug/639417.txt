firefox 3.6.15 (and 3.6.14) immediately use all my memory and hang. They also constantly throw up a window asking me to authorize Firefox to access the keychain
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13 GTB7.1 Ubiquity/0.1.4

I've tried to install both Firefox 3.6.14 and 3.6.15. Both versions IMMEDIATELY use up all of my free memory, according to Activity Monitor. I have 2GB installed and before opening these two versions of FF more than three-quarters of that 2GB was free. Upon opening either of these versions, the spinning beachball starts and won't go away. 

In addition, both versions pop up a window over and over saying: "Firefox has been updated. Do you want to allow the new version to access the same items (such as passwords) as the previous version?" It doesn't matter which of the buttons offered ("Change All" or "Don't Change") that I click, the same window with the keychain question continues to pop up every few seconds.

Needless to say, Firefox is unusable in both 3.6.14 or 3.6.15. I've gone back to 3.6.13, which works fine for me. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install either Firefox 3.6.14 or 3.6.15.
2.Open the application.

Actual Results:  
3.ALL free memory is used up and Firefox hangs with the spinning beachball, plus the keychain question window keeps popping up. 

Expected Results:  
I expected Firefox to open and work.

I submitted an attachment with this report showing the memory usage in Activity Monitor as well as the Keychain popup message that keeps coming back.
