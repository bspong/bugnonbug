location bar and UI while typing

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64; rv:41.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/41.0

Steps to reproduce:

I have several client certificates and a website "support.example.com:443" in my history that requires a client certificate to access it. I cannot make use of automatic certificate selection for this site and working around that will not change anything about this bug, so please keep those discussions in the ancient bugs about how certificate selection is broken.

Repro:
I start typing a string into the location bar and as the suggestion UI opens up and the site populates into the suggestion list, the certificate selection dialog opens up.


Actual results:

Instead of letting me continue typing what I was actually wanting to type, the UI steals all input, and in the worst case, is not noticed until I accidentally accept a certificate.

I speculate that this is either some sort of prefetching or refreshing of suggestion data from the actual site.


Expected results:

I expect that whatever functionality causes this dialog to pop up from background tasks like whatever it does to not throw blocking modal UI at me while typing.

In the attached screenshot you can see the result of this. It got as far as processing the "sp" of whatever string I was typing, and "s" has my "support.example.com" site as completed site and as one of the suggestions.
