When two or more windows with specific sound file are open and a window with multiple tabs is exited, Firefox will crash. [@ libc-2.11.1.so@0x33a75 ]
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1

I've reproduced the bug 7 times now, and it all happens the same way.  With at lest two windows open, firefox will crash when attempting to close one of the windows with multiple tabs.  

Firefox did not have this problem for me until today.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open Firefox
2.  Open several websites, in tabs for the current Firefox window
3.  Go to File -> New Window
4.  Return to the window with at least two tabs open.  
5.  Close that window using the 'x' button in the window frame.  
6.  Firefox will crash.  

Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes and shows the Mozilla Crash reporter.

Expected Results:  
The browser normally displays an input dialog box that asks if the user is sure he wants to close multiple tabs.
