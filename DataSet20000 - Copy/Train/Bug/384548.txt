Upon updating to latest firefox, bookmarks are empty and I can't add new bookmarks.  A pop up prompts me to type in new bookmark description instead of the old click and confirm.  Filling in the fields and hitting ok doesn't do anything and I end up stuck

This began after a system restore and may actually be a problem on my end.  Restored to a point before I updated to the latest Firefox version.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Bookmark this page
2.  Pop up with fields "name" "keyword" and "create in" appear
3.  End up stuck as nothing you type in the fields can get you out except hitting cancel
Actual Results:  
Have to cancel.  Must type in every url now manually to navigate the web. If I use the history feature and drag down to the url I've visited before, it does not complete the url for me and in addition, I can no longer bring up the cursor in any field after that happens, leading to me having to close and restart firefox.

Expected Results:  
What's expected is considered commonplace among browsers in 2007.

Bookmarks were erased and problems began after a system restore.  It could be on my end.
