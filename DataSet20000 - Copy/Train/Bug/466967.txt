Opening a stream URL produces Empty Tab with keyboard "dead". Ctrl-W, Ctrl-T, Ctrl-Tab, Alt-D, Alt-F, [F1] etc. do not work.

A stream URL opened in FF3 is usually passed on the the appropriate handler-application, e.g. Windows Media Player. If it was opened in a new Tab, this Tab remains empty (OK). But the new Tab does not respond to keyboard actions (not OK).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a webpage containing this piece of HTML (just an example):
   <a target="_blank" href="http://81.173.4.20/radio538">Radio 538 stream</a>
2. Make sure that FF3 is configured for opening a Tab when HTML contains target="_blank".
3. Open this webpage in FF3.
4. Click the link.
5. A new Tab opens, and the URL (or Mime Type) causes Windows Media Player to take over. The new Tab shows no content.
6. Audio playback starts in WMP after a few seconds.
7. Go back to FF3, make sure the new empty Tab is still displaying.
8. Try closing it using Ctrl-W... does not work.
8. Try opening a new Tab using Ctrl-T... does not work.
9. Try Tabbing away using Ctrl-Tab or Ctrl-Shift-Tab... does not work.
10. Try opening the File menu using Alt-F... does not work.
10. Try activating the Address bar using Alt-D... does not work.
12. Try opening Help using F1... does not work.
13. Click any other (normal) Tab. Cycle through Tabs be keeping Ctrl-Tab pressed. Cycling will stop as soon as dead tab is reached.
Actual Results:  
Keyboard is completely dead in an empty Tab created in this way.

Expected Results:  
Keyboard should function. Empty Tabs created in this way should behave the same as empty Tabs created using Ctrl-T.
