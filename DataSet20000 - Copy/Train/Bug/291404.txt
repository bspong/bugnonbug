New Win2K patches are causing system lockup when FF is used.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.3

I installed the latest MS patches (KB890859, KB893086, KB893066). Once
installed, the system would lock up whenever Firefox was used to access the
Inet. The system lockup seems to be memory related, but the lockup occurs
inconsistently; that is, always when I access a new URL but not necessarily the
same URL or after the same amount of time. Removal of all the patches cured the
problem. Neither the boot log, DRWATSON or any other of the Win2K trace tools
has any useful information. I intend to put the patches, one at a time, on a
spare machine and see what happens. System hardware, which may be effecting
this, is an AMD Athlon @ 1.1 MHz w/ 768 MB of RAM, an Adaptec 29160 controller,
Creative Labs 24 bit live sound card, DFI system board, D-Link NIC and an ATI
Rage AGP-4 video card.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open FF
2.Log into my ISP (Verizon DSL) from the router.
3.Access a number of URL's

Actual Results:  
System locks and will not respond to an ICMP (ping) from another machine on the
LAN (inside the router).

Expected Results:  
Run as normal. I do not think this is necessarily a FF bug, but a case of MS
doing its thing without regard to the rest of the world.

To reiterate, removal of all the Knowledge Base patches restored normal operation.
