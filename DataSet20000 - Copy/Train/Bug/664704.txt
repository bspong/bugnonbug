Firefox hangs (not crashes) on the plugin rich websites !
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1

I am not sure about the reason behind the firefox hang. I will be just reporting what is happening with my browser.

- I was trying to connect to facebook.com
- Browser suddenly becomes not responding and each and every tabs or windows which are working also stuck.
- Since this problem is occurring for last one month, I have observed that when I wait from 1-3 minutes firefox resumes back and works well until next restart of the browser. But again the same problem occurs which is really frustrating.
- My browser always work in private browsing mode.
- Same thing happens with some other websites as well but this bug report was generated when I was visiting facebook.com
- There is one bug which was generated just before this one which says that ad block plus + java makes some problem together. In that case also problem was same but website(s) were different. I think that problem is temporarily solved because someone on IRC told me to disable some option in java control panel.


I am sorry for such a long description but I don't know how to explain this is brief. I have no idea which component is affected by this bug so I have selected "General".

Reproducible: Always
