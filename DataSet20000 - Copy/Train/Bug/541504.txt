When setting a max-height in a parent element, it's children don't get this value of height, for example when setting a percentage value for max-height on this elements children.  See the test case for an example.

Looking at the W3 (http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html), it says:
"If the height of the containing block is not specified explicitly (i.e., it depends on content height), and this element is not absolutely positioned, the percentage value is treated as '0' (for 'min-height') or 'none' (for 'max-height')."

The issue I see here is how the term "explicitly" is defined, I would say that when a max-height rule has been set and is in effect, then the height of the containing block is explicitly set, as it no longer depends on the height of the content, though just with this, I can see that it can be argued that explicitly means setting the height attribute.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the test case as in my next post
Actual Results:  
Image displayed with its full height of 595px.

Expected Results:  
The image to have been scaled so that it had a height of 270px (90% of 300px)
