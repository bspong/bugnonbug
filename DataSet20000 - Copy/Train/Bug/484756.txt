Downloading multiple files in quick succession breaks the "Save as" dialog.

When I launched three sourceforge download pages in separate tabs in quick succession, one of the "Save as" dialogs was corrupted. After cancelling the broken "Save as" dailog, letting the other downloads finish and then retrying the download link - the "Save as" dialog was correctly presented.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open these pages in separate tabs:
http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/filezilla_portable
http://portableapps.com/apps/graphics_pictures/gimp_portable
http://portableapps.com/apps/development/notepadpp_portable
2. Click the download button on each page in quick succession.
3. Check the "Save as" dialogs.
Actual Results:  
Two "Save as" dialogs appeared correctly, but the first of the files I clicked to download produced a corrupted "Save as" dialog. (Although I clicked on it first, it may not have been the first to download.) The file type and file location fields were blank, and the "Open with" drop down was located in the wrong place. 

Expected Results:  
Expected to get a simple "Save as" dialog for an Application, with options to Save and Cancel only.

I'll attach screenshots for a) the "Save as" dialog I actually got and b) the "Save as" dialog I was expecting.
