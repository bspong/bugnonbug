Restored session in Offline-mode results in many "cannot connect" pop-ups

I use Firefox with very many tabs each session. I autosave sessions when I close Firefox. When I open Friefox allsaved tabs are restored. If I happen to be offline at that moment, I get an error message for each tab session. If Firefox is restoring very many tabs an error message is given very many times instead of just once, each one per tab that was autosaved when trying to restore tab session.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open many tabs, autosave ab session, close Firefox
2. Open Firefox with autorestore session when you are offline
3. You will see many error messages, one per single tab
Actual Results:  
I have to close every single error message, which is very annoying, if I use very many tabs at once, and the repeated error messages are not usefull at all.

Expected Results:  
I would prefer one error message for being offline only, or maybe better, an in-window error page I see instead of a popup-box where I have to click "ok" for each single error messages of the very many error messages.

So maybe this annoying behavior of Firefox would not happen if an error message of being unable to connect because the computer is offline would be displayed as an displayed error-page instead of mutliple identical repeating popup-windows where I have to click "ok" each single instance.
