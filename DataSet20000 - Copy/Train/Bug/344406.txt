This bug applies to Bon Echo.

If you surf to a page that triggers a blocked popup (like http://www.cnn.com) a notification appears across the top of the browser content area.  The "Options" button within the notification doesn't respond to any selector (as far as I can tell, having tried several) other than a CSS rule in button.css that selects all buttons everywhere. 

This button has neither a DOM element id nor element class, contributing to the problem.

To make this button selectable, add an DOM element id or class such as ".messageOptionsButton".

current DOM structure

notification
  hbox.notification-inner .outset
    hbox
      image.messageImage
      description.messageText
        ...
      spacer
      button
        ...
      toolbarbutton.messageCloseButton
    browser
      ...
      

proposed DOM structure

notification
  hbox.notification-inner .outset
    hbox
      image.messageImage
      description.messageText
        ...
      spacer
      button.messageOptionsButton
        ...
      toolbarbutton.messageCloseButton
    browser
      ...
      
My particular goal is to change the button border color to darker for higher contrast. So far everything I've tried has failed EXCEPT setting it within button.css with the following rule:

button {
  border-color: red !important;
  border: 1px solid red !important;
}


which of course is bad because it selects all buttons everywhere, when I only want to select this one.

These selectors don't work:

.notification-inner button {
border-color: red !important;
border: 1px solid red !important;
}

description.messageText + spacer + button {
color: red !important;
border: 1px solid red !important;
}

I can select the text that's next to it with this rule:

description.messageText {
color: red !important;
border: 1px solid red !important;
}


Reproducible: Always
