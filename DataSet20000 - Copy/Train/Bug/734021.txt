Actual results:

Firefox 10.0.2 keeps crashing. Please contact me if there is a DEBUG mode I should be running in which would assist in troubleshooting.


Expected results:

Firefox should probably not randomly crash, I've been having constant crashing issues since I updated to 10.0.2 on 2/16 of this year. The first set of crash reports talk about an EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION_READ error, which sounds like a memory error. Later crash reports do not list this error. This is occurring on XP SP3, IE8 seems ok. No windows updates have occurred since Jan 2012. Ran AVG and winnt SFC against O/S looking for corruption, both checked out.
