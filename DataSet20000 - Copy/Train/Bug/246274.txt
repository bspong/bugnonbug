Firefox advanced browsing option "open links in the background" misleading

This is an analog to the Mozilla Suite bug I've been working on, #111842

To sum up, the preference under General Browser in Firefox's Advanced options
labeled "Load links in background" is EXTREMELY confusing. It was slightly
better (though still misleading) in the Mozilla Suite since it was under Tabbed
Browsing preferences. Under General Browser in Firefox, it makes it seem as if
the browser is "precaching" pages that are linked to on the current page. In no
way does it specify that it has something to do with the manner in which new
Tabs (and Bookmarks) are opened.

I've created a patch that his been approved (but waiting for sr, neither have
gotten back to me for the past five days though) which basically gives a new
text for the option, as well as automatically reverse the meaning of the pref in
the backend. Shouldn't break anything existing that depends on this pref.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:




I would normally set this to "Trivial" but this is a VERY confusing option. I
believe it's rather important to clear up for 1.0 exactly what's happening when
people enable or disable the preference.

I'll try to get the patch submitted tonight.
