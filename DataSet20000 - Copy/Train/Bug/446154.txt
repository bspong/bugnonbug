I have had this happen every time I use  Firefox now for whatever reason.

During any session of use, if I have a good deal of content up on a page or multiple tabs, after I close out FF and log on again I lose all my bookmarks, content of quick links etc. If the computer has had any kind of extra load on it, you can bet that FF will not have all my data ready to use again. You have to completely reboot to get it to completely load up again. This did not happen on versions before 3.0. You guys have any idea whats causing that. I mean its a real pain having to reboot your machine when you were ready to fire up FF and do your banking and other items of business and find you have to reboot. Whan it first happened I thought I had lost everything. It was a good thing I had Nortons password bank.

There are times when you dont even have to have FF open to have this problem occur. If you have a load on your box (CPU intensive applications such as Photoshop Audio Video apps etc. When you boot FF I have had the same problem (all content gone. This machine isnt ram starved , it has a gig of ram in it.
