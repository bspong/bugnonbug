Firefox is unusable if it will not retain the Automatically detect connection setting.

Under Tools/Options/Connections settings/ it automatically re-sets itself to "Manual proxy configuration," after being set to "Automatically detect proxy setting."  By doing this, it will not find a web site, ever.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Click on a link or put in a web site address
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
The requested URL could not be retrieved
While trying to retrieve the URL: http://www.webshots.com/
The following error was encountered:
    Unable to determine IP address from host name for www.webshots.com 
The dnsserver returned:
    Temporary network problem, please retry later 
This means that:
 The cache was not able to resolve the hostname presented in the URL. 
 Check if the address is correct. 
Your cache administrator is xuchao@tomonline-inc.com. 

Expected Results:  
The reason it can't find the web site address is because it has re-set itself to manual proxy configuration.  I have re-set it to automatically detect proxy configuration a dozen times and the very next time I try it, it has gone back to manual, and can't find the web page.

Should maintain the setting I put in there.  I don't know what caused this.  Yesterday both Internet Explorer and Firefox had to be re-set to "Automatically detect proxy configuration."  I don't know how they got changed.  No one else uses my computer, but Internet Explorer has retained the setting I gave it, and Firefox will not retain the setting.  Why not?  I even uninstalled Firefox and re-installed from the web site, but the problem continues.
