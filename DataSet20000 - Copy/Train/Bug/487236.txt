Occasionally Firefox 3.0.8 crashes without warning when clicking a link that opens in a new window
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.8) Gecko/2009032609 Firefox/3.0.8

The last time I clicked a link from http://uk.freeads.net (see steps to reproduce) which opened a photo in a new window in Firefox 3.0.8 it crashed Firefox without warning. Yet restoring Firefox to the original open tabs and clicking the same link again then opened the window without problems. Even loading in Safe Mode did not create any other issues.
There is no crash report.
This problem has only occurred in the last 2 versions of Firefox and I have been using Firefox for many years now. I have become so frustrated with it that I have searched the Internet and Firefox for similar problems but nothing recently quite matches my criteria.
All my AddOns load in the new version and are not creating any other issues.
Unfortunately it is not possible to narrow down the problem any further.
I have now changed the value of browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction in about:config from 2 to 0 so that opening the link now opens it in a new tab.
I already have tools / options / tabs set to open links that open a new window to open in a new tab but it seems that Firefox ignores this when the page author has specified the window to open a specific size.
Links now open in a new tab. I shall monitor this and report back if the problems still arises.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://leisure.uk.freeads.net/health_+_fitness/therapy/8880/professional-californian-full-body-massage/view
2. Click on the large picture adjacent to text Professional Californian Full Body Massage. 
3. When Javascript attempts to open the picture in a new smaller window in the top left of the screen Firefox crashes.
Actual Results:  
Firefox crashed.

Expected Results:  
On the second attempt after re-loading Firefox the window loaded without any problem and all as expected.

I could not find an event in Microsoft Administration Tools that was relevant to the crash.
I have used the http://uk.freeads.net site for a good many years and have not experienced any problems in Firefox version 2 whatsoever.

I am using the following AddOns.
The ones marked with a star are the more recent additions but they were certainly not added in Firefox 3.0.7 or 3.0.8 where the issue arises.

AdBlock Plus 1.0.1
AI Roboform Toolbar 6.9.93
British English Dictionary 1.19
Calling ID 1.1.0.80*
Change 0.0.0.10
Dafizilla Table2Clipboard 0.2.1
Finjan Secure Browsing 1.314*
FoxClocks 2.5.11
Google PageRankStatus 0.9.9
Handy Xtra Stuf 3.0.0
IE View 1.4.1
Java Quick Starter 1.0
McAfee Site Advisor 26.6
Norton IPS 1.0*
Norton Toolbar 3.5 (disabled)*
Speed Dial 0.9.0.
Tab Mix Plus 0.3.7.3
Word Count Plus 1.2.3

I did not report the crashes in 3.0.7 because the new version was imminent and I thought that I would wait to see if this resolved the issue.

I am not sure if it is relevant to this problem but I have Firefox set to notify me of new updates but it does not notify me.
