Firefox repeatedly crashing X server
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071022 Ubuntu/7.10 (gutsy) Firefox/2.0.0.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071022 Ubuntu/7.10 (gutsy) Firefox/2.0.0.8

Seems in Linux/Ubuntu Gutsy if you click on a link then highlight text while the page is loading, everything freezes on Firefox and the computer, including all panel widgets (my Wanda the Fish animation stops, as does the clock), but the mouse will still work. I'm not able to SSH in to the PC because I'm fairly new to Linux but I suspect this is a crash of the X server or a system component. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on a web link.
2. While the page is loading, and still on the original page, click on another link or highlight text. 
3. Reboot and continue with work. System seems unaffected after this crash. 
Actual Results:  
Everything stopped, including the clock and my Wanda animation. Mouse still moves though, but no system beeps from holding down 10 keys at a time. 

Expected Results:  
Nothing really. On Windows, you'd just get highlighting or going to the other page you clicked. 

Default theme, Ubuntu Linux Gutsy (not beta), Firefox 2.0.0.9. Emerald theme manager. Compiz with some add ons, but mostly stable ones. No problems without using Firefox.
