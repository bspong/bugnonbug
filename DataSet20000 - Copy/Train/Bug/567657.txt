Unresolved automatic proxy does not work with plugins / external apps (when firefox is default browser)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I use a corporate network automatic proxy (.pac) when I'm connected to a VPN. When I'm not on the VPN, the .pac proxy doesn't exist and it defaults to no proxy.

This does NOT happen for plugins (e.g. Java). E.g. when I use webex.com to start a webex session it is not able to establish a session because of the automatic proxy. I need to disable the automatic proxy for the webex session to work. This works fine in IE 8.0 but doesn't work in Firefox 3.6.3.

This is a huge problem because when Firefox is the default browser, ALL applications use Firefox proxy settings and none of them work due to this problem. If IE is made the default browser, this problem doesn't occur.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup a automatic proxy (.pac) that doesn't resolve
2. Create an account on webex.com
3. Try to host a meeting on webex.com
Actual Results:  
not able to establish a connection.

Expected Results:  
Should ignore unresolved proxy and default to no proxy
