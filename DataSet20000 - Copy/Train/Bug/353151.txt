Java scripts fail to load web pages when using ES Proxy server
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; ru; rv:1.8.1b2) Gecko/20060821 Firefox/2.0b2

I am using ES Proxy server for Internet access.
Some Java scripts load respective web pages into the browser. There are such scripts that fail to load pages using ES Proxy server. When a certain Java script tries to load a specific page, the browser window gets clear and then the loading stops. Some pages can be loaded hereafter by pressing Enter or F5 key but other pages require data from the correspondent Java script and can't be loaded.
When accessing Internet directly (without proxy), all these Java scripts load the pages without problem. These scripts also load the pages successfully when using MS Internet Explorer with ES Proxy Server and when using Firefox with AnalogX Proxy server.
The problem appears when using Firefox with ES Proxy server. I think, Gecko/20060821 needs to be corrected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the file http://ln.com.ua/~vendor/progs/ESPSRV.EXE;
2. Install ES Proxy server running the command line "ESPSRV.EXE INSTALL" (when needed, detailed instructions in Russian are available at http://www.esproxy.org.ua/);
3. Run ES Proxy server using Windows Services manager;
4. Configure Firefox to use ES Proxy server (its port is 3128 by default);
5. Load the following page to the Firefox browser: http://software.canon-europe.com/Printers/Laser_Beam_Printers/LaserShot_LBP1120524.asp
6. Select a certain operating system and language in the correspondent combo boxes (my example: Operating system: Windows; Language: Russian);
7. Activate "Submit" button (status bar shows: "javascript:filterSoftware();").
Actual Results:  
The page gets clear, then the loading stops, and the page remains clear.

Expected Results:  
The page has to get clear and then to show the list of drivers for Windows OS and with Russian user interface.

This problem also appears when using Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; ru-RU; rv:1.8.0.5) Gecko/20060706 K-Meleon/1.0 with ES Proxy server, therefore I think that it is caused by Gecko engine.
