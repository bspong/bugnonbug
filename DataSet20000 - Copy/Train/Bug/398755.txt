Request is submitted twice with a 1 second gap causing error on the client (data loss).
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; InfoPath.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: 1.5.0.9

The problem happens when the user clicks on the link in the attached HTML: <a href="<%=encodeURLWithSID(request, response, sLink)%>">
<img src=../images/leftArrow.gif width=10 height=10 border=0></a><%=sValue%>&nbsp;</nobr>

Our application has links in it and when you click in them multiple times, after a few attempts Firefox would submit the same request twice with a 1 second gap.  So the server gets the first request  and it starts working on it, it gets another request half way through for the  same session and it thinks that client wants to collect the results. That part  fails because the server is still executing the first request. So that causes an  error on the client.
Note that we do not click on the link twice, and it doesn't happen every time we click on the link.
Attached please find the HTML of the page, and the access.log from apache which shows the extra requests coming from the same link.

Thanks,
