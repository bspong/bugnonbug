www.m-w.com is an online dictionary.
When you query a word in the dictionary, it gives you the meaning and next to
the original word there is a small audio icon in red.
If you hit that icon then a new window pops up and you can hear the word
pronounced (if you are using IE).
Firefox pops up a new window, but then the window does nothing.
At the bottom of the window there is a message
	
"Having trouble hearing a pronunciation?
* Click here to listen with your default audio player.
* See the Audio Pronunciation FAQ."

and if you click on "Click here to listen with your default..."
Then it opens up Real Media Player (which happens to be my default) and plays
the pronunciation.

IE recognises the fact that Real Player is my default media player.
It plays the file as soon as the window opens and you dont have to click on any
part of "Having trouble hearing........."

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto www.m-w.com
2. Type in a word into the dictionary box (say "bug")
3. Click the red Audio icon next to "bug"

Actual Results:  
A new window opens up.
There is no sound.
If you click on
* Click here to listen with your default audio player.
Then it opens up your default audio player and plays the sound in that.

Expected Results:  
A new window opens up.
You hear the pronunciation.
And it should not open up an audio player.
