Live bookmarks need 15 minutes to reload if connection drops before the first update

I get this error message in all the RSS feeds I've subscribed when I start Firefox with no internet connection (which is obvious).
The strange thing is that the feeds aren't reloaded even after I get an internet connection and restart firefox too quickly, so it seems like on the second start (when an internet connection IS available) firefox doesn't try to reload the rss feeds, so I have to manually reload them one by one.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open firefox with no internet connection available: no live bookmark is loaded, error message is displayed instead
2.Connect to the internet
3.Close firefox and re-open it quickly (not too quickly, else you get the "another instance is already running" dialog)
4.Even if an internet connection is now available, Firefox doesn't try to reload the feeds at startup, you have to do it manually, or wait some seconds more before restarting it
Actual Results:  
Live feeds don't reload even when connected to the internet and firefox has been restarted (quickly)

Expected Results:  
Firefox should always try to reload live feeds on startup, even if another instance has been closed only a few seconds before.
