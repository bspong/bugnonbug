Consistent system performance degradation running Firefox - high CPU & memory usage by idle Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.0 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.195.6 Safari/532.0

Consistently over the period of the past several weeks I've noticed that my system performance will degrade over time with Firefox running.  When I check the process stack, Firefox.exe with as little as two tabs open (Gmail & Autodesk homepage for example) will be using 50% of CPU and over 170K of available memory.   This system performs well otherwise.  This system is Virus & Malware free.  Problem is easily reproduced and results in my daily close of Firefox and switching to less secure Chrome to continue web-related activities.  My environment is as follows.  As far as I know/can tell all items are up to date and legit.  Please advise

Vista Home Premium 32bit + Service Pack 1
Intel Pentium Dual T2330 @ 1.60GHz

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firefox as configured above
2. Note general system wide performance degradation over time.
3. Check process stack, not Firefox.exe running 50%+/- CPU usage and high memory footprint
3. Kill firefox, note immediate return to normal system wide performance.
Actual Results:  
Severe system wide performance degradation with firefox.exe as root cause 

Expected Results:  
Normal operation.  Firefox using minimal CPU / memory when idle with few tabs

I suspect something in cocktail of plug-ins/extensions causing firefox.exe to misbehave, but all plugins & extensions are legitimate and required by this user..  so disabling them without clear justification is not an option.
