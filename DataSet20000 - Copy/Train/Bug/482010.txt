When the "Warn me when closing multiple tabs" tickbox is ticked, clicking the close "X" icon at the top right of the window shuts the browser down.

I am using:

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.7) Gecko/2009021910 Firefox/3.0.7 on Windows Vista Home platform with multiple User accounts.

Yesterday (Thur, 6 March 2009) my Firefox browser ran the latest upgrade. Since then, when I close the browser with multiple tabs open, the pop up box asking me to save tabs, no longer appears.

I have looked in the Options --> Tabs and the "Warn me when closing multiple tabs" tickbox does not make any difference whether it is "ticked" or not. When I clicking the close icon "X" at the top right of the window, the browser still shuts down. This worked prior to the upgrade.

The odd thing that is happening, is that on another account on the same pc with the same upgrade showing, the correct closure box appears.
