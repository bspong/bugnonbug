when Firefox crashes and the tabs comes back (the page shows to either restore or new), the Address bar can't be change.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/2.0.0.14;MEGAUPLOAD 1.0 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

well, the thing is that first I tried to watch a youtube video with Close Caption but it froze (reported in another problem). so them when it restarts and I get the page where it says that to either Restore section or to Start new one (that it shows the pages too), the address bar goes like a light-black color and you can't write anything at all. 
It is very difficult to work like this.
I have 3 tabs open right now, and they all have the non-writing Address bar.
This only happens when it crashes and put as Restore ONLY when that page that shows the tabs opened occurs. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.make firefox crash (ex:I use the bug that occurs when I press "Translate" in where the Close Captions are in a youtube video)
2.Restart firefox
3.make sure the page that shows the info and that it includes the tabs oppened before and if you want to "Restore" or Start new"
4.press "Restore Section" in that page.
Actual Results:  
the address bar goes to a light-black color, and you can't write anything in it.

Expected Results:  
the address bar SHOULD work property like others version before 3.5.2

I was ussing a normal theme. Note that this is the new one that just came out, the 3.5.2
