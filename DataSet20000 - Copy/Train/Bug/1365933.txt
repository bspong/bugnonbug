Update and Restart loses window data, displays broken tabs (with "TypeError: tabData.entries[activeIndex] is undefined")
I clicked on the button to restart and update my browser. Instead of successfully restarting, the browser closed and did not restart. When I started it again, one of my windows did not restore correctly, instead having a couple of "New Tab" tabs, and a bunch of tabs which have no text on them. When they are clicked on they change their name to "New Tab" and render about:blank.

I opened the browser console,a nd noticed that the following error occured within SessionStore - I imagine that this was caused by failing to write out sessionstore when restarting? perhaps I had too many tabs open and writing out sessionstore was interrupted or similar?

We should definitely handle the case where sessionstore raises an exception while restoring a window better. At the very least this should instead show a page which says "sorry, we failed to restore your tabs"

A promise chain failed to handle a rejection. Did you forget to '.catch', or did you forget to 'return'?
