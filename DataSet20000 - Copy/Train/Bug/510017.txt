Firefox hangs while trying to rename sessionstore-1.js during AV scan
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

As a precondition I'd like to state that I have absolutely no control over the AV program installed on my machine (McAfee). Every time Firefox creates a temporary sessionstore-1.js file and immediately tries to rename it to sessionstore.js the AV program locks the file while it's being scanned and Firefox just locks up using 100% of the CPU core the process is running on. The behavior was not present before FF 3.5 and it's really annoying. I've set browser.sessionstore.interval to 6 minutes so I don't have to suffer from the glitch every 10 seconds as the default config would have it. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox and have McAfee "scan on read/write" activated
2. Make sure the browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash is set to true and that browser.sessionstore.interval is the default 10 seconds (10000)
3. Browse the Web, open new tabs, scroll down some pages, click some links, etc 
Actual Results:  
Every 10 seconds you get a 2 second lock-up while Firefox tries to rename sessionstore-1.js while the AV scans the file

Expected Results:  
Don't have my browser lock-up because it can't rename a temporary file right away.

I've read in some forums that sessionstore cant get incredibly big (50Mb and more). I've checked mine and it's only about 150Kb.

The workaround is to greatly increase the interval so as to have the problem occur as infrequently as possible or to set browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash to false and in both cases you can't really expect to "resume from a crash" with your tab intact.
