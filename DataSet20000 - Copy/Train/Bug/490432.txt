Ebay "forgets" I'm logged in between summary screen and item screen. Cookies?

I am an eBay seller.  Recently I put a batch of items up for sale.  I am logging on to the eBay system.  I can look at my list of items for sale and at the top of the screen, I am shown as being signed in.

If I then select one of my items to view, the message at the top of the screen implies that I am no longer treated as being signed in and asks me to sign in again.  The result is that I can never look at my actual item details from a seller's perspective, only that of a general third party user.

Returning back to the summary screen, I am magically signed back in again.

I have downloaded the 'Op...' browser and this does not have the same problem.  Is there some kind of issue with cookies going on here?  I used eBay quite a bit with FF v2 and this worked OK so at some point an anomaly has crept in.

TIA
Ian

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in to ebay
2. View summary of items for sale
3. Select an item to view
4. I am no longer signed in
5. Return to summary screen
6. I am signed in again
Actual Results:  
As implied

Expected Results:  
As implied.

I should remain signed in between summary and item screens as I am with the "Op..." browser.  A Win machine I use at work using IE(v?) also delivers the expected behaviour.

I cannot use FF3 for my eBay selling activities.
