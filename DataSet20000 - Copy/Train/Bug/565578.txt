Performance rapidly degrades, and eventually starts dragging down all of OS X
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_3; en-us) AppleWebKit/531.22.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.5 Safari/531.22.7

At first this seemed similar to Bug 554689. However, it is not the same. I had severe problems with Firefox a number of months back, that got so severe that I stopped using it and switched to Safari for several months. Then the problem was apparently fixed and I resumed using Firefox, which I have now been using for several months.

However, in the last week or two, the type of symptoms has apparently returned.

Please note, this is on OS X 10.6.3.

The problem gets really bad after only a couple of hours since loading Firefox. I see in Activity Monitor that Firefox is using a lot of CPU, and the whole system is slow. After quitting Firefox, the system speeds up. Often I have to Force-Quit at this point, as it won't just exit on its own. And after restarting Firefox, it is initially responsive, but the cycle repeats in a few hours, as stated.

So for now I am forced back to Safari, as the pattern is that soon after restarting Firefox, it gets really slow. Slow to load pages, slow to respond to clicks on its controls.

Here are the installed Addons:

1Password 3.1.2
Firebug 1.5.4
Google Toolbar for Firefox 7.0.20100326M
Keyfixer 0.4.3
Xmarks 3.6.14

I am reporting this in the hope that it helps, as Firefox is (normally) my preferred browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox
2.Use it for a few hours.
3.Force-Quit Firefox and go to step 1.
Actual Results:  
Performance of Firefox becomes unacceptable, and the whole OS does too.

Expected Results:  
Performance of Firefox and OS X should remain stable and acceptable.

I have given the Severity as Major. But the actual result for me is the workaround of not using Firefox. You decide how severe you consider that, as for me, the workaround is acceptable but not preferred, whereas for Mozilla, it could be a show stopper.
