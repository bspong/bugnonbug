"Warning: function onKeyPress does not always return a value" for autocomplete.xml
Just noticed an 2 warning messages (for one underlying issue) in my error console that looked worth filing.

The errors are:
{
> Timestamp: 05/24/2012 10:29:26 AM
> Warning: function onKeyPress does not always return a value
> Source File: chrome://global/content/bindings/autocomplete.xml
> Line: 439, Column: 12
> Source Code:
>            return false; 
}
...and...
{

> Source File: chrome://global/content/bindings/autocomplete.xml
> Line: 503, Column: 10
> Source Code:
>           return true; 
}

It looks like "onKeyPress" has both a naked "return;" statement as well as "return false" / "return true", which is why we're warning.

e.g: line 439 vs 443 here, from MXR:
> 433       <!-- ::::::::::::: key handling ::::::::::::: -->
> 434 
> 435       <method name="onKeyPress">
> 436         <parameter name="aEvent"/>
> 437         <body><![CDATA[
> 438           if (aEvent.target.localName != "textbox")
> 439             return;  // Let child buttons of autocomplete take input
> 440 
> 441           //XXXpch this is so bogus...
> 442           if (aEvent.defaultPrevented)
> 443             return false;

I'm setting this as blocking bug 407359, which added the naked "return" statement.

I don't know this code at all, but I'm guessing we want "return false" instead of "return"?
