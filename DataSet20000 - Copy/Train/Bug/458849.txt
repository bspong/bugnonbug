In the Privacy pane of preferences, I uncheck "Keep my history for at least ... days" (where ... is anything, e.g., 0).  In the same pane, I clear private data, including history. I then visit the URL of a file such as a PDF file.  "Show All History" then shows that the URL has been saved to History.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Preferences.
2. Select the Privacy pane.
3. Uncheck the box "Keep my history for at least ... days".
4. Click "Clear Now" (making sure that all history items are selected to be cleared)
5. Select "Show All History" under the History menu - history is empty.
6. Close the History window.
7. Visit http://www-math.mit.edu/~poonen/slides/cantrell3.pdf  (or any other PDF file online)
8. Select "Show All History" under the History menu.
Actual Results:  
cantrell3.pdf shows up in the History window.

Expected Results:  
History should still be empty, since "Keep my history..." was unchecked.

Unchecking "Keep my history" should mean that no history is saved.
Setting the number of days for history to be saved to 0 should have the same effect.
