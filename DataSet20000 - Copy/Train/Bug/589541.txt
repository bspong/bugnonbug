Transparent Tabs, Transparent Title Bar Text

Occasionally (perhaps once a day) Firefox 4.0b3 will begin rendering the tabs with a transparent background (such that the tab background is the Windows Desktop) and the Title Bar will change from the standard glass bar to the non-Aero "Windows Basic" style bar, with transparent text. The new "Firefox" menu will disappear and there may or may not be a ~10px line of graphical corruption at the top of the content rendering space. For the tab and menu bar corruption I have attached an image to demonstrate.

There is no clear way to reproduce this, and no clear way to resolve it short of closing and re-opening Firefox. If you try the maximize button twice (so to go from fullscreen to fullscreen window) the proper skinning returns to title bar and tab background, however the corruption isn't actually gone. The window appears to have issues adjusting size because the standard min-max-close windows buttons do not properly adjust their position. After switching between fullscreen modes, the buttons come in two modes with the non-Aero buttons being rendered on TOP of the Aero buttons, with the non-Aero buttons being the active ones and their location can be slightly above the tab space (that is your mouse is hovering over both a window button and a tab button, although the window button takes priority). I have also attached an image to try and show this window button behavior.
