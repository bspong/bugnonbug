In my extension on a onclick event, a xul window will open with 3 buttons.
One resulting in an alert box, one resulting in canceling the current box and one, which opens up another xul window.
The problem now is, that on hovering over the second xul window it immediately closes. I have no eventlisteners. It is just the code in the onclick event which calls up the seconx window.


I experience this error only with firefox 4, but with windows XP, windows 7 and Linux/Mint.

I tried every window separately and it works.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.install my extension: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5581/aflattr.xpi
2.in the tools menu click aflattr preferences and type in something, doesn't matter.
3.then reopen it the same way and the mentioned window with the 3 buttons will appear. click the middle one in firefox 4 and on hovering it will dissappear. 
Actual Results:  
Second window is closing on hovering (i tried different locations of the window. So I'm sure it's hovering.

Expected Results:  
The second window shouldn't be closed at all. Firefox 3.6 is fine so. It's a firefox 4 problem.
