Opening external URIs sometimes moves firefox window
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071022 Ubuntu/7.10 (gutsy) Firefox/2.0.0.8

With firefox already running on another workspace on my desktop:

1) Normally, "firefox http://www" leaves the window where it is, and opens a new tab with the given URI. I can then see this page by changing workspace. This is the desired behaviour.

2) If I do some work in thunderbird, running the same command causes the firefox window to pop onto my current desktop. It appears that firefox no longer believes that it is the active application, so feels the need to move its window about.

Exactly the same behaviour occurs with "firefox -remote openURI(http://www)".

Relevant config settings:
browser.link.open_external=3
browser.tabs.loadDivertedInBackground=false

It may or may not be relevant, but I'm using the XFCE window manager.
