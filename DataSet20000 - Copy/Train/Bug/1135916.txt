[e10s] "Copy Email Address" in remote browser causes unsafe CPOW usage warning
+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1133577 +++

STR:

1) Visit a site with a mailto: link on it in an e10s window
2) Right-click on the mailto: link, and choose "Copy Email Address"

This causes an "unsafe CPOW usage" warning in the Browser Console.

In browser/base/content/nsContextMenu.js:

  // Generate email address and put it on clipboard.
  copyEmail: function() {
    // Copy the comma-separated list of email addresses only.
    // There are other ways of embedding email addresses in a mailto:
    // link, but such complex parsing is beyond us.
    var url = this.linkURL;
    var qmark = url.indexOf("?");
    var addresses;

    // 7 == length of "mailto:"
    addresses = qmark > 7 ? url.substring(7, qmark) : url.substr(7);

    // Let's try to unescape it using a character set
    // in case the address is not ASCII.
    try {
      var characterSet = this.target.ownerDocument.characterSet; <- Causes CPOW warning
      const textToSubURI = Cc["@mozilla.org/intl/texttosuburi;1"].
                           getService(Ci.nsITextToSubURI);
      addresses = textToSubURI.unEscapeURIForUI(characterSet, addresses);
    }
    catch(ex) {
      // Do nothing.
    }

    var clipboard = Cc["@mozilla.org/widget/clipboardhelper;1"].
                    getService(Ci.nsIClipboardHelper);
    clipboard.copyString(addresses, document);
  },
