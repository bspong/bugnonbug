After running a Private Browsing session and closing Firefox, Firefox reopens in Private Browsing mode. This behavior seems to start after invoking Private Browsing with the Ctl+Shift+P methodology for the first time. The behavior was initially fine when invoking Private Browsing from the menu item bar. Now invoking Private Browsing in that manner is also broken in terms of Firefox erroneously reopening in Private Browsing.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox
2. Invoke Private Browsing via Ctl+Shift+P
3. Close Firefox
4. Reopen Firefox and verify Firefox is still in Private Browsing
Actual Results:  
Firefox remains in Private Browsing mode

Expected Results:  
Firefox should be in normal browsing mode
