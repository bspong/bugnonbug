I have a sidebar extension which makes heavy use by dragging and dropping something from webpages onto this sidebar. I took me a while to find out that there's no problem with my code, I figured this out:
- When dragging multiple links everything work's as expected.
- When dragging a single link on a control which doesn't support drag&drop by default the the dragged page is loaded into the sidebar.
- This happens not only to my extension, even to bookmarks and history sidebars.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load http://google.com
2. Show Bookmarks in sidebar
3. Drag a link from the website onto the "Search" label of bookmarks

Actual Results:  
The sidebar Title remains unchanged (It says for example Bookmarks/History although a web site is loaded)

Expected Results:  
Nothing should happen if something is dragged into the sidebar area.


If dragging&dropping is desired behavior there should be options for sidebars to protect against
To avoid the confusion, the drag&drop website feature imo should be restricted to the side-bar title.
The title of the sidebar should change to something like "Displaying Website".
Right clicking the sidebar title could offer the sidebar menu for quick exchange.
