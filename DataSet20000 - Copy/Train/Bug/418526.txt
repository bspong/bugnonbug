Switching between tabs is lagged on pages with heavy JavaScript

SYSTEM CONFIGURATION:
=====================

- AMD Athlon 3200+ Processor
- 1.5 GB RAM
- Windows XP Professional (fully patched)
- Firefox 2.0.0.12

When using tabbed browsing, switching from a regular HTML page or an HTML page with little JavaScript to one with a nominal amount of JavaScript takes an excessively long time (upwards of 5 seconds). This happens even with all Firefox extensions disabled and on multiple sites.

ADDITIONAL DETAILS
===================

Additional details and a demonstration of the issue can be seen in the video referenced within this bug report.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox with several tabs (one of which containing a heavily javascripted page)

2. Switch between other tabs and note the delay in switching tabs.

3. Switch to the tab containing the Javascripted page and notice the added delay
Actual Results:  
There was a noticeably extended delay when the browser switched to the tab containing the page with javascript.

Expected Results:  
A slightly slower response as the browser parsed the script but not substantially slower (over 5 seconds on a page that had already been rendered within the tab)
