Tooltip for disabled toolbar item should explain why it's disabled

When hovering over a disabled toolbar button (e.g. the Stop button once a page
has finished loading), the tooltip (Stop Loading this Page) still appears. This
is true for all other buttons on this toolbar.

I think that disabled buttons should display one of the following:
 1. "Button Disabled"
 2. "<Standard Tooltip> (Disabled)" (e.g. "Stop Loading this page (disabled)")
 3. "<Explanation into why button disabled>" (e.g. "The Stop button is disabled
as the page is fully loaded")

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ensure a toolbar button is disabled (e.g. Stop button once a page has
finished loading)
2. Hover over the stop button
3. View tooltip

Actual Results:  
Stop button shows the standard tooltip ... 'stop loading this page'

Expected Results:  
Stop button should show something else (outlined above).

As already mentioned, this is true for all toolbar buttons. I have only used the
stop button as an example.
