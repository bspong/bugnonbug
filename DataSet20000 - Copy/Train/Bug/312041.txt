"Auto-detect proxy settings" and the autodetected proxy becomes unavailable
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux ppc; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20051002 Firefox/1.0.7
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux ppc; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20051002 Firefox/1.0.7

Setting the automatic detection of Firefox, the browser tries to resolve
wpad.domain.tld until it finds a record pointing to a webserver hosting a
wpad.dat autoconfiguration script. This works.

The problem is with laptops users, who often change location, and then internet
access (e.g. from a WiFi net to another), sometimes not closing Firefox, just
suspending the machine.

When the laptop is woken and gets access to another network, Firefox still holds
the parameters for the old network, and trying to access any website will result
in the "The proxy server you have configured cannot be found" message box.

When this happens _and_ in auto-detect proxy settings mode, Firefox should try
and re-detect the proxy settings (keeping in mind that this might not be the
same network, so the domain.tld might have changed) and, failing that, fallback
to the no-proxy configuration

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox in a network (say domain1.tld) with
http://wpad.domain1.tld/wpad.dat. Firefox then sets its proxy settings according
to this script.
2. Suspend the machine without exiting Firefox
3. Plug the machine to another network (say domain2.tld)
Actual Results:  
Trying and access any website with Firefox will result in "The proxy server you
have configured cannot be found"

Expected Results:  
Firefox goes through detection of the proxy parameters again:
1. resolves wpad.domain2.tld and, if it exists, get http://wpad.domain2.tld/wpad.dat
2. falls back to direct connection to the internet
3. displays an error message _only_ if all of the above has failed
