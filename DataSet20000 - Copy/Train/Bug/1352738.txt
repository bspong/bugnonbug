Container Tabs 'Learn More' link should be on the same line as the 'Enable Container Tabs' checkbox
Today's Nightly had a severe regression in Preferences. It's very hard to find settings right now, and some settings appear in panes with a description that doesn't have anything to do with them.

1) Search settings are very important, yet lumped into the middle of "General", aside a small part, that has got nothing to do with Privacy And Security, yet is in the middle of that pane (Location Bar), and has to link back to the middle of General (which is an indication we don't actually expect people to manage to find the other settings by themselves...)

2) "Reports" is in "Updates" yet obviously has nothing whatsoever to do with it.

3) Proxy (Connection) settings probably doesn't belong in "Privacy And Security", mainly because it's a setting some people will need to get on the internet at all.

4) "Cached Web Content" is in "Privacy and Security". The link here is weird at best.

5) "Site Data" appears to be entirely broken. Buttons display awkwardly on the right, clicking "Settings" has no effect.

6) Some display aspects are totally inconsistent. Look at DRM Content vs Container Tabs, and note the positioning of "Learn More".

In general lumping everything together in a few huge categories also means that one has to do a lot of scrolling to find anything now, rather than clicking categories and seeing everything at a glance.

I think we at least need a "Search" pane, probably a "Display and Language pane", and something like a "Stored Data" pane. Probably other sane orderings are possible, but anything is better than just lumping everything together.
