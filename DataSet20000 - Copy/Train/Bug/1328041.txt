Flash plugin notification briefly appears and disappears, causing content on the page to twitch
>>>   My Info:   Win7_64, Nightly 49, 32bit, ID 20160526082509
STR_1 (A):
0. Set Flash to "Ask to activate" or intall an obsolete version of Flash
1. Open  http://dagobah.net/flash/lolicatgirls.swf  in a new selected tab, wait until the page loads
2. Open new tab, then reload the tab from Step 1 via context menu. Wait until the tab loads
3. Switch to tab from Step 1

STR_1 (B) [good]:
0. Set Flash to "Ask to activate" or intall an obsolete version of Flash
1. Open  http://dagobah.net/flash/lolicatgirls.swf  in a new selected tab, wait until the page loads


AR:  Plugin notification appears and disappears, so content on the page twitches (STR_1 (A))
ER:  Either X or Y  (i.e. please leave content along)
 X) No Flash plugin notification at all
 Y) Flash plugin notificaion shouldn't disappear

Notes:
 1) Marked as regression, because at some point (bug932854) content started to twitch w/o clear reason
 2) As you can see from STR_1 (B), dagobah.net normally opens plugin notification and doesn't close it

This is regression from bug 932854 (see Note 2). Regression range:
