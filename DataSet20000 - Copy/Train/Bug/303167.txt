Display of Submenus from Right-Click Context Menu Entries (Added by Extensions) Enable Back and Forward Context Menu Entries, Even If the Current Page Has No Back/Forward History

When making use of the entries in the right-click context menu, the Back and
Forward menu entries are only enabled if the currently-viewed page has a
back/foward history - otherwise, those menu entries are disabled.

However, if an extension is installed that adds a context menu entry that
contains a submenu, and the cursor is placed over that entry to expand the
submenu, then both the Back and Forward context menu entries are enabled,
regardless of whether or not the page has a back/forward history.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install an extension that will add a right-click context menu entry that
contains a submenu for more functions (such as Tab Mix Plus, Linky, View
Formatted Source, etc.).
2. Right-click on a page that either has no history, or either back or forward
history (but not both).
3. Move your cursor over one of the extension-added context menu entries that
has a submenu.
Actual Results:  
The Back and Forward entries are both enabled, regardless of whether or not the
page has a back/forward history.

Expected Results:  
The Back and Forward entries should only be enabled if the page has a
back/forward history - otherwise, they should remain disabled.
