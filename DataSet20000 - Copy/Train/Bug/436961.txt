firefox improperly applies standards compliance mode based on DTD not errors in page

If there is a valid DTD at the beginning of the (x)htm(l) file, firefox assumes it's a valid file, even when gecko reports invalid code. As a result, the invalid website is parsed in standards compliance mode instead of quirks mode. If IE starts requiring DTDs (for invalid, MSIE compatible code), quirks mode won't work at all because it will never be triggered. To reproduce:

I KNOW what a DTD is. It means "I am using valid code of format foo." But if the code is not valid (and the DTD is), surely it makes sense to switch to quirks mode? Suppose Microsoft changed MSIE to require a DTD? The web designers would figure this out and spread it by way of blog, and all of a sudden, the Internet (tm) doesn't work on firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0. have a standards incompliant html authoring program installed (e.g. Dreamweaver)
1. Make a fairly complex web page/site (offline of course)
2. Confirm the presence of and/or add a valid doctype declaration per the instructions somewhere at www.w3c.org
3. View the page in Firefox. Check the page properties (right click -> view page info). 
Actual Results:  
It will be in "standards compliance mode." 

Expected Results:  
Since your page is littered with invalid code, it should have switched to quirks mode at some point during rendering.

I wasn't entirely certain what to set severity to, so I left it at Normal.  You might even call this an enhancement, if you look at it the right way...
