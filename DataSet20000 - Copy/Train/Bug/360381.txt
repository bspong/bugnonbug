site_icons cause uncached images to be loaded twice or thrice (if bookmarked)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909

If browser.chrome.site_icons and tabbed browsing is enabled and you retrieve an
image via a script (uncached) the image is loaded twice. If you add a bookmark to
the URL and retrieve it again it will be loaded three times from the webserver.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Put an arbitrary jpeg-image (named j.jpg) on your server. Enable CGI.
2. put the delivery script p.pl into the directory where you
   put the image:
--- p.pl ----
#!/usr/bin/perl
use CGI qw/:standard/;
print header(-type => 'image/jpeg');
open(J,'<j.jpg');
read J, $b, 1000000;
print $b;
--- end p.pl ---
3. set browser.chrome.site_icons to true and retrieve the URL (p.pl)
   with firefox. Count the lines in the webserer log.
4. Bookmark the URL and retrieve the URL again. Count the lines in the webserver
   log.
Actual Results:  
3. 2 GETs are logged
4. 3 GETs are logged

Expected Results:  
The image shall be loaded *once* regardless of site_icon settings or existence of bookmarks.

Does this behaviour reveal whether the user has bookmarked some URL?
Is this a potential privacy issue?

Workaround: set browser.chrome.site_icons to false  :-(
