FF crashes when I try to access the sigmakappa-phoenix.org website
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1

Up until  5 days ago I could access the website with no problem.  Now when I try to do the same thing, the browser crashes.  I can pull the same site up on MSIE, so it is a valid website and functioning properly.

I thought it was an add-on problem, so I got rid of all add-ons.  No help.  Then I reloaded another copy of FF, newest version, thinking any bugs would clear out.  No help.

I checked the security system for both Windows Vista, the HP desktop I am using and Trendmicro security software.  I am not the swift when it comes to diagnostics so I amy have missed doing something that would have helped the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open FF.  Type in http://www.sigmakappa-phoenix.org
2. Click on Enter.  Wait, Screen goes to muted white and a MS dialog box shows up telling me that Windows is closing FF, also offering to find a solution online.
3.Browser closes.
Actual Results:  
The Windows dialog box states that Windows" Data Execution Prevention has closed FF. Then the browser closes.

Expected Results:  
FF should be able to open http://www.sigmakappa-phoenix.org, as it had done previously (past 5 days ago).

I also tried opening FF in safe mode. Still had the same problem.  :-(
