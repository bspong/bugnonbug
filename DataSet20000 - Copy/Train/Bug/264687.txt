this page makes Firefox hang
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1

The summary says it all.  Same thing happens in Netscape 6.2, but it works in IE
6.  Probably something is wrong with the page, but even so, Firefox shouldn't hang.

The URL redirects to http://planet.nana.co.il/0090/, Firefox hangs there, too,
so it's not the redirect.

Other pages on the site, e.g http://planet.nana.co.il/00901/index.htm also hang
Firefox.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. just visit the site.


Actual Results:  
Firefox appears in Task Manager as "Not Responding".  Nothing works but Alt-F4.

Each time this happens, a new Java Console icon appears in the system tray,
moving the mouse over the icons makes the old ones vanish.  I don't know what
the Java Console can do, I've never tried to use it, but I can't get it to do
anything once Firefox is hung, so perhaps it's hung by whatever hangs Firefox.

Expected Results:  
Displayed the page, or if the page is faulty, displayed an indication of the
problem (which I could send to the page maintainer) but not hang.

This is not my website.  I am also emailing the contact for the site,
aplaton10@hotmail.com about this.

I set severity to Critical, because Firefox hangs.
