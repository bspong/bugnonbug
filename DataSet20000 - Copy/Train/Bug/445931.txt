Using trackpad to click the cursor on the down arrow results in an incorrect response.

At the lower right side of the page there are up and down arrows.

In prior versions one could navigate up and down the page by clicking on the cursor.   That doesn't work anymore.   Now the NYT page gives you a pop up designed to help if you click on any of the words on the page.   That shouldn't be popping up blank when the up/down navigation arrows are clicked on.

Obviously there are other ways to navigate the page; but it's annoying and the old version worked fine in this regard.

I haven't encountered this on any other site but the NYT.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to nyt.com
2.bring cursor to the navigation up/down arrows.
3.Use trackpad/mouse to click on arrows to navigate page up/down.
Actual Results:  
Pop up appears as if you had clicked on a word in the body of the page.

Expected Results:  
Same as above.

This started with the 3 release and hasn't improved with the new one.   I assumed it would be fixed as it seems a minor issue.

I have zero html/technical skills.  Just came here to let someone know about this relatively minor, but annoying,  glitch/bug.

Thanks
