Dragging in "add a bookmark" -> "Name"  dialog or anywhere in "bookmarks manager" causes firefox to crash.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040207 Firefox/0.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8a6) Gecko/20041212 Firefox/1.0+

I have just installed Firefox 1.0 (latest nightly build) on a redhat 9.0 box.

On dragging within bookmark dialogs as described below in "steps to reproduce"
firefox dies with the following error.

./firefox-bin: relocation error:
/usr/local/staden_linux_2003.0b1/lib/linux-binaries/libpng12.so.0: undefined
symbol: inflateInit_

firefox 0.8 and latest mozilla are both OK

seems to be a problem with my library paths?
If I comment out the initiation scripts for the staden package in  .bash_profile
dragging in bookmarks is OK.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0. ./firefox
1. click on bookmark this page
2. click on selected text within the "Name" field and try to drag.

OR

2. click on Bookmarks, then manage bookmarks
3. try to drag a bookmark.

Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes with message
./firefox-bin: relocation error:
/usr/local/staden_linux_2003.0b1/lib/linux-binaries/libpng12.so.0: undefined
symbol: inflateInit_


firefox start up errors were as follows:
downloads/firefox/firefox-bin:
/usr/local/staden_linux_2003.0b1/lib/linux-binaries/libstdc++.so.5: no version
information available (required by downloads/firefox/firefox-bin)

(repeated 5 times)


Expected Results:  
not crash.

This seems unlikely to be a problem for the majority of users, as it seems to be
caused by my library paths set up by another package.
However, it would be nice if firefox gave a warning or error message without
crashing.
