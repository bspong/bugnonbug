Restores pages after crash despite option setting

FF 3.6 crashes often - every 2 or 3 days.  C'est la vie.

Usually I have ton of pages open from various activities.

I have the option set: when FF starts, show a blank page: NOT restore previous session.


But after a crash this is ignored, without recourse and without any input from me.

That is an extremely harsh experience, as FF locks up my windows desktop trying to paint many windows, bogs my network trying to open hundreds of connections, and bogs itself tending to ignore my kb/mouse attempts to get it to stop.  It can impair my system for several minutes before I get its attention.

On start after crash, FF's behavior is INTOLERABLE.  It should do one of the following instead:

1. honor the setting to start with a blank page, or
2. honor a new similar setting on what to do on start after crash, or
3. ask me if I want the old session restored.

What it does now, restore willy-nilly against my option and resisting my efforts to stop it, is absolutely unacceptable, unreasonable, and in violation of its own "contract" expressed in the option settings.  This needs to be fixed. Please.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a bunch of pages in multiple windows and tabs
2. wait for FF to crash
3. restart FF
Actual Results:  
it restores all prior windows and tabs without asking and despite option setting

Expected Results:  
I get one blank window or a dialog asking me what to do.
