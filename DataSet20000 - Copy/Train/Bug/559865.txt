I'm a tech support person with an Internet company, we have been getting calls about this same issue from 3 other customers. We all have HP printers and with using Mozilla, last night my printer stopped printing from Mozilla, of anything off of a web page. I can print a test page and print from a doc file. So, I figured it was the printer first. This started for all of us last night, Thursday the 15th. They uninstalled and reinstalled the printer and still get the same issue-Can't print from the web pages. After the reinstall, then I thought I would test it for IE....BINGO-it works from there. I hate to revert to IE, but at this time, if I want to print from the web, that is what I have to do.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.just go to any web site and hit the print button and get error -20 printer not activated.  
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
printer not activated, -20 error message
