Don't capture thumbnails when 'Cache-Control: no-store' is given in a meta tag (instead of a HTTP header)
I was not aware that there were already supposed to be measures in place to prevent the caching of a thumbnail for my bank account page when I filed bug 822516. I initially just filed it because I noticed a thumbnail of a logged-in Bugzilla screenshot and later tested with my bank. Apparently it's not supposed to be saving a screenshot of the latter...

I've filed this with the security flag set out of paranoia, but I don't think I'll be posting anything too private.

Let me start with the caveat that I think I've used Live HTTP Headers maybe once before and I'm not exactly an expert with it.

The testing here is now with the latest Firefox nightly on Linux in a new profile.

Build identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:20.0) Gecko/20121218 Firefox/20.0

Starting from a new profile, going straight to pncbank.com and logging in, I can then check the thumbnails dir for that profile and see a couple thumbs of the front page with my username half typed in and another thumb of my logged in account page. If I start again with a fresh profile but first go to about:config and set browser.cache.disk_cache_ssl to false, I only get the first two screenshots not the latter. That pref is off by default, however, so in the normal case I get a thumbnail for my logged in account. Even with it on it is caching two (?) thumbnails for an HTTPS page as well. I've also got two thumbnails for the first-run page for some reason.

Digging into the headers returned for the account page I see the following headers, with a few parts redacted:

This URL is the one displayed in the location bar:
https://www.onlinebanking.pnc.com/alservlet/OnlineBankingServlet

This URL is a frame inside that with the actual content:
https://www.onlinebanking.pnc.com/alservlet/MyAccountsServlet

If I click "Account Activity" that switches the page in the frame to the page for that and the screenshot is updated to show my transaction history. If I then right-click on the "Summary" link (which points back to initial page) and open that in a new tab, I've now got the "MyAccountsServlet" URL open without the frame and no new screenshot is created for it. My initial guess is that the first page's header is not enough to make Firefox not save a thumbnail so it saves the whole thing even though the page in the frame is set not to be cached.
