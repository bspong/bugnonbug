firefox-3.6 does not obtain focus normally when loaded from external application

I am using mozilla-firefox 3.6 under gnome-2.28/gentoo. I found a problem that if the firefox is loaded from an external application, such as by typing "firefox" command in a terminal, any already-opened firefox window/tab doesn't obtain focus. This does NOT happen in firefox3.5.7.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a firefox window, then minimize it(sometimes I need to firstly open the links for some websites to reproduce this problem)
2.Open a terminal, type "firefox"
3.
Actual Results:  
The terminal still has the focus, while the newly opened firefox is at background.

Expected Results:  
I wish it have focus correctly.

I uploaded a screen video capture for this issue at youtube.com. Please refer to it if I didn't describe my problem clearly. I didn't install any add-on, also I tried with a new user profile and the problem is still there. Also I tried to enable/disable the "when I open a link in a new tab, switch to it immediately" but it appears to have no effect on my issue. Also I tried to launch other applications through terminal, such as evolution, all of them obtained focus correctly every time.

Thanks.
