Pop-up is blocked even when pop-ups are allowed

I have used two sites so far that have had pop-ups blocked (one is my bank so I can't really show you that one; the other is a credit card application for Citibank).  I checked the Blocker and made sure it was unchecked.  I continue to receive the message:  "Firefox prevented this page from automatically redirecting to another page"


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to this website:     https://www.accountonline.com/cards/acq/Apply.do?app=UNSOL&sc=4T3ZJX50&m=ZCJKMDQ48ZW&langId=EN&siteId=CB&B=M&screenID=3000&uc=A95&t=t&link=Consumer_568416151&ProspectID=CEC6B324ED0F4974B34812F22D48B401
2.  It immediately shows the message "Firefox prevented this page from automatically redirecting to another page"
3.  Even after clicking on "ALLOW", it gives me the same message.
Actual Results:
