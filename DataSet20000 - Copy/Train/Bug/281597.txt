certain content in title attribute in an anchor tag prevents virtual includes from working

Adding a title attribute to an anchor tag with content containing “1.5 MB”
prevents include files (header and footer in this case) from loading. They are
in the code but do not appear in Firefox. They do still work in IE.

For example:
<a href="proddesc/ARG2005Catalog.pdf" target="_blank" title="1.5 MG PDF - Opens
in new window">2005 Catalog </a>
prevents <!--#include virtual="./includes/top_mw.htm"--> (elsewhere on page)
from functioning.

<a href="proddesc/ARG2005Catalog.pdf" target="_blank" title="Large PDF - Opens
in new window">2005 Catalog </a>
does not interfere with function of include files.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a web page with an include file, make sure it loads
2. on the page, create a hyperlink to another page, make sure it works
3. add a title attribute to the <a> tag, with content that contains "1.5 MB", it
will prevent include file from loading when link is clicked
4. Take out the "1.5 MB" (probably just the period will do) and the link should
load the linked page with the includes

Actual Results:  
Web page appears, missing the include files content (header, footer). Even
weirder: this interference then occurs on other pages on the web site with those
includes! The same include files do not load on other pages, even if they do not
have the apparently causative anchor tag.

Expected Results:  
Loaded the include files.
