Firefox updates should only show up in Add/Remove programs if Show Updates is checked
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2

This is a followup bug to bug #247884, see comments 134 and 135.  

The issue there was that when the user updates from a previous version (say,
from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1) then the uninstall entry for the previous versions is not
removed from Add/Remove programs.  After installation both the entries will be
available in Add/Remove programs, and using the previous entry will actually
uninstall both versions of the program.

But shouldn't the Add/Remove entry for Firefox behave in a similar way to the
Add/Remove entry for, say, Office 2003?

The left part of the attachment (Show Updates, combined screenshots) shows the
MSO2K3 entry when the "Show updates" checkbox is not checked and the right part
when it is checked (Windows XP SP2).

Similarly, shouldn't the main entry for Firefox be "Mozilla Firefox 1.0" and
when "Show updates" is checked it would also show "Mozilla Firefox Update
1.0.1", "Mozilla Firefox Update 1.0.2", etc?  When Firefox 1.1 is released the
main entry would be replaced with "Mozilla Firefox 1.1" and the update entries
removed, until Firefox 1.1.1 is released and "Mozilla Firefox Update 1.1.1"
would be added?
