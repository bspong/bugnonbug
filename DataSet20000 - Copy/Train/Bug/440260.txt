I just installed Firefox 3.  The toolbar lacks back page and forward page arrows.  Installation erased my bookmarks.  Months of patient research gone in an instant.  If I had known that would happen, had I been warned that firefox 3 would erase my bookmarks, I would not have installed it.  I would suspect (forgive me the ad hominem), that this is the work of a certain world famous transexual software designer out of microsoft.  I would suggest you should treat this as an active and malicious attack and bring to bear both civil and criminal actions.  Very disappointing.  I had had faith in your organization.
P.S. it would be nice to have the page forward and page back arrows replaced, whether that self emasculated psychotic computer vandal who wrote this trash thinks HE needs them or not. (This is not invective.  Your Transexual Trojan Horse out of Microsoft has made the news on CNN.  He is insane.)  I would like to suggest that preliminary restricted site testing before releasing defective software is strongly indicated.  It is quite infuriating finding the msn butterly back on my startup screen as a consequence of accepting your Firefox 3 given all the trouble I'd gone to to disinstall after past trouble.  I thought I was getting a Mozilla Firefox product, not an msn Trojan horse.  I should have been warned.
