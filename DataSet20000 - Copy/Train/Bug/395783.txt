Lack of "Other" option when downloading PDF files

I'm using 2.0.0.6 for Mac OSX.  When I click a link to a PDF file to download it, I'm given Acrobat Reader as the default application.  All the help documentation I've read indicates that Firefox should offer me "Other" as an additional option if I don't want to use Acrobat Reader.  Since I have Acrobat Professional, I'd rather use it for PDF files, but without the "Other" option, I can't tell Firefox to handle all PDF files this way.  I don't even have Acrobat Reader on this computer.

I tried the Manage File Types option in Content Preferences, but it will not allow users to add a new Action.  It generates its action list from past downloads, which brings me back to the original problem of the lack of an "Other" option in the Download Manager.

I was able to recreate this bug 10 times with a 100% success rate.  For now, I can use OSX's "Open" options in the download manager to circumvent the Firefox bug, but it's an unnecessary additional step in the process.

I'm reporting this as a new bug because I wasn't entirely sure if it was related to:

Bug 354971 – Insufficient options when opening PDF files
Bug 283038 – Mac: firefox suggests Adobe Acrobat as default PDF app instead
  of Preview
Bug 290609 – Downloaded pdfs not recognized as pdfs (edit)
Bug 299849 – Mime type ignored for a PDF or JPEG responses. (edit)

Is it possible that all these bugs are related?
