Site created with frontpage has mismatched <td> and </td> tags and renders poorly, text overprints, etc.

Admittedly this site sucks, but it exhibits a problem I have noticed on a few
other sites, this problem occurred with Mozilla, and the problem continues with
Firefox.  

The problem is this: 
The page renders poorly.  Text overprints other text. I have taken a look at the
source and I surmise the problem is that the page has about 9 <td> tags and I
stopped counting at 160 </td> tags.  How this could have occurred I have no
idea, bad technique on the part of the page designer and Microsoft. Pox on them
but that matters not one bit.  

IE however renders the page correctly. IE apparently ignores and tries to fix
such errors in HTML markup, and Firefox does not. 

It's hard to argue that in the face of such goofy behavior on the part of the
Microsoft Frontpage tool and the user that the problem is with Firefox and not
with Frontpage or the user, but if the goal is the acceptance of Firefox as a
good replacement for the IE browser *USERS* will not accept any argument about
"bad web design" or "errors in the HTML" being the problem.  They will just use
a browser that doesn't have (or show) the problem. I would therefore argue that
such issues should be fixed regardles of how well Firefox follows and IE
deviates from any standards proposed by any august body. 

FWIW, I noticed a related looking problem in the past on slashdot.org, but they
seem to have finally fixed it.  When viewing an individual story on that site
the comments started pretty far down the page. I did not compare to IE and like
I said it seems to have been fixed recently but it looked like a related problem.
