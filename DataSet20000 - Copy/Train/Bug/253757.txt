Sub-menus on context menu don't open automatically
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040730 Firefox/0.9.1+

Several extensions add sub-menus to the context menu.  In previous builds, the
sub-menu would pop open on mouseover.  On 20040730, a left-click is now required
to open the extenson's sub-menu.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install an extension that uses a context menu (for example, MakeLink
http://www.netsoc.ucd.ie/~finuvir/makelink_1.2.xpi ) and restart Firefox.
2. Right-click anywhere on the page and mouse over the context menu item "Make
Link >"


Actual Results:  
The context menu did not open, and a left-click was required to open it.

Expected Results:  
The context menu should open automatically on mouseover.

I saw this bug with three of the extensions I use (Make Link, Linky, and
BBCode).  Another user in the forums verified the bug with two other extensions
(ReloadEvery and ImageZoom).  Looking through yesterday's checkins, I thought it
might be associated with either Bug 243720 [bookmark can't move into sub-folder
in personal toolbar (drag and drop)] or Bug 203183 [Bookmarks context menu stays
when clicking other menus].
