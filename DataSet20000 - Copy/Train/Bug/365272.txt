The [Submit Comment] button on a digg comments page never enables; also the CAPTCHA "Please enter the code in the image above" never appears.

FireBug Inspector shows it as
input type="submit" value="Submit Comment" id="submitbutton" name="submit" disabled="" /
note the disabled attribute. Some JavaScript inserted that, it's not part of the page source.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Pick any story on Digg
2. Log in to digg
3. Enter a comment in "Add Your Comment" at the bottom.
4. Try to submit comment.
Actual Results:  
The [Check Spelling] button is enabled, but [Submit Comment] never enables (and I never see the Digg CAPTCHA).

Expected Results:  
In MSIE7, the moment I start typing in the comment textarea, a CAPTCHA "Please enter the code in the image above" appears and the [Submit Comment] enables.
