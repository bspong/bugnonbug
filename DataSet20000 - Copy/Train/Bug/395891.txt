When you have several profiles and you use the profile manager to manage this profile and to select your start profile at Minefield startup, this prevents the minefield start when you click on links in external programs (like Thunderbird) or when you type start -> run www.mozilla.com

A Firefox Process is started in the Windows Process Manager, but the profile manager does not come up. 

This also cause the Problem that when you click on the Minefield icon on your desktop or start menu nothing happens.

You need to end the Firefox Process first and then you can start Minefield again.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create some Firefox/Minefield Profiles
2. Choose on the Profile Manager and uncheck "don`t ask at startup", so that the profile manager comes up at every start
3. Start Minefield, make sure its the default browser
4. Quit Minefield and ensure its completely closed
5. Click on www.link in a mail or from start -> run www.mozilla.com
6. nothing happen - minefield does not come up
7. click on the minefield icon in the start menu or desktop -> nothing happen
8. check the process manager - there is a firefox.exe process running
