Random image weirdness in Minefield
For the last 24 - 36 hours, I've been seeing some weirdness in Minefield with images. Sometimes animated gifs, but mostly gifs. 

I've turned off hardware acceleration. I've turned off accelerated layers. I've ran new profiles. I've tried safe mode. I've disabled all of my extensions. 

I'm still seeing it despite trying all of these things, however it doesn't happen on EVERY image, which is frustrating me to no end. Pressing F5 has no effect, ctrl-F5 does fix the problem though. I can't reproduce this in Chrome 9 or IE 9 so I doubt it is my video hardware or anything else in my PC.

Here are are a couple examples:
