Folder name in Bookmark All Tabs dialog behaves incorrectly
STR:

1. Open a window and load some pages in a few tabs.
2. From the Bookmarks menu, choose Bookmark All Tabs....
3. Select the drop-down button next to the "Create in" field.  A new item with no text is added to the "Create in" combo-box.
4. Select a root item in the list box below the "Create in" combo-box.  Another new item with no text is added to the "Create in" combo-box.  For each root item, this can be reproduced.  Children of these folders behave correctly.
5. Select the drop-down button once again so that the list becomes hidden.  The empty items persist.
6. Make sure one of the empty items are selected in the "Create in" field, and click Add Bookmarks.  The bookmarks are added, but it's not apparent which folder they are created in.  In my testing, I didn't edit the folder name and used the default value ("[Folder Name]").  Clicking the Star button on one of the pages shows the bookmark is created in that folder, but it's not accessible from the Library (or anywhere else in the UI where Bookmark folders are shown).
7. Invoke the Bookmark All Tabs dialog again.  The folders with empty titles have been added to the "Create in" combo-box this time.

Apparently, this can cause a number of untitled folders be created and a new folder ([Folder Name]) be added as a child of one of those.  These folders can't be accessed from the Library and can't be even deleted.  The bookmarks created in those folders can't be found via the Search Bookmarks field in the Library, and don't seem to get used in AwesomeBar results as well.
