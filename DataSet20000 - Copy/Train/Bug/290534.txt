Hi,

This is NOT a bug but is very important feature for USER FRIENDLY value of FIREFOX.

I have mozilla installed with a few profiles, and also Internet explore (
default ) .. while installing FIREFOX it gave me an " EITHER OR " menu in the
form of Radio Buttons to choose the browser from which profiles should be imported. 

It should be a CHECK BOX, so that I can select BOTH browsers namely MOZILLA and
Internet Explorer .. because I wanted to import profiles from BOTH browsers into
FIREFOX.

Thanks

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install browser ( FireFox )
2.Delete Folder ( Uninstall )
3.Reinstall browser ( FireFox )
4. =)

Actual Results:  
It gave me a radio box..that means I can choose to import profiles from EITHER
Internet Explore OR Mozilla/Netscape  

Expected Results:  
I want to import profiles from both =) .. I know I can do it from inside, but it
is LOGICAL to have a multichoose tick boxes to select as many browsers installed
to import profiles

umm .. fix it ?
