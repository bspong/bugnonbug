[e10s] Back/forward gesture causes "unsafe CPOW usage" warning
STR:

1) In a remote browser, do some browsing so that you have some session history
2) Use the "back" gesture to go back a page. On my MacBook, that's 3-finger swipe left, but it might be different for other folk.
3) Use the "forward" gesture to go forward to where you came from.

This causes some "unsafe CPOW usage" warnings in the Browser Console at the following locations:

in browser/base/content/browser.js:

  /**
   * Starts the swipe animation and handles fast swiping (i.e. a swipe animation
   * is already in progress when a new one is initiated).
   *
   * @param aIsVerticalSwipe
   *        Whether we're dealing with a vertical swipe or not.
   */
  startAnimation: function HSA_startAnimation(aIsVerticalSwipe) {
    this._direction = aIsVerticalSwipe ? "vertical" : "horizontal";

    if (this.isAnimationRunning()) {
      // If this is a horizontal scroll, or if this is a vertical scroll that
      // was started while a horizontal scroll was still running, handle it as
      // as a fast swipe. In the case of the latter scenario, this allows us to
      // start the vertical animation without first loading the final page, or
      // taking another snapshot. If vertical scrolls are initiated repeatedly
      // without prior horizontal scroll we skip this and restart the animation
      // from 0.
      if (this._direction == "horizontal" || this._lastSwipeDir != "") {
        gBrowser.stop();
        this._lastSwipeDir = "RELOAD"; // just ensure that != ""
        this._canGoBack = this.canGoBack();
        this._canGoForward = this.canGoForward();
        this._handleFastSwiping();
      }
    }
    else {
      this._startingIndex = gBrowser.webNavigation.sessionHistory.index; <-- Causes CPOW warning
      this._historyIndex = this._startingIndex;
      this._canGoBack = this.canGoBack();
      this._canGoForward = this.canGoForward();
      if (this.active) {
        this._addBoxes();
        this._takeSnapshot();
        this._installPrevAndNextSnapshots();
        this._lastSwipeDir = "";
      }
    }
    this.updateAnimation(0);
  },

and later in the same file:

  /**
   * Stops the swipe animation.
   */
  stopAnimation: function HSA_stopAnimation() {
    gHistorySwipeAnimation._removeBoxes();
    this._historyIndex = gBrowser.webNavigation.sessionHistory.index; <-- Causes CPOW warning
  },
