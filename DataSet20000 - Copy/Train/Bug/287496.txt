SELECT/OPTION Drop Down Menus do not work in FireFox without a window manager.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 1.0.3705)

In any page, if you are running FireFox in Linux without a window manager, 
drop-down style SELECT/OPTION boxes do not drop down.  You can select the box 
and use the up/down arrow keys to toggle options, but clicking on the dropdown 
button will not drop down the menu.  In KDE/Gnome/TWM/etc. it works correctly, 
but running without a WM (this is for Kiosk systems) causes the problem to 
occur.  SELECT/OPTION boxes with a height of more than one row (i.e. list 
boxes, not drop-down boxes) will display properly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run FireFox in X Windows without a window manager
2. Go to any page that has a drop-down box on it

Actual Results:  
Dropdown boxes will not work properly, clicking the drop down "V" button does 
not show the available options, clicking on the text and using the up/down 
arrow keys will move through options.

Expected Results:  
Drop down a box, as it does when running inside a window manager.

default theme, happens with both default and custom browser.xul settings.
