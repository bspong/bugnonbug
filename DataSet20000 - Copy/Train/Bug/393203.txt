some of the preloaded feeds will attempt to pull content down w/o user interaction. since the request is sent w/o user interaction, and is not sent via https a mitm situation is possible. this happens regardless if "subscribe to the feed" is selected or not.

also, a smaller issue with privacy; one of the preloaded feeds (bloglines) attempts to set a cookie. -- this can be controlled via cookie settings. however, the request is sent w/o user interaction.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open tools->options.
2. switch to "feeds" tab.
3.
Actual Results:  
several of the preloaded feeds initiate http request, w/o user interaction.

Expected Results:  
nothing. a request w/o user interaction/knowledge in the preferences should not be made. perhaps consider only enabling this if the option "subscribe to the feed" is  selected.

technically a security problem, though it requires user to navigate to options-feeds to trigger.
