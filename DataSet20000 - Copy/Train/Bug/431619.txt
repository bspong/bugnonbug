After the first right click the right-click menus no-longer display in a timely fashion and sometimes not at all.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open up two Firefox windows and try the following for both
2.Right click on the blank part of the page (or anywhere, over images etc)
3.Next, left click somewhere on the blank part of the page to hide the menu
4.Right click on the blank part of the page (or anywhere, over images etc)
5.If you don't see the problem left click and try again once or twice to be sure there isn't a problem
Actual Results:  
1.One window works the other doesn't
2.The first right click on the page pulls up the right-click-menu as expected (for me)
3.The left click hides the menu as expected
4.After the right click there is a significant pause before the menu displays (about one to two seconds sometimes more, sometimes the menu never displays)

Expected Results:  
the menus showing up consistently when right clicking.

I am using the default Firefox theme, but I am using the classic windows-xp theme. I have seen this problem sporadically while using Firefox 3 and will try to keep better track of it because I would really like this fixed before the stable release.
