Page fails to load and content area reamins blank

This problem has started with b6 and persists.  When I open FF, create a new tab and then try to open a page from a book mark or by typing in a URL, the page does not load. No spinner, no error, nothing...just a blank page.  Eventually, a page will load after I quit the browser and then come back in.  However, I cannot say for certain why the problem goes away. When I tried this evening, it seemed as though nothing I did would get a page to load, until I finally went to:  http://en-us.www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/community/ (to report the bug). This page loaded and then I could go to any page thereafter.

Note: When this occurs, this is not a INET conn issue.  I can open any other browser and it works fine. Also, once the problem goes away, it does not return. 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Boot computer.
2. Load FF
3. Try to navigate to a page




I have classified the severity as Normal, but were this a persistent bug repeatable by many -- for which I have not seen a similar bug report -- it would be a major issue, since you cannot use the browser.

Great work guys. I use FF, Safari, Chrome and IE (when I have to), and I prefer FF.  Thanks!
