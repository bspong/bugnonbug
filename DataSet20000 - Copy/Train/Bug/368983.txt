update to and from Firefox 1.5.0.9 makes root CA unusable

When firefox users update to version 1.5.0.9 the root certificate of "Staat der Nederlanden" fails to authenticate properly. Also an upgrade from FF 1.5.0.9 to 2.0 renders de root CA unusable. 

Dutch government websites rely on the proper athentication through the root CA of "Staat der Nederlanden". As a government official I have first hand information on this issue as the Dutch Tax Office receives quite some complaints about this bug. 

Be aware that a clean install does not appear to suffer from this bug.
