What happens is that when you use the latest version of Firefox 3.6, then when you want to close it, it will not really close. what I mean by that is that when I use it for a long time (like more than an hour), then it will seem like it closes but in the "Windows Task Manager", it will still appear and if you try opening it, it will read that message that Firefox is still running. This is the 2nd day I have version 3.6 installed. I did not use to have this problem in the last version before 3.6 came along. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open up the Firefox 3.6
2.Keep it open for many hours (probally 2-5 hours?)
3.before closing it, Open up the "Windows Task Manager" too.
4.Close Firefox 3.6
5.it will still be running (after 5 min, it will still be running without being shown).
Actual Results:  
it will still be running (after 5 min, it will still be running without being shown).

Expected Results:  
if should still be running in the background

please note that this is a Windows Vista Home Premium laptop I'm using.
