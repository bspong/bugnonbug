New Responsive Design Mode in Firefox 52 breaks add-ons with `window.gBrowser.selectedBrowser.sendAsyncMessage()`
Created attachment 8814190
Test extension (.xpi)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0
Build ID: 20161124004020

Steps to reproduce:

1. Install the attached test extension.
2. Go to https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/
3. Click the toolbar button added by the test extension.
4. Verify that an alert dialog pops up, saying "frame.js received TestMessage. URL: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/"
5. Close the alert dialog.
6. Enter Responsive Design Mode by pressing ctrl+shift+M
7. Click the toolbar button added by the test extension again.


Actual results:

An alert dialog pops up, saying "frame.js received TestMessage. URL: frame.js received TestMessage. URL: chrome://devtools/content/responsive.html/index.xhtml"

The alert dialog looks like those created by running `alert('test')` in the BROWSER console (which can be opened by pressing ctrl+shift+J).



Expected results:

The same thing as in step 4: An alert dialog pops up, saying "frame.js received TestMessage. URL: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/"

The alert dialog looks like those created by running `alert('test')` in the WEB console (which can be opened by pressing ctrl+shift+K), just as it does in step 4.

Tested in a new Firefox profile.
Also tested in Firefox Nightly 53.0a1 (2016-11-24) (64-bit).
