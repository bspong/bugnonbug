After forced quit, Firefox usually gets into a not responding state at the restore session dialog

Sometimes, Firefox gets hung up and I need to forced quit it. On relaunching, Firefox presents a restore session dialog. The dialog's buttons are usually unresponsive and after a short time, the Force Quit Applications dialog in OS X indicates that Firefox is "not responding". At this point, I force quit Firefox and relaunch it. This behavior often repeats numerous times before eventually Firefox "gives up" hanging and then presents the restore session dialog with responsive buttons.

I am unable to reproduce this by merely force quitting Firefox and relaunching it. It may occur only when Firefox had originally been busy with a lot of windows on the screen in the previously running session that I force quit. Or it just may be random.

I sometimes see journal files to the mysql database file but not always, so the cause does not appear related to their being present.

The question is what code could possibly be running when Firefox is displaying the restore session dialog. I don't see that it should be do much of anything but waiting for the user to click a button.
