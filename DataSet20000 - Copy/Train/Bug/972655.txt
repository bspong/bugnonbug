Console should show XMLHttpRequests
Currently, the "Net" filter with its options of "Errors," "Warnings," "Log," and "Log Request and Response Bodies" does not offer any way to distinguish synchronous from asynchronous requests. When turning net logging on in the console, you'll receive a full dump of every request and response made, but typically the only request information one wants to see, alongside their regular console logging calls, are asynchronous requests. After years of using third party tools like Firebug, or Chrome's developer tools, it's taken for granted that these requests will be seen in the console in their own right--in some uncluttered state. I very much like the ability to see all requests and responses in the Console. I just think there should be toggles in place to emulate that more traditional expectation. 

Perhaps instead of "Log Request and Response Bodies," it can be divided into two other options, like "Log XHR requests," and "Log all synchronous requests." Having both of them enabled will effectively be the same as "Log Request and Response Bodies," but individually they will divide up the requests for better clarity.

In order to see asynchronous requests under the current system, one would have to enter the "Network" tab and filter out the "XHR" responses, which is fine, but when debugging, it's nice to see just the asynchronous requests and whatever debugging output one is logging--together--instead of having to switch tabs.

What do you think about this?
