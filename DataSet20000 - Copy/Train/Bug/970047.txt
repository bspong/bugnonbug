Steps to reproduce:

Feature request: add a full-page screenshot button to the Responsive Design View (aka Responsive Mode). Currently the screenshot button only allows users to take a screenshot of the visible content.

Rationale: full-page screenshots are a common need for web designers and developers, as exemplified by popular screenshot extensions for Firefox, Chrome, etc. This feature is generally the core reason for those extensions to exist, since operating systems provide their own screenshot feature to capture visible content.

This feature is already available by combining the Responsive Design View (to get the viewport width you need for testing/demonstration) and the Developer Toolbar command line. I’d argue that a majority of users of the Responsive Design View are unlikely to ever use the nerdy Developer Toolbar, especially web designers, so exposing the "full page" screenshot feature in the Responsive Design View UI would make sense.
