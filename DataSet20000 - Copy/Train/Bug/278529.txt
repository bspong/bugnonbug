when firefox is active (even minimized) ALL drop down menus in ALL windows
applications (incl. firefox) have flickering in their drop-shadows.  Also
affects any context sensitive "tool tip" type windows (ie where hovering cursor
over an item raises an info type window) eg file info in windows explorer or
items on windows taskbar (start button, quicklaunch icons, open apps, systray
icons etc)  BUT in these windows the WHOLE window flashes/flickers NOT just the
drop shadows.

As soon as firefox is closed, normal window behaviour resumes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start firefox
2. click on any drop down menu in firefox or any other active windows app, OR,
hold cursor over an item in the windows task bar etc


Actual Results:  
As stated above, drop down menus have flickering drop shadows & context
sensitive windows themsleves flicker badly.

Expected Results:  
Not flicker.
