google calendar or sciencedirect popups are displayed incorrectly with transparent background

google calendar or sciencedirect popups are displayed incorrectly with transparent background. My system: KDE3.5, setting are: white color over black background throughout the KDE's Personal Settings. In firefox options->content->colors I try both 'system colors' and explicit white font and black bg. I do NOT allow pages use their own colors. My userContent.css is:

* {
   color: #FFFFFF ! important;
   background: #000000 ! important;
   background-color: #000000 ! important;
}

img {
   background: #DDDDDD ! important;
   background-color: #DDDDDD ! important;
}

With such settings many popups are displayed incorrectly with transparent background, which makes them impossible to read. Examples include google calendar (click on a date to add event) and sciencedirect html articles (e.g. mouse over 'related articles' or references in the text).

NOTE: konqueror behaves correctly here (even if google tells it is not supported).
SEVERITY: can not use the browser!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. specify white on black in KDE 3.5 Personal Settings (Desktop). Note - I did not use the built-in high contrast scheme, just changed the colors manually.
2. chose 'use system colors' in options->content->colors, do NOT allow pages use their own colors
3. set userContent.css to:
* {
   color: #FFFFFF ! important;
   background: #000000 ! important;
   background-color: #000000 ! important;
}

img {
   background: #DDDDDD ! important;
   background-color: #DDDDDD ! important;
}


Actual Results:  
With such settings many popups are displayed incorrectly with transparent background, which makes them impossible to read. Examples include google calendar (click on a date to add event) and sciencedirect html articles (e.g. mouse over 'related articles' or references in the text).


Expected Results:  
Popups should not be transparent, as they were not transparent with the unmodified configuration.

I mark severity as 'major' because I can not use the browser (I use sciencedirect daily).
