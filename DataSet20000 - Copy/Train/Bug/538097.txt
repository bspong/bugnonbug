I can close the browser, but it doesn't stop running in the task manager. and if i try to open Firefox it says its already running It gives a pop-up message, but it doesn't stay around long enough for me to fully read what it says. but it says something about i have to restart my system first. so I looked in the task manager and Firefox was running. i clicked end process then clicked on the icon and it opened, but when i close it it won't shut all the way down. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.close the browser
2.try to open a new browser and I get an error message saying its already running
3.Open Task manager to shut it down
4.then click on icon then it will open again.
5. close the browser it closes, but keeps running in the task manager.
Actual Results:  
I already told you above

Expected Results:  
when i close the browser that is shuts all the way down
and doesn't keep running in the background.

Also Firefox will not save my passwords. and the scroll won't work unless i double click in a blank space on the page.
