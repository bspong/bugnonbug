Using .cmd-files as external viewer doesn't work

I'm trying to use a Windows commandfile (.cmd-extension) as an external viewer for specific filetypes (download/open with/always perform this action).

With Firefox 2.0.0.16 this works flawlessly while with Firefox 3.0.1 the .cmd-file is not executed. The file is copied to the Temp-directory and the download-manager reports "download successful". As soon as I assign an .exe-file to the filetype everything works.

I guess it has something to do with the way Windows handles .cmd-files. Since they are no real executables (like .exe-files) they must be opened using a handler.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download a file which mimetype or file-extension is not known to Firefox.
2. Choose "Open With" from the download-dialog.
3. Select a Windows Commandfile (.cmd) as viewer.
4. optionally: choose "always open with..."
Actual Results:  
The file gets saved to the Temp-directory and the download-manager reports "download successful". The .cmd-script is not executed.

Expected Results:  
The .cmd-script should be executed (Command window popping-up showing the script's output). This is the case with Firefox 2.0.0.16.
