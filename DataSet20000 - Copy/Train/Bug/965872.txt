Storage Inspector (Editor ? ) - actor for cookies, local storage and session storage
Created attachment 8368027
actor

This bug is for the backend of the storage tool.

This bug will cover the first iteration of the actors.

Attaching patch with:
 - The main storage actor
 - Three child actors : cookies, local storage and session storage.

For version 1, we are targeting read only. So the patch:

 - Allows you to query and get all hosts and cookies/local storage items/session storage items
 - All child iframes/windows etc are also listed.
 - Gives live update on any change in the above three.

The detailed protocol definition is present at https://etherpad.mozilla.org/storage-inspector-protocol

Things to do:
 - Lot of duplicate code
 - On some sites, local(session)storage checks for the dom-storage2-changed event are not working properly because of how it is implemented right now.
 - The update event should be batched.
 - Add comments.
 - Cookies created via Set-Cookie header from network calls are not accessible. There is no way to link these cookies to the current web page as the domain of those cookies is different and platform does not link them to the current page domains.
 - Make sure the actor works in chrome mode.
 - Make sure the actor works across products (android, FxOS etc)


Here is a little script to see the actor in action : https://gist.github.com/scrapmac/8714857
