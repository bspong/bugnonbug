ComponentArt Web.UI 2.0.1983/ASP.Net 1.1 pull/pop-down menu fails to display

The CmponentArt interface allows me to specify a delay for the display of the pull/pop-down menu associated to the "Our Products" element in the top menu bar of this page.

If I don't specify a delay, the menu displays.  If I specify a delay it does not.  The menu displays "properly" with IE, so I'm forced to specify a delay as the default delay is to short, and I've yet to receive any negative feedback relating to the non-display in Firefox.

I assume that some event is not getting passed to the correct handler if a delay is specified.  The problem is reproducible all the way back to Firefox 1.5.0.7, which is the earliest version I've tried. 

Of interest is the fact that the problem does not manifest itself on WinNT 4.0, but is solid on Win2K and WinXP.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.type www.jebrown.net in the address bar
2.mouse over "Our Products" -- notice no menu appears
3.try it on IE
