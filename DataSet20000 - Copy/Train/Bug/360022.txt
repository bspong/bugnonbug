Firefox can not access FTP-folders if folder names contain German umlauts ('ü', 'ö', 'ä').
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

I won't succeed in trying to access FTP-folders with the built-in FTP-client while folder names contain a German umlaut (e.g. 'ü' or 'ä').

For example if I try to access a folder:
/PUBLIC3/MUSTER/Schmitt/DVS/Prüfungen
I get the following error message:
550 No Such Directory "/PUBLIC3/MUSTER/Schmitt/DVS/Pr"

I found that in the error message the file name string will always be cut off at the umlaut's position.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go via FTP to a directory that contains a subdirectory with an umlaut in its name
2. Make sure that you have the permissions needed to access the subdirectory 
3. Try to access it
Actual Results:  
You won't be able to access the directory.
An error message with error number 550 will occur.

Expected Results:  
I should be able to browse the folder.

Umlauts in folder names are also not displayed correctly. A question mark is set instead of the actual character.

Trying to access folders containing umlauts in its names using the Konquerer-browser was successful.
