Backgrounding a Firefox file system browser window puts Firefox into RTL mode

When a file system browser window (launched from Firefox) appears, it is backgrounded (manually), and then Firefox goes from being in left to right mode to being in right to left mode.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Start off running in Gnome on a Debian Etch box
2.  Install GTK 2.12 into a specific directory (not the default install directory)
3.  Install Firefox and have it use the installed GTK 2.12
Steps 1 through 3 take place on a laptop.

4.  Install Joomla 1.5.4 on a website
Step 4 takes place on a VPS server running on Debian Etch

5.  Log into the Administrator section
6.  Go to the media manager
7.  Click 'Browse files'
8.  Click on a non-Firefox window
9.  Click on the main Firefox browser window
10.  Start typing in a URL; you will find you are now in RTL (right-to-left) mode....well....sort of.  You'll be in insert mode, and everything you type in, will scroll to the right of the cursor, but you'll be typing on the left side of the screen, not the right side of the screen.
Steps 5 through 10 take place on the same laptop
Actual Results:  
Please refer to above; I've described what happens several times now.

The odd steps required above to get Firefox installed are just the pain in the ass stuff you have to do on Debian to get a non-Iceweaseled, newer GTK-requiring Firefox to run.

Expected Results:  
The browser should not have gone into RTL mode (or whatever it is that you would normally call that mode).  Also, the file browser window should also have its own appearance on the Gnome taskbar, and it does not.

I am using the binary version for 686 Linux that was posted to the Minefield downloads section.

The only fix I've found is to shut down the application, and restart it.

Also, sometimes when this happens, there ends up being certain browser windows that don't close down, even when I click on the 'X' in the upper right corner of the window.  One such window was the 'About' window.  This part is not reproducable at will, but the RTL issue is reproducable every single time.
