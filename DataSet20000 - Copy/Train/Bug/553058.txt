Firefox update 3.6 messes up desktop icon (double icons)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 YFF35 Firefox/3.6 GTB6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 YFF35 Firefox/3.6 GTB6

After the 3.6 install Firefox place two desktop icons on my PC.  One has the Firefox logo (normal icon) and the other appears to be the default icon for Windows apps when it can't find the app or icon.  When I try to delete this later icon the first icon disappears and this one (the bogus) stays on the desktop.  When I try to delete the bogus one a second time I get the error message:
 "Cannot delete file: Cannot read from the source file or disk".  Tried creating a new shortcut by dragging the icon off the start menu and once again it created two icons, one good, one bogus.  And once again when I right clicked on the bogus and selected delete the good icon disappeared and the bogus remained,  So what's up?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Read the details
2.Drag Firefox Icon to desktop
3. Now see the two icons for firefox, one with the "logo" one without
Actual Results:  
two icons where you can NOT delete the bogus icon

Expected Results:  
Should only be one icon with the logo that works and the bogus icon should NOT exist

Should have created one icon with the logo that works
