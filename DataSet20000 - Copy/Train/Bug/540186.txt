Lost all Installed Add-ons (but one) from FireFox display, FF Add-On window, WE folders.

I used FireFox's Add-On FireShot to create tutorials documents. FS has an Options first Saving then open target folder, which is a Windows Explorer folder. At one point too many folders were opened, so I decided to close some folders but mistakenly closed FireFox.  I thought it was no big deal so I restarted new FireFox session, by looking at the display I immediately realized all(about 14) my previously INSTALLED Add-Ons were gone, the only survival was ADBLock. Add-Ons were no big deals to reinstall it because it was easy to do.  However, installed Add-Ons should not vanish under any circumstances unless user uninstalls it.  Furthermore, installed icons should not disappear from the FireFox display at all.  I was shock. This makes me unease using FireFox, although I stick to it since it is more logically arranged and appear more powerful and friendly than IE.    

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close many folders opened by FireShot (Saving edited capture then open target folder setting in the Options). 
2. Close FireFox accidentally by right click FF icon in the status bar then chose Close option.
3. FireFox closed.
4. I click on quick-launch FireFox icon to re-start, notice all my previously INSTALLED add-ons I rearranged on the display were gone, Checked Add-Ons window to find only one left(ADBLock). Vanished Add-On did not even exist in the WE.

Actual Results:  
Did not want to risk installed add-on, I did not have time to go back to square one again.
I have: Adblock Plus 1.1.3, ColorfulTabs 4.1, Cooliris 1.11.6, CoolPreviews 2.7.6.0623,FireFTP, FireShot 0.80, FlagFox 3.3.20, FoxTab1.2.1 ...

Expected Results:  
FireFox launched with all my previous installed Add-Ons icons in place, as the way I rearranged after the installation.
