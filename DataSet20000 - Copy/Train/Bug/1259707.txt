session restore may put windows off-screen (fails to constrain window placement to available screen space)
This is a bug caused by incorrectly mixing display (desktop) pixels with CSS px coordinates in the ssi_restoreDimensions function.

STR, on Windows 8.1 (or presumably Win10) with two displays:

* Arrange displays in the Display control panel with the secondary monitor to the right of the primary one

* Launch Nightly, and put its window on the secondary monitor; load some website, maybe even a couple of tabs (to make successful Session-Restore recognizable)

* Quit Nightly

* Rearrange displays to put the secondary monitor on the left of the primary one

* Re-launch Nightly

(Note that until bug 1259492 is fixed, the window will be virtually off-screen at this point, and you'll need to right-click its icon in the taskbar and choose Move, then press left-arrow to bring it into view.)

* Now click the Restore Previous Session button

Expected:
The previous session's tabs should be restored, within the visible window

Actual:
The window disappears, because Session Restore has put it off-screen where the secondary monitor used to be, but there's now nothing.

(To retrieve the window, once again right-click the taskbar icon and Move it. But this is a lousy user experience.)
