Firefox 5.0 crashes if following addons are installed with the previous version - Selenium, Zynga Toolbar, Symantec Addons
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/534.30 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/12.0.742.112 Safari/534.30

Steps to reproduce:

I upgraded firefox from version 4.0 to 5.0


Actual results:

Installation was successful with the message some of the addons were not compatible with new version. The when firefox was restarted it crashed - with the crash message appearing with two options - REstart Firefox, Quit Firefox. When Restart Firefox button is clicked, it crashed again with the same message.

Solution - Ran firefox in safe mode and selected the option of running Firefox without any addons. Then firefox opened. Went to addons page and disabled or removed following addons - 
1. Selenium
2. Zynga toolbar (Facebook)


Expected results:

During upgrade it should have shown the message - "Following addons will not work with the newer version, do you want to continue - Yes/No". This would give the following options - 
1. Continue with the older version if the addons are required. Because now that i have upgraded I would have to deinstall and install version 4 again for my addons to work
2. Allow users to disable/remove the addons so that Firefox does not crash after the installation.
