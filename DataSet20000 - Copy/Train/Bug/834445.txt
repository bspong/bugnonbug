Ability to bookmark launchers for native OS applications.
Firefox Bookmarks are currently a useful way to organize links to web sites. Functionality traditionally implemented in native client applications/programs is now often being implemented as web applications accessed via a URL. For a user to get a task accomplished they may utilize a combination of native client applications and web-based applications. Unfortunately, Firefox bookmarks can only be used to organize links to web-based applications based on their URL. It would be useful if Firefox bookmarks could also link to launchers/binaries of native applications. This would allow users to organize launchers using the same tags and folders used to organize web sites. It would also allow applications to be launched from the Awesome Bar. This would provide a more seamless experience for users since they could organize ways to get things done using a single organizational structure regardless of whether the application is implemented using web technologies or thick-client technologies.

Currently, it is possible to bookmark a link to a file on disk, however the default behavior for such links is to copy the file to a new location. The desired behavior would be to run the file in place.

A secondary benefit of this feature is that it would provide an alternative option for organizing and running programs to the new Start menu introduced by Microsoft in Windows 8. An Awesome Bar-based solution to running web or native applications would provide a consistent user experience across operating systems.
