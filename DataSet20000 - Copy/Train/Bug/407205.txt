When dynamically altering the size and contents of an HTML table using ".innerHTML" the table is not rendered and drawn to the screen correctly.  The DOMInspector shows that the "width" and other attributes of the table are correct, but on-screen the GUI elements are not drawn correctly.

This bug seems to only happen when dynamically changing the table using Javascript polling functions (setTimeout() call).  When the table is dynamically changed by calling a function when an "onChange" event is fired, the bug does not seem to be expressed.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the web page specified earlier in this post (URL).
2. Change the "View 1" "View 2" combo-box over and over again (views are changed based on 1 second polling).  This is easiest to do by setting the combo-box to have focus, and them pressing UP, Enter, Down, Enter, etc...
3. Keep at it until you see the table drawn incorrectly (header missing for dynamic part of the table, body of table missing, etc.).
4. Feel free to look at the Javascript file provided (bug.js).
5. Compare functionality to the alternate implementation provided at this URL:

  - This URL does NOT express the bug in question.
Actual Results:  
When dynamically redrawing the table, periodically (may take a couple minutes of toggling) the table will not draw correctly in the browser, while the DOMInspector states that all elements rendered are correct (widths, etc.).

Expected Results:  
When changing "views" on the page, the table should ALWAYS be drawn correctly.
