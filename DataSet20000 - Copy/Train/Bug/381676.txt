ctrl+click should be the same as middle click in all contexts. the only one it is different in that I have found is in the bookmarks drop down. I cant ctrl click a folder and cause that to open all of the items inthe folder to open up in separate tabs. middle click does accomplish this though.

This is important because most laptops have only 2 buttons and not the middle button.
