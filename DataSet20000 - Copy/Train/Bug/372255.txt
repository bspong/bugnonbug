Version 2.0.0.2 Fails to negotiate an https session using TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5

We use a Dell DRAC remote console to administer computers in a hosted data center.  With Version 1.5.10 of Firefox we can connect to this remote console successfully.    The remote console choses a cipher-suite of TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5 as reported by ethereal.  Version 2.0.0.2 fails to connect and ethereal shows the flaw as being in the certificate handshake dialogue.

The about:config screen shows that the preference name security.ssl3.rsa_rc4_128_md5 has a value of true.

I can provide ethereal packet captures if desired.

Thanks!



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Attempt to log into web server for remote console.
2. Connection fails.
3. Examine packets with ethereal
Actual Results:  
Login screen never appears as key exchange fails after choosing cipher proposal.

Expected Results:  
Successful negotiation of ssl secured connection.

I label this as Major since there may be others trying to do what I am.

Thanks!
