in the previous version of firefox, you could drag stumbleupon to a different spot--generally i would move it to the right side of the top bar--where file, edit, view, etc. are located.  Now, when i right click and choose customize the toolbar that stumbleupon initially installs on disappears so you no longer have access to move the buttons.  

The bookmarks toolbar does NOT disappear as well though, so it may be a stumbleupon specific problem.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.install stumbleupon
2.right click and check the stumbleupon toolbar so its turned on.
3.  right click and choose "customize"


Actual Results:  
stumbleupon buttons disappear but the toolbar stays--but shrinks in height.

Expected Results:  
stumbleupon toolbar stays active, and i can drag it to a different location, and then disable the actual toolbar it resides on to save space.

if you click "done" in the customization window the stumbleupon toolbar disappears, and you will have to right click and put a check mark next to it to re-enable it again.
