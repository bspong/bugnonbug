Cannot use image map and z-index on the same item

I'm trying to apply a z-index of -1 of a picture, then use an image map over it.

The image map is defined as:
----------------------------
<IMG SRC="images/mascot.png" CLASS="photo2" USEMAP="#photo2">
<MAP NAME="photo2">
	<AREA SHAPE="poly" COORDS="55,19,37,160,175,177,192,36">
	</MAP>

The css for the image is:
-------------------------
img.photo2	{
	position:absolute;
	left:25%;
	top:-15px;
	border:none;
	z-index:-1;
}

The same code works flawlessly in all other browsers (IE8, Safari, Chrome). You can also see a separate image map working on the tag on the right.

I tried putting it in a DIV for the z-index, and the map worked, but the z-index was over-ridden. If one works, the other doesn't (map works, displayed in front or displays properly, no map).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an image map
2. Apply the map to an image
3. Apply a z-index to the image
Actual Results:  
Image appears behind (partially obscured), which is correct. Map does not work at all.

Expected Results:  
Should have drawn the image behind (partially obscured) while allowing the map to work.

Same result for other z-index values that should put it behind something else.
