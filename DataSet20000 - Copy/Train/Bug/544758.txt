FF 3.6 large bookmark file freezes UI, consumes CPU for minutes

Build Identifier: It's back in 3.6 with a vengeance, after being fixed from at least 2.0.0.11 through at least 3.0.17.  After a 1MB bookmarks.html file has been imported, activating the Bookmarks menu the first time in every session produces the spinning beachball of death and 100% CPU utilization for some number of minutes.  (Subsequent times in the same session do not do this.)  Also, while the menu appears immediately, the favicons do not appear until it is done.  Again, it only affects the Bookmarks menu, not the Bookmarks Sidebar.  Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6

Bug 310192 is back in 3.6 with a vengeance, after being fixed from at least 2.0.0.11 through at least 3.0.17.  After a 1MB bookmarks.html file has been imported, activating the Bookmarks menu the first time in every session produces the spinning beachball of death, 100% CPU utilization, and hung UI for some number of minutes.  (Subsequent times in the same session do not do this.)  Also, while the menu appears immediately, the favicons do not appear until it is done.  As before, it only affects the Bookmarks menu, not the Bookmarks Sidebar.
