Hello, I post and moderate www.basketballforum.com which uses Vbulletin's software. When Firefox 3 came out and immediately downloaded it and preceded to try it out, but soon realized that the quickreply feature which allows you to post on the current page without having to open a new one functionality to drastically reduced. Essentially, it will allow you to type and delete however if you try to put your cursor anywhere in the text you have written it won't let you. If you highlight and try to delete, it won't work. Essentially the only way to edit what you have already written is to start and the end and hold the delete key. This feature worked fine in FF2. There is no further problem, if you open up the new page to reply, this problem only pertains to quickreply.

Thanks
Cris
