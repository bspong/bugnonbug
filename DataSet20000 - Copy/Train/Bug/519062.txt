(excuse me for my bad English)

Imagine that user open a web page with pictures. User select some text with images, press ctrl-c. Then user open OpenOffice, press ctrl-v and save document. User who never did this earlier can think that he/she really have all information copied. But when he/she will open document in future and website will not accessible then he/she will be surprised: odt have just links, not images. Information was lost!

This example should show that current behaviour of Firefox ctrl-c is unexpected, incorrect and - sorry - treacherous.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any page with picures.
2. Select text with pictures.
3. Press ctrl-c
4. Go to OpenOffice Writer or MS Word.
5. Press ctrl-v.
6. Save document.
6. Disable access to the network or move document to machine without network access.
7. Open document.
Actual Results:  
Images will not accessible.

Expected Results:  
Images should be accessible in content that was copied with ctrl-c from FF independently from network state.

First variant.
ctrl-c should copy images, but not just links.
Context (right-click) menu should contain 2 options:
- "copy" that copies really images;
- "copy text and links" that copies links in place of real images.

Second variant.
ctrl-c acts as now: copies links in place of images. But also gives warning window about this.
Context (right-click) menu contains 2 options:
- "copy (text and images, but not flash)" that copies really images;
- "copy (only text and links)" that copies links in place of real images.
