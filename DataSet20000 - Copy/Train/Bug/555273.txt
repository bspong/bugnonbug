Flash component is sluggish only in Firefox 3.6.2 on PC
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.2) Gecko/20100316 Firefox/3.6.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

This seems to be a problem regarding Firefox 3.6.2 on Windows XP while it is also running Internet Explorer 8, and also standalone Firefox 3.6.2 on Windows XP. Firefox 3.6.2 seems to be having trouble processing the animations effectively, and it's choking just to load the page, let alone manipulate the page.

After attempting this in every other browser, plus researching the issue, my verdict is that this has to do with the PC version of Firefox 3.6.2, which was released and pushed by Mozilla earlier this week. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to the site with Firefox 3.6.2
2. Click "My Coach"
3. Drag the slider bars around
Actual Results:  
CPU usage goes up immediately upon loading the page.
Firefox becomes less responsive when I try to click on another tab (noticeable 1-2 second delay between any other clicks or actions)

Expected Results:  
CPU usage should stay stable and sliders should update immediately.
