News.yahoo.com goes to http://real-fe.us.news.yahoo.com which does not resolve.

Tech evangelism: something is broken on the Yahoo site, which only affects Bon Echo and possibly other nightly builds of Firefox. The workaround is to either:
1. remove the session id from the link URL (_ylt=/random string/), or
2. change the UA string to any of the standard ones: Firefox, IE, Opera.
This has been a problem for the last few weeks, and happens on a clean profile.  It does not require being logged into Yahoo.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://news.yahoo.com using a Bon Echo nightly.
2. Click on a Slideshow.

Actual Results:  
The Yahoo server responds with:
HTTP/1.0 301 Moved Permanently
Location: http://real-fe.us.news.yahoo.com/nphotos/Midwest-Flooding/ss/events/us/050208midweststorms/s:/ap/20080629/ap_on_re_us/midwest_flooding
Bon Echo goes to the new URL, which does not resolve.

Expected Results:  
Slideshow, HTTP/1.0 200 OK.

Googling on "real-fe.us.news.yahoo.com" gives no results so one reason I am reporting this bug is so that other people can find out something about it when it happens, such as the two workarounds.
