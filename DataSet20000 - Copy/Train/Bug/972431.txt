Drag and drop events do not get registered after using responsive design view
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:28.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/28.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140210161136

Steps to reproduce:

1) go to about:config and check that dom.w3c_touch_events.enabled is set to 0 (default)
2) go to http://pixelscommander.com/polygon/propeller/ and drag the propeller. It rotates.
3) open responsive design view and touch "simulate touch events" in the top bar, and rotate again the propeller (it works)
4) Disable "simulate touch events" (default). And close responsive design view.
5) Close tab and reopen tab at http://pixelscommander.com/polygon/propeller/. The propeller does not work anymore. If you check about:config dom.w3c_touch_events.enabled is set to 1

Anything that the responsive design view enabled/set must disable/unset after it was closed. This can cause strange and hard to debug behavior for developers using Responsive design view.

Reproduced both on Firefox 27 and Firefox 28

Actual results:

Drag&drop events/touch do not get registered after opening and closing responsive design view.


Expected results:

After using "Responsive design view" with "simulate touch events" the page should behave exactly as before opening the mentioned tools. Disabeling the "simulate touch events" in the toolbar and closing the "Responsive design view" should reset the drag&drop/touch events to the default state. This should be done automatically by Firefox and not be by the user in the about:config
