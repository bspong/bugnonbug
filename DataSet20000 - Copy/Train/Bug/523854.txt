Firefox fails to unload properly on program exit, requiring system restart to start Firefox again.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Due to some recent change in my system, the firefox.exe process appears not to be unloading when the application is closed (I verified this in Task Manager).  The program will not restart when I attempt to do so.  The only workaround so far is to restart the system.  Also, when starting Firefox, the application sometimes seems to be taking an inordinate amount of time to load.  If a tab was open when I closed the previous session, Firefox will often complain of a problem trying to restore the session and prompt me to attempt to recover or start a new session.

Reproducible: Didn't try



Expected Results:  
Firefox should exit cleanly and restart properly when opened.

I recently installed quite a few Windows patches from a Patch Tuesday release.  The problem seems to have begun afterwards, although this is no proof that one has anything to do with the other.  However, I am very suspicious, as the patches applied were wide-ranging and attempted to plug a number of security holes.
