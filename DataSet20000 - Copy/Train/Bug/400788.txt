This is most likely a custom theme issue, but in case it's not:

If you apply a background image to the main browser window with the following CSS:

window[windowtype="navigator:browser"][theme="nasanightlaunch"] {
    background: url("chrome://global/skin/subskins/window-picture-4/sts116-s-021.png") top right no-repeat #232323 !important;
}

the background image doesn't show up until the places edit bookmark popup/panel/dialog opens.  It's not the operation of the toolbarbutton that does it; it's the opening of the panel.  Also not triggered by opening the Options window, a menubar menu, or a context menu in the page content area.  So far, only the places dialog makes the window background image show up.

The CSS is in a CSS file @imported in userChrome.css.

I can provide details if this is worth pursuing.
