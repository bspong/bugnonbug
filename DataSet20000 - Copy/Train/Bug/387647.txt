Visit stixfonts.org, and hover your mouse over or through the menu entitled "About Stix Fonts." Notice that the menu, correctly, stays open if you leave your mouse hovering.

Visit the page "project description" or "general information". Now hover your mouse over the menu "about stix fonts", or any entry in it. The menu quickly "disappears", as if your mouse were no longer hovering. Hovering may appear to work on the other menus, but they stay open until the first menu is clicked, even after moving the mouse away (when you first visit the page, the menus will stay open for about two seconds after moving the mouse away).



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to stixfonts.org
2.Go to some other page on the stixfonts.org website, accessible from the menus on the site
3.Go back to the main page.
Actual Results:  
Hovering no longer works on the menus. Menus either stay open after the mouse moves away from them, or don't stay open while the mouse hovers over them.

Expected Results:  
Menus to work correctly, as when you first visit the site, with a clean cache.
