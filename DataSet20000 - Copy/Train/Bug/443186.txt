Can't set the shipping to calculated in Ebay postings
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0
Build Identifier: FIREFOX 3 on Vista and FF3 on OSX Tiger

On new listings/sellings in Ebay, it fights me on making the shipping calculated, and USPS 2-9 days. But sometimes it does let me do it after a few tries and refreshes and then on the preview page it won't post it because it's says there is an error. This is new to Firefox 3, I've tried it on a PC with Vista and a MAC with Tiger.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set up a sale on Ebay
2. Attempt to set shipping as calculated/largepackage/under 1 pound/2-9 days USPS, it doesn't refresh/load the options promptly or sometimes at all. Refresh if it doesn't and sometimes the options will change for you and it will appear to be set how you want it.
3. Click the next/preview option at the bottom of the page.
4. Hit List button, it won't list and will tell you there is an error in the listing?!
Actual Results:  
It won't let you post the item with Calculated Shipping, only as Flat Fee

Expected Results:  
It should let me list it calculated/dependent on zip code.

This is new to FF3, never had the issue in FF2. Contacted and discussed with ebay and they told me they build their site to work within IE browsers. Please, please don't make me use IE. I really don't want to at all, and I want to proudly use Firefox.
