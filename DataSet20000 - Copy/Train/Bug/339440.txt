Could not initialize browser's security component causing SSL to be disabled
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; Media Center PC 4.0)
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.5.0.3

Upon opening the latest version of Firefox I immediately receive the following alert: Could not initialize the browser's security component. The most likely cause is problems with files in your browser's profile directory. Please check that this directory has no read/write restrictions and your hard disk is not full or close to full. It is recommended that you exit the browser and fix the problem. If you continue to use this browser session, you might see incorrect browser behaviour when accessing security features. Exiting Firefox to view the profile manager fails because the system says that Firefox is still running, even upon restart. Continuing to use the browser session results in frequernt messages that a URL cannot be accessed because SSL is disabled. Approximately 10 minutes into a session a message will appear stating addons.mozilla.com (?) cannot be accessed bcause SSL is disabled and the browser will no longer function or close.  This bug also results in an inability to access email functions or access bugzilla.

Reproducible: Always




This occured on startup on Wednesday, May 24, 2006, and has repeated every time I have attempted to open Firefox. I did install San Diego Zoo & Wild Animal Park Screen Saver on the that same day.
