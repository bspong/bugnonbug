"Can't find server" error message

When attempting to reload a page, and/or switching pages on the same site, I frequently get a 'can't find server' error message.  Sometimes, using the 'retry' button on this message page will allow the reoad to proceed  Sometimes, there does not even appear to be an attempt to reload (the firefox tab does not give the 'reload' indication).  
  In either case, I can access the site by going back to the link on my 'favorites' menu, and opening a new tab.  

NOTE:  There is at least one site I access, cnbc.com, that I frequently access, that periodically reloads itself.  I do not know the frequency of these updates.  I have noticed that I occasionally get this error message from this site.
   
   I think the message is inappropriate, since I am already connected to the server in question, unless there is a temporary disconnection during the reload process.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Attempt to reload page, or to change pages on a site
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
seemingly random failure to reload page or to switch pages
Sometimes, reload occurs after several retries

Expected Results:  
normal reload/page change
