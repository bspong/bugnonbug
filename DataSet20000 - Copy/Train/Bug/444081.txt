Can't uninstall Firefox version 3 using Control Panel/Add & Remove Programs

Have tried this a lot, even after restarting windows XP, can't uninstall Firefox 3.0 using remove button.  Had a sneaky look in uninstall folder in C:/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/Uninstall and there's no Uninstall program, but a helper file.

I upgraded from version 2 thinking that this version would be quicker, but quickly discovered that it didn't work with a lot of the websites that I use regularly.  I wanted to uninstall it and have decided to go back to IE7, which also has some bugs, but seems to work better for me, or try to reinstall version 2 of Firefox.

Help me remove this Firefox version 3 from my pc.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start
2.Control Panel
3.Add Remove programs
4. Click on Mozilla Firefox
5. Click on Remove
Actual Results:  
Highlight goes lighter as if it's going to work, then nothing happens and the highlight goes back darker again.  I am then able to click on remove again - something that shouldn't happen if Uninstall is working in background.

Expected Results:  
I should have been able to uninstall the program
