Hotmail, msn webmail, "the classic version of Qwest Mail"- which is just the classic version of hotmail/msn webmail.
     Once in the inbox or another folder, the folders to the upper left, Inbox, Sent, whatever custom ones, will not open in tabbed browsing.  Right click and the choices are, "Bookmark this link.  Copy this link.  Properties".  This worked prior to FF 2.0.0.15.  Tabbed browsing *does* work with IE 7 on these folders.  May be an MSN FU to FF, I can't really tell.  The status window states javascript;  There is nothing in the error console when changing folders or trying to tab browse.  I have disabled NoScript.  No change in behavior.  Sun Java Standard Ed. 6 Version 6 update 5 build 1.6.0_05-b13  

Hotmail already forces one to type in their password twice when logging in as the first attempt *always* fails.  This I'm convinced is a MS FU to FF.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.login to hotmail using firefox
2.click on the inbox to display messages
3.right click on a folder and look at the choices
Actual Results:  
No choices to tab browse.  All but the above mentioned three menu choices are gone from a right click on a folder in hotmail.

Expected Results:  
Should have the usual number of choices when right clicking on a link.
