log in issue, browser adding multiple items to cart, error msg displayed even when page is there
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.8) Gecko/2009032609 Firefox/3.0.8

Issue 1: Log in issue - After downloading new FF 3.0.8, unable to log into Myspace. After attempting to log in, I visited my page and was shown "online" even though it didn't appear that the log in worked. Issues logging into other websites as well.
Issue 2: Browser adding multiple items to cart. The link included above is an example of what this is doing. Reproductibility shown below.
Issue 3: Error message displayed even when page is there - I am able to log into my ZenCart, but once inside, any of the links I click give me an 404 error message. Opening the same admin in IE, all links work perfectly.

All issues that I am reporting just started after downloading FF 3.0.8. All of the above work perfectly in IE 8.0.6, as well as version 6.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.mineraliciousmakeup.com/products/details/1/test1
2. Select either of the Test2 or Test3 attributes from the dropdown box 
3. Click add to cart
4. Site will redirect to cart, where you will see the item has been added with multiple quantities and attributes 
Actual Results:  
I added the item with Test3 attribute, in the cart, the following items are showing: Test1 w/test3 attribute x 2 and Test1 item w/no attributes x 2...so the browser is adding multiple items/quantities

Expected Results:  
Cart should just have item Test1 w/Test3 attribute x 1

All of these bug issues occur even after uninstalling Firefox completely (including all plug ins) and reinstalling a fresh copy.
