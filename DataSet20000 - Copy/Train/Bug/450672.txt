FF3 has been crashing a lot recently for me, I am attempting to view a file in an intranet site (which works fine in IE) the file attempting to be viewed is as any of these extensions (.pdf, .doc, .xls)  Also having crash problems when FF3 is being used in an intranet site to browse a location on my hard drive for an upload.  Also receiving file error "C:/DOCUME~1/TEMP/XXXXX.doc cannot be written to temp directory, as the files in there cannot be changed." (*XXXX.doc used as an example) or something to that nature....

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in to intranet
2. Enter Interchange file uploading intranet
3. Find file
4. hit View link (which normally opens the document immediately on my desktop)

Actual Results:  
Firefox closes completely

Expected Results:  
should have opened the file on my computer.

no theme used, nothing out of ordinary, links were working before switching to FF3.
