 Password prompt appearing frequently
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3

I have just loaded 1.0PR after running .9.3. I am now prompted repeatedly for my
userid and password authenticating me on our proxy server. I was prompted 3
times loading the forums page.

I normally don't allow my password to be saved to prevent other users in my
office from using my account but in desperation I tried saving my password. Made
no difference.

Proxy server is a Microsoft ISA server.

My operating system is winXP sp1. 

I have uninstalled 1.oPR and gone back to 0.9.3.  Problem does not occur.

I posted this on the forums and there several other users connecting to
Microsoft Proxy servers who are experiencing the same problem.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  enter a URL for a site such as http://forums.mozillazine.org/
2.  When userid password dialog appears enter details and submit
3.

Actual Results:  
The password dialog reappears after part of the page is loaded, submit, more of
the page loads, password dialog re-appears.  Going to the above URL the password
dialog appeared 3 times.  If you cancel dialog it only re-appears again

Expected Results:  
It should have only prompted for userID and password once for the browser session

From the forum it seems that the problem is probably related to connecting to
Microsoft ISA server.  I do not run the Microsoft Proxy agent.  The members
experiencing the problem are not all running on XP as I am - one was running on
windows 2000
