Hard shutdown of PC after closing all apps. Turned on then off PC (ran maybe
4secs then shut down hard. Was trying to fix battery backup issue) Next turned
on PC and allowed XP to boot up, told it to boot normal, go the blues screen
asking to repair hardrive files and folders for consistenacy. Allowed repair to
occur when finished noticed it had scrolled "fixes" on my files/folders and all
Firefox info/data where all truncated in my C:/documentsandsettings/rob folder. 

When loading up firefox all my bookmarks and data stored in my settings were
gone. I then tried to repeat this and was able to repeat this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Hard shut down of pc with all apps closed (os XP Pro no service pack 2)
2.Start PC but only a second or 2 and shut down again
3.Start pc and allow to boot using normal mose and allow windows to run disk
checking when promted

Actual Results:  
All info for my firefox settings were truncated. This appears on the disk check
run by windows

Expected Results:  
load normal 

I have installed the toolbar from http://www.anonymization.net on Firefox. I can
not seem to unistall it nor does the FIrefox unistall info reside in the regkey.
I tried to unistall Firefox from the C:/programs/firefox/unistall folder(not
actual folder but you know what i mean) and got a regkey entry missing message.
