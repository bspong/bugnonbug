Firefox closes down every time I try to open an article (any article) from wsj.com.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2b2) Gecko/20091108 Firefox/3.6b2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2b2) Gecko/20091108 Firefox/3.6b2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

The problem, I believe is when Firefox tries to show the new type of ads that wsj.com started to use for the last 10 days (before everything worked fine).
The same problem happens when opening an article from theatlantic.com
For example, 
http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/11/jeffrey_sachs_on_obamas_inadequacy.php 

These ads have a special feature "rollover to discover" which expands the ad and changes it once the mouse rolls over them.

The problem is extremely annoying I guess for all the Firefox readers of these two periodicals (and perhaps of other sites). 
The only current solution to read them is through Explorer :-(



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.log on wsj.com
2.click on any article
3.the page will open fine until the add on the right is loaded at which moment the Firefox closes itself automatically
Actual Results:  
Firefox closes down completely.

Expected Results:  
Should open the page normally and continue to work

PS: the problem existed with Forefox 3.0 and 3.5, and persisted even if all the extensions were blocked.
I also updated all the media s/w I have to the latest versions available: nothing helped.
