When using the copy copy/paste on an image, a strip of pixels from the far left of the image (from top to bottom) are added to the far right of the image. I noticed this first when the drag&drop functionality was removed from FF3 (grr) and I had to start using copy/paste to get album artwork into MediaMonkey from FF3. I then repoduced the error consistently copying from FF3 and pasting into Paint .NET and with the same IMG URL did not get the error using IE7.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Copy an image in FF3. Use one that has different stuff e.g. colour on the right and the left. http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61c8gHJxlIL.jpg is quite good as the right hand side should be a white line.
2. Paste the image into anything e.g. Photoshop, Paint .NET
3. Observe the approx 10 pixels from the left have been transpose to the right.
Actual Results:  
The resultant pasted image has approx 10 pixels from the left hand side transposed to the right hand side.

Expected Results:  
The image should be pixel prefect paste of the original.
