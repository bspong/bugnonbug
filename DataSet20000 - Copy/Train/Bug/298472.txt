Long strings rendering badly (either not shown or line wrap is screwed up)

Long strings of random characters have display issues.  In the example page the
string wraps without a newline, so the page renders looking like there was a
printer jam (the wrapped text appears on the same line as the unwrapped text). 
 By decreasing the length of the DNA sequence it's possible to get it so the
line does not appear at all (though view->source shows that the string is still
there, just not being displayed)  Possibly related to bug 280104, where long
strings are not displayed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Try to view a page consisting of a long string of random characters (example
included)
Actual Results:  
The second half of the text (wrapped text) appeared on the same line as the
first half.

Expected Results:  
Either the line should not have wrapped or it should have wrapped on a second line.

I checked this on Suse 9.3 and Redhat with the same results.  On windows there
were also display issues but not identical ones (the line was not displayed but
appeared when text was highlighted)
