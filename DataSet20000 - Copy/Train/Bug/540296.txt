Opening JavaScript chromeless windows renders Firefox functional but unusable.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.3a1pre) Gecko/20100116 Minefield/3.7a1pre

If a JavaScript chromeless window is opened from within the last build from 2010/01/08, when the window is closed, new tabs cannot be opened, pages cannot be reloaded, nothing can be entered into the address bar, drop-down menus cannot be opened, and the Close button doesn't work, so the process has to be killed directly. After doing so, the Restore Session screen only works half the time (but always appears).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a JavaScript chromeless window.
2. Close it.
3. Try to use the address bar.
4. Try to close Firefox.
Actual Results:  
The address bar didn't work, and Firefox wouldn't close.

Expected Results:  
Well, that was expected, but, ideally, everything would have kept working.
