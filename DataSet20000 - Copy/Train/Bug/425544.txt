Used USB Overdrive (www.usboverdrive.com) to get the side scroll buttons on my mouse (Logitech G5 with no other drivers) to work as back/forward. It seems to work unless a text box on the web page has focus, in that situation it seems to perform a home/end key stroke behaviour. I'm pretty sure it is the proper back/forward commands being sent and not just cmd+arrow (which would explain why this happens).

The behaviour is correct in safari where the back/forward mouse button works regardless of what control in the web page has focus.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on a link so the back command is available.
2. Click a text box on the web page to give it focus.
3. Use the mouse back button.
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens. If there is text in the text box then the cursor will move to the beginning.

Expected Results:  
Expect the mouse back button to get us back to the first web page we were on.

Workaround is you always have to ensure no text box on the web page has focus before using the mouse back/forward buttons.
