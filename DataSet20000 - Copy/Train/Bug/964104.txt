Icon moves when activating toolbar buttons that show panels
There are two kinds of "buttons" which can be placed on the toolbar: those who just execute one action ("open new window") and those who show a menu. I am talking about the second kind here. This is true for the current Linux nighlty build, I am not sure if other platforms have similar problems.

Currently there seem to be four (!) ways a "button which shows a menu" can work:

1.) the menu opens on mouse-release, icon changes position a few pixels to bottom/right. This can be seen here:
- Encoding
- History
- Web developer tools
- Downloads

2.) the menu opens on mouse-press, the icon changes position a few pixels to bottom/right. Does not support activation of items by press-drag-release. This can be seen here:
- Customize and control


3.) the menu opens on mouse-press, icon does never changes position but menu changes postion a few pixels to the right after moving the mouse pointer to the menu. Does support activation of items by press-drag-release. This can be seen here:
- Bookmarks

4.) the menu opens on long-press, icon changes postion but only when moving mouse away from the button while keeping the mouse button down. This can be seen here:
- Back
- Forward

IMHO 1-3 menus should 
a) already open on mouse-press
b) support press-drag-release to activate contained items
c) not move the icon around

Case 4 is special, it works fine but the icon should not change position.
