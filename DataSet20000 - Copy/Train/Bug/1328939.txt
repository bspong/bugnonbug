Selection in inspector sidebars extends outside of scrollable part, so keyboard scrolling doesn't work
+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1327771 +++

Text selection in console and inspector extends to outside of scrollable part.
And that, in turn causes these issues:
- (1) Up/Down/PageUp/PageDown/Home/End buttons don't work
- (2) filter buttons / tabs in inspector become selected
- (3) Ctrl+Shift+Home/End doesn't scroll srollable area to the beginning/end
This can be resolved by using iframes. Proof of concept:
