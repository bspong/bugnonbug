This has happened a few times and is somewhat dangerous.  You complete an online purchase, enter CC information and such, your transaction completes.  You then start doing something else on another tab.  Later, sometimes hours later.  You are back on the tab that had your online purchase and you press the back button on the browser.  Your financial information is resent and a duplicate transaction occurs.  Not really a big one, but it depends on the dollar amount.  This happened on my mortgage and I wound up making two $1600 payments in a matter of hours and the mortgage company just applied the extra to the principal.  I have had this happen with various web sites and various processors, from Paypal to LinkPoint.  IE doesn't do this.  Once the transaction is sent and you have received the confirmation code from the online whatever you are not able to press the back button and have the transaction sent again.  Firefox will let you toggle back and forth between the "confirm this transaction or submit" page and the "confirmation" page and each time you toggle you have another transaction.
