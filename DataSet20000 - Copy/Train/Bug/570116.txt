Firefox reports wrong QuickTime Plugin Version
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; de; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20100527 Firefox/3.6.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; de; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20100527 Firefox/3.6.4

Situation:
Mac OS X 10.6.3 with QuickTime Player X Version 10.0 (113) and QuickTime Framework 7.6.6. No legacy QuickTime Player 7.6.6 installed, only QuickTime Player X with its QT 7.6.6 Framework.



Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Firefox reports wrong QuickTime Plugin Version, although all other browsers (Apple Safari, Google Chromium/Chrome, Opera and even Camino) do report it correct.

Expected Results:  
Firefox (release build as well as nightly trunk build) should report the correct QuickTime Plugin version as all other browsers including latest Camino nightly trunk build are also able to.

Question: From where does Firefox fetch the outdated (and obviously not installed!) version number of QuickTime/the QuickTime Plugin, although a newer version is installed and all other browsers (inclusive Camino!) are able fetch to report the correct and actual version number of the QuickTime Plugin and its Framework?
Please check and correct this, if it is faulty.
