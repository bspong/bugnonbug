I saw some similar issues, but nothing specifically relating to this issue. (If I missed a search result, my apologies.) Sometimes when I start up Firefox, it will freeze. It won't just affect Firefox, but my entire computer. The exact effects are more like extreme lag. Anything I try to do has about a ten second delay. Typing in the address bar, scrolling, opening a new tab, anything. This also affects anything else I'm currently working on. If I switch to another program, it will hang for about ten seconds, then switch to it, but those programs work fine.

I tried a reinstall, a complete erase and reinstall, tried it without any add-ons and created a new user profile, but the problem still exists. Every other program still works fine, and it happens completely at random. It will be working fine, I'll close it, re-open it, and it will start acting up. I'm not sure what the differences are that create this situation.

Force Quit does not have any effect, even in the rare times I can access the menu due to the lag.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox. This is honestly the only thing that I have to do.
Actual Results:  
Freezes/lags, making any action nearly impossible. Does not resolve itself, Force Quit has no effect, entire computer affected.

Expected Results:  
Open smoothly and allow normal operations.

It's all in the Details. However, note that when this happens, I do not get any crash notification or error messages of any kind.
