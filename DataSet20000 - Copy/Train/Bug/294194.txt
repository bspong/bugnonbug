Firefox seems "impatient" when on dial-up.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

I'm using dial-up now with FFox. Of course I understand that dial-up is slower.
Problem is, when I am using FFox and loading in more than 1 page at a time, FFox
seems to be too willing to just give up and say that it can't find the site,
can't connect to it, or it's unavailable, or any number of excuses like that. 
But if I stop the loadin for all the tabs and load them individually, they all
load just fine.  
FFox seems to time out too easily.  I only mention this because of tabbed
browsing being a major selling point for FFox.  Seems silly to have to load each
page manually rather than selecting "Reload all Tabs" from the tab context menu.
Is there a simple way to make it wait longer before giving up?  Yes, dial-up is
slower, but I just have to deal with that.  If FFox will wait longer, it'll work
better with dial-up.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start FFox
2.  Wait for my 5 homepages to load (remember, they are already cached to some
degree.)
3.  Curse when error messages start appearing.

Actual Results:  
Above mentioned errors


Expected Results:  
Loaded all pages in perfectly without problems.  Will be slow due to limited
bandwidth of dial-up, but that's OK.  Life is hard.

I have rated this as a major problem because tabbed browsing is a major selling
point of FFox.  (I mean it's a major reason why people switch from IE to FF)
