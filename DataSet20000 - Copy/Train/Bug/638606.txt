The installation (upgrade) requests OS reboot even after OS reboot
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.0; Trident/5.0)
Build Identifier: Mozilla Firefox Setup 3.6.14

After loading the file for Firefox setup 3.6.14, I was told I needed to reboot to complete the instalation.  I was asked if I wanted to do that.  I responded yes and the computer rebooted.  When I attemtped to open FireFox, I was told that I needed to reboot the computer to complete the installation.  I was asked if I wanted to reboot and didso.  When the computer rebooted, it again ran the script.  Aftward, I again attempted to open Firefox and was again told I needed to reboot.  I then attempted to uninstall Firefox and was again told I needed to reboot to complete the installation, which I did.  Again I could not open FireFox. 

I was then advised by a Geek Squad member to reinstall an older version.  I attempted to do so but ran into the same popup telling me that I needed to reboot my computer to complete the recent installation
