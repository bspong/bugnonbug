I'm sorry for not being more detailed, but I don't know exactly what the problem
is. I don't find this bug particularly annoying, but I figured I should at least
report it.
Basically, sometimes when I click on a link, or do something that may or may not
require a change in the webpage, there is this sort of digital static displayed
that looks like part of the website went through a blender. Selecting all
removes the abberation and if the abberation covers link, hovering over the
links will remove the abberration over them.
I think this is a DOM issue, I'm not sure, so I left it under general.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Don't try to reproduce this bug, just be randomly using firefox;
2. And then all the sudden there's this wierd static that you know you've seen
before but can't describe it;
3. And then look like an idiot for filing a bug that you can't reproduce

Actual Results:  
Wierd abberation

Expected Results:  
No abberation.
