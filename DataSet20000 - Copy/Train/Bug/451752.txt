<a href="http://www.rippenschneider.de/bbforum/images/smilies/39.gif">ok</a>


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See details, just make a html-file with these lines and open it.
Actual Results:  
No display if URI contains www

Expected Results:  
Interprete/transform URI given in img-src-attribute the same way as given in a-href-attribute. (I think previous FF-versions behaved as expected.)
