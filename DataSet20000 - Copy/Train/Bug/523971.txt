I have the newest version of Firefox and I'm very annoyed with it.  When I try to open up Firefox, it takes 1 - 2 minutes just trying to open up on my laptop.  Also, when i am on any site, it takes forever to load up, especially if there is a java or adobe reader that also needs to load on the page.  I know it is not the actual websites and it is not my connection because I've re-downloaded the new Firefox and have run Internet Explore which runs better than Firefox.  Why is it running slow and what can i do to fix it?
