Back and Forward functions not working with buttons, file menu or keyboard

Firefox and only be opened once. After a restart of the application the back and forward functions do not work.  The page loads but the browser load animation on the tab never starts.  The computer has to be restarted to fix this problem but then it starts again when firefox is closed then started again.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start firefox
2.close firefox
3.start firefox again
Actual Results:  
Page load animation never stops and back and forward functions do not work

Expected Results:  
Allow back and forward from page to page

Theme does not make a difference.   A blank page always loads on the restart and the home button or keyboard functions does not take me to my home page, only the the firefox search page.  
I am listing this as a major severity since it renders the program useless. I have been using safari until this is fixed because it makes the program useless after one use unless I restart the computer.
