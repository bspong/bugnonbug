Crash after answering "Confirm Setting Cookie" dialog whose window had been closed
Talkback incident id TB35945643G.  I've seen this a couple of times before.  I didn't file a bug report, but I probably sent a Talkback if it gave me a chance to do so.

I closed a window (or maybe a tab) and later noticed an orphaned "Confirm Setting Cookie" dialog lying around.  (In this case I first noticed it on the Window menu but couldn't find it visually and the menu did nothing; then it magically reappeared when I returned to Firefox after switching to another application for a minute.)

When I saw the dialog window, I clicked on "Deny".  A blank browser window with the URL was created, the mouse cursor turned into a busy spinning rainbow for a few seconds, and then I got the message "The application Firefox quit unexpectedly." from MacOS and a similar message from Talkback.

While I'm not familiar with the Mozilla code at all, if you don't have any better ideas, the first thing I'd suggest is to look at the code the Talkback stack trace points you to, and see if something needs to check for an unexpected null value or disposed object.  That is, my hunch is that it's trying to feed a cookie (or deny one) to an object that no longer exists in memory.

If you want to know how I got an orphaned "Confirm Setting Cookie" dialog in the first place, I'm not sure, but I frequently use cmd-Tab to create new tabs without immediately flipping to them, which may have something to do with it.
