On some pages containing Polish characters (such as the one whose address is
given), the page looks correctly on screen, but printing produces extra spaces
after some of the Polish characters, which makes the printout look ugly and
unreadable. The archive attached contains the whole of the above page (since
it's a page dedicated to an event which has already taken place, the page may be
put offline, so I archived it) and a postscript document produced by prinitng it
to file. Notice the extra spaces after some (but not all !) Polish characters
(the accented letters) and that the font looks monospaced instead of a
proportional sans serif. I also encountered the same behavior several times with
some other pages with Polish characters (using the browser from mozilla the
suite, not firefox), but it was a long time ago and I can't locate them any more.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open one of the affected pages (e.g. the one given in "URL") 
2. Print it to file or to printer
3.

Actual Results:  
Extra space was added after some Polish characters

Expected Results:  
There should be no additional space after these characters

Some pages with Polish chars display and print correctly. The errors may be due
to some special html found on the page, but I was unable to identify the exact
cause.
