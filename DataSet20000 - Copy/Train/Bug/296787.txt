Feature request: Disable JavaScript particular functions/methods for particular domains

The user should be able to disable particular JavaScript functions/methods for
particular domains using the "Preferences" dialogs "Web Features" section. In
this section the categoies "Enable JavaScript" "Advanced..." button should lead
to a more complicated but feature enriched dialog. Like in the "Allowed Sites"
dialog from "Block Popup Windows" there should be the possibility to enter a
domain name. Additionally it should be able to enter a function or maybe several
functions separated by semikola. The entered data may then be committed into a
table (like in the "Allowed Sites" dialog) by the button "Disable".

There should also be a possibilty to generally disable/enable JavaScript
(without wiping/reentering data).

When possible the domain name this feature is matching against should be the one
 in the adress bar. As a result that would mean (i)frames or included JavaScript
files hosted in other domains would be disabled without researching and entering
data for each of their domains.

Example:
Disable the JavaScript method "write" for the domain "mercateo.com".

The target:
Since Popup windows may be blocked by Firefox they keep comming up with those
full screen "DIV" banners to annoy each of us with their stoopit comercial
stuff. As if we would buy that crap just for they put it in front of the stuff
we like...

It would also be cool to lock variables/attributes to a special or their initial
 value...
