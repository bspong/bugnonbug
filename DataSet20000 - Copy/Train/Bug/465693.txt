Dragging a bookmark from the bookmarks toolbar to the tabstrip to open a new tab seems to break most of the functionality of the bookmarks toolbar. Once the new tab is created the bookmarks toolbar is 'frozen' clicking bookmarks does nothing, the iBeam cursor from the drag operation is still showing, none of the live bookmarks or most visited tag folders will expand, bookmarks can't be dragged anywhere.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.New profile
2.Drag a bookmark from the bookmarks toolbar onto the tab strip to open a new tab.
3.
Actual Results:  
Notice how the bookmarks toolbar is now 'frozen' clicking bookmarks does nothing, the iBeam cursor from the drag operation in step 2 is still showing, none of the live bookmarks or 'Most Visited' tag folders will expand, bookmarks can't be dragged anywhere.

Expected Results:  
Bookmarks in the bookmarks toolbar to behave normally

You can activate bookmarks and expand folders, but only if you have the mouse cursor right at the bottom a few pixels from the border between the bookmarks toolbar and the tabstrip.
