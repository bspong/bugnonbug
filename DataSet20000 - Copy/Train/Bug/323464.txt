I keep getting unresponsive script messages when going to the above indicated page.  It does not occur with other CBS Sportsline pages that also update, such as http://www.sportsline.com/nhl/gamecenter/live/NHL_20060114_NYR@DET.  The message returns me to the problem page from whatever other page I happen to be viewing at the time...very annoying.  The message instructs me to click "continue", to see if the script can be completed; or "end script" to end the script now.  No matter what I click, and even when I "x" the message out or make it disappear from the screen by clicking whatever other page is underneath (on rare occasions, the message appears over the page I am viewing without returning me to the problem page), it returns within 15 seconds or so. I am using a Compaq laptop with Windows XP.  By the way, this does not happen when I go to the same page in Internet Explorer (6.0 with service pack 2) or the AOL browser.  I'm using a wireless G adapter and no matter what wireless network I access, the problem exists.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://cvfhl.hockey.sportsline.com/scoreboard/live using Firefox browser



Actual Results:  
see details section above

Expected Results:  
page should update automatically, which it seems does happen, but without the repeatd interruptions of the unresponsive script messages
