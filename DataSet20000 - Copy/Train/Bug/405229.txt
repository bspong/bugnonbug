Environment:  Dell Inspiron 1501 laptop running Fedora 8 Linux

The touchpad on the 1501 has special areas on the right and bottom to simulate the scroll wheel function of a mouse.  The scroll area on the right comes into the program as X button press events for buttons 4 and 5.  These result in vertical scrolling as expected.  The scroll area on the bottom comes into the program as X button press events for buttons 6 and 7.  Moving left in the horizontal scroll area of the touchpad results in a PAGE BACK operation; moving right results in a PAGE FORWARD operation.  This is quite frustrating because a slightly misplaced finger can cause it.  I assume the idea was that these would trigger a horizontal scroll operation, although I have never seen a real mouse with a horizontal scroll wheel.  Making these events to a horizontal scroll would be great, but just ignoring them would be a big improvement over the current situation.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch firefox
2.Move finger in the horizontal scroll area
3.
Actual Results:  
PAGE BACK or PAGE FORWARD operation depending on direction of finger movement.

Expected Results:  
No action.

Horizontal scrolling would be even better than no action.
