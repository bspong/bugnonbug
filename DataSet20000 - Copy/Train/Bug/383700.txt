NS_ERROR_FAILURE (apparently random) stops javascript processing and images loading
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20070515 Firefox/2.0.0.4

I have never noticed this behavior before 2.0.0.4.
Since I upgraded, every now and then a page fails to load and the following error appears in the error console:

[Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIFileOutputStream.init]" nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)" location: "JS frame :: file:///Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/components/nsSessionStore.js :: sss_writeFile :: line 2025" data: no]

When it occurs it usually stops loading a part of the Javascript on the page, resulting in various javascript errors, and most of the time some images on the page appear as broken links.
If I reload the page (and get the exact same HTML source) it usually loads fine, with no error.

I have not yet found a pattern with this, or a way to reproduce it systematically, although it seems to occur quite frequently on some websites.
I will add more details if I can find additional info.

This can be quite annoying because it makes you think the website is broken/down, which is something we don't want our customers to think of our services, so I selected major severity.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Firefox 2.0.0.4 and browse the web as ususal
2. If at some point the images on a page appear to be broken and/or part of the dynamic behavior of the page seems to be missing, check the error console for this error.
3. If you see the same error, reload the page, it will usually go away
