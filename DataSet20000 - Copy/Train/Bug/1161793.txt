Pocket: Race condition in onShow handling
There is a race condition occurring with the panel messaging (panel <=> chrome) that is causing a number of issues, primarily an infinite spinner showing on the save dialog or panels not loading.

This is the root cause of the following bugs:
- https://github.com/Pocket/Firefox/issues/15
- https://github.com/Pocket/Firefox/issues/17
- The missing error state described in: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1161654#c4

The problem:

The cause of the bug is an expected handling of the onShow callback of the showPanel method.

In the add-on code, when the button is clicked the following is called:
1. pktUI.pocketButtonOnCommand which goes all the way down to pktUI.saveAndShowConfirmation
2. This calls pktUI.showPanel and passes a callback onShow that is expected to be called after the panel shows.
3. The panel is then loaded and the javascript inside of the panel initializes
4. The panel then triggers it's onpopupshown shown event which calls pktUI.pocketPanelDidShow, which in turns calls the onShow callback
5. This onShow callback then sends a message to the panel and continues

However, the code in native integration is doing something slightly different and not using the native onpopupshown event callback. When the Pocket button is clicked:
1. Calls onPanelViewShowing in Pocket.jsm
2. This method then in one line after the other calls: pktUI.pocketButtonOnCommand and pktUI.pocketPanelDidShow, so the following occurs:
3. pktUI.pocketButtonOnCommand which goes all the way down to pktUI.saveAndShowConfirmation
4. This calls pktUI.showPanel and passes a callback onShow that is expected to be called after the panel shows.
5. [race condition occurs here]
6. pktUI.pocketPanelDidShow is called immediately before the panel can potentially load and the content inside of it initializes. 
7. This immediately calls the onShow callback which tries to send a message to the panel, but the panel hasn't loaded yet so the message is never received.

As a result, the panel ends up in a state that will never complete.

The solution:

A) The ideal solution is that pktUI.pocketPanelDidShow gets called when the panel shows (using the onpopupshown event). This will mirror what the add-on code is doing and will make it easier for us to maintain consistency there.

B) If there is a problem with doing that, we can update our messaging framework to have the panel send a message up to the chrome to say "I've loaded" and then use that in place of the onpopupshown event. This will work, but it's possible this introduces a flash or delay after the panel loads before content pops in.
