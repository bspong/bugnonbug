After Print Preview, Jscript event listeners stop responding

After returning from Print Preview, any actions that were assigned through event listeners no longer respond. For example, clicking links or buttons that have attached events no longer triggers the events. By contrast, standard links with an href value are followed, and/or code within onclick attributes is executed. It is only attached events, be it to an individual item or to the body, that are ignored. All the attached events work fine prior to Print Preview, and work fine once again after page refresh.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://demo.backbase.com/RSS/
2. Toggle tabs ("Live" or "Archive") and Show/Hide Columns to verify that these events respond. Note the time display in the upper-right corner.
3. Enable Print Preview.
4. Exit Print Preview.
5. Attempt to reproduce the previous actions (toggle tabs and/or Show/Hide Columns). 



Actual Results:  
They have stopped responding. The time-display in the upper-right corner has also stopped. 
Please Note: This page has a built-in auto-refresh time interval; after it triggers, the page functions once again. 

Expected Results:  
Attached events should continue to respond after Print Preview.

The page above is merely one public example. Other pages not available publicly but all using the same event attachment model are behaving exactly the same.

This bug is NOT present in Firefox 2. 
This bug is most likely related to Bug 296288.

There does not seem to be any possible workaround.

We have been advising all our users to use Firefox, but until this issue is fixed we are sadly unable to continue to do so.
