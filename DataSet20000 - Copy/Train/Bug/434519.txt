I am a developer for Queensborough Community College and we have always received a warning from firefox when directed to our secure SSL server. This only appears in firefox and never in IE. We are using a valid verisign certificate and IE doesn't show this message.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any webpage on our ssl server https://www2.qcc.cuny.edu

Like URL above or use the search on this page:
http://www8.qcc.cuny.edu/search?q=www2.qcc.cuny.edu&btnG=Search&entqr=0&ud=1&sort=date%3AD%3AL%3Ad1&output=xml_no_dtd&site=collection-1&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&client=collection-1&proxystylesheet=collection-1

Actual Results:  
Warning, unable to verify the identity if www2.qcc.cuny.edu as a trusted site.
In the SSL certificate details "Could not verify this certificate for unknown reasons.

Expected Results:  
There should be no warning and browser should go to pages with no prompt.

This has been a problem for years in firefox which is my default browser and I should have reported it earlier. Thanks
