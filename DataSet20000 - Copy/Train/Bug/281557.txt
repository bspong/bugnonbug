When attempting to rename folders in manage bookmarks I cannot rename the first
folder that I click on (Rename button is currently greyed out).  I then click on
another folder and the rename button becomes available and stays that way.  This
is reproducibile every time I attempt to manage bookmarks.  If I click on a
sub-folder the rename button is still unavailable until I click on a second folder.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open manage bookmarks - rename button is currently available
2.  Left click on any folder (on the left hand menu) - rename button is unavailable
3.  Left click on any folder (on the left hand menu) - rename button is available 
4.  Left clicking on any subsequent folder the rename button is continues to be
available
Actual Results:  
rename button is currently available
rename button is unavailable
rename button is available 

If you click on a folder on the right menu the rename button becomes available,
but the first folder you click on the left side cannot be renamed.  You must
first click on another folder and then click back on the previous to rename the
folder

Expected Results:  
Any folder or bookmark that I click on should be renameable
