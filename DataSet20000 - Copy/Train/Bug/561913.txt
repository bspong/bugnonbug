cannot use Firefox to log into routers
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Firefox fails to echo the header of Belkin routers to the screen.  You need the header to show on the screen to allow you to log onto the router.  Router is just a generic Belkin router.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.log into router http://192.168.2.1
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Outputs some of the components of the router to the screen but not the Belkin header on the top of the screen.  You need the Belkin header to log into the router.  Also fails to display the left sidebar from the router to the screen.  You need the left sidebar in order to navigate the router menu and set various settings for the router.  That is a moot point however since I cannot even log in.

Expected Results:  
Display a header so you can log into the router to set it up. Haven't tried any other type of router but seems to be consistent with Belkin type routers.  Also display the left side navigation bar.
