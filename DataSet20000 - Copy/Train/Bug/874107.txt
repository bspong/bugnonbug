Steps to reproduce:

Hi. I am a web designer and I just upgraded from XP to 8 and first overall problem I had was ClearType in the entire OS. So I disabled ClearType in the Windows 8 Control Panel settings and I also deselected 'Smooth edges of screen fonts' from Visual Effects tab and noticed that the later one disables antialiasing/smoothing/ClearType for web fonts on Firefox. Which means it renders all fonts, default and web fonts without any smoothing/antialiasing effect, which is bad. Default fonts should be rendered as sharp fonts and web fonts should be rendered as they supposed to be (with antialiasing effect). I cannot enable that setting in the Windows options just for that, because it enables smooth effect on the entire OS and it kills me. Windows XP doesn't have that ClearType crap and it all works fine, why can't they do the same with 8?

Also my about:config setting gfx.font_rendering.cleartype.use_for_downloadable_fonts is set to true which I suppose means that it should render web fonts with antialiasing cleartype effect.

I am using Firefox 21.0 with Windows 8 Pro x64.


Actual results:

ClearType do not work for web fonts. Windows settings overrides Firefox.


Expected results:

Web fonts should be rendered with ClearType as set in the about:config options.
