when a pdf document is oppened in firefox, all Photoshop functions are blocked, but firefox still work.
When I try to close firefox's page containing pdf file then Firefox will start using almost 100% of cpu being blocked. I have to stop firefox in windows task manager. then everything comes back to normal.
