I have elected not to use tabs, yet continue to have tabs line appear, not only with the site I am looking at, but all the Mozilla Firefox Start Page tab appears as well.  I have gone into tools, made sure tabs were not elected and they were not. saved settings and tried again.  Same problem.  I really don't want tab to appear nor do I want the google start page to always appear as the Mozilla Firefox Start Page tab.  Can you fix this bug.  Was not a problem in old version. Really like the vers 3.0 beta is much faster and very few crashes compared to the older versions.  Thanks for listening.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open firefox with your selected home page (in my case yahoo mail)
Window opens quickly with yahoo mail login.  However
2.At same time a tab appears for the Mozilla Firefox Start Page and is always there. 
3.
Actual Results:  
Always happens

Expected Results:  
Don't want to see tabs appear at all, if a tab MUST appears, then only the tab for site I am looking at.  Do not want to see The Mozilla Firefox Start Page tab every time.
