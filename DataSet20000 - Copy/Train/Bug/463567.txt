I've had this problem in Firefox 3.0, but the problem is still there in 3.1 beta 1.

When Firefox is used for an extended period of time, (usually more than 10 minutes) Firefox will start to display pages in correctly, showing just text, and omitting all formatting and picture files.

Refresh does not clear up the problem.

Attempting to go to another website is unsuccessful, Firefox simply stops responding to commands and will not connect to another website.

Firefox will then not shut down and Force Quit must be used.

When Firefox restarts, it operates as normal, but once again, if it is being used for more than ten minutes, the same problem reoccurs in the same way.

The duration from start up to issue varies, but 10 minutes (an extended period) is a good estimate. 



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
To reproduce, browse many websites very quickly, sometimes clicking on new links, before previous pages have finished loading. Pretend you have ADD, that should do the trick. Or manically check multiple Presidential polling websites every few seconds.
Actual Results:  
Becomes unresponsive and must be restarted.

Expected Results:  
Browse websites and allow searches.

It's a 24 inch iMac, 2 gig of memory. Should breeze through this.
