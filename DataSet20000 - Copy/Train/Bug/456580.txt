I was in my yahoo account when firefox3 browser was being used.  I was sending a job resume to a perspective employer and when I went into my sent folder to review it, it showed my resume attached and about 6 (six) .jpg files (that I did not attach).  When I viewed those .jpg files they appeared like firefox pics from the turorial or something.   So, I closed the firefox3 browser, and open up IE browser and apologized to the employer and resent the resume the same as I had done with firefox browser.  This time only my resume was sent and no additional .jpg files.  

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Haven't tried to reproduce it with firefox browser since I was sending it to an potential employer, but did resent with IE browser and it sent correctly and did not do the same thing as firefox browser.
2.
3.



Pretty self explanatory.  When attaching a document, it should only attach what you select and not randomly select other things.  I think this is very serious because you can't randomly be sending attachments to people that you don't know about.  Could be a major privacy issue as well.
