This Report is NOT a "Philosophical Discussion".

This Report of an incorrect URL (or this Report is "INVALID").


Page http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/about/whatismozilla.html says "encouraging choice" but the 'Bug Reporter Webpage' derides[1] the (possibly new user) Reporter to upgrade to "Nightly". 

[1] Deride[2]: http://www.thefreedictionary.com/deride
"to speak of or treat with contempt, mockery, or ridicule; scoff or jeer at"
"to laugh at; to mock." or 
"causing or deserving scorn".
[2] Mock: "To frustrate the hopes of; disappoint."


We have 3919 "Normal" Bugs, along with 21 "Blocker" and 463 "Critical" assigned in the last TEN days (if my report generating skills are correct):

Page https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi uses \"<font color="red">\" says
"Also, please do not file bugs on browser/email software older than two weeks - first, download a newer build of Firefox[3].

Why MUST _everyone_ upgrade to "Nightly", how is that correct.


A "Release" version is a better choice for all of us.

It is a better choice for the Reporter (if they are a new user) since "Nightly" has a lot of assigned Bugs reported and thus they may experience some issues with their Browser.

It is a better choice for _us_ since the User will get a better experience and we will get Bug Reports on "Release Versions" instead of being flooded with Dupes.

Nightly should be suggested for the sophisticated User, but a Release version should be what is recommended as a general Rule.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the URL.

Actual Results:  
It is a matter of opinion.


Expected Results:  
A "positive experience" (when using "Mozilla Products") for the "End User".

We can "move the line" on "Report Quality" and "Reporting Frequency" by not (very strongly) recommending "Nightly".
