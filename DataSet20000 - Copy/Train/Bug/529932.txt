In last several days, after several hours of inactivity would not re-activate as normally does but crashes instead. When I clicked on icon to bring ff back up I would get that a version of ff is already running and to close that session to bring another up. I would do that and when the session restore came up I clicked to restore previous session but I got a window that was built just after installing 3.5 but had disappeared during a previous crash and returns intermittently (usually when the other do NOT come up!). My other windows did not restore even though they were listed in the option. I don't know if they will return after another boot or not; as sometimes I get the ones I was working with and I sometimes get this ONE.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. but sometimes it JUST DOES IT BY ITSELF
2. 
3.
Actual Results:  
I work with what comes up even to the point of re-creating what I had before

Expected Results:  
I don't expect ff to crash, especially just trying to activate it from 'sleeping mode' after non-use for several hours. When trying to bring up after crash not to see that it is still running so that it disables bringing it up from icon and when I select last session restore to bring up those pages/windows and not 1 I built several months ago that had disappeared previously.

I don't use any themes; just the original. I don't know the module. How do you find that out?
