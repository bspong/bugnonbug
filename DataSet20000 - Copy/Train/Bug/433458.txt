FF3 executed javascript functions for no apparent reason

Upon clicking the "add to cart" button on the example page, CheckItemLetter() is invoked.  In the source, there is clearly a </form> on line 121, but upon getting Firefox to save a complete webpage, the tag is stripped from that location in the document.  Additionally, document.getElementsByTagName('form') only returns two elements, indicating that the DOM is broken somehow.  Have fun with this one.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Using FF3, go to specified URL.
2. Click "add to cart" image input.
3. (or, save as complete web page and inspect source for missing tags)
Actual Results:  
"Please enter at least 2 letters".  Joy.

Expected Results:  
The second form submits, without running stuff that the first form has in its onSubmit.

Disclaimer:  I don't do web stuff, and that is not my site (I was trying to buy something :) so the page -could- be at fault, but this is still a strange way for FF to be broken as a result of any such error.
