Firefox 3 caused blue screen and restart upon initial launch after installation. Won't open at all now.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Firefox 3 Download Day

I downloaded the Firefox 3 setup and installed it.  I clicked finish with the box checked to automatially launch Firefox 3.  It hangs for a second then flashes a blue screen basically saying that theres and error and it's restarting.  Upon restart I click to open Firefox 3 and nothing happens. It just hangs there and the "my computer is doing something" light is flashing but nothing ever opens.  While transfering files to an external harddrive, in particular the backup files from my wordpress blog site, the blue screen would happen again and a forced restart.  I tried to restore to an early point on my system and in the middle of that I get the blue screen as well.  I cannot use Firefox 3 or restore it to an earlier version.  I'm stuck on IE right now with my only thoughts looking at formatting and reinstalling windows.
