Bug Notes 20150821.rtf

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:39.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/39.0
Build ID: 20150806001005

Steps to reproduce:

On Monday, 08/21/2015, we deployed Firefox 40.0.0 and 40.0.2 to user pcs.  Users use Firefox and IE Tab 2 plugin to print SSRS reports, export SSRS reports to different file formats (.csv, Excel, pdf, etc.).
Steps to reproduce the issue:
1. Access SSRS report manager by clicking the report manager url shortcut (http://-xxxx-/Reports/Pages/Folder.aspx)
2. Open an SSRS report.
3.  Export the SSRS report to csv by clicking the "Export Drop Down Menu" button which produced a drop-down listing the export to file options - .csv, Excel, pdf, etc.
4.  In this case, I selected "CSV - comma deliminted"

 


Actual results:

Export to CSV result is a new tab opens that hangs for a while until eventually an "Warning: unresponsive script" message box appears with the following message: "A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding.  You can stop the script now, open the script in the debugger, or let the script continue.
Script: chrome://ietab2/content/ietabUtils.js:97".  Next, I click "Continue" which shortly results in the tab crashing with the message "The IE Tab Plugin has crashed." 


Expected results:

Export to CSV expected result is a File Download message box appearing prompting users to open or save the exported file (report).
