Hey guys,

I'm not 100% if my problem is the same as that top known problem bug reported on above... but it looked pretty close to mine.

Basically, I came on my computer after closing all windows and such 6 or so hours ago, and suddenly all my bookmarks... everything I previously imported from IE after a reformat and all saved since, every bit of search history, every bit of cookies or saved sites in the search bar or web search bar for all recently viewed sites - inexplicably gone out of the blue. It's a huge loss of... everything, but I'm not as steamed with it as I probably could be.

I'm not sure if it was due to the latest firefox update, which maybe installed when I closed all windows last time, or some unknown spyware or such there... but I wanted to make sure I reported it here incase anyone else has had this happen, and in hopes it doesn't have to happen to anyone else again. I'm pretty sure none of my lost data can be recovered in anyway, but would be more than willing to hear options available, if any, to recover that.

If anyone's willing to help or have any words of wisdom her - thank in advance, if not - no hard feelings. I honestly don't think there's a miracle cure for this one.

Take care guys,
Jay
