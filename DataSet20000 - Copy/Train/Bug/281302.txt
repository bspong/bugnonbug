if firefox.exe is already running, browser window grabs focus when installer detects it
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b) Gecko/20050206 Firefox/1.0+

When I am upgrading nightly builds I sometimes forget to close the download
manager, or sometimes the process just fails to die properly after I close it.

When the installer sees that a firefox.exe process is running, it shows a
warning dialog, but it also brings focus to the browser window.  The focus
changing off the installer window is somewhat annoying, but it's even more so
when only extension manager or download manager was opened and it actually opens
a new browser window so it can get focus.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download a Firefox exe installer
2. Close the browser window, but leave download manager opened
3. Begin the install process

Actual Results:  
When the installer checks to make sure no Firefox process it running, a new
browser window will open and take system focus away from the installer.  The
installer gets an application modal warning dialogue.

Expected Results:  
The installer should retain focus.
