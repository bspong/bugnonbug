Deleted Bookmarks are not sent to the Recycle Bin, so accidental deletions are unrecoverable.

I created a new folder in bookmarks, then found I'd duplicated one in the next Bookmark.  Deleted the new (I thought) and the entire next Bookmark, full of URLs, was deleted.  Perhaps I didn't have the "new"/empty Bookmark folder highlighted - that is not the point.
. . . Internet Explorer 6 sends deleted bookmarks to the Recycle Bin.  Firefox should, too.
. . . Things sent to the Recycle Bin can be recovered.  As is, Firefox does not provide a means of recovering an accidentally deleted Bookmark.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click Bookmarks, click Organize Bookmarks
2.Click New Folder icon, name it _New Folder, description: Test for bug report
3.Right click the new folder, click Delete
4.Open Recycle Bin - it is empty (if it was empty before test)
Actual Results:  
The deleted Bookmark was not in Recycle Bin and I can find no way to recover a deleted Bookmark.

Expected Results:  
Any Bookmark that is deleted should go to the Recycle Bin for recovery if desired.

None
