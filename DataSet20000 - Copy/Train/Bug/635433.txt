crash (exception in XUL.DLL) trying to "save page as" to local directory
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (OS/2; Warp 4.5; rv:2.0b12pre) Gecko/20110210 Firefox/4.0b12pre
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (OS/2; Warp 4.5; rv:2.0b12pre) Gecko/20110210 Firefox/4.0b12pre

I tried to save the contents of the referenced URL as a file (I changed the name in the dialog box first).  Page saved sucessfully, but Firefox terminated.  *.TRP file left in the Firefox directory.
I have had similar failures on other pages and when trying to "Save Link As".
Same symptoms also previously happened with the 3.x versions of Firefox.
Happens often, but not always.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to page referenced
2. Select File, then Save Page As ...
3. In the dialog box, choose a directory, then enter a different file name than suggested (ok to keep file extension).
4. Click on OK
Actual Results:  
page saved, but Firefox terminates (crashes).
If I restart Firefox, it takes me back to the page I was saving.

Expected Results:  
No Crash

*.trp file says "Exception C0000005 - Access violation"
and "Filename: F:\MOZILLA\FIREFOX4.0B12\XUL.DLL"
Complete file will be attached.
