Very large web pages are truncated without a warning

A very large webpage containing +24000 rows in a single table will fail to 
fully render in FireFox.  The page that caused this is in total 140,000+ lines 
long and most of it is a single table.  The rendering fail about 2/3 of the way 
through.  The rest of the page will simply not be there.  I am unable to give 
you the page that caused this as I am developing a network management tool and 
the report that caused this contains potentially sensitive data and I do not 
have the spare time to modify the report generation tool to not output live 
data at this time.  The page is 4818162 bytes in length and 140626 lines long.  
This is not a memory issue as I watched firefox's memory usage and it did not 
come near to the working set for my machine.  A page about half as long as this 
one did not have the problem/

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Generate large webpage with a single very large table in it.
2.  Load webpage
