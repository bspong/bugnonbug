Website won't load (hangs at Waiting for...) after submitting POST data

Surfing www.extreme-gaming-clan.de only works until I open a new tab, and go to https://pma.funzt-halt.net. After then, sometimes Firefox hangs waiting for a server response. Using other browsers, the page works fine, so I guess it must be a problem with Firefox. When I restart FF, the page loads all right again.

I don't know exactly what is necessary to reproduce the bug, though. Mostly, it occurs when using the clan page and PMA simultaneously. What confuses me is the way FF behaves on Windows... I just had the problem exactly the way I described above, then restarted FF, and went through the same steps without any problems :(

Both the clan page and PMA are hosted at the same server. It's an Apache2, obtained from this package:
Maintainer: Debian Apache Maintainers <debian-apache@lists.debian.org>
Architecture: i386
Version: 2.0.54-5sarge1

PHP is self-compiled (http://85.25.9.79/info.php), but the problem also occured when I used this package:
Package: php5
Version: 5.2.0-0.dotdeb.3
Priority: optional
Section: web
Maintainer: Guillaume Plessis <gui@php.net>

The page's source code is nearly completely validated.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open http://extreme-gaming-clan.de
2. open https://pma.funzt-halt.net in a new tab
3. try to continue surfing the clan page

Actual Results:  
Firefox didn't load the page (Waiting for extreme-gaming-clan.de...) at all, or it took extremely long

Expected Results:  
The page should have loaded as usual :)

I tested on Linux with the latest Noia theme, and on Windows using the default.
