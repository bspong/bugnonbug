Switch CustomizableUI tests from using homebrewed test runner to built-in add_task
Our tests for CustomizableUI were written at a time when writing mochitests for asynchronous stuff resulted in much callback spaghetti.

To resolve this, we wrote our own homebrewed testrunner thing to make writing Promise-y tests easier.

It turns out that bug 872229 landed a few months back which gives us this Promise-y goodness in the form of add_task.

We should axe our homebrew testrunner and use add_task instead.

Instructions:

1) Go inside browser/components/customizableui/test/
2) For each file that starts with browser_, open it up, and find the "gTests" object.
3) Extract the "run" functions for each of the objects in gTests, and put those in add_task functions, like this:

add_task(function name_of_test() {
  // Code from "run" function in here.
});

4) Make sure the test runs by executing it from the root mozilla-central folder:

./mach mochitest-browser browser/components/customizableui/test/browser_test_file_name_here.js

We might have to do a little thinking about clean-up functions, but I think this conversion will be relatively straight forward.
