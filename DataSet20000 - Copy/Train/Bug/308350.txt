When right clicking on an bookmark item (a folder, a bookmark, a separator,
...), a context menu shows up allowing one to manage the given item, or in other
words, the item's properties and its contents. In the case of a bookmark, one
can edit its properties, open it in several ways, etc. However, there is a "Sort
by name" options that applies the sorting procedure to the items at the same
level as the bookmark.

The problem could also be said to affect the  "New Bookmark...", "New Folder..."
and "New Separator" entries. However, since these options affect only locally
(i.e. the bookmark's neighbours), their behaviour can be considered acceptable.
Howerver, sorting occurs globaly (at the bookmark's branch level), which is much
more disturbing, even more so given bugs such as the debatable sorting procedure
used at this time (which deletes separators, as per bug 262329) or the problems
when trying to undo (see for example bug 248912 applied to Firefox, or bug 275250).

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:

Expected Results:  
The context menu that shows up should not have a "Sort By Name" entry, or should
have it disabled.
