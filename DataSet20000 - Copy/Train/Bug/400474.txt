Performing a Bookmarks Menu 'Sort by Name' in Firefox 3.0a9pre currently sorts everything alphabetically, intermixing bookmark items and folders. This is a change from the way it was previously.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:

Folders are sorted alphabetically and grouped above sorted individual bookmarks.

Was there a reason for this change?
If it wasn't intended (and I hope not), was it possibly broken here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=325342 ??

I came across a similar bug, Bug 379560 https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=379560 filed in May, but that filed on 2.0.0.3, which I don't believe was really affected. In fact, it was  marked a duplicate of Bug 288260, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=288260 which refers to sorting in the Bookmarks Manager view.
