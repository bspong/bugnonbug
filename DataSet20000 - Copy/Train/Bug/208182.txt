(If the homepage field is set to open all bookmarks in a folder) Under
TOOLS>OPTIONS>HOMEPAGE ... the datafield for the URL does not update when the
contents of the said folder under have been updated.  The result is having to
manually change that field everytime one makes changes to the contents of the
corresponding folder.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Create folder in BookmarksTab
2) Populate with bookmarks of some websites you wish to have opened when
starting browser
3) ToolsTab>OptionsTab> Set that folder as the homepage
4) Restart Browser
5) BookmarksTab> Edit the folder's bookmarks (delete some)
6) Restart Browser
7) The changes have not been made, but inspecting the folder shows the deleted
bookmarks have been removed, however, under ToolsTab>OptionsTab, the homepage
data is unchanged.

Actual Results:  
There are no changes to which tabs open at browser-launch

Expected Results:  
Should have made the connection that this folder was set to be the homepage upon
browser launch and that any changes to the contents of the folder should
automatically be carried over to the homepage-field(Tools>Options>Homepage)
