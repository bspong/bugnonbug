Write a browser-chrome test suite for the various "Save As" functions in Toolkit's "contentAreaUtils.js"

The various "Save As" commands, available from the browser's context menus
and other places, use some JavaScript functions that are defined in the
"contentAreaUtils.js" file. For Firefox, the file is located under the
"toolkit" folder.

These functions need a test suite that exercises all the various save
scenarios. Such suite would ideally test all the possible code paths,
checking things such as the name used by default for the target file,
the available save types (complete, HTML only, ...) based on the MIME
types of the content, possible error conditions with the save operation,
and so on.

Reproducible: Always




SeaMonkey uses a separate "contentAreaUtils.js" file, located under the "suite" folder. To be useful for SeaMonkey development too, the test cases should be
written in a way that differentiates between the expected behavior for the two
products, if different.

Ideally, the common functions should be moved to a shared place where they can
be tested in the same way for both products. This is covered by bug 484616.
