every time I print, the print settings get reverted to the most ink-costly settings (full color, high quality).  I would like to *save* my print settings as to not have to manually set them to the Save Ink settings *each and every time*.

even Microsoft Word lets me save the print settings.  I know HP and other manufacturers of cheap inkjets with expensive ink have paid you a lot of money to default to "ink waster" preferences each time, but please, do the *right* thing, and allow thrifty folks to *preserve* their preferences, so they don't have to go in and edit the settings each time they print, or otherwise burn a great quantity of ink.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. hit print
2. change settings to something that uses less ink
3. print
4. hit print again on a different page
5. ink settings are reverted to "massive fountain of ink everywhere, costing $26 a page"; congratulations!
Actual Results:  
if I'm not careful, a new ink cartridge is the actual result!

Expected Results:  
save my ink preferences each time so that I don't have to manually set "save ink" each and every and each and every and each and every time by hand.

how much more additional information do you need??  tell the ink manufacturers where they can stick their scam!
