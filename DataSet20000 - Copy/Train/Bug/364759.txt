TikiWiki sessions time out before they're supposed to (cookies enabled and present even after logout)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.8) Gecko/20061115 Ubuntu/dapper-security Firefox/1.5.0.8

When I browse a TikiWiki site, I get logged out before I should.  The site has a "remember me" function, and I have the duration set for "1 week"...but I get automatically logged out much sooner than that if I'm idle (after 30 minutes, sometimes).  It only seems to happen when I'm idle (ie, I won't just be browsing away and *pow* I'm logged out).

Normally I would suspect the web application to be at fault in this sort of situation, but when I browse the same site with KDE's Konqueror, I always stay logged in...regardless of idleness.

The cookies in both browsers are the same (except for the contents of the PHPSESSID cookie, of course).  All the cookies are still present in Firefox's "cookie jar" after the logout occurs.  The PHPSESSID cookie is a session cookie.

I'm not sure what other information would be helpful here, but feel free to update this bug and I'll run through whatever test cases are necessary (I have my own local TikiWiki installation, so I can control the browser, application, web server, and OS for testing purposes.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in to a TikiWiki site ( http://www.tikiwiki.org/ )
2. Let the session sit idle for some time
3. Observe that you get logged out

Actual Results:  
The site behaves as if your session has timed out, but it shouldn't.

Expected Results:  
I should have stayed logged in to the application.
