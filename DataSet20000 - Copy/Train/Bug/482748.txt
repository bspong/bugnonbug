application/x-www-form-urlencoded content type is encoded improperly.

Due to rfc1738 "Uniform Resource Locators (URL)" paragraph 2.2 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt):

"octets may be encoded by a character triplet consisting of the character "%" followed by the two hexadecimal digits (from "0123456789ABCDEF") which forming the hexadecimal value of the octet. (The characters "abcdef" may also be used in hexadecimal encodings.)"

Firefox brakes this rule by omitting character "0" previous to symbol from "123456789ABCDEF". Here is an example of urlencoded content produces by Firefox:

limit=6&content=%CF%F0%E8%E2%E5%F2+%EA%E0%EA+%E4%E5%EB%E0.+%CC%ED%E5+%ED%E5%EE%E1%F5%EE%E4%E8%EC+%E4%EE%EA%F3%EC%E5%ED%F2+%F3%F0%EE%E2%ED%FF+%C4%D1%CF.+%CF%EE%EC%EE%E6%E5%F8%FC%3F%3Cbr%3E%A%3Cbr%3E%A&rand=957140

Mind %A which occurs twice.
