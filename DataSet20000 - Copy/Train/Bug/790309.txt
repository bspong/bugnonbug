console.trace output should be prettier
console.trace() currently puts something like this in the console:

[12:20:24.890] http://localhost:8088/files.js :: File :: 299

Interestingly if you copy this line you get additional trace information, such as:
  ...
  http://localhost:8088/files.js :: null :: 180
  http://localhost:8088/files.js :: null :: 139

It's also clickable, which gives:

> 0: Object
  filename: "http://localhost:8088/files.js"
  functionName: "File"
  language: 2
  lineNumber: 299
> 1: Object
  filename: "http://localhost:8088/files.js"
  functionName: null
  language: 2
  lineNumber: 180
> 2: Object
  filename: "http://localhost:8088/files.js"
  functionName: null
  language: 2
  lineNumber: 139


Also you must expand each item (0, 1, 2) to see the detail.

This should be better.  I think everything could be displayed in the console itself, without the need for an inspector.  Locations could be clickable.  The function name ("File" or "null") is not explained: I'd recommend "File()" or "unknown function".  Also it's not clear which is the inner frame and which is the outer.

Perhaps some affordances should be made for large stack traces, but I'm not sure – async code tends to keep the traces small, so it might not be an issue.
