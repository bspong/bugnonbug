if a form field has exactly 1 remembered entry, and firefox automatically pops
up the history list, then the opened menu won't go away even after clicking on
the browser

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to the above address, click "enter geckomail now"
2. try to type something in loginid and login, let firefox remember (make sure
you only have 1 entry remembered. and you dont need a valid account)
3. go back to the first address
4. right after you click "enter geckomail now" and before it loads to the second
page, click on a top level menu or right click for context menu
5. after the page is loaded, the id field's history automatically pops up. if
you right clicked, the context menu will move up. neither the popped up top
level menu/context menu will disappear normally
Actual Results:  
the menu stays open

Expected Results:  
the menu should be closed normally by clicking somewhere in the browser

if it's top menu, clicking/moving to other top/sub menus will fix it.
if it's context menu, you will have to right click to get the same context menu
to fix it.

and the funny thing is, you can click back after the last step to try other
context menus and you will end up having 5-6 menus showed up at the same time
