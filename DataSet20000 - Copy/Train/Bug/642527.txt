Toolbars stay in inconsistent state after using customise toolbars dialog and "Customise..." option in toolbar context menu becomes disabled. Navigation toolbar becomes blank after clicking "Tabs on Top" option in toolbar context menu. In addition toolbars cannot be enabled or disabled by clicking respective options in context menu and menu bar items are disabled (greyed).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open customise dialog from toolbars context menu
2. Make changes to toolbars (also reproducible without making changes)
3. Close dialog by clicking "Done"
4. Flexible separators are still visible, menu bar and Customise option is disabled
5. Navigation toolbar and Web developer toolbar become blank after clicking "Tabs on Top" option in context menu. Google toolbar missing some buttons and search field.
Actual Results:  
Interface is in inconsistent state and some toolbars are blank. Customise option is disabled.

Expected Results:  
All toolbars should stay as customised and no customisation chrome should be visible.

Toolbars are blank even after restarting Firefox or opening new window. Only way one can fix this is by opening new window or restarting Firefox and clicking "Restore Default Set" button in customise dialog.

I was able to reproduce this behaviour twice on two different Firefox installations, but not in new profile.
