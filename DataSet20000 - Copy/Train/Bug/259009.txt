personal toolbar default icon size setting messed up when icon size is changed in the customize toolbar menu

When Firefox is started, the the personal toolbar ALWAYS has a default iconsize
of small.  However, if you go into the customize toolbar menu and change the
iconsize to small, and then back to normal (or what have you, as long as the
iconsize ends up being set back to the normal size) the personal toolbar's
iconsize will be set to the iconsize of all the other toolbars.  It seems to me
that either the personal toolbar should not be defaultly set this way, or that
its iconsize value should never be modified.  Or even that all toolbar's
iconsizes should be independently modifiable (though this doesn't really seem
necessary).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.open firefox
2.open customize toolbar menu
3.click small icon checkbox on then off again.

Actual Results:  
icons added to the personal toolbar folder will be normal size and not small

Expected Results:  
personal toolbar folder should always have small icons.
