Clicked links not colored as visited, or visited color forgotten after hard refresh

1. New profile, start firefox
2. Visit http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showbuilds.cgi?tree=
3. In the 'guilty' column, left click on a name. A translucent popup appears
4. Left click on some white-space in the main page to dismiss the popup. Note the name you clicked on has changed colour to indicate it has been visited
5. Press CTRL+R

Expected:
 - Page reloads from web server, but the name you clicked remains coloured as per a visited link

Actual:
 - Page reloads but the name you clicked is not coloured to indicate you've clicked it previously.

(I also see a similar problem on http://hourly-archive.localgho.st/ when right-clicking on one of the .zip files and choosing Save As. Most of the time the file starts downloading, but the link isn't coloured appropriately.)
