Youtube videos stutter strongly and cause occasional system freezes

Steps to reproduce:

This has been happening whenever I go to Youtube. I haven't used many other Flash video players, but I believe it's happened to them too. Furthermore, and most cryptically, I've been getting this problem on Youtube's HTML5 videos as well, though the latter format has not, to date and to the best of my knowledge, caused my system to freeze.


Actual results:

When playing a video, I will frequently experience a sort of stuttering in which the video freezes but the audio plays just fine. This normally lasts for at most a second or two but happens constantly.

However, on occasion, generally when the video has just started, freeze not only the video, but the controls as well. The audio keeps playing normally, but at this point my system becomes unresponsive as follows: Initially just the video is frozen, but Firefox quickly hangs. After this I am still able to interact with the taskbar for at most half a minute; by interact, I mean I can highlight the buttons for different windows/programs, and right-clicking gives me the context menu as normal, though telling Firefox to close this way accomplishes nothing. Eventually the taskbar freezes as well, leaving me with only the ability to move my mouse, but shortly after the taskbar freezes so does my mouse cursor. At this point I have to force a hard shutdown on my system.


Expected results:

I first noticed this issue this past December; before that, videos on Youtube and elsewhere always played normally.

I suspect this bug and bug 697739 are strongly related if not identical, since the one time I managed to open Task Manager to see what was eating my CPU it turned out to be plugin-container.EXE, and forcing the process to end immediately gave me a watchdog.sys BSOD.
