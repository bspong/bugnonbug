Disabling Java (security.enable_java) has no effect

By browsing the url www.revolvermaps.com, the Java Applet will still be loaded with the following settings defined in about:config
- javascript.enabled = false
- security.enable_java = false

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open about:config, set
   - javascript.enabled = false
   - security.enable_java = false
2. Browse http://www.revolvermaps.com
Actual Results:  
The Java applet with the revolving earth is being started.

Expected Results:  
No Java applet should be allowed to be running, as it has been forbidden by the security.enable_java preference.

Code looks like:
<noscript><applet codebase="http://ra.revolvermaps.com/j"code="core.RE"archive="r.jar">...</applet></noscript>
This is the very reason I had to disable JavaScript to see this bug appearing.

Enclosing an applet in a <noscript> tag could be a potential security issue as anyone could force Java applet execution, even if disabled.

BTW it would be nice to add an option to configure the "Java enabled" settings from within the GUI (Firefox>Preferences>Content) as there is none so far (only about:config let us configure it)
