https proxy and http proxy MUST use different ports

I always use a manual proxy configuration with one proxy running at port 81. I also specify "Use above proxy for all protocols". This works with all my browsers (IE, FireFox2, Seamonkey, Lynx). It does not work with FireFox 3. I did a fresh install of FireFox 3. I updated my Squid Proxy to version 3.0-STABLE6. Nothing helped. I finally changed the manual proxy configuration such that port 82 is used for SSL-connections (and of course I changed my squid-configuration such that squid is listening on port 81 and 82). Now it works!!

By the way: I had to change the manual proxy-configuration via about:config since the regular dialog is broken - but this is a different story.

I'm using FireFox 3 for a couple of weeks now. I'm almost sure that using port 81 for http- and https-proxying worked in the beginning. I have no idea what changed - maybe 3.0 - 3.0.1 update.

Since I was really desperate I even used tcpdump to check what's going on. When FireFox 3 uses port 81 it sends out a CONNECT-request, my squid proxy connects the webserver, answers back to FireFox with a 200 reply and then somewhere in the middle of the SSL-handshake FireFox 3 does not answer anymore.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select manual proxy configuration with one host, port 81
2. Share proxy configuration for all protocolls
3. Load any https-page
4. disable sharing of proxy configuration for all protocolls via about:config
5. change SSL proxy-port from 81 to 82 (and of course change proxy-configuration)
6. Now loading of https-pages work
Actual Results:  
Using same port for http- and https-proxying does not work

Expected Results:  
Using same port for http- and https-proxying should be possible.
