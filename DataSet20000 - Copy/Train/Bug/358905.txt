Entire browser lags, when several tabs are being loaded/rendered at the same time

When you load several tabs in a short time (a good example is opening 15-20 links of recent changes in a wiki using mouse gestures which open each link in a new tab), the browser first waits for server to response and then it stops responding, when the large amount of data starts arriving simultaneously. It keeps lagging until most of the tabs are fully loaded.

I guess it is because all the tabs are handled in the single processing thread, affecting all the other tabs and windows, even those, that are already fully loaded and rendered. This prevents the user to scroll and read the already loaded text, because there are things loading somewhere in the background.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use mouse gestures to open links in tabs or use bookmarks and click "open all in tabs", when there are 15-20 links to recent changes of wikipedia.org.
2. Wait until the server starts sending data.
3. Try to scroll in the already loaded tabs, while the other tabs are still being loaded. You may need a good connection speed in order to allow the amount of data to arrive.
Actual Results:  
The entire browser stops responding for a while or lags a lot, preventing the user to scroll the text or switch to other tabs/windows. Depends on how many tabs were opened and how long are the pages being loaded.

Expected Results:  
Other windows and tabs should remain unaffected, especially those, that were loaded a long time ago.

No other extensions add-ons were used than mouse gestures.

I suggest, that each tab should load and render in a separate thread. This would prevent the lagging of the entire browser, when one tab stops responding for any possible reason.
