Recently..within the last few weeks Firefox has been just closing suddenly, when viewing a page email etc or playing a game in the browser including java based games but not exclusively that, suddenly the browser will just close ..disappear with no warning etc. Restored the session and it does it again...made new session with same results ..restarted computer and all was fine for about 30 minutes then it closed suddenly once again ..well you get the picture its a domino effect.This happened on more than 1 computer so i knew it wasnt just mine that was doing it.
