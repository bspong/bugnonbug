I did a restart and now it is saying security warning for all your site
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; MDDC; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E; rv:11.0) like Gecko

Steps to reproduce:

Restarted Firefox because my video player was not working, and I was thinking that maybe some how, I might have changed some thing, so I was just going to go back to the default of Firefox


Actual results:

I keep getting this 

This Connection is Untrusted

You have asked Firefox to connect securely to bugzilla.mozilla.org, but we can't confirm that your connection is secure.

Normally, when you try to connect securely, sites will present trusted identification to prove that you are going to the right place. However, this site's identity can't be verified.
What Should I Do?

If you usually connect to this site without problems, this error could mean that someone is trying to impersonate the site, and you shouldn't continue.

bugzilla.mozilla.org uses an invalid security certificate. The certificate is not trusted because no issuer chain was provided. (Error code: sec_error_unknown_issuer)


Expected results:

it should have let me add the security certificate, but it will not let me it is just get out of here there is no way to add it from the page like I would do befor...
