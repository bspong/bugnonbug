In FF 2.0 there was a visual hint when a new tab was opened in the background - a flash on the 'right arrow' on the list of tabs. This was very helpful in showing that indeed a new tab was opened even if there were so many tabs already open that the tab itself wasn't visible. Yet this is missing in FF 3.0.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open enough tabs so that the list of tabs is full.
2. Using middleclick, open a new tab in the background.
Actual Results:  
There is no visual hint that in fact a new tab was opened.

You may have missed and middleclicked only close to the link, and you wouldn't know it.

Expected Results:  
A visual hint of some sort that a new tab was opened. For example like FF 2.0 does, it 'blinks' the right arrow on the list of tabs darker for a second.

My theory: Perhaps something to do with the change to using native GTK+ widgets?

If so, and if the FF 2.0 hinting is not feasible using GTK, then any other type of visual hint would be welcome. It doesn't matter what, so long as the user has an idea that his/her click was indeed registered.
