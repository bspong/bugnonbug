Firefox instance crashes if I click links to certain webpages, which have become inaccessible as a result.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

In Mozilla Firefox, when I click on the download link on
http://www.redhat.com/fedora/, the Firefox window crashes though other windows
keep working. A similar problem is encountered when I try to access sent mails
in my gmail account. A system reboot solves the problem, but it returns after a
while. I first thought these are website specific problems, but they are not
encountered in Internet Explorer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.redhat.com/fedora/
2. Click on the link 'download'.
3. (If Firefox crashes) Go back to step 1.
   (If Firefox doesn't crash) Close Firefox and restart. Repeat steps 1 and 2. 
  In case problem does not arise, reboot system and repeat steaps 1 and 2.
Actual Results:  
The window where I tried to open up the Fedora webpage closed. Other Firefox
windows continued to work though.

Expected Results:  
Should have taken me to the Fedora download page (and not crashed).

No visible error message displayed.
