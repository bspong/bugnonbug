Unusual Memory Demand when Browser is open for extended time

I use firefox on a daily basis and recently noticed with the v2.0.0.3 that the amount of memory used increases abnormally.  This happens on both of my computers and is noticable after firefox has been running for over an hour.  I use multiple tabs during browsing of which some of them I login to secure websites.  After about an hour or so, the browser starts slowing down in every aspect, such as open new tab, load page, etc.  I open the task manager to see that firefox is using well over 300 MB of ram.  Screenshot available upon request.  This happens under normal browsing usage and I am unable to determine why the amount of memory increases like so.  When I terminate the browser, it takes about 15 seconds for firefox.exe to be removed from task manager, unless I force it.  When I restart the browser, the memory usage is back to normal but again after extended use, the memory usage jumps way up again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Browser random sites for an hour with multiple tabs and without closing the browser completely.
3. Open task manager to see its current memory usage.
Actual Results:  
Memory usage jumped to over 300 MB of RAM.  Browser performance dramatically decreases.  The only remedy so far is to terminate the browser, wait until it is cleared from task manager and reopen.

Expected Results:  
Not demand so much memory and slow down dramatically.

After searching current bugs, the only thing close to this report is other reports of memory leaks, but in unrelated matters.  I was unable to match this report with any known issues.  The browser does not crash, but it slows down to the point where it almost freezes, but is barely responsive.
