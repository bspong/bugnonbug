Work blocks video feeds, this causes Firefox to hang apparently indefinitely
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Whenever I go to site that is on our firm's black list (or more likely link to a separate site that has video which is streamed from one of those sites), Firefox just hangs.  I have waited as long as 10 minutes with no result.  If I have multiple tabs open, none of them work.  


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Block the video feeds that are returned from foxnews.com (perhaps with a proxy)
2.  Attempt to use anything whatsoever in the browser
3.  Give up
Actual Results:  
After clicking once or twice anywhere in the main window, the titlebar changes to (Not Responding).  My only recourse is to exit Firefox and restart.  Sometimes the session is restored, sometimes not.

Expected Results:  
I am reporting this as a bug as, in my opinion, the failure (or latency) in loading a video portion of a page should, at most, stop that page from loading.  It certainly should not make the entire browser unusable.


This happens most frequently visiting content-intensive sites such as foxnews.com.

I believe foxnews.com will work fine for you.  We have filtering that prevents our viewing video feeds from some sites but not others.
