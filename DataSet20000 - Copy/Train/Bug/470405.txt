Heavy GWT site locks up browser, prevents new HTTP requests, but tab JS content still functions

When playing poker at GPokr, after a shortwile (5 to 15 mins), the browser suddenly stops being able to retrieve new content (could be just GETs and not POSTs because GPokr still works.) From there, all user icon images no longer load, and are replaced with the broken image link icon. Also, if you open a new tab and request a new page, the request will never trigger, leaving the page as "(untitled)". Repeated attempts are not successful. The browser will no longer respond to a Quit, and must for Force Quit-ed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.gpokr.com
2. Play poker for a 5 to 15 mins (change tables a few times as well)
3. Wait for new user icon images to no longer load.
4. Open a new tab and request a page. 
Actual Results:  
No new requests will go out. The browser wrapper will no longer respond. The inner tab content will continue to function somewhat normally (non loading images not withstanding.)

Expected Results:  
I should be able to open new tabs and see user icon images.

I have tried with Greasemonkey and Firbug both enabled and disabled. Other addons I should have tested without but did not is AdBlock Plus.
