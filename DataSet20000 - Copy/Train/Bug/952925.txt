No quit warning or multiple tab quit warning in Private Browsing Mode, even with about:config options set True
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20131205075310

Steps to reproduce:

1) Enable Private Browsing Mode (Preferences/Privacy/AlwaysUsePrivateBrowsingMode)

2) Enable "Warn me when closing multiple tabs" (Preferences/Tabs)

2) In about:config set the following as True:
---) browser.warnOnQuit 
---) browser.showQuitWarning
---) browser.warnOnRestart
---) browser.tabs.warnOnClose
---) browser.tabs.warnOnCloseOtherTabs

3) Open multiple tabs.

4) Hit Command+Q (Quit Firefox)



Actual results:

Firefox closed without any warning at all.



Expected results:

Firefox should have provided at least one (or both) of the following warnings:

1) A warning that Firefox is closing, asking the user to confirm.
OR...
2) A warning that multiple tabs are being closed, asking the user to confirm.

Additional testing:
Retested using same steps, but with Private Browsing Mode *disabled*. When quitting, Firefox asks user to confirm intention to quit, as expected. Upon re-enabling Private Browsing Mode, incorrect behavior returns. Thus, problem seems to occur only with Private Browsing Mode.
