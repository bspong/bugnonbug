Browser code incorrectly looking for browser-only modules in gre location
Created attachment 411523
patch - v1 (trunk/1.9.2)

A member of the Ubuntu Mozilla Team noticed that his sessions were no longer being restored, and he noticed the following error in his Error Console:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80520012 (NS_ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND) [nsIXPCComponents_Utils.import]"  nsresult: "0x80520012 (NS_ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/browser.js :: delayedStartup :: line 3590"  data: no]

browser.js line 3590 is:
  Cu.import("resource://gre/modules/NetworkPrioritizer.jsm", NP);

When he went to resource://gre/modules/NetworkPrioritizer.jsm, he got file not found. However, the file was under /usr/lib/firefox-3.7a1pre/modules/ along with distribution.js and openLocationLastURL.jsm.

Mook pointed out that such import code should probably be using resource://app/ instead of resource://gre/. Indeed, resource://app/modules/NetworkPrioritizer.jsm works just fine.

This patch modifies the file paths for all calls to distribution.js, NetworkPrioritizer.jsm, and openLocationLastURL.jsm.

Requesting blocking, as this currently makes session restore (at least) completley broken.
