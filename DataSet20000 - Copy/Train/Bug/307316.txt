Downloaded the linux installer for Deer Park 2 Sep 02 build and Sep 04 build.
I installed it to Ubuntu Linux and created a desktop shortcut pointing to
/usr/local/firefox/firefox.  Clicking on the icon, Deer Park briefly flashes
onto the screen and then closes.  This occures regardless of using Gnome or KDE.
 This occured regardless of the install directory- have also tried installing to
/home.  This occures both with and without the default installation of Firefox
that comes with Ubuntu.  I am able to launch Deer Park 2 from the desktop icon
if it is run as root.  Also using sudo /usr/local/firefox/firefox from a
terminal window it will launch.  NO themes or extensions installed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Deer Park 2 on Ubuntu Linux
2.Create a desktop icon application link pointing to /usr/local/firefox/firefox
3.Click on icon

Actual Results:  
Deer Park briefly (less than 1 second) flashes onto screen then closes.

Expected Results:  
Browser window should stay open
