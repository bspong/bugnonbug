Restoring tabs from history overwrites tabs already open
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When attempting to reopen tabs lost to a close of Mozilla (where the "You are about to close X tabs" did not appear) via the History menu, I opened several tabs that I wanted individually.

Then, I attempted to select multiple History entries with Ctrl+click and selected "Open all in tabs" from the right-click drop down menu. This opened all the tabs I had selected, but actually navigated to the selected URLs on the tabs I already had open.

The Back button on the overwritten tab shows the page that was navigated away from and I can get back to that using the middle-click function, but surely it would be better to "Open all in NEW tabs" when using the History menu.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open new session of Mozilla
2. Open tabs individually from the History menu
3. Select multiple tabs from the History menu and select "Open all in tabs"
Actual Results:  
Selected multiple tabs all opened, but navigated away from the URLs of the individually opened tabs before opening any new tabs.

Expected Results:  
Opened all the multiple selected tabs in new tabs, not altering the tabs already open.
