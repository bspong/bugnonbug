The list of disabled commands in detached chat windows isn't correct

Patch

Since bug 898161, I noticed a 'document.getElementById(...) is null' error in chatWindow.xul when I detach a SocialAPI chat window on Windows or Linux.

The cause is a few elements that don't exist in the DOM because they were included as part of browser-menubar.inc: 'viewToolbarsMenu', 'viewSidebarMenuMenu', 'viewFullZoomMenu', 'pageStyleMenu', 'charsetMenu'.


I took the opportunity of patching this list of disabled elements to review the whole list of enabled keyboard shortcuts in detached chat windows, and found some commands that I think we should disable:

These 2 commands open dialogs that don't seem appropriate above the chat window:
Browser:OpenFile, Tools:Sanitize (accel,shift,VK_DELETE)

These 2 are broken because window.content is undefined in chat windows.
View:PageSource
View:PageInfo
I think they make sense to keep enabled, so I defined a 'content' getter to make them work (this seemed easier than getting the 'content' property we get from C++ to return the right value -- that would likely involve implementing nsIBrowserDOMWindow).


These commands are broken because they expect gBrowser:
Tools:DevToolbox
key_selectTab{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,LastTab}
cmd_findPrevious (ctrl+shift+g or Shift+f3)
cmd_fullZoomReduce, cmd_fullZoomEnlarge, cmd_fullZoomReset

Irrelevant for our case (and broken: 'sidebar is null' error) :
viewBookmarksSidebar (accel+b)

These 2 commands work fine on Mac (because we have the menu bar), and are broken elsewhere:
Browser:OpenLocation
Tools:Search


Note: I tested this on Linux and Mac, but haven't tested on Windows yet (I expect the behavior there to be identical to Linux).
