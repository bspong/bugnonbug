When selecting text in particular text fields (see *) with shift+cursor, selection will disappear when the shift key is released. Similarly, when selecting with shift+ctrl+cursor, selection will disappear when the ctrl key is released.

Happens when editing text fields at http://www.trademe.co.nz (requires account) with Firefox 3.0. Does not happen using IE5.0.

(*) trademe.co.nz alerts user if the character count in this particular text field exeeds 2048. I suspect this code is associated with the problem:

</table></td><td><textarea class="verdana" name="body" cols="40" rows="15" onkeyup="return ValidateTextArea(this,2048,null, event)" >

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to trademe.co.nz, click on "list an item"
2. Type the description. Select some typed text by holding shift then any cursor key.
3. Release cursor key, then release shift key, and one will observe the selection has disappeared.
Actual Results:  
Selection disappears when releasing shift key. Selection should not disappear.

Expected Results:  
I expect the selection should stay there, so I can perform further actions such as ctrl+c to copy, or ctrl+x to cut, or del to delete.

Shift+cursor text selection is at times significantly faster than mouse text selection.
