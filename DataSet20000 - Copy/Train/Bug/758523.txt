Firefox bookmarks corrupted when moving from Ubuntu to Windows
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:12.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/12.0
Build ID: 20120420145725

Steps to reproduce:

Summary: I've been sharing bookmarks between Windows and Linux since at least 2008 using Subversion and more recently Git, synchronizing usually every day. After the latest Firefox updates the bookmarks have become corrupted only on Windows 7.

Exact steps:
1. Logged in to Ubuntu 12.04.
2. Browsed using Firefox 12.
3. Exited Firefox.
4. Ran sqlite3 vacuum <https://github.com/l0b0/tilde/blob/master/scripts/cleanup.sh> to minimize the size of the sqlite files in the top-level profile directory. I always do this before committing the files in Git.
5. cd'ed to the settings directory on the mounted Windows partition.
6. `git checkout .mozilla`, that is, reset the contents of the Windows Firefox settings.
7. `git pull`, that is, retrieved the settings from the Linux repository.
8. Rebooted into Windows
9. Started Firefox 12 on Windows


Actual results:

All the bookmarks have disappeared, but the bookmark folders are all still visible. In the Library window (Ctrl-Shift-B) it just shows three bookmarks with no icon and the title "(no title)". The folders are not shown either.


Expected results:

All the bookmarks should still be visible, as they still are in Ubuntu.
