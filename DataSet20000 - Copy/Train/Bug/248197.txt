I was almost forced to try to locate the file that stores this information, 
though luckily I was able to set it back because I still had a browser window
open. Also I had a copy of mozilla running that didn't have a window (orphaned?). 
You might try setting the cache to 0 just to see the effect, but I'm not going to 
do it again.. 

Also I noticed that sometimes when testing java applets, the cache seems to keep
old class files around.. I was trying out a programming example, and the example
in my tutorial kept loading in, in place of the class I had created.. It took
some experimentation to determine the source of the problem. Its either a
problem with Firefox or Java 1.5, I'm inclined to think that the Java plugin
wouldn't have a cache for previously loaded classes.  The reason I changed my
cache size to zero is I was trying to prevent the caching of the class file so
tat I could see the results of my work on my java code.
