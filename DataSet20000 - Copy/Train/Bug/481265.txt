AFP account unable to complete some javascript calls on certain pages (e.g., at https://www.discovercard.com/)

From a client user account mounted on a remote Os X Server, on certain pages where login access is required, certain javascript calls do not work with Firefox 3.  These worked in Firefox 2 and continue to work in Safari.  They also work in FireFox 3 when logged in using a local admin account (so it is apparently AFP=specific).  An example of this problem is at http://www.discovercard.com/.  When logged into my account, I have noticed that if I want to sign up for their 5% Cashback bonus, if I go to click the 'sign up now' button, it is non-responsive.  I first noticed this behavior when I upgraded to FireFox 3 (it had previously worked fine with Firefox 2 and continues to work fine from Safari; it also works fine with Firefox 3 if I am logged into a local admin account).  I have noticed this same type of behavior a a few other pages where I have to login (e.g., https://access.usbank.com/cpsApp1/index.jsp, the 'save transaction fails'; this does work using Safari).

5.press 'Sign Up Today' button
Actual Results:

Feedback that I have been signed up.

Again, this seems to be a problem that is specific to those who have their user directory (and therefore their FireFox profile) located on a remote AFP server.  I'm not sure if I should classify the severity of this as being 'major' or 'normal' (since I can mange by going into Safari when I need to do this type of function, I'm classifying is 'normal' for now).  This problem extends to sites other than discovercard.com, but this is the site that is probably most generally accessible of those I've had this problem with.
