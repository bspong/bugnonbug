Crash when you are taken to a log-in page

Put any item in your shopping cart (FYI: this is a store for CDs, DVDs, games)
by clicking on any button saying "Köp" ("buy" in swedish).
Now, in the left frame, a button appears saying "Till kassan" ("check out" in
swedish). Clicking on that will take you to a page where you are supposed to log
in with a u/n (username) and a p/w (password). Now though, Firefox freezes
before I get a chance to fill in the details and the only way to shut down
FireFox is from the Task Manager.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the page
2. Put any item in your shopping cart
3. Go to the check-out

Actual Results:  
Firefox freezes

Expected Results:  
Let me log in

- This page works in Mozilla (it was about a months since I tried it last time
using Mozilla, I've uninstalled Mozilla these days to only use Firefox), so this
might be a Firefox-only problem
- The page is available in english as well (go to www.cdon.com)
- The page uses a secure line when you log in (SSL I suppose), perhaps that's
what's causing Firefox the trouble
