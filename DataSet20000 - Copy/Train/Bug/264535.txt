close multiple tabs dialogue doesn't support most common use case

The "confirm close" dialogue box that appears when a user clicks the window
close control directly supports only one of the two most common use cases for
that control. The use cases are: 

1. the user actually wanted to close the window
2. the user meant to close just the front tab

... plus of course the "oops" case. In my personal experience, use case 2 is the
most common (i.e., I make this mistake frequently). However, if I did mean to
close the current tab, the required sequence of steps to accomplish this goal,
after the dialogue box appears, is:

1. select [Cancel] in the dialogue
2. close the front tab using one of the other available mechanisms.

I believe there is a clean interface that can do better; see "expected results"
below.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. In | Tools | Options | Advanced | Browsing |, ensure "Warn when closing
multiple tabs" is selected.
2. Have multiple tabs open in a browser window.
3. Click the window close control.

Actual Results:  
A dialogue like this is displayed:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Confirm Close
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your are about to close two open tabs. Are you sure you want to continue?

[x] Warn me when I attempt to close multiple tabs

[[Close tabs]]  [Cancel]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Expected Results:  
The interface would be cleaner if it allowed the user to close just the front
tab (or even a selection of tabs) from the dialogue box. Here's a possible redesign:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Close window or tabs?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Did you want to close the window, or just some tabs?

[X] favicon and title of front tab
[ ] favicon and title of another tab
...
[ ] favicon and title of last tab

[X] Warn me when I close a window with multiple open tabs.

[Close Window] [Close Selected Tabs] [Cancel]
--------------------------------------------------------------------

With this design, the user can close either the window or just the front tab
with a single click. As a bonus, the user can close a selection of tabs as well,
with just a teensy bit of extra cognitive overhead.
