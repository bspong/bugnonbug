Transparent Flash assumes underlying element's UI when dragged

Steps to reproduce:

Originally reported by one of our users here:  https://github.com/zeroclipboard/zeroclipboard/issues/282

Steps:
1. Enable Flash Player, if not already.
2. Navigate to:  http://rawgithub.com/koganei/ZeroClipboardIssue/master/index.html
3. Click and hold on any of the divs.  (You will actually end up clicking on a transparent Flash object.)
4. Drag that Flash object over the other divs.


Actual results:

The UI of the div that the Flash object was hovering over at the time of your click will sometimes be hijacked by the transparent Flash object, so that it almost looks like the items are being reordered and/or having their text changed as you drag (they're not).

Here's a video clip from our user:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hqq1dprJjE

I was also able to repro this last week on my box as well.


Expected results:

1. I'm no Flash expert but, AFAIK, Flash objects should not be draggable by default, so it's weird that this one appears to be.  I did not expect it to be draggable.
2. The Flash object should definitely NOT have assumed the underlying element's UI when dragged.
