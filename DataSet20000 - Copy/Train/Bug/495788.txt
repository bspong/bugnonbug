While I was looking at the menu of my popular websites folder, I noticed that, moving, slowly, the cursor from the bottom back up to the top, the blue rectangle skips some of the websites (going far up) and then it goes back down to the one I had the cursor on. It doesn't happen on the other way (from the top to the bottom) and I also noticed it doesn't happen all the times.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the Popular folder (which has been transferred from my Safari browser)
2.Moce the cursor of the mouse, without clicking, from the top to the bottom
3.Once you went down (like after 20-25 voices of that menu) move the cursor back up to the bottom, slowly

Actual Results:  
The blue selection (correspondent to the voice of the menu you have the cursor on) skipped some lines of the menu up and then it went back down to the correct one

Expected Results:  
The blue rectangle should follow the movement of the cursor of the mouse
