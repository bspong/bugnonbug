Cookies with JSESSIONID are not set in Firefox 3.6 when JRE 1.6.0_13 is installed.

Our Java application sets cookies (actually Tomcat sets them, we do a request.getSession()) in the form of JSESSIONID. However when using Firefox 3.6 with JRE 1.6.0_13 the cookie is not set.  We get a 401 status code in response from the servlet.

To address this we tried the following without any avail.
 a. accepting third party cookies
 b. clearing all cookies
 c. clearing cache  
 d. editing "about:config" cookie settings.  

Here are some more observations: 

 Cookie is set properly for following:
           1. Firefox 3.5.7 and  JRE 1.6.0_13 combination.

           2. Firefox 3.6 and JRE 1.6.0_14 combination
           
           3. Firefox 3.6 and JRE 1.6.0_18 combination.

Please advise.


Reproducible: Always
