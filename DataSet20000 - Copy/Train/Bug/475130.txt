On earlier release of firefox 3, when I use shift key and clock hyperlink, it open new tab and display content, the previous orginal tab, where I click the hyperlink was unaffected. This is good.

With latest version firefox 3.0.5, when I do the same thing, it alway open new tab with website content as well as overriding the original tab with the same webpage as the new tab. This is annoying as I have to keep using back button. 

The shift+hyperlink is not working correctly, it does not retain the orginal webpage as the previous firefox version. 

This is why I'm reporting this bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.load any webpage with hyperlink
2.press shift
3.it open new tab with new webpage
4.the previous webpage is overridden by new webpage....bug!

5. previous version firefox did not do this.
Actual Results:  
See above

Expected Results:  
The orginal webpage (old tab) should not be overridden.

Firefox 3.0.5, alway keeping version up to date, will upgrade to 3.1 when released ASAP (hoping it is fixed).
