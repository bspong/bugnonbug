Print an email from Earthlink.net account by selecting PRINT and body text of email is garbage. Headers are OK. Printing from Yahoo.com in the same manner is OK.
Printing by selecting FILE/PRINT is also OK, except that I get all the banner ads on the page. When opening the email, the font visibly changes in the body. from what is was just previewing the email. It does not do this in Yahoo.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.log onto Earthlink.net email account
2.open any email with body text
3.click Print
Actual Results:  
headers are printed correctly, the body is garbage.

Expected Results:  
expect print to be what was on the monitor.

IE does not exhibit this problem and is a simple workaround. When opening email in IE the font does not change from the preview. Printing the opened email via PRINT or FILE/PRINT both work. This appears very similar to previously reported bugs but I figured the specific details may help in solving some of them.
