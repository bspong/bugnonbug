When populating the innerHTML of TDs, if a TD with larger vertical content is populated before a TD with smaller vertical content in the same row - using the ele.innerHTML attribute - the vertical height of the row is not updated the second time this operation is preformed. See attached HTML File

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click the button "Click First" - this sets the innerHTML of two of TDs, making the one set first have a greater height than it previously did
2. Click the button "Click for Layout Bug" - this sets the innerHTML of two of TDs, again making the one set first have a greater height than it previously did
Actual Results:  
The second time innerHTML is used the table row height is not adjusted correctly, however the text is still rendered.

Expected Results:  
Table row height should have been recalculated.

If you do something to force an update to the page layout (like expand or collapse FireBug, the table updates, and everything looks fine (I tried this on a version of firefox w/ out FireBug to make sure it wasn't that))
