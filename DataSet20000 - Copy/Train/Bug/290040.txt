JavaScript called within Flash Player gets UUDECODED automatically causing the JavaScript function not to work

Using Flah Player version 7.0.19.0

Whenever I call a JavaScript function using getURL() from a Flash Movie, the
arguments of the JavaScript function gets UUDECODED automatically, breaking the
JavaScript function if special characters (such as '"иат etc.) are present in
the function arguments.






Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a Flash Movie with a getURL("javascript:alert('pippo%27s%20room')");
2. Drag the generated movie in a Firefox window

Actual Results:  
NOTHING!!! The function does not get executed, and nothing is reported in the
JavaScript console


Expected Results:  
An alert window with the text "pippo's room"

I guess the problem is thet the embed uudecodes the javascript function BEFORE
executing it. This causes javascript to work incorrectly because special
characters are placed in the function.

No JavaScript function will work!!! I found a solution endoding the text twice,
so that the first decode does not affect content, but this is tricky...

Many flash websites will malfunction because of this.
