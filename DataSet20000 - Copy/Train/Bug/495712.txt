This has been happening for a week or so.  I click on a link that has an email address, and it is supposed to input the email address to compose an email in gmail.  I tried to switch my default email to hotmail to see if gmail was part of the problem, but I couldn't figure out how to do that.  When I click on the link, instead of opening gmail in a new tab, it opens blank tabs - and it won't stop opening them! I've tried closing tabs, I've tried quitting firefox (I end up having to do a force quit), I've tried getting back to the original page, or to any other page, but it all fails.  Last time I asked it to close all tabs (which either didn't work or took too long to notice), it asked if I want to close all 222 tabs! 222!
