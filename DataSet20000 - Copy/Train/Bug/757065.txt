untrusted connection window hangs cannot exit out

firefox stuck while trying to identify secure site.png

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:12.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/12.0
Build ID: 20120420145725

Steps to reproduce:

I went to https://66.220.147.88 because I need to test out the firewall blocking of all facebook servers.


Actual results:

Firefox Untrusted Connection page appeared and when I clicked add exception, the Checking Information window under Certificate Status was checking and trying to identify the site, but since I had the ip address blocked, it could not access the sites so no identity could be verified. And I couldnt click cancel or exit out because the "Attempting to identify the site..." never timed out... I had to force quit out of firefox with all my tabs open in the background and didnt get saved..
I am assuming there can be such a tiny fix for timing out of untrusted connection windows if the site cannot be reached.
Someone might wonder, well if its blocked of course it wont identify it, and thats exactly my point, if it cannot reach the site to identify its trusted connection then I should be able to cancel the "confirm security exception addition window" which is what is making the browser hang.


Expected results:

The site should have timed out and firefox should have let me exit after trying to identify it without success for a certain period of time (seconds preferably).
