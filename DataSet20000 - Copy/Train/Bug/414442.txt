The content tree is reloaded with the current bookmarks multiple times when toggling places in the left tree and when double clicking in the content tree to open a new folder. This might also occur in other situations. 

When toggling the folders open or closed in the left tree which are closer to the top, the content bookmarks are refreshed. This seems to be because both containerOpened and containerClosed in the tree view call invalidateContainer... which eventually sets rowCountChanged, which calls onselect, which calls onPlaceSelected, which reloads the tree based on the current selection, even though the selected folder never really changed. Since the currently viewed folder is reloaded this isn't very noticeable.

Double clicking on the content tree seems to cause this because it calls the left tree's selectItems method. In the embedded findNodes method, opening and closing certain containers seems to again call invalidateContainer, rowCountChanged, then onPlaceSelected, which reloads the content tree just like toggling a tree open or closed in the ui does. Since in these cases the selected location hasn't changed yet, the same set of bookmarks is still reloaded. After the findNodes method finishes the current node is finally selected and the right bookmark list is loaded.

I don't really know what the best way to fix this would be. Stopping onselect from being sent when the selected index is modified because something was inserted or removed above it would fix it, but I suppose it still makes sense to be called since the actual selected index does change.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add a dump or breakpoint in the constructor of PlacesTreeView (since that is created each load)
2. Double click on a folder, make it the 'Bookmarks Menu' folder if you want. You might need to have some tags added to a couple bookmarks so the Tags folder isn't empty
3. Look at how many times the content tree was loaded
Actual Results:  
The content tree is reloaded at least once with the old bookmarks before loading the correct set. There is no visual indication that this happens though.

Expected Results:  
The content tree should only load once
