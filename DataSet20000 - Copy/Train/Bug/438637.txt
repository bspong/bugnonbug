When restoring a session with multiple tabs, that in the previous session had differing horizontal scrollbar settings (ex: some far right, some in the middle, etc.), these positions are not restored.  Instead, all horizontal scroll bars are reset to the far left.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a session with several tabs, and move the horizontal scrollbars at the bottom of each to different positions, zooming in if necessary to create a horizontal scrollbar.
2. Exit Firebox, choosing to save session if that option is offered.
3. Run Firefox once again, choosing "Restore Session" in the initial dialogue.
4. All tabs' horizontal scroll positions will have been reset to the left side (default position) of the screen.
Actual Results:  
Same as in "Details" description above.

Expected Results:  
Just as all zoom settings and vertical positionings for all tabs are maintained when saving a session, horizontal positions should be maintained as well (ex: for centering text, viewing the desired portion of an image).
