zh-CN localized Firefox displays system dialogs in zh-TW
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6
Build Identifier: http://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-1.0.6&os=osx&lang=zh-CN

Flash Player 8 raises a modal dialog to indicate a potential security violation.
 This dialog is localized based on the current locale.  When the OS is set to
use zh-CN and Flash raises a dialog from Firefox 1.0.6 zh-CN, the dialog itself
is in zh-TW.  Since the dialog resource provided is zh-CN, the end result is
garbage.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0. Set OS X to use Simplified Chinese
1. Install Flash Player 8 Public Beta:  
http://www.macromedia.com/software/flashplayer/public_beta/ 
2. Download the attached files to your local machine, and open testLFS132548.html
3. Click the blue dot

Actual Results:  
Dialog shows as garbage traditional chinese (see attached picture)

Expected Results:  
Dialog should show as simplified chinese (not garbage).

My hunch is that Firefox is setting the codepage to use via code rather than
relying on system settings.  If this is true, than it may just be that the
simplified chinese localization is setting the wrong codepage.
