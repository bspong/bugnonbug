Dragging an image that is a hyperlink to the home button incorrectly sets home page to a locally cached copy of the image and not the anchor url

Dragging an image that is a hyperlink (e.g. <a href="somepage.html"><img src="someimage.png"></a>) from a webpage to the Home button on the toolbar should set homepage to somepage.html but atually it sets it to a locally cached copy of someimage.png. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a page that has an image as a URL, eg. http://images.google.co.uk/images?client=firefox-a&channel=s&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&hl=en&q=test&btnG=Search+Images&gbv=2
2. Drag a hyperlinked image to the home button - say"yes" to set as home page
3. Click "home" button to see the new home page
Actual Results:  
home page has been set as locally cached copy of the image, e.g. 

file:///C:/DOCUME~1/matt/LOCALS~1/Temp/images-1.jpg

Expected Results:  
home page should be set as the surrounding anchor url



Correct behaviour is observed under the linux version 

Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20061201 Firefox/2.0.0.6 (Ubuntu-feisty)

Under Windows XP and Vista this problem is as described above.
