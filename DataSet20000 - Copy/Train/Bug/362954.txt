When you open any sidebar and drag the dividing bar to increase the width, there is a limit to how far the sidebar's width can be increased. Beyond this point, the resize should stop. Instead, it rips the sidebar off the side of the window and creates a void area to its left that is never reclaimed for that window even if you close and re-open that or any other sidebar. You can, however, increase the void area's width by attempting to make the sidebar wider. If you open a new window, it is not affected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any sidebar, e.g. history (ctrl-H)
2. Drag the sidebar's divider pane wider and wider
Actual Results:  
The sidebar detaches from the of the window: it won't enlarge beyond its width limit so it gets torn away leaving a hole in the window to make up the deficit in space (probably a XUL layout flaw)

Expected Results:  
The divider bar should not be allowed to travel further than the sidebar's width limit OR do not enforce an arbitrary width limit.
