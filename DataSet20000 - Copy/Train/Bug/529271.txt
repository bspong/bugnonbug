Binary download fails with input type=button, parent.location=URL
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

The code below downloads a file using a button, and onclick/parent.location. If the file to be downloaded is binary, then FF 3.5.5 incorrectly downloads it. Chrome and IE8 correctly download the file. I'm pretty sure this is a new problem, but I've just tried this with rv 1.8.1.20 on Linux, and it also has the problem.

NOTE:

1) I use a tgz file for testing. Apache on this server is set up not to compress tgz files.

2) I tried this with a small hand-constructed binary file (10 bytes) and that *does* work on FF.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Put a tgz file on your favourite server
2. Fix the URL (MYSERVER/MYFILE) in the html code to point to this file
3. Load the html file into FF, click the button, save the file, compare
Actual Results:  
My original tgz was 746314 bytes; the version saved by FF is 742608 bytes. Chrome and IE8 correctly download the file. Interesting point: if I gzip the source file, it ends up as 742618 bytes. My guess is that Apache has compressed the file, so FF must somehow have defeated Apache's recognition of tgz files.
