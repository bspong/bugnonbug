When logging into my.yahoo.com it looks fine.  After going to any other page or
web site, then coming back to my.yahoo.com, the 'search bar' area at the top of
the page displays incorrectly (square box, rather than long rectangle).  I have
to hit refresh one time to get it to display correctly.  This happens each time
I come back to the page from anywhere else.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. (Must have a yahoo account) Log into my.yahoo.com using secure mode.
2. Go to any other page or web site.
3. Type in new URL my.yahoo.com (don't use back button) or if inside a yahoo
page, click the 'My Yahoo' link.

Actual Results:  
The Search Bar at the top of the page display incorrectly.

Expected Results:  
Displayed the Search Bar correctly.  When using Internet Explorer, it works
perfectly fine.

This has happened starting with version 1.0.5.  When I removed and reinstalled
1.0.4 the problem did not go away.  Screen shots of the problem can be provided
upon request.
