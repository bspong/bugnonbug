Browser lockup on page navigation

When navigating away from the page above by selecting the 'Radar Loop' option of
the 'Radar' menu near the top of the page, the browser locks up and the process
has to be killed.

I am certain that I was able to navigate in this manner with FireFox in the
past, however I do not know if this behavior began when I started using a newer
version of FireFox or if it started while using a consistent version (implying a
change to, and thus a breaking of, the code on intellicast.com)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Paste the above URL into the address line and load that page.
2. Mouse over the 'Radar' menu at the top of the page
3. Select 'Radar Loop' in the menu.


Actual Results:  
Browser locked up.

Expected Results:  
Successfully navigated to and loaded the page referenced by the 'Radar Loop'
item in the 'Radar' menu.

If I perform these steps in IE6SP1, there are no issues.  When I copy the
destination URL reached by selecting the 'Radar Loop' menu item and past that
URL into the FireFox address bar, the page loads without problems.  I have not
verified (not sure how to) that intellicast.com is attempting to load the same
URL for FireFox and IE6 when performing these actions.
