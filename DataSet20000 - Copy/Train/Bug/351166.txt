non-native fx2vr tab styles out of place with common gtk themes
it probably isn't a good idea to use inflexible non-native widget styles on tabs on a platform that gets a bunch of fairly different widget themes usually shipped and easily selectable by default, and where the default selection varies by distributor and the seasons

the environment has a fair bit of tabbed apps, so the gratuitous difference in appearance is not very nice

theme as of fx2.0b1 replicates native tab style well, test and icon details nonwithstanding (which I guess is fine), although the tabs tend to be a bit undersized

fx2vr themed tabs look out of place due to different hue in several themes, and in several themes spiffy details especially on the selected tab are lost.

it's probably better to just use native tab style on gtk by default since that stuff works (which is awesome! and it's a shame to throw that away by default), and let the platform do the whole looking cool thing flexibly and relatively consistently overall since it can if we let it

screenshot uses themes packaged in debian, overlap with themes shipped in an ubuntu dapper default install (where there are more) is >50%
