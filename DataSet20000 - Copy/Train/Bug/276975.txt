Tabs become messed easily
This is really outrageous! I need to restart my Firefox many times a day because
of this bug!

I have three-button-mouse. I have a habit to click many links with middle button
in order to open that link to new tab. I have configured my Firefox so that
middle-button of mouse open a link to nrew tab.

This happens too often: I click some link with middle button. Mouse cursor shows
hour glass few seconds. Tabs goes weird: New tabs do not appear. Old tabs can be
chosen and then they can be closed via that tab closing icon located in the end
of tab row. Only way to see those new tabs that were opened _after_ tabs went
messy is to close all other tabs via that tab closing icon. But tab row really
don't show those tabs althougt the contents of each tabs are shown.

I think this way you can make this bug happen: Choose some WWW-page that has
many links that opens page to new window when clicked normally with left button
of mouse and normal links, too. Now, click many links with middle button, both
normal links and those that open to new window. Keep you eye on tab row and your
mouse cursor. When you see both of these happening, you have reproduced my bug:

- Mouse cursor shows hour glass few seconds
- tab row do not not change

After that click tab closing icon many times. You'll see also that page that you
just opened but tab row don't show its title.
