Restore with Yahoo Mail Classic - Disconnected from chat windows not in same place
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I took a screen shot.  Would like to enclose.

When doing a session restore with many yahoo mail Classic mail messages open, the "You have been disconnected from Chat..." dialogs which require a dismissal are all over the place and it drives me nuts trying to find all of the windows belonging to the flashing orange Firefox notifications on the taskbar.

In particular, there may be two identical "you have been..." dialogs open in Firefox; One may be in the upper left corner and one in the middle of the screen.

Then you dismiss all the ones in the middle and the ones in the corner and low and behold, you have to minimize all of the Firefox windows to find the hidden dialogs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Have multiple email messages open  ( I typically have otification emails from AskMeHelpDesk.com open and don't know if it matters).

Cause Firefox to save tabs and restart Firefox which will activate restore session.
Actual Results:  
Need to attach screenshot somehow.

Expected Results:  
At the very least, all of the dialogs should be centered. Not some hidden and some in the upper left hand corner.

I'd love for them to be dismissed
