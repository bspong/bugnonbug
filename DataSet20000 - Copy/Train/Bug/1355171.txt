Steps to reproduce:

Visit a secure (https) webpage (e.g., https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/).


Actual results:

In the security field of the URL-bar (screenshot attached), an exclamation point with a circle around it is shown next to the green lock icon.


Expected results:

That exclamation point should not be shown on secure connections. This is confusing to people. I keep getting calls from clients because they think something is wrong with the secure connection (i.e., that there is a problem with the security and that the exclamation point is displaying to alert them to that fact).

Security notices need to be simple. Google Chrome does this the best right now. They have effectively idiot-proofed it by showing the entity's name for EV Certs and simply showing "Secure" for non-EV. I would advise this for Firefox. But at a minimum, the exclamation point should be removed because it is confusing, informs the user of nothing, and is counter-productive to quickly assessing the integrity of the connection.
