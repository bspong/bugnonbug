Reset button in Library search box is broken
Clicking the search box's reset button only deletes the search text, and manually deleting the text does nothing.  In either case the scope bar should disappear and we should be returned to the folder we were viewing.

These are two consecutive revisions (WFM on the older revision), so it looks like http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/ddcb3ca67b5e is the cause.  Related bug is bug 475273.  From that bug:

The new return statement is reached, and the logic in the !resetSearchBox conditional below this new code doesn't get called.  That's all I know.
