Phoenix is great, but I have a suggestion to make the icons/toolbars sizes a
little more consistant.

A)Currently with small icons (without text) there are 3 different icon sizes.
1)home button, 2)back/forward buttons, 3)go button. Depending on what buttons
you add to a toolbar they will make the toolbar grow a few pixels each time and
use up unnecessary toolbar space.  Try this:

1)Add a new empty toolber (with any name)
2)Add the go button on (watch toolbar grow)
3)Add New Page button (watch toolbar grow again)
4)Add a back or forward button (toolbar grows again)

The small icons all should be the same default height on the toolbar, so the
toolbar doesn't need to expand/shrink.....which brings me to...

B)The default toolbars, Menubar, Nav bar (small mode), and Bookmarks toolbar, as
well as new toolbars, should all be set to a default hight to accomodate
different button/arangement, including the urlbar and search bar.  For example,
you could create a new toolbar, or edit an existing one, and put a search bar,
and any icons into it without it having to expand it's height (when adding
items) or shrink down (when removing items).  A resonable height seems to be the
size of creating a new toolbar and adding the location bar into it.  For an
example, you could look at how the menu bar and location bar are same height in IE.

Anyway, hope that makes sense.  Just a thought about how the toolbars could be a
bit cleaner and a bit more consistant and save some space.
