Firefox 1.0.7 l10n update verifications
Localization Release Tasks for Application Update

All of the builds that you sign off on will be staged out to all of our mirrors.
 This mirroring out process can take as much as 24 hours (time for all of our
mirrors to get the builds).  Keep an eye on this bug to see if your locale is
staged and ready for testing.

In order to make each of the localizations available via Application Update, we
need your help to test the update mechanism. For those builds that are already
available on all of our mirrors, this should be able to be completed quickly.
For those builds that haven't all mirrored out, it could be up to 24 hours
before this testing can be completed.

To test the update mechanism, you need to install each of Windows Firefox 1.0
through 1.0.6 and follow these steps for each of those builds:

1. Type about:config in the address bar and hit enter.
2. Locate and change the app.update.url string to the .rdf URL listed
   below.
3. Restart and go to Tools -> Options and select the Advanced panel.
4. Locate and press the Check Now for updates button.

At this point, you should be notified that the 1.0.7 update is
available.

5. Proceed to download and install.
6. At the end of the install, start Firefox and select the Help -> About
   Mozilla Firefox menu item to verify that you are running version
   1.0.7.

If all of this is successful, please add a comment to this bug informing us of
that and we will update the live RDF file which will notify all users of your
locale that an update is available.

If the update fails and you are testing one of the builds below marked with a *,
please repeat the test and if it still fails, please report that failure to this
thread. Be sure to included the steps you took above and where in those steps
the install failed as well as how it failed. Likely failures will be a "hang"
between step 4 and step 5. If your update is successful, please add a comment to
this bug informing us of that and we will update the live RDF file which will
notify all users of your locale that an update is available.

If the update fails and you are testing one of the builds marked with a ?,
please wait and try again in several hours. If it is still failing in 24 hours,
please report that failure to this bug. Your builds may not have made it to all
the mirrors yet and that could cause the failure (between step 4 and step 5.) so
do not report a failure until the build will have had a chance to mirror out to
all of the servers.

Here are the quick checklist for this set of tests:

   o The about:config preference name is 'app.update.url'.
   o The URL to chance it to is in the format of
     https://aus.mozilla.org/update/firefox/test/<L10N>.rdf
     and each one of these is listed below
   o Only test Windows platforms.  Other platforms will show no
     updates.
   o Use as an example en-US update as a baseline to set expectations
     for how the update should function. Your update should work just
     like en-US.
   o Verify each of these update paths.
         o 1.0 -> 1.0.7
         o 1.0.1 -> 1.0.7
         o 1.0.2 -> 1.0.7
         o 1.0.3 -> 1.0.7
         o 1.0.4 -> 1.0.7
         o 1.0.5 -> 1.0.7
         o 1.0.6 -> 1.0.7

Additionally, once you have verified the test .rdf URLs are working and we make
your locale live, you will need to retest using the default .rdf URL:

https://aus.mozilla.org/update/firefox/<l10N>.rdf

for these upgrade paths: 
         o 1.0 -> 1.0.7
         o 1.0.1 -> 1.0.7
         o 1.0.2 -> 1.0.7
         o 1.0.3 -> 1.0.7
         o 1.0.4 -> 1.0.7
         o 1.0.5 -> 1.0.7
         o 1.0.6 -> 1.0.7

to verify that the live .rdf files are working as well.  If you have any
questions, please post them in this bug.  Thanks.
