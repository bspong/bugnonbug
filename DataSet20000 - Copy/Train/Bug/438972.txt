Bookmark All Tabs fails with "Assertion Failed" when trying to bookmark many tabs

I don't know the minimum number of tabs for which it happens, but I often have >100 tabs open at a time, and when I want to Bookmark All Tabs, I enter a name for the set, and then trying to bookmark them I get an "Assertion Failed" dialog box, and no tabs are bookmarked. I have to keep all tabs open across even more sessions, in order not to lose them.

If I delete heaps of tabs (I don't know down to what level - I haven't proofed it to that level), Bookmark All Tabs works again. It is clearly a bug associated with having many tabs open.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have MANY (I have >100) tabs open at a time
2.Bookmarks>Bookmark All Tabs>enter name>Add Bookmarks
3.Get failure dialog
4.No tabs are bookmarked
Actual Results:  
Failure dialog popup upon trying to Bookmark All Tabs. No tabs bookmarked.

Expected Results:  
Tabs bookmarked into a set, no matter how many tabs I have open.
