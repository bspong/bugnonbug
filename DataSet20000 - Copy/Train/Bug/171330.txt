redesign of how we expose bookmark groups / launching multiple tabs from bookmarks
Blake and I had a design meeting today and I'm capturing our notes here for
discussion with the rest of the Phoenix team and implementation if pch and hyatt
agree. 

Problems with bookmarks groups:
1. no obvious and clearly discoverable way to create and use groups.
2. unclear how to represent them consistently in different locations (prefs, bm
manager, bm menu, bm toolbar).

solution: get rid of bookmark groups. simplify the metaphor. go back to
something most users understand - folders.

implementations: for the bookmarks menu, folders on the bookmarks toolbar and
the new preferences (start page) bookmarks menu, we add a "open all in tabs" or
similarly named item at the bottom of each folder menu (probably put a separator
below the last bookmark). 

This gives us a simpler, more discoverable mechanism for loading multiple pages
into tabs. It also eliminates the need to implement much more complicated and
less discoverable features like "make this folder a bookmark group" and "open
one of the bookmarks in this group". 

downside: 
this adds an extra click to launching a group of tabs. this is a negative for
the handful of people that already understand how bmgroups work but we believe
this is a reasonable trade-off to expose the feature to the masses.
