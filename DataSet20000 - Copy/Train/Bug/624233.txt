Firefox.exe task executes w/ low-ram usage (2mb) and no window appears
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b8) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b8

I don't remember when this issue started, but it was definitely present in the last 4-5 betas of firefox 4.

When firefox is NOT running (no firefox.exe or plugin-container.exe tasks exist) - I click on the firefox icon, firefox.exe executes and you can see it on the task manager, it hogs ~2mb of ram and no window appears.

One of two things can happen next -

A) I click on the icon again and another 2mb instance of firefox.exe appears in task manager but again, no window.
B) the window appears and works as usual.

After the first launch attempt, 49% of the time I repeatedly get to A with each additional click (creating multiple 2mb tasks with no window) until I end-task them and try again to eventually get to B, and 49% of the time the 2nd launch will get me to B. Finally, 2% of the time, it will work on the first run.

I can confirm the following:

1) no malware, spyware or adware exist on the box (Microsoft Security Essentials is monitoring) and I also did a spy-bot scan.
2) Uninstalling (and manually deleting firefox and profile directories) then reinstalling did not solve the problem.
3) the 2mb firefox.exe process is indeed the correct executable and not a trojan-replaced or infected one.
4) I also tried closing as many processes (end-task) to see if something was interfering, keeping only the system crucial processes. still, no go.

I will be happy to provide as much additional information as possible.
