This problem started in the previous release of Firefox and is still an issue. At a variety of sites, e.g. Google maps getting directions, or snopes.com and others, entering some text into the search field works fine. But if the text is changed and the "go" button is clicked again nothing happens until the page is been reloaded (with <ctrl>r).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. At snopes.com (or google maps getting directions)
2. enter a search term in the text field (e.g. obama)
3. click go.
4. after the results page is displayed, go back (<alt><left arrow>)
5. enter a new search term in the text field (e.g. clinton)
6. click go and nothing happens.
7. reload the page and reenter the search term(s)
8. click go and it works.

Except that it's not necessary to go back to the previous page, the same thing happens if a different destination address is entered into destination field in google maps.

Actual Results:  
nothing until the page was reloaded then it worked for that search. to change the search again, another reload was necessary.

Expected Results:  
produced a new search result.
