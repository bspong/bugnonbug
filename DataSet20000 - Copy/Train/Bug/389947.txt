"transferring data" mentions wrong domain when downloading image
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.5) Gecko/20061201 Firefox/2.0.0.5 (Ubuntu-feisty)

Firefox was loading http://roelschroeven.net/search/ (I used that as my home page). It contains images from google.com, en.wikipedia.org, nl.wikipedia.org, dict.org, w3.org. The page itself and all of the images except for the one from w3c.org were already loaded; Firefox was still working on the image from w3c.org (apparently W3C's web server was down or very slow).

At that moment, the status bar read "Transferring data from www.dict.org" even though Firefox was at that time clearly transferring data from w3.org, not from dict.org.

I've seen that behavior numerous times before (both in Linux and Windows), but never as clear and obvious as now, so that's why I only report the bug now.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find or make a page with images, where one of the images is hosted on a very slow webserver.
2. Load that page.
3. Watch how the status bar mentions the domain of the previous domain, instead of the one Firefox is currently downloading (or trying to) from.
Actual Results:  
The status bar mentions the domain of the previous domain.

Expected Results:  
The status bar should mention the domain Firefox is currently downloading (or trying to) from.
