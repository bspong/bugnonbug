Just lately I have been trying to send out my resume to interested parties and I can't attach my 2 page resume to the note in Yahoo Mail.  I am using the above and Firefox is 2.0.0.3 which I believe is the latest release for this operating system.  



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Reply to a note using Yahoo Mail

2.Select the attach button to attach a document

3. The attachment screen comes up with the buttons on the top and bottom but not the browes area.  That is blank.  I can't select to search for a document to attach it because that area or part of the screen is missing.

I am using another browers until you can fix this problem

Actual Results:  
The same results each time. There is no brow area to pull up a document to attach to the note. NOT ONE because I believe there are 5 places to attach a file to a note.  It is blank each and every time.  This has been happening about two weeks+ because it use to work as a champ.  Nothing has changed in Yahoo that I know about and nothing has changed here that I know of.  I am using my aunt's machine mine is windows XP.  However I can use Safari on this same machine and it works and my aunt's encor also works in this machine.  Firefox is the only browers that is not working right now.


Expected Results:  
Sames result a blank screen (with the browers area Not the button area)
