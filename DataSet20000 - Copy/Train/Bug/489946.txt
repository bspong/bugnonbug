Crashes at any arbitrary action

Works fine if only checking inbox, opening emails, attachments and composing and sending replies.

But if attempt to edit any settings (mail preferences, NOT FireFox settings), then settings improperly displayed, in some cases (specifically unable to edit or create new filters, other general bugs present too).

Following this if attempt to return to inbox, inbox NOT displayed. Cannot compose email, goto sent/spam etc.

If then attempt to refresh webpage (F5 or FireFox refresh button (both tried)) then FireFox crashes with FireFox crash notice. 

All features were working as of 3.1 b2 and for a while in b3 (although had not been tested extensively in b3 till now).

NOTE: I always ONLY use secure connection (HTTPS). This is coded into my Gmail account.

NOTE2: NoScript was update right before crashes satrted. i suspect  this may be cause - But cannot be conclusive since disable didnot change. Have not treid uninstalling. Will try to report the bug to NoScript

Note3: I am report this as a critical error given the volume of users who use both gmail and noscript. Also FireFox critically crashes when using an email website and thus may interrupt critical communication channels

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load and login to Gmail (https://mail.google.com - NOTE: I always use HTTPS never HTTP)
2. Check if inbox is displayed fine and can read emails

Fork in road! 3 slightly different paths taken after noticing bug
3.1.1 > attempt to add filters ("Settings -> filters -> add new") or edit filters.
3.1.2 > Following incorrect display form above, attempt to return to Inbox
3.1.3 > Failing this, attempt refresh.
3.1.4 > FireFox Crashed.

3.2.1 > Attempt Refresh (Now edit filter or anything else).
3.2.2 > FireFox Crashed

3.3.1 > Attempt to close FireFox (No refresh, filters or anything else).
3.3.2 > FireFox Crashed notice
Actual Results:  
FireFox Crashed Notice

Expected Results:  
normal Gmail web browser display when using secure connection (HTTPS)

Addons installed: (ALL ARE LATEST VERSIONS since i update regularly)
1. NoScript (latest - updated just before crashes - i suspect  this may be cause - But cannot be conclusive since disable didnot change. Have not uninstalled)
2. AdBlock Plus 
3. All-in-one sidebar
4. DOM inspector
5. WOT
6. iMacros
7. LabMeeting
