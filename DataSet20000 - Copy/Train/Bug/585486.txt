So,I am here just going to say that I am not the only one with problem,my friend has that bug too,and it logs of his facebook too,but not after 10 mins,but after 2 min or something like that... So the bug is the same,but timeline only different...At first I tought my computer was wrong,but then,I realised that my friend has got it too... Here are links of sites that log off,that I use :

http://www.facebook.com/

http://bux.to/

Same,on bux.to,I am registered there and after a few ads (same,in other Firefox window I am exploring internet),it says "Not logged in"...So hope you fix this bug... 

I think i was preety detailed in my report :)

Great Thanks!
