Firefox Doesn't handle LiteralControl controls within Visual Studio properly.

If you add a LiteralControl like <br/> then firefox doesn't execute it/add it to the web page!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
This is in C#
1.In visual studio 2005 create a new project and add a placeholder
2.Then add a method ....
  protected void addText(PlaceHolder ph, string Info1, string Info2)
  {
    Label l1 = new Label();
    Label l2 = new Label();
    ph.Controls.Add(l1);
    ph.Controls.Add(new LiteralControl("&nbsp;"));
    ph.Controls.Add(l2);
    ph.Controls.Add(new LiteralControl("<br/>"));
    l1.Text = Info1;
    l2.Text = Info2;    
  }
3.Then call that method a few times.
Actual Results:  
What is suppose to happen, is that after the two labels are created it's suppose to call a html break line but it doesn't or any other Literal call.

Please note that this does work in IE.
