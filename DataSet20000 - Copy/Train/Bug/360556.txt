all of my settings in the toolbar disappear when restarting Firefox. Asking a new window resolves the problem.Restarting Firefox I have to do it all over again.

everything worked well, but today when starting Firefox all my toolbar settings - except for the navigation toolbar - dissapeared, except 3 items. (Instead of 4 bars only 3 remained.)
However, asking a new window brought all the settings (incl. add-ons) back.(now 4 bars again) Everything works as normal.
Note: I cannot find all of the items back in the customize window(view)in the starting window,though they don't appear in the toolbar. As a result I cannot reset them.

Asking a new window and replacing all of the items in the toolbar back in the customize window (view) was resulting only in losing all of the toolbar settings in the new window to. After trying to repair it bij closing and restarting Firefox several times, suddenly all my setting were back again, but only when asking for a new window.
