Some Firefox windows, usually configuration menus are too large to be fully displayed on devices with small screens.  These windows typically do not have vertical scroll bars.  Since the buttons to save, cancel, etc. are typically at the bottom of the window and the window is too tall to display the buttons, such programs are largely unusable.  

Particularly reporter complains about Firefox (and equivalent in Thunderbird) *when run in KDE and/or LXDE* to show dialogs for Preferences - Advanced - Network - Settings - Proxy, Firefox Preferences - Privacy - Private data, and Preferences - Main - Add-ons requiring more than 440 pixels height to fully display all of the information and allow it to be fully functional.
