Installing with 'Run As' and launching Firefox from the installer launches as a user different than the one installing and leads to a potential exploit of Save As during that session

Installing Firefox to the Program Files directory from a non-su account in Windows XP requires "Run As"ing the install file with admin privileges.  This is normal.

However, Firefox then installs with Admin privileges and defaults to the Admin account directory tree - regardless which account it's run under.

That means that when I go to "save as" a linked file, from a non-su account, I can save the file into any directory that Admin would have access to (i.e. admin's personal folders, system folders, the Windows TM Registry TM ... etc.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install Firefox to a Win XP computer from a user (non Administrator) account, using "Run As" to install into the Program Files directory
2. run newly-installed Firefox
3. right-click a link and select "Save As" ... take a close look at the displayed "home" directory ... it won't match the user's home directory
4. just for fun, try saving to a deep branch of the Windows System folder.
Actual Results:  
saved a harmless .pdf to my Windows System folder

Expected Results:  
Should not have been able to save a download to my Windows System folder from a user account.
