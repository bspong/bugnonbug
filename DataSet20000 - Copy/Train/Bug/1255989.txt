Cannot drag window from empty space in bookmarks toolbar items when customized to the menubar
First noticed this on first Aurora 47 build on Windows (47.0a2 (2016-03-11)) where I couldn't drag an addon (DownThemAll) window.

Then I noticed I can't drag the Firefox window itself too.

Tried nightly and it did drag.

Then I customized Nightly it as follows:
1. burger -> customize
2. Show/Hide tooblars -> [check] menu bar
3. Show/Hide toolbars -> [check] bookmarks toolbar
4. Drag the bookmark toolbar (which just became visible) to the right side of the menu toolbar (which also just became visible).
5. Exit customize.

6. Try dragging the Firefox from the top of the window (right side of the bookmarks toolbar).

Expected: Firefox window follows the mouse.

Actual: Firefox window doesn't get dragged.

Mozregression pointed to this range:

Which point to bug 1241275 and bug 1219215, both seem highly relevant.

P.S.
Didn't follow up on the "cannot drag addon window" symptom, but I'm guessing that fixing the reported issue would also fix the addon symptom. I'll report back on this once a fix lands.
