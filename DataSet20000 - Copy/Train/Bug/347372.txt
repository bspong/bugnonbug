Firefox FREEZING WHEN NAVIGATE
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; fr; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; fr; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6

I've the same problem, it's probably a problem because i run firefox on 2 cpu... but i swith the process on only one cpu and the problem persist...
maybe firefox's not suppose to run correctly on windows ! 

i restart the machine the problem persist:
All firefox windows are freezing when i navigate and if i try to close one of them by right clicking on the winbar and close it...all the firefox window that i'm trying to reach are closing when iclick with my left button.....tell me what the hell is that problem...

I test it with a new installation of Windows .... the problem's still there !
There's some update that firefox popup at the first or second utilisation...
It's probably those new features that bug my system. I Don't know...
Someone help me
