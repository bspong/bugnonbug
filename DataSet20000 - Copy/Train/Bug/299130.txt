Freezes while moving around a message board

Among all the ways that Firefox freezes, and they are many, I've discovered it
also hangs when you are attempting to post on a message board, such as the one
noted above.  All I was doing was reading a post, then tried to move to another
and Firefox froze.  Most of my experience with Firefox freezing has to do with
either Flashgot downloads, or when the Mac sleeps, or if there is no activity
for a period of time, but now I'm seeing a freeze under a more active scenario.
 Also, Firefox froze yesterday after only about 10 minutes of idle time, which
is much quicker than usual.  

I've seen the huge number of posts of Firefox freezes, PC as well as Mac, and
this really has to get fixed, as it is absolutely ruining the user experience of
this otherwise lovely browser.  Firefox has frozen under some conditions since
version 1.0, my first experience with it, but it is getting worse, not better.

1.Read posts on Message Board
2.Move to other posts, maybe make one
