Firefox crashes (without warning) on paypal login

I have two paypal accounts. Today morning I tried to login to one of my accounts (for the first time since I installed 3.0 about 3 days ago) and firefox simply closed without any error whatsoever. 

I was on the main paypal page and could see the green icon to the left of the website address. I entered my username and password and pressed enter (I did not click on the login button). And FF closed. I reopened FF and did the same thing again and I was able to login...

I then logged out of the first account and tried to login with my second account doing the exact same things I did the first time. Boom, crash without warning again. Restart FF and I was able to login just fine. 

Seems that the first time I login to my account FF crashes but when I restart (by restoring the previous session) I am able to login just fine.

My first bug report, please let me know if I can provide any more help.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://www.paypal.com
2. Enter username and password in the form that appears on the left side of the page.
3. Press enter, do not click on the button.
4. Crash


Expected Results:  
Should login to paypal the first time.
