Firefox shows 100% CPU usage, severe lag, is sluggish and unresponsive while moving the mouse over a Firefox window on Linux
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:29.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/29.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140421221237

Steps to reproduce:

For websites: 
Example 1: Open any website, e.g. http://news.google.de and mouve the mouse cursor while trying to scroll using the wheel or arrow keys.

Example 2: Open https://duckduckgo.com/?q=firefox and move the mouse between the results.

Example 3: Open http://demo.phpmyadmin.net/STABLE/?pma_username=root and move the mouse vertically between left navigation pane items.

Please note that it does not matter where exaclty to move the mouse to experience the problem. Though natuarlly the effect will get worse if the mouse moves trigger css/js hover efffects. Please also note that moving the mouse over any non-firefox window has no impact on Firefox performance.


For Firefox window with main navigation enabled: 
Load a few bookmarks, click on "File" and move the mouse to the left and right so that menus start to appear.


Actual results:

Firefox take 80-100% cpu usage and will start to lag, "jump screens" and show sluggishness. This will get worse when you move the mouse faster, to the extent that Firefox will become totally unresponsive until you slow down mouse movement.



Expected results:

Firefox should not use that much CPU time and stay snappy and responsive no matter how fast you move the mouse.

Try all my examples in Google Chrome to see how it should be. You will notice absolutely zero impact on browser responsivness nor snappiness from mouse move there.
