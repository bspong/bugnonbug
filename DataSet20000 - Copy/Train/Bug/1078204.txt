Firefox not scalable (single-tasking needed?) - gets sluggish over time (and often ends up crashing if I do not kill it first). 5 min+ startup (CPU use not spread from master process?)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:33.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/33.0
Build ID: 20141003080645

Steps to reproduce:

Open Firefox - my old tabs reopen - I have lots.

[Have had this problem on stock Ubuntu Linux builds (64-bit Intel and at home) of Firefox for 14.04 (installed, not upgraded to 14.04 and not using old profile). Both current, beta and Aurora and:
Installed version: 33.0~b8+build1-0ubuntu0.14.04.1~ricotz1
Available version: 33.0~b9+build1-0ubuntu0.14.04.1~ricotz1

Did upgrade to the "available" b9 after my latest slowdown. Any preferred version testing method?]


Actual results:

All will be fine for a while. Generally happy with Firefox and its speed. [Still I see CPU use between eg. 20 and 50% (and minimal for plugin-containe):]
KiB Mem:   8130196 total,  4136676 used,  3993520 free,    45096 buffers
KiB Swap:  8341500 total,  1306056 used,  7035444 free.   740148 cached Mem
VIRT    RES    SHR %MEM
2948764 1,406g  57344  18,6  R firefox
1315368 233272  33588  2,9  plugin-containe

With a little browsing and clicking on tabs I had previously (I think then they get loaded in) after a while Firefox gets very sluggish and not very usable with CPU up to a 100% (on one CPU of my "eight" (I think four as virtual). I believe I saw 5g (I assume in RES). Swap wasn't full, didn't notice thrashing (hear or all machine getting sluggish - happened in the past - believe not happening now).

Then I either kill Firefox process or plugin-containe. At last time, killing the latter didn't change anything, in the past that has often helped, but I believe current problem has nothing to to with that/Flash).



Expected results:

Not get sluggish over time.

What is needed (one way that would help..) IMHO, is single-tasking (as on Firefox for Android?). I have 15 Windows open. Almost all have tens (hundreds?) or more of tabs. If only one tab or one tab in each Window would get CPU, then it should not be measurable. However, the CPU isn't strictly a problem, now when everything is running ok. My guess is that when I click the old tabs and/or open new tabs they all get memory and the CPU is only an indicator of that (do we need do garbage collect agressively non-focused tabs?).

[I didn't count all tabs, was 27 in one Windows and seemed typical, maybe double/triple in others not more I think).]

Only using stock plugins/extensions and all are on "Ask to activate" (and I don't think I've gotten a "question" or activated), except Flash that is "Always activate" (I changed that at home, and believe I still have the same problem there).

All my extensions are updated:
Ubuntu Firefox Modification 2.9
Online Accounts 0.5
Unity Desktop Inegration 3.0.2
Unity Websites integration 2014.08.06.beta

All my plugins are at the most recent but still all vulnerable..:

Believe this is not the issue as been having this problem a long time and just recently switched from the free driver and have had problems at home on Dell Inspiron 1525 (Intel graphics free driver).
