this issue just appeared while i was downloading multiple files (not at once) from multiple hosters.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
I don't know how to reproduce this because this firefox session here runs already more then 10 hours without a problem.
Actual Results:  
Showing the whole time "starting..." when it downloads and when its done.
The rightclick menu on theese downloads shows the usual "starting..." rightclick menu.

When i start a new download it won't be listed untill i reopen the manager.

more information:
see url

Expected Results:  
showing finished downloads.

I run Firefox fluitly since the Minefield/3.7a4pre update came out.
Besides.. most of the extensions i usually use, are not enabled right now.
I only run adblock plus and an adblock plus addon called "element hiding helper".

i have 24 tabs open right now wich - i think - have nothing to do with that bug.

all my usual firefox modifications are currently disabled.
