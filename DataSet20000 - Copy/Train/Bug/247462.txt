When visiting a ssl site that opens a popup, the ssl security icon will
overwrite the popup icon. You can actually see the popup icon first, then it
gets overwritten. This makes impossible for user to select the popup icon and
unblock the window if desired. User must maually go to options and add the url.
What is worse is that from the example given, the website actually redirects to
a different address, so it is very hard to capture the original url.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. enable popup blocking in mozilla or firefox
2. go to http://www.stgeorge.com.au
3. click on Log onto internet banking


Actual Results:  
1. popup blocking icon appears as the login window is blocked
2. the icon is overwritten by ssl icon as the website redirects to another https
address
3. at this stage, a novice user must be very confused.

Expected Results:  
Both popup blocking icon and ssl security icon should appear in lower left. I
actually saw it working around firefox 0.6 days.
