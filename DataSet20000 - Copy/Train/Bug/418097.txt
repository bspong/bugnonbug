Not much to say.  summary is pretty much it.  I'm using the nasa night launch theme, and if I open a new tab(or use existing) and type www. the good ol drop wond box appears with loads of options.  However, it won't scroll through the options.  Either using the mouse wheel, or the scrollbar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open new tab, or use existing
2.  Type in www.
3.  try scrolling through the options provided
Actual Results:  
If i move my mouse over a result, and then scroll down, only the bottom-most option will change, as if that's all that is scrolling.  Likewise with scrolling up and the topmost option.  the middle options in the drop down box do not move.

Expected Results:  
It should scroll through all the options.

I have the Nasa space launch 0.6.20080213 theme installed and running.

I have a bunch of other addons, but they're all disabled until a compatible version comes out.  

Using FF3 beta 3.  but you know that from the build info.
