Firefox 3 does not remember its previous screen size upon reopening.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4

If the Firefox 3 window is manually sized to anything less than full-screen and Firefox is then closed it does not reopen to that same screen-size. Instead, it opens a small 4" x 6" window which must then be manually resized in order to be usable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox 3.
2. If Firefox opens to a full screen window use the "restore down" button in the upper right corner to produce a smaller window.
3. Grab one of the lower corners of the Firefox window and pull the Firefox window to a desired size.
4. Close Firefox 3.
5. Open Firefox 3 and observe that the resulting window is not the same size as the one that was just closed.
Actual Results:  
Each time that the above steps are performed, Firefox 3 opens in a small 4" x 6" window which must then be manually resized in order to be usable.

Expected Results:  
Each time that the above steps are performed, Firefox 3 should open in a window of the same size as it occupied before being previously closed. This is the way other browsers work and the way Firefox 2 worked on this system. Since installing Firefox 3 this feature no longer works as expected.

My system has a 1920 by 1200 pixel screen with a resulting dpi of 146. I am running Windows Vista Service Pack 1. I previously ran Firefox 2 on the system and did not experience this problem. I was referred to Mozillazine article "corrupt localstore.rdf" and I executed the procedure to delete and regenerate my localstore.rdf file. This made no difference. I installed Firefox 3 on my Windows XP computer and the "window-memory" worked perfectly on that system. I then copied the localstore.rdf file from the windows XP version of Firefox 3 and imported that localstore.rdf version into Firefox 3 on my Windows Vista system. No help. The problem continues to persist.
