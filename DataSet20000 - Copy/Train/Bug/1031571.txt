Restyled error pages - Try Again button:hover cursor is pointer instead of default

The new visual style of error pages implemented in Bug 982347 looks really sweet and good, but there's this little thing bugging me.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Get an error message page - for example by disconnecting your computer from network and performing a network action in Firefox.
2. Move cursor over the "Try Again" button.

Expected results:
Cursor doesn't change (keeps "cursor: default" CSS).

Actual results:
Cursor changes to a "hand" pointer (has "cursor: pointer" CSS).


Likely, this is determined by Project Chameleon at http://people.mozilla.org/~jgruen/chameleon/#nav1. Then again, the project page clearly says it's a work in progress, so this should be a subject to (discuss to) change.

The "Try Again" button shouldn't use Pointer as a hover cursor. A button is a button, not a link.

Every operating system uses the standard cursor for buttons - even some websites (if they have their own buttons styling, like Google) and all web browsers - including Internet Explorer, both old&new Opera, and Google Chrome do. There's no reason to go against the crowd now - and not ever.

I'd also like to point out that Firefox's inContent preferences styling uses the default cursor for buttons too (which is good).
