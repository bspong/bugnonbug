browser.tabs.loadFolderAndReplace is obsolete, remove it from firefox.js
support browser.tabs.loadFolderAndReplace or browser.tabs.loadFolderAndReplace obsolete, remove it from firefox.js

bug #175124 has removed support for browser.tabs.loadFolderAndReplace, but we still have:

/browser/app/profile/firefox.js, line 270 -- pref("browser.tabs.loadFolderAndReplace", true);

from bug #175124 comment #29:

click on Open in Tabs replaces the currently selected tab with the tabset
Ctrl/Cmd+click on Open in Tabs appends the tabs and selects the first tab of
the set (foreground load)
Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+click on Open in Tabs appends the tabs and leaves selection
alone (background load)

although it appears as by design and after much discussion, I'm a little concerned about "open in tabs" (by default) replacing the selected tab.
  
are users like me, and they use tabs as "a todo list"?  

I see that I can get back to my replaced tab (with the back button), but it still has a data-loss like feel.  

(the Ctrl/Cmd+click listed above sounds like what I'd want.)

what about restoring support for browser.tabs.loadFolderAndReplace, so that click on Open in Tabs will not replace?

thanks to rob strong for pointing this out.
