When you load http://usemycomputer.com/indeximages/cars/Bugatti/EB%2018%20Veyron/ and you hover with the cursor over the left image in the second row or the rows below, the image jumps one row higher to the right end, all following images get resorted as well, then everything jumps back again and so on in an endless loop. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load http://usemycomputer.com/indeximages/cars/Bugatti/EB%2018%20Veyron/
2. hover over the left image in the second row
Actual Results:  
The image below the cursor jumps one row higher to the right end, all following images get resorted as well. Afterwards all images jump back again. Both result steps are repeated very fast in an endless loop. The same problem happens on a PPC with 10.4 Tiger 

Expected Results:  
The images should not get resorted when you hover over one of them. Everything works properly on Firefox 2.0.
