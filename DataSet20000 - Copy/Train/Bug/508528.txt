I tried to log in to mt Tesco Personal Finance account shortly after Firefox 3.5.1 was installed and was told that their system wont recognize it and I should use Internet Explorer. I complained by phone and they have now written to tell me that 3.5.1 will not be acceptable until it has been reviewed and found to be safe.
Can you ask Tesco to get their finger out. They don't give any email contact but their phone No and address are:- (44) 141 567 0252 (9 to 5 Mon - Fri UK time).
Tesco Personal Finance, George House, 36 North Hanover Street, Glasgow, Scotland, G1 2YG.

Warning that my browser (Firefox) is not secure and request to log in on a recent version of Internet explorer.

Probably not Firefox's fault but if you don't give them prior advice that you are changing the browser it is reasonable for them to refuse to operate with it until their security team has tested it.
