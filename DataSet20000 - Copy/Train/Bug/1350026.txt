Fix recognition of the handler type in the JSON handler service back-end, and add detailed testing of the file format
This bug adds detailed testing of the values we read from the template "mimeTypes.rdf" and "handlers.json" files that we have in the test folders.

For this to work consistently, the "application/pdf" type had to be renamed to a type that the operating system does not know about, otherwise we would get spurious information that depends on the external configuration of the machine.

This change required a minor update to another test, that was effectively dependent on the "pdf" extension being associated to the "application/pdf" type at the operating system level.

An incorrect "&amp;" in the JSON file is also fixed, so that it now matches the data in the RDF file precisely.

The code is also refactored to minimize duplication by adding new helper functions to "head.js". Using the helper functions throughout the file improves the amount of data that is verified. This resulted in fixing a misleading use of the appendExtension method, because the argument should not include a leading dot.

This bug depends on bug 1350008 because, when I tried to add tests for the code I eventually decided to remove, the JSON and RDF implementations behaved differently.
