Focus fired inconsistently on iframe's document.

I listen on the focus event for the content document of an iframe. It is fired twice when I click on the iframe and fired once even when the iframe already has focus. If I use tab to get focus on the document, it fires only once when the iframe gets focus, but when I use tab to focus out of the iframe, a focus event is still fired. If I use shift + tab to focus the iframe, 3 focus events are fired and 1 is fired when I use it to focus out. The below HTML can be used to observe the behaviour:

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Firefox focus bug.</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>
      Iframe focus testing.
    </div>
    <iframe id="testIframe">
    </iframe>

    <div id="logDiv">
    </div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      var iframe = document.getElementById('testIframe');
      var iframeDoc = iframe.contentDocument;
      iframeDoc.write('Focus me.');
      var numFocus = 0;

      iframeDoc.addEventListener('focus', handleFocusDoc, false);

      function handleFocusDoc(event) {
        var logDiv = document.getElementById('logDiv');
        logDiv.innerHTML += ++numFocus + ' ';
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

Instead of the iframe document, if I listen to the iframe's content window, then the focus events are fired correctly.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a file with the HTML given above.
2. Click on the iframe.
Actual Results:  
Observe that the text at the bottom is "1 2", meaning the focus event was fired twice.

Expected Results:  
The text at the bottom should be "1 ".

The same behaviour was observed on FF 3.0.10 on Linux also.
