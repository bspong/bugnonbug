Add-on doorhanger does not reappear consistently on Mozilla add-ons site
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b7pre) Gecko/20100927 Firefox/4.0b7pre

When installing an add-on from the Mozilla add-on site (with addons.mozilla.org NOT in the "Exceptions" list and D2D enabled), clicking a green "Add to Firefox" button will bring up an "Allow" doorhanger. If you click away to ignore it and then try to make it reappear by clicking a different "Add to Firefox" button, the notification will not always reappear even though the puzzle icon is visible in the URL bar. Trying to bring up the notification by clicking the icon in the URL bar is also inconsistent. Clicking on a white "Add to Firefox" button and then clicking "Install anyway" in the popup dialog will also produce this behaviour.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable Direct2D in about:config.
2. Remove "addons.mozilla.org" from the add-ons exception list.
3. Visit the add-ons site and click an "Add to Firefox" button to bring up the doorhanger.
4. If it appears, click away to hide it.
5. Try to retrieve it by clicking another "Add to Firefox" button.
Actual Results:  
The "Allow" doorhanger notification does not always reappear.

Expected Results:  
The "Allow" doorhanger notification should reappear.
