As I use Bon Echo more and more, Xorg's VM footprint grows. With significant use over about 24 hours, X.org grew from 85 MB to 250 MB. Opening this page- http://www.improveverywhere.com/mission_view.php?mission_id=48 - Which is filled with jpg images, caused it to grow from 90 MB to 135 MB just now. Closing the tab or window does not free it, but closing Bon Echo does.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Note X.org's VM usage
2. Open Bon Echo
3. Go to http://www.improveverywhere.com/mission_view.php?mission_id=48
4. Note X.org's new VM usage
Actual Results:  
Xorg grew from 85 to 130 MB, which was not recoverable until I closed Bon Echo.

Expected Results:  
Xorg to not fill up or to have the RAM freed.
