Firefox freezes, have to kill process, then reboot whole computer for it to work again.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.0 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.195.38 Safari/532.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla Firefox 3.5 and up.

Firefox freezes every single day when clicking on anything. For example, when I click "Home" on FaceBook, it will freeze, if I click on any type of link, it will freeze. This only happens 15 minutes after opening Firefox. When I try to close Firefox, it wont let me. I have to press Ctrl+Alt+Delete and kill the process. When I try to open it again, it wont open. The process is there but it only reaches to 27,000 K's (when its really 110,000 K's). So then I have to restart it, then Firefox will open again. But the same thing happens every 15-20 minutes into the session. I dont have that much tab's open so that i know for sure is not the problem. (only two or three at a time)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Kill Process
2. Restart
3. Open up again
Actual Results:  
Worked for about 15-20 Minutes (then re-did the steps)

Expected Results:  
NOT CRASH IN THE FIRST PLACE!!

Windows 7, No special theme, only has happened with version 3.5 and above
