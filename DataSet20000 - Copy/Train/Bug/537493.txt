Occurred on a MacBook Pro. Other details are on the Build Identifier field of this report.
With the computer set up to shutdown after some period of inactivity results on deadlock if firefox is on a file-upload dialog.
Only way out is hard-reset.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Make sure your computer is setup to shutdown after some period of inactivity.
2.From a web app (I was using gmail) go the the dialog to upload a file.
3.Leave your computer untouched so that it reaches its timeout and tries to shutdown.
4. The shutdown action will try to quit Firefox and so will display a confirmation dialog.
5. Try then to get out of that state.

Actual Results:  
The computer is "frozen" on a deadlock state

Expected Results:  
User should be able proceed with either quit or cancel or save-and-quit, which should allow user to also decide what to do with the file-upload.

I have a screenshot of the deadlock state and will be glad to send it if you need it.
