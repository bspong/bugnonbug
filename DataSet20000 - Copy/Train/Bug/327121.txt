Bug 202615 has similar background.  All important for ease of browsing in modern mouse/Keyboard/touchpad is quick BACK and FWD buttons or strokes.  Many of these pieces of equipment have dedicated buttons or strokes for BACK or FWD. These facilities do not work in Firefox with Sony Vaio laptop or Logitech mouse or keyboard.  Have tried latest versions of all drivers and software etc. These functions work with every other piece of software that I have.  For me it has never worked with any version of Firefox.  This problem is evident with Firefox and Firefox only.  I would echo the sentiments of many others on the Forums etc.  This function failing to work makes Firefox unuseable for those of us who have become accustomed to the convenience of these quick navigation buttons.  I so want to use Firefox but am frustrated by this shortcoming, I know I am not alone I hope there is a fix!  From what I have read it appears to be the same with most makes or brands of Laptop or Mouse/Keyboard.

Reproducible: Always
