Sync reverts changed passwords if old password entered before sync complete
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:29.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/29.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140130030202

Steps to reproduce:

1. Set up Firefox Sync (easier to reproduce with two installations on a dual boot).
2. Synchronise saved passwords.
3. Change and sync the saved password to an online account.
4. Reboot (or otherwise switch to) another Firefox installation.
5. Attempt to log in to account with changed password before sync occurs (setting a master password makes this easier to notice, not sure if it affects reproducibility).


Actual results:

The login attempt failed with an incorrect password message (in this case, Google informed me that I had changed my password a while ago). After synchronisation was completed, the new password was overwritten with the old password on all devices set up with sync, making it impossible to log in with the saved password.


Expected results:

Ideally, sync should have picked up and used the new password immediately, although of course that's not possible under all circumstances. It probably should have eventually picked up the new password, and definitely should not have reverted the password on all synced devices.
