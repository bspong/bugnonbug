When I save a Places search that matches on a tag, it includes a duplicate untitled entry along with the target entry. There is one dupe for each tag on the target entry, whether the other tags match the search or not.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Unzip a recent trunk hourly
2.Start it with a new profile
3.Click the URL bar star twice to open the dialog for the current page
4.Enter XXX in the Tags: field, click done
5.From the Bookmarks menu, click Organize Bookmarks...
6.Enter XXX in the search field, then click the Save button when the advanced search UI opens. Accept the default query name (New Query)
7.Select New Query on the left side of the organizer, and notice the result in the main pane.

Actual Results:  
One entry named 404: File Not Found, and a second entry named (no title) with the same URL and tag.

Expected Results:  
Only display the 404: File Not Found entry, ala the "smart folders" in the Places toolbar folder.

bug 397165 and bug 401450 are related, I think, but they're fixed and the search-saving isn't.
