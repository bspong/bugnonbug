Status bar progress indicator, throbber and tab title get stuck on "active"

Applies to Firefox 1.5 RC1 and RC2.  When loading a web page, the status bar progress indicator, throbber and tab title stay active instead of indicating that the page has loaded.  That is to say, the progress indicator retains a bar that looks at though it is at about 98% (almost all the way full) and the status bar text stays at "Transferring data from xxx..."; the throbber keeps spinning; and the tab title remains as "Loading..."



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
This will happen on different webpages at different times, there does not seem to be anything that I can narrow down the circumstances to.
Actual Results:  
The status bar progress indicator, throbber and tab title stay active instead of indicating that the page has loaded.

Expected Results:  
On page load completion, status bar text changes to the page URL; the throbber stops spinning; and the tab title shows the page title.

Version info:
Didn't happen with FF 1.0.7; this has happened on FF 1.5 RC1 and RC2 (WinXP SP2)
