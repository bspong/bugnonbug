Firefox won't load after uninstallation and reinstallation
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: n/a

After installing a few extensions, Firefox wouldn't load properly, it would 
show me the shell of Firefox, but no tabs or webpages would show up.  It also 
would not let me click on anything at all, no menus or bars or anything.  I 
uninstalled all extensions and I had the same problem.

I tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it, but the frame of Firefox shows 
up, but it still shows a theme that I uninstalled.  I tried uninstalling it, 
purging the registry of anything with "Mozilla" in it and tried reinstalling 
it.  Still the same problem.

I cannot visit any pages or click on any menus.  When I click the X to close 
Firefox, it asks me if I want to close all of the tabs I have open (which I 
can't see; I had multiple homepages before I had these problems).  I was using 
a fresh installation file from mozilla.org.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Uninstall Firefox
2. Reinstall FIrefox
3. Run Firefox

Actual Results:  
Firefox appears, but I can't do anything with it.

Expected Results:  
Show webpages and allow me to access all of the menus
