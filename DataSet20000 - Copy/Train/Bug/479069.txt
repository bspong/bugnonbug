My friend built an extension for firefox, and I noticed that the timepicker control (in xul) does not display the AM/PM select, neither does it provide a 24 hour clock. (only on Ubuntu).

I live in India, and so it just shows IST instead of AM/PM (see screenshot)

This problem occurs only on Ubuntu (I have not tried other distros). The same firefox extension was displaying AM/PM correctly in Firefox when running on Windows Vista.

The same problem occurred with the datepicker control: it was displaying an arbitrary "October" between the Day number and Month number. (This too, only on ubuntu).

I wonder why this is hapenning.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox in ubuntu
2. Open a firefox extension that has the datepicker/timepicker controls (the one I used is not yet published. I am not its author).
3. See how the timepicker/datepicker look.
Actual Results:  
We see that the timepicker has no AM/PM selection
Also, the datepicker displays a random "October" in it, irreespective of the month selected in the datepicker.

Expected Results:  
Expected results are seen on Windows Vista (on the same version of firefox): neither the datepicker nor the timepicker have anything unuasual. AM/PM is present, and the extraneous "October" is not.
