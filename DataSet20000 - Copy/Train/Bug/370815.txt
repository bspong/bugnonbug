Clicking a PDF link causes Firefox to spawn multiple blank windows unceasingly

Anytime a PDF link is clicked, Firefox automatically downloads the file in Download Manager and opens it in Preview.  Firefox also spawns an unending number of Firefox windows.  The CPU usage goes to 100%, I cannot get back to my original window, and I must use Force Quit and restart Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on a link to a PDF file.
Actual Results:  
PDF file completes downloading in Download Manager, and it opens in Preview.  Continually, blank Firefox windows are opened and I must use Force Quit and restart Firefox.

Expected Results:  
PDF downloads in Download Manager and opens in Preview, with no additional Firefox windows opening.

I disabled all extensions and the bug still exists.

Possibly the same bug as 366977, in which case the user had the same problem with .SWF files.

When I reopen Firefox and Download Manager, I can click the PDF file and it will open in Preview without opening any additional Firefox windows.  The bug seems to only exist when originally downloading the file.
