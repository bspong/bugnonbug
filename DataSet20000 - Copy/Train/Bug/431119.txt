If I try to drag the site icon or the current tab into the bookmarks toolbar folder by dragging it over the overflow chevron and then placing it in the resulting list, the bookmark is not placed and is lost.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Drag site icon or tab onto overflow chevron on bookmarks toolbar
2. Do not let go of mouse button, waiting until overflow list appears
3. Move mouse downwards until an insertion point appears indicating it is safe to place the item here
4. Let go of the mouse button to place the bookmark
Actual Results:  
When checking the list a second time, it is clear the bookmark didn't get made.  Cannot find the bookmark anywhere.

Expected Results:  
Should make a bookmark

This bug is subtly different to all of the recent similar bugs.  In this incarnation, which only started being a problem within the last few days, the overflow list does open and the insertion point does appear, and it's only the act of dropping the item into the list that fails.

Possible data loss issue: it appears that you have bookmarked something, and you get positive feedback that you have, and it isn't clear until later that it wasn't bookmarked.
