alt-enter behavior in URL bar/location bar is idiosyncratic with multiple keywords

When I type a keyword into the location bar and hit enter, firefox does the following until it finds a working URL:
a. performs a DNS lookup
b. searches for bookmark keywords
c. performs a search using the keyword.URL setting

The same pattern holds when I type in _multiple_ keywords and hit enter, as well as when I type in a single keyword and hit _alt_-enter.

When I type in multiple keywords and hit alt-enter, however, firefox attempts only a and b, never c. If it can't find a bookmark keyword it gives the error message, "The URL is not valid and cannot be loaded."

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. type in 'foo bar' into the location bar (no quotes, 2 separate words)
2. hit alt-enter
Actual Results:  
alert("The URL is not valid and cannot be loaded.")

Expected Results:  
depending on keyword.URL, something like:

a) open a google search for 'foo bar', or
b) done an I'm feeling lucky search and gone to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_bar, or
c) ..

Relevant discussion, perhaps: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=237027 (That was the closest bug I could find)

Boundary condition: set Tools/Options/Main/Startup/When Firefox starts to 'Show a blank page'. Restart. Now type something, anything into the location bar and hit alt-enter. No response.

This only happens when there's only one tab, it has no history and no open page. It's arguably reasonable. However, it interfered with my diagnosis of this situation - it took me a while to realize that behavior was different in the boundary condition. Just in case somebody else tends to open browser at about:blank and runs into this issue.

IIRC this change happened with some automatic firefox update last November, before that things were fine. My workaround since then has been to use a keyboard shortcut for a bookmark (?) for the same behavior. I finally got around to confirming it wasn't a conflict with some extension before filing it here.
