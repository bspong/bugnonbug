A white area with the dimensions of 150 px in height by 482 pixels in width appears in all browser windows after system sleeps.

Usually I will have multiple pages open for later reference.  I will leave my
laptop on playing a playlist in Audion.  Everything is hidden except the desktop.

After a while, the system will sleep, either because it's out of power, or
because an hour has passed.  When I wake up later and reactivate the laptop, all
open pages have this white area in them (top left-hand corner of the screen).

Tried refreshing the pages, but the blank area would not go away.

Also, there were no applications open at the time that had any windows open in
that area of the screen.

To get rid of the problem, I restarted the browser; next time, I'll simply try
closing all tabs and see if that does anything.

This has happened twice now since I installed the new build.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open several tabbed web pages in Firefox (perhaps add another window with
it's own tabs as well)
2.  Create a playlist in Audion and play it (I was using old Coast to Coast AM
shows)
3.  Allow system to sleep
4.  Revive system after an hour or so

Actual Results:  
I have not used these steps per se, but that is what I did when the problem
initially arose (twice now).

Expected Results:  
Firefox 1.06 simply displays the page without that white area.

The build I'm using does not have any themes installed.

System information:  14" Macintosh G4 iBook with 768MB of RAM, running MacOSX
10.3.9.

Tomorrow I plan to upgrade the RAM to 1GB; should the problem still occur, I
will add a comment (after closing all windows before restarting the browser,
that is).
