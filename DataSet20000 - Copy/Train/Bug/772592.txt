Firefox crashes due to allocating maximum memory (2.2GB+) after switching resolutions in Youtube video player

Steps to reproduce:

This is a constant issue in the last days, but has happened randomly at other times in the past. 
My current isp seems to have some issues with their caching servers or whatever they do, so this issue appears almost on a daily basis now.

Basically when I watch a video on Youtube, it starts by default at 360p or 480p and the player buffers up to a point and then it stops. This point is random, sometimes it's 10 minutes within a video, other times it's 20-30 minutes in it.

When the playback reaches that point, invariably Youtube's player fails to reconnect to the stream so I'm forced to select another resolution from the bottom right corner of the player. This works every time - Youtube picks another download location and finishes the stream at the higher resolution.

Probably every 6-10 videos I watch in a session, the moment the video transfer starts, the main firefox process memory increases, as if the whole video is kept in its memory. 
With 30-40 minutes at 720p or 1080i/p, this is enough for the firefox process to reach over 2 GB of memory. 

The other processes, plugincontainer and flashplayer show normal memory usages 10-60 MB of memory.

In some cases, I can predict firefox will crash by hearing the hard drive starting to swap a lot (the system only has 4 GB of memory installed) so by killing plugincontainer or Flashplayer I can make Firefox recover (the page will say the plugin has crashed) and memory decreases back to normal values (200-400 MB).


Actual results:


watching sd stream on Youtube, times out after a while, switching to a HD resolution resumes stream.
Not always but often enough to be annoying, firefox.exe's memory consumption increases in tandem with the actual new stream's transfer speed, until firefox crashes due to using over 2 GB of memory. 


Expected results:

Firefox shouldn't start using memory all of the sudden, should fail more gracefully. 
At the very least a 64bit version should be made available to alleviate this issue
