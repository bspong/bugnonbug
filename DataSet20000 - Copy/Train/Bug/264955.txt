FFox 1.0RC1 crash upon 3+ open tabs
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041017 Firefox/1.0

When having more than 2-3 tabs open in firefox 1.0 rc1 and opening a new
succeeding tab, the browser freezes upon opening. This only occurs when a new
tab is opened that is directly correlated with a web link. On my machine, the
freeze then eats up 48000 K of memory in task manager until it is stopped and
the browser is reopened.

Did not have this problem on the .10.1 release.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox and about 2-3 tabs with sites in each tab.
2. Try right clicking on a link in any tab and going to "open link in new tab".
3. Broswer freezes upon opening of 4th or 5th tab - eats up around 50000k of
memory when frozen.
4. The firefox process must be ended in order to relaunch a new window.

Actual Results:  
Brower freezes up and must be stopped in task manager in order to continue using
firefox.

Expected Results:  
The broswer should be able to open as many tabs as you wish without freezing.
This problem was not present in the 1.0 preview final release. Only occurs with
1.0 RC1.

No extra extensions or themes are being used with firefox on my machine. I was
only running etrust antivirus 7.1, ATI tray tools, and fraps at the time.
