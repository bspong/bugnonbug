Firefox doesn't remember toolbar layout after it's closed nor in a new opened window

When I set up toolbars to custom layout, next time I open Firefox it's different. Then I need to right-click, click Customize and then Done so they restore to the normal state.

It is best that you reffer to the screenshot (either to the URL or attachment) to see what is it about. It is easier that explaining with words.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox and Maximize it.
2. Right-click on any of the toolbars and click Customize...
3. Place Bookmark items right after Help menu.
4. Place the Search text-box after Bookmarks.
5. Ensure that you have just enough Bookmark items so that Search box width is "nice". (cca 190 pixels)
6. Close Firefox and open it again.
Actual Results:  
The Bookmarks are all squezed into one icon (>>) and Search box is huge. That doesn't happen only when I open application, but also in every new opened window.

Expected Results:  
The toolbar should stay like it was before closing Firefox. It worked well with version 3.0
