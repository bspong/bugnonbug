The properties positions are moved to the left in the Manifest Editor
Reproduces on:
latest Aurora (20140224004003)
 Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:29.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/29.0
latest Nightly (20140224030203)
 Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:30.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/30.0

Doesn't reproduce on latest Firefox 28 beta 4.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open about:app-manager page
2. Add a packaged app (download and unzip from https://github.com/mjschranz/webmaker-ffos)
3. Expand a property and move the mouse over the add / remove buttons

Expected results:
The properties are correctly displayed.

Actual results:
The properties values are moved to the left (visual artifact). Expanding another top level object will result in moving it's values to the left while the values for the properties previously expanded will be displayed correctly. Collapsing an object will reproduce the issue again. 

Notes: 
1. The issue also reproduces on Ubuntu 32-bit and Mac OS 10.9
2. The issue is a regression
