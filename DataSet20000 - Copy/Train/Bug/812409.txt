Firefox performance issue
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:16.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/16.0
Build ID: 20121025210744

Steps to reproduce:

Comparing performance using CraigslistFusion script (Greasemonkey) here:

http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/57662

Version 9.0 of the script, between Firefox 16.0.2 and Chromium 20.0.1132.47, I see that scroll during loading of large list (with images) in Chromium is much smoother and more responsive (easier on the eyes), the listing appears to be consistently completed loading quicker.  It seems not only JavaScript is what needed to be looked into, but rendering also matter greatly.  For example, in testing, I created a page that JS generates 50,000 rows of random data (text length of 100 characters)  in an HTML table (with dynamic DOM node additions).  The JS completes quickly in Firefox (using JS code to measure time of completion), but the page finishes rendering much longer than that (measures by waiting to see a popup alert at the end of the rendering).  Chromium is much faster on the rendering of the page, even it's not much faster with Javascript.  What this means is that focus on JS performance is only 50% of the equation.


Actual results:

Is not as smooth or quick in rendering large page


Expected results:

Should render faster and smoother.
