Text input element becomes unresponsive to text input
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.8; rv:19.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/19.0
Build ID: 20130307023931

Steps to reproduce:

Click the input field to gain focus THEN select the text in the input field.  Typing does nothing then.

I was able to reproduce this with an absolutely positioned div containing an input element absolutely positioned over top of a ustream video embedded inside of an iframe.

A succinct example in HTML is below.

<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<div style="position: absolute;">
  <input type="text" value="I'm giving her all she's got, Captain!" />
</div>
<iframe width="600" height="369"
src="http://www.ustream.tv/embed/13561842?v=3&amp;wmode=direct"
scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: 0px none transparent;">
</iframe>

Actual results:

I cannot enter text into the input element, nor delete the text inside the input element.


Expected results:

I should be able to delete and enter text inside of a text input element.
