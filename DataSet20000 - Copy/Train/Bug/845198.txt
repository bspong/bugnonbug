Firefox keep asking to be the default browser even if I uncheck the checkbox to avoid it to check when starting
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:18.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/18.0
Build ID: 20130116073211

Steps to reproduce:

Under Windows 7, Firefox version 18.0.1
I have Chrome and Internet Explorer also installed.

I don't want to use that fucking, buggy, unconvenient, slow and ugly Firefox, but I'm obliged to for some reasons. Anyway I really don't want it to be my default browser.

But most of all I don't want FF to check if it is the default browser because it is not and it won't never be on my computer.

BUT no matter if I check/uncheck the checkbox "check if FuckingFox is the default browser at startup" in the poping window A.K.A menu Tools > Options > Advanced > System > "Always check at startup that FuckingFox is the default browser", it always check and popup the window at startup.

You guys when you tested your feature only test that it works when FuckingFox is the default browser, and I'm sure you never test when it is NOT the default browser.

Fix your shit!


Actual results:

FF alsways check if it is the default browser even if I don't want him to check, then it is poping his annoying popup window.


Expected results:

Stop checking if FF is the default browser or not if the checkbox Tools > Options > Advanced > System > "Always check at startup that FuckingFox is the default browser" is unchecked.
