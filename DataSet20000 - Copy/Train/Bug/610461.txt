Sites with advertising give repeated errors for "xpcom_core.dll file not found."

Sites with advertising (Flash or Shockwave, I believe) give repeated errors for "xpcom_core.dll file not found."

I've tried uninstalling Firefox many times, and it never fixes the problem.

I checked the user group postings, and 42 people report that they have this same issue.  if 42 report it, I have to think that 42,000 must have the problem.  I've had it for at least a year.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a site with advertising.  AOL.com, for example.
2. For each instance of a Flash ad (guessing; basically, ads with animation), I get an error message.
3. Uninstalling (but keeping user settings), and then re-installing should take care of the problem.
Actual Results:  
Uninstalling and re-installing had no effect.

Expected Results:  
Uninstalling and re-installing had no effect.

My understanding - from the following link - is that this problem goes back to Firefox 2.0.0.x.

"The file xpcom_core.dll was last used in Firefox 2.0.0.x versions and is no longer present and used in current Firefox versions.
You seem to have a program or an add-on that is still looking for that file.
You will have to uninstall that program."
