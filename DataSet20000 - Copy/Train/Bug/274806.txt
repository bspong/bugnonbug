Missing drop-down list capability in Firefox vs. IE6
Using Internet Explorer on a Microsoft Sharepoint based site called Teamcenter
Community (specific url is
http://mycommunity.ugs.com/customers/GD/Marine/EB/Shared......) there is a
dropdown list that appears when hovering over a document name in a document
list.  I presume that this is a client-side app of some sort.  

When using Using Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5)
Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0  on the same url the drop-down list does not appear.  

I have viewed the source code and will append it to the end of this bug report.  

This is the only obstacle I have to using Firefox.  Not because of the cosmetic
aspect of the drop-down list, but because this is the only way for me to access
and edit documents in this sharepoint site.

Here is the html code of the web page in question:

<td class="ms-vb" width="100%">
											<a onfocus="OnLink(this)"
onclick="DispDocItemEx(this,'FALSE','FALSE','TRUE','SharePoint.OpenDocuments.2')"
href="http://mycommunity.ugs.com/customers/GD/Marine/EB/Shared%20Documents/EB%20CAD%20Evaluation/Phase%201%20-%20RFPI/2004%20December%203rd%20Meeting%20Action%20items/Action%20Item%20List.doc">
											Action Item List</a></td>
											<td>
