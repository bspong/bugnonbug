With VAN extension installed and enabled, For web pages like gmail, cnn, google news, and http://www.universetoday.com/2008/05/18/comments-on-no-doomsday-in-2012/, firefox freezes for seconds to minutes, if you click to activate the tab. The firefox will crash many times a day for the same reason. I disabled all extensions one by one, and finally isolate the problem to this extension. Please note that VAN is also the trouble maker that made Chrome crash when Chrome first came out.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Citibank VAN
2. go to page http://www.universetoday.com/2008/05/18/comments-on-no-doomsday-in-2012/
3. open a new tab and use cnn.com
4. come back to the first tab, and try to scroll the page
5. Watch the CPU utilization. if you have multicore, you should see a lot of activities on one core.
Actual Results:  
web page freezes for seconds to minutes. Sometimes it unfreezes and sometimes it crashes

Expected Results:  
You should be able to scroll the page freely as soon as you move to the tab without freezing.

Citibank developers suck. The caused problem for both Chrome and Firefox.
