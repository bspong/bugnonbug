on my home computer, I cannot download a jpg from either dowload or view options
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/525.19 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/1.0.154.48 Safari/525.19
Build Identifier: Firefox 3.0.6

If I choose 'view all' from within an Gmail email WITH MORE THAN ONE jpg attachment, I can right click to download individual jpgs. BUT if an email has ONLY ONE jpg, and I try to download from the 'download' option OR right-clicking the image that opens from the 'view' option, any jpg gets renamed as "mail.google" and is unopenable - even if I rename it and re=enter the extension.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In Gmail, choose an email with a SINGLE jpg attachment.
2. Either select a) the 'download' option or b) the 'view' option and right-click for a download
3.
Actual Results:  
Every downloaded jpg is renamed as "mail.google" and LOSES its extension so that it is unopenable EVEN IF the extension .jpg is re-added to the end of file name. (This glitch only happened after the most recent Firefox update during the past week.)

Expected Results:  
the jpg should have retained the name that it appears with as the attachment in the email and should be openable

The above downloading procedure works as expected in both Internet Explorer and Chrome browsers. It works in Firefox with an email that has more than one jpg atttachemnt AS LONG AS I use the 'view all' option first. It works on my Firefox browser at work, though at work I have not updated Firefox and I have fewer ADD-ONS installed. The ADD-ONS I have installed at home have been installed for the last 4 months and are highly recommended ADD-ONS.
