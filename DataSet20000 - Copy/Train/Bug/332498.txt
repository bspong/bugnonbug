modifier-clicking url proxy icon (favicon) should duplicate tab, copy tab to new window, save tab, etc. (using middle/ctrl/shift/alt clicks)
Currently clicking on the back, forward or home buttons with certain modifiers opens the relevant URL in a different way (new tab, window, save, etc.). These special ways of opening URLs would be useful if applied to the current page too, and would provide a means of performing several frequently requested functionalities.

Currently:
  * Clicking the url proxy icon selects all text in the location bar (whether or not any modifiers are used or the middle mouse button was used)
  * Hovering over the url proxy icon causes the cursor to become a grab hand.

I propose the following changes:
  * Middle/Ctrl-clicking it opens the current page in a new selected tab
  * Shift-clicking it opens the current page in a new window
  * Shift+Middle/Ctrl-clicking it opens the current page in a new background tab
  * Alt-clicking it saves the current page
  * When hovered it just looks like a bookmarks toolbar item, so it is clear that it can be clicked but also reasonably intuitive that it can be dragged. The cursor would be unchanged, which would actually be more consistent with other UI elements and programs.

The code and reasoning for choosing which action (already used by the back, forward and home buttons) is here:

This is a split of bug 263942, after discussing that one with timeless on IRC he suggested that it would make much more sense for the functionality to be added to the url proxy icon instead of the reload button.
