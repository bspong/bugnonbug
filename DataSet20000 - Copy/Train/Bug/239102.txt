Hyperlink to form page doesn't work from within the same form page

I have a server-side Tcl program that manages a form.  When you first go to it,
you go there without any query elements in the URL.  It displays the form.  You
put some data into some of the form fields and submit the form; the METHOD is
"post" and the ACTION is the same URL as the form.  When the page receives the
HTTP request, it realizes that there's some query data there, so it processes
the query.  Depending on the form, it may or may not redisplay the form --
that's not important here.  What's important is that it does display a simple
hyperlink to the form's URL, without any query elements.  If you click on this
link, the browser should reload the page without any query elements.  But
instead, it thinks it's already there, so it does nothing.

Mozilla 1.6 and Internet Exploder 6 both handle this situation correctly.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to my sample page
2. Enter some text in the input form field
3. Press the Send button.
4. You'll get an invitation to click a hyperlink to restart the whole process.
5. Click it.
6. Nothing happens.

Actual Results:  
The browser does nothing instead of reloading the webpage without query data.

Expected Results:  
It should have reloaded the webpage with no query data, returning the user to
the beginning of the whole process.
