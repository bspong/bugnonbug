Confirm (OK) does not trigger containing javascript (non-reproducible)

Sometimes, on the given page, and some more pages that the confirm dialog box is needed the pressing of (OK) doesn't call the javascript function contained;
if (confirm("Are you sure you want to remove this person from your selection?")) {
    			alert("deleting user");}
Alert or any other javascript function contained by the confirm function is not called;
I tried clearing all files, cookies, session - the confirm function is not calling anything untill I restart the browser;
Restarting the browser clears the problem;
The occurence is very rare, 
The error console is not issuing any error on specified problem;

In the given page you have to execute a search, make a few selections then click on the small thumbs on the right side of the page to clear desired selected people from your selection...
The confirm function should clear that person from current selection - sometimes, after I press OK - nothing happens;
Three different coputers running the same version of firefox encountered this problem - all of them have been upgarded from previous versions - none has a clean install of the current version - thougt this might be relevant....
