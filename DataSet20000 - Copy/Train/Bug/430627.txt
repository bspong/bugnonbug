Remove open search notification in primary UI
I've been thinking about open search discovery, and I'm pretty sure I think it is simply a bad idea to begin with.  If the user wants to add a search engine, they might go to the menu to check if it is available, or they might go to a list of all available engines, but I don't think we should improve the discoverability of the possibility, because odds are the user won't care to begin with and the notification is just capturing their attention needlessly the vast majority of the time.  I think we should remove the visual cue on the search button on all platforms.  Right now the user might notice the cue reasonably often, but only actually act on the cue three or four times during the entire life cycle of using the browser.

People will likely criticize this change saying "it is important that I am able to see that that a search engine is available, in case I want to add it." I believe that notifications have a cost of momentarily wasting the user's time, and it is only worth going through with the notification if there is a reasonable chance that the user is going to act on it.  In my opinion, adding a search engine doesn't pass the bar of reasonable chance of action.

This very likely won't get addressed for Firefox 3, but I wanted to get the bug filed in case we consider it for the next release.
