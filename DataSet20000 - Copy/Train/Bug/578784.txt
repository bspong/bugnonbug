Full Screen mode video with Firefox 3.63 works perfectly fine in ESPN3.com and www.tudou.com. After updating to Firefox 3.64 and 3.66, switching to full screen mode video becomes a blank black screen. I am now stucked with a small square screen to watch any video.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Watch full screen video with Firefox 3.6.3 on espn3.com or www.tudou.com and everything works perfect.
2. Update Firefox to 3.64 or 3.66 and switch to full screen mode to watch video again on espn3.com or www.tudou.com and you will get a black blank screen with nothing. The only way to watch video is to use the original screen side to watch video.
3. I think it is regression issue caused by the 3.64 update
Actual Results:  
Cannot watch video in full screen mode after updating to Firefox 3.64 or 3.66 version.

Expected Results:  
I should still be able to watch full screen video in Firefox 3.64 and above without any problems or crashes.

My video screen did not crash so far. It is just that I cannot watch video in full screen mode on Firefox 3.64 and above.
