bookmark folder name with quotation marks silently causes the backup file to be unloadable

When backing up the bookmark file, the user receives no warning that anything is amiss. 

Upon attempting to restore the bookmark backup json, the console receives this message:

*** unwrapNodes(): JSON.decode(): [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIJSON.decode]"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: file:///usr/local/lib/firefox-3.0b5pre/modules/utils.js :: PU_unwrapNodes :: line 529"  data: no]

The GUI silently fails; no bookmarks are loaded from the file, but there is no error message in the GUI.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a bookmark folder with the quotation character (") in the folder name
2. Bookmarks -> Organize bookmarks -> Import and Backup -> Backup...
3. Try to load the .json backup file that you created into a clean firefox (Bookmarks -> Organize bookmarks -> Import and Backup -> Restore...)
Actual Results:  
(see "details", above)

Expected Results:  
The backup should be able to be used, of course.

It is also bad that there is no error message in the GUI. Also, it would have been nice if the error message had been more informative than "PU_unwrapNodes :: line 529".


This is a scary bug because the user thinks they have backups but the backups won't work.
