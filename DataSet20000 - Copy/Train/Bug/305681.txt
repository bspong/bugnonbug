What should happen: when mousing over small images at bottom, large image
changes (along with text) to match smaller image, but smaller images SHOULD NOT
MOVE. In Safari 2 (Mac OS X) and IE 6 (Windows 2000) this works as expected:
large image changes, smaller images do not move.  In FireFox (1.0.6 for both)
large images changes as expected, but smaller images jump around as follows:
After load, if mouse over left small image, all small images move down about
1em; When mousing over left then center then right, small images move down by a
large amount (height of image?).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load page http://www.boxorox.com/webdesign/examples/artsale/index2.html 
2.Mouse over (from above) left small image (small images jump down about 1em)
3.Mouse from left to right across all small images (small images jump down
significantly)

Actual Results:  
Small images move vertically, first a small amount, then a large amount

Expected Results:  
Small images should not move at all.
