A mix of right to left and left to right fonts gives scramled text.

Now, I'm not sure if this is actually a bug in Firefox or the webserver
(somehow). But watching the text on this page
<http://www.shacknews.com/ja.zz?id=8855524> with Firefox 1.0PR will show you
text that seems very scrambled. The same page in IE6 looks ok and both browsers
got a source that corresponds to what's being displayed. The spoky parts comes
when you copy the text into notepad (from Firefox -> completely normal) and if
you paste it into Word and blow up the fontsize you can see the differences in
the obfuscated parts.

Of course, this is a spam, so I'm guessing it's a technique used to confuse spam
filters, but I thought it might be interesting to see this, especially as it
might possibly be abused in some way (that I cannot think of). I can't see
anything in the source that would cause this, so I have no idea how it works
(the obfuscated parts isn't enclosed in their own tags or anything).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
View enclosed link.
Actual Results:  
Scrambled / obfuscated text

Expected Results:  
Not sure what I'd expect. Unobfuscated text? Indication that text has been
obfuscated? Ignoring the text completely.
