I'm getting an intermittent problem with the way mouse left-button clicks are
handled.
Sometimes I click on a link and nothing happens. When this happens I have to
hold the button down and release it and then the browser follows the link. I
even get this problem sometimes with your "O" icon just below the titlebar close
button. (Which should load the "firefox central" page.)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click on a link
2. nothing happens
3. press, hold, release    mouse button down when that happens


Actual Results:  
sometimes I have to hold the mouse button down and release it then it follows
the link (press, hold, release)

Expected Results:  
follow the link immediately after the button click

I have the Intellimouse software installed and the middle mouse button is
configured for a double-click. The left button is always set for normal
operation. Firefox is the only application that has this problem - all other
applications handle left-clicks OK.

This issue doesn't relate to middle-click or right-click buttons.
