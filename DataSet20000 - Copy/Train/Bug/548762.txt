Installing plugin to one instance restarts all instances of Firefox without confirmation; tabs not saved

Hi, this is an untypical scenario, but anyway:
I had started Firefox as user with no administrative priviledges when I found out that I should update one plugin. So I started another Firefox ("Run as..." Administrator) and installed the plugin from a local file.
Then I selected "Restart Firefox", and I was surprised that the other instance of Firefox (with multiple tabs open) also had been terminated. Furthrmosre, the newly started instances did no run as Administrator (as expected).
When trying to clean up, I closed the window with the multiple tabs first, and to my surprise there was no prompt whether I's like to save the tab layout (the other window just had one tab with an empty page). When closing the other window as well, my saved tabs were all gone (I had this tab setup for several weeks).

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a Firefox as non-priviledged user
2. Open another Firefox as priviledged user
3. Install some extension (plugin) for all users (i.e. try to do that)
4. Click on "Restart Firefox" for the instance that runs in administrative mode
Actual Results:  
All instances of Firefox terminate (restart)
When terminating a window with multiple tabs, the choice to save the tab layout is not presented

Expected Results:  
Only the instance that had a new plugin installed should restart
When closing a window with multiple tabs (while another window is open), the layout of that window should be savable, even if another window is still open

Excuse for describing two issues in one report, but maybe that are related.
