Firefox closes after I click the Mozilla Firefox icon on desktop and wait 30-60 seconds.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 GTB5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 GTB5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When I start my computer, when it's not completely loaded (booted up), I open Mozilla Firefox and wait couple of seconds (30-60 seconds). After it opens, it immediately closes with no error messages and I have to open it again.

It mostly happens when I try to open Firefox, but I still have to wait and I double-click it for the second time, two Firefox instances opens and instantly closes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Boot up your PC
2. Before EVERY application loads (like MSN or Yahoo! Messengers), open Mozilla Firefox
3. If it doesn't open within 10 seconds, double-click it again
4. If two Firefoxes opens, they should close themselves immediately.
Actual Results:  
I waited a couple of seconds and reopened it.

Expected Results:  
It should open both Mozilla Firefox and let me close one of them.

I used the original Firefox theme, my computer is tweaked correctly, even my brother has the same problem on his computer. Homepage is Google of course, (I have google.hr, he has google.hr/firefox).
