Animated gifs take the CPU to 100%

Currently using Win-XP,SP3  with a 1.1GHz Athlon (and plenty o' RAM!) 
  
I have noticed with many websites, that animated gifs frequently drive Firefox to grab all remaining CP power, and the system slows down considerably. 
 The Firefox.exe process in task list goes to 92% (or whatever the system-idle precess was using before)

  When I kill the tab, or press esc to stop animation, the WinXp will resume normally.

If I try the same animated gif in IE7, and after all other tasks have quiesced, the IE7 will draw no more than 50-60% and leave me with about 30% system-idle, ready for other tasks.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Win Taskmanager
2. Show an animated gif in Firefox 2.0.0.14
3. after checking taskmanager kill the tab/page.
4. Try the same url in IE7.
5. Check Taskmanager.
6. Profit! (at least for Microsoft)
Actual Results:  
I stopped FF2 and resumed page(s) with IE7.  System resumed normally.

Expected Results:  
 At least brought FF7 down to 70% of CPU, leaving me with some slack....
