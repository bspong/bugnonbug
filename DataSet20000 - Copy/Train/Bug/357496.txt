Whien displaying video, the audio plays for a few seconds, then cuts out.

While viewing video files at Gamespot.com, the audio and video proceed for a little bit before cutting out. The video continues, while the audio stops. This does not occur while viewing MOV and MPG files on other web pages, but videos through Gamespot have this problem. It may be how they handle the embedding, or it may be that the files I'm trying to view are WMV files (which I think is what's going on.) 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on one of the links to a video file at the site I've given you the URL to. (It looks like a little bit of film strip)
2. Let the video load.
3. Watch it.

Actual Results:  
The video buffered and loaded (note, don't expect to see the controls at the bottom of the screen, that's not how it shows up on Gamespot in Firefox), and played. However, after a few seconds (4-7) the audio cuts out entirely, while the video continues.

Expected Results:  
The software should have done everything it did, except the audio should have continued playing, in sync with the video.
