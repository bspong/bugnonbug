firefox 1.5.0.1 hung when trying to use after machine had been idle, windows and tabs respond, can be selected and toggled, minimised, maximised, and most can be closed (see my other bug for details of the menu functions and the final window). web page links, however, do not respond in any way, nor does the back, forward and reload buttons. data cannot be entered into the address bar, nor can new windows/tabs be opened, but curiously most can be closed. scrol bars and menus continue to function, except for links (history, bookmarks, etc). unable to use and unable to exit cleanly (task only exited with a forced-quit)

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
Couldnt reproduce as had no way of knowing how this occured, firefox had been running fine, with no obvious signs of trouble before machine was idle. machine had been idle and asleep several times with no ill effects.




Bug #325187 may be related to this as occured at the same time, although Bug #325187 has occured previously in unconnected issues.
