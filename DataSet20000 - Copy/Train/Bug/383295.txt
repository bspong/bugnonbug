Adding a window in the toolbar that shows the domain of the visited page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Help the user to identify it's service provider

Hi, I work for a bank to develop web applications. I think that an urgent change is due to navigators to better fight fishings. After thinking of it, I understood that the problem of phishing is not a client authentification problem, it's a provider's authentification to the client problem. The biggest difficulty that I have to show to beginners (to witch I always install Firefox by the way) is how to read the URL to identify it's domain. Then, after looking at a new software from Verisign, I realised that it would be easy for you to show the visited DOMAIN in a widget apart, in the tool bar of Firefox. When the domain is not available, then the IP adress is shown, and the background of this widget becomes red, with an error message in a bubble. I think that this solution is easy to implement, and would be a fast way to improve the capabilities of ordinary people to authentify their providers.

Since it's a security issue, I felt I also had to send a similar request to Microsoft for it's Internet Explorer.
