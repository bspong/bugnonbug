Add telemetry probe for master password usage
Created attachment 8428941
The patch which caused the xperf failure

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1013448 +++

This will help us better estimate how many users have master password enabled.

The patch from bug 1013448 caused xperf test failures:

00:38:30     INFO -  TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL : xperf: File '{profile}\secmod.db' was accessed and we were not expecting it.  DiskReadCount: 6, DiskWriteCount: 0, DiskReadBytes: 16904, DiskWriteBytes: 0

00:38:30     INFO -  TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL : xperf: File '{profile}\cert8.db' was accessed and we were not expecting it.  DiskReadCount: 4, DiskWriteCount: 0, DiskReadBytes: 33288, DiskWriteBytes: 0

00:38:30     INFO -  TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL : xperf: File '{profile}\key3.db' was accessed and we were not expecting it.  DiskReadCount: 4, DiskWriteCount: 0, DiskReadBytes: 8712, DiskWriteBytes: 0

because we were querying the master-password state as part of delayedStartup, causing these reads.

I'm wondering if there is a way to avoid this additional IO completely - eg, move the probe closer to the security modules, and write the probe once we are already doing the IO for other reasons (eg, to read a password).

Dolske, any thoughts?
