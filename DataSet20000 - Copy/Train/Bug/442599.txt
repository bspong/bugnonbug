Program crashes indiscriminately without rhyme or reason or anything that would serve as a precursor to the crash.

After each 'crash' your message window would appear requesting information as to the cause.  I completed this section several times, but due to the number of crashes and their duplicity I begin to simply send the notices with blank spaces.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load the FireFox Browser and begin using it.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
There is no way for me to report any actual facts as there is no warning prior to the crash.  Varies in terms of time before crash or nature of operation during crash.

Expected Results:  
What? Starting the browser for general use? I begin using, such as now, and after a period of use program would crash.

What should the software have done instead (of crashing)??  Operated as promised and in same manner as previous versions - without indiscriminate crashes. Best of luck in locating the problem as I really favor Fire Fox for browsing.  For now I will just keep 'firing it up' after each crash and continue using, but...
