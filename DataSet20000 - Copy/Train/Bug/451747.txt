[Mac] Firefox won't open in 3.01; it opens in version 2.0.0.4.; I have to quit it and re-open the dmg download in order to get 3.0.1, always
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070206 Firefox/3.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070206 Firefox/3.0.1

I updated with 3.0.1 dmg. Everytime I shut down my computer and click onto the FF icon, version 2.0.0.4 pops up to open.  I "forcequit" 2.0.0.4 and send to trash; then re-open the 3.0.1 dmg, which opens right into that version and full functionality.  Then, next time I shut down and reopen same thing, 2.0.0.4 pops up and I must repeat.  How can I eliminate 2.0.0.4? I have searched the harddrive (intel mac Mini) to find where it is to remove it and cannot find any version to remove.  This is too many steps to open Firefox.  It should automatically be 3.0.1 after so many re-installs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.click re-open, or icon
2.when 2.0.0.4 opens, forcequit and trash it
3.reinstall 3.0.1
Actual Results:  
I get my functionality; but, do not want to do this everytime I start my computer.

Expected Results:  
Version 3.0.1 should open; not 2.0.0.4

This problem does not exist on my Powerbook, which is pre-intel chip.  It is only on the newer macMini with 1.66 GHz Intel Core Duo processor, 2 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM that I have this problem.  Both are Tiger version 10.4.11
