Bookmark panel doesn't immediately update fields when I open it, causing distracting text movement

Second scenario, by reporter.png

I have a problem with Firefox Beta 52, Beta 53. It happens on Nightly 55. Doesn't happen in Firefox ESR 45, Release 51.
Sometimes (always, it seems) when I open bookmark panel, its fields (namely "Name", "Folder", "Tags") update after the panel is shown, causing distracting text movement.
These 2 scenarios demonstrate the bug

First:
1. Open https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1345479 in a new ("first") tab, bookmark it with name "1".
2. Open https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1344309 in a new ("second") tab, bookmark it.
3. Assuming that the last time you opened bookmark panel in "second" tab, switch to "first" tab and press Ctrl+D.

Result: In the field "Name" the name of the 2nd bookmark is briefly displayed, but then it's replaced with "1"
Expected: All fields should initially display information related to current page


Second:
1. Open new window, open url https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1345479#1029392
2. Press Ctrl+D

Result: Initially "Page bookmarked" panel appears without any fields, then all fields appear
Expected: All fields should initially be displayed
