Data loss issue or wrongly labeled "Delete This Page"

Applies to websites with multiple webpages, like webshops.

While browsing through history, I wanted to check every page I visited before on a certain website. However each page's title was the same. So I wanted to remove the history entries of said website I revisited, so I don't revisit them twice or not at all. The most logical option seemed "Delete This Page". When I did this, the history of all pages of that website went missing, and moreover, all evidence that I ever visited the site seems have been removed (cookies, shopping basket contents, closed tabs, etc).

I can't figure out what this action is supposed to do because the general help is unavailable. "Delete This Page" apparently does the same as "Forget about this site".

So either this 'feature' is gravely mislabeled (starting with the definitions of Website and Webpage (see wikipedia if you are not sure)) or it does all kinds of things it's not supposed to.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a website (like Archonia.com) where different pages have the same title.
2. Browse several of those pages (in case of Archonia.com, the search result pages)
3. Go to history and notice several pages with the same name.
4. Right-click on a history page and with the intention of removing only that entry from the history, click "Delete This Page".
Actual Results:  
All history entries from Archonia.com, all cookies of that site and all closed tabs with that page (and maybe more) have been removed.

Expected Results:  
The right-clicked entry removed is from the history, and nothing else has been removed.
