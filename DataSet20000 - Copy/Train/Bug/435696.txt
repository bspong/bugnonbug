This is fairly complex, but when playing a yahoo game (I typically play spades) and an alert window pops up, firefox locks up.  It behaves very much like a semaphore has been grabbed but not released.  I do not see this problem on IE, but have not tried it on other browsers.  FF also had this problem in the 2.x versions.  The easiest way to reproduce this is to start a game and then get booted it.  This seems to lock it up at greater than 80%.  A yahoo account is required to play a game.  Two ids and two machines would be required for the first to boot the second after creating a table.  I've wondered if the problem could be in Java as I'm sure the yahoo games use Java, but all FF windows lock up.  I have not tried on Linux, that would be worth trying.



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Two users with yahoo ids.  1st starts sades game so the s/he is owner of game.
2.Second comes to table.
3.First boots second, must be owner of game.

Actual Results:  
FF windows for second lock up.

Expected Results:  
Locked up FF windows, not responsive.
