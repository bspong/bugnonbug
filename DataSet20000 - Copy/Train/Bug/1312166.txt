Steps to reproduce:

Calling the page "https://www.computerbase.de/". The page loads, but there are problems with some areas:

"Notizen"
"Neue Tests"
"Leserartikel"
"Im Fokus"

Tested with
Firefox 52.0a1 auf Windows 7 64-bit (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0) - default browser
Firefox 49.0.2 auf Windows 10 32-bit

It currently works with 
Firefox 49.0.2 auf Windows 7 64-bit (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:49.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/49.0)

A new profile has not solved the problem.


Actual results:

On the page there is a problem with the JavaScript execution of the next buttons. Furthermore the images are not always loaded (see screenshot). A refresh of the page is required to fix the problem with the images. but it does not solve the problem with the next buttons.


Expected results:

All images on the page must be loaded and all buttons must work without reloading of the page.
