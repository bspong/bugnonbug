(I've got my history set to 50 days)

Pulling up a list of Google results (say "Test" for example), and middle clicking through a page of them used to turn the clicked links immediately purple.

In my beta browser, Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.1b3) Gecko/20090305 Firefox/3.1b3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) , the links don't change colour until I refresh the page, or close and open it again.
Left clicking a link to visit a new page and then clicking "Back" also doesn't update the links colours.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a page with lots of links. ( e.g. http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=test&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&client=firefox-a )

2. Middle click a few of the links.

3. Observe the lack of link colour change.

Also:

4. Left click on a link to visit that page.

5. Wait for page to load, and then press "Back" returns to the previous page - but the link colour hasn't updated.
Actual Results:  
All the visited links stay blue.

Expected Results:  
Links turn purple.

Middle clicking on any of the following links at the end of the search results:

"Google Home - Advertising Programmes - Business Solutions - Privacy - About Google"

updates their visited link colour immediately.
