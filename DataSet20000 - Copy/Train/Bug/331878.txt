copy/paste functionality requires administrator account

Copying and pasting either to or from firefox (or thunderbird) fails unless firefox is running as admin. This is running firefox as a limited user - not a partial admin account that has nearly every admin privledge, but a properly set limited user aka standard user.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Either log on as a limited user or use the runas command or other means to launch firefox as another user
2. Attempt to copy and paste anything to/from firefox
3. Fail
Actual Results:  
Nothing is read or written to the clipboard.

Expected Results:  
Selected item is copied into clipboard, or clipboard item is pasted into firefox/thunderbird.

Exact same problem in Thunderbird 1.5
Internet browsers and email clients should not require administrator rights to function, running internet aware programs as a limited user is a very useful means of mitigating damage done by malware/spyware/trojans/exploits etc etc ad nasuem.
This is the only bug I've found keeping me from implementing limited user browsers/email on a large install base...which could save me looooooots of hair pulling in the future.
IE7 is supposed to have this feature in vista but if programs were correctly written to the windows file system/security model since NT/2000 this wouldn't be an issue. (yes, even MS wrote IE5 and 6 wrong)
Theres a great writeup here from the march 02 entry: http://www.sysinternals.com/Blog/
