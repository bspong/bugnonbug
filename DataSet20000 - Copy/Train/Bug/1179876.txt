Add links to an "MDN error reference" from console errors
The web console emits thousands of error messages to web developers everyday. While seasoned web developers understand what is going on, especially beginners need help to understand them. Often the message gets copied, put into google, and answered on Stackoverflow.

What we could do is adding a [Learn More] link to error messages (like we already do for warnings, see CORS), so that we offer developers a direct way to get to know more about what just happened.

This could also be an icon to reduce the text noise (say a question mark in a circle).

More information is available in this etherpad: https://etherpad.mozilla.org/webconsole-mdn-error-msg and the discussion is happening here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.developer-tools/zUiTSyjIvOs

This bug is about the devtools implementation in the console.

The current [Learn More] function lives here: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/webconsole/webconsole.js#1693

A link to the error docs could look like his:
https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Errors/JSMSG_BAD_RADIX

where "JSMSG_BAD_RADIX" is an "errorNumber" from https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/js/src/js.msg

I will file a depended bug to get "errorNumber" added to nsIScriptError.
