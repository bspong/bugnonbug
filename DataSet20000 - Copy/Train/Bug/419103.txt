All Navigation items alter wrongly, when moved to different toolbar

When moving the Navigation buttons to the file edit menu previously, all buttons kept the same consistent look and feel.  On the latest nightly they all go to small icons even though this is not selected.  

When I turned small icons on, then off again, normal size icons did resume which should have been present already, upon moving navigation buttons to file edit menu.  Many users would of course not attempt this swap of icon size and be left with the wrong icon size, and incidentally, icon look and feel.

Small icons even when they are turned on, are not consistent with normal icons look and feel.  They all return to Firefox 2 designs, this includes back/forwards where keyhole design should and could remain.  Stop is no longer the cross but the Firefox 2 design, Reload, new tab, and others, the same applies.  The icons should be as consistent to the normal size icons as possible not the Firefox 2 icons.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right click file edit menu
2. Customize
3. Drag navigation buttons to file edit toolbar
Actual Results:  
Small icons are present, yet this is not selected.  Small icons design even when present is not consistent with Firefox 3 icons, but Firefox 2 icons.

Expected Results:  
The same icon size, look and feel should be consistent throughout.
