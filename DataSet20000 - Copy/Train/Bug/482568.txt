Firefox will not load the page clubugly.com fully and just hangs. Click random menu links and you will see. To get rid of the hanging then click refresh in the browser and the page will load, click any link will cause it to hang again. territorioland.com produces the same result on a FF 3.0.7 Vista 64 install.

It worked fine prior to upgrade. I have two identical computers and the second had 3.0.6 and worked fine. I then upgraded to 3.0.7 and produced the same results as the first computer.

I can only assume its hanging on some javascript.
