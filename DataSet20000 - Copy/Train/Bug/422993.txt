On some forum sites, there are textboxes which allow you to view the pre-formatted text before you submit it.  The formatting with these textboxes do not require you to use BBcodes, instead, there are buttons that you press which renders the text with that chosen style live inside of the textbox.

That may sound very cryptic, so I attached a screenshot of it occurring.  Note, I have played around with other forum sites, and not all of them have this problem.

I apologize if this bug is a duplicate, but I've noticed that throughout the development process of Firefox 3, I've seen this bug come on and off with each beta release.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a forum site that has as submission textbox that allows you to format the text live inside of the box.
2. Not all sites have this problem, but some do.  I've noticed that some PHP forums with this functionality do not have this problem.
Actual Results:  
The lines appeared.

Expected Results:  
Not place the lines there.

Look at the attached screenshot.
