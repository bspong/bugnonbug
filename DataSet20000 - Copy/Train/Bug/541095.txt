mouse coordinates problem with FLASH PLAYER 10.0.42.34 only in SNOW LEOPARD
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7
Build Identifier: (Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US;) Firefox/3.5.x

Only in Snow Leopard (Mac Osx 10.6)
latest version of the flash player (10.0.42.34)
Firefox 3.5

We find that, from a Flash/Flex application, whenever we open an operating system menu, the mouse coordinated detected by the Flash player start to be completely wrong. The mouse coordinates inside flash remains wrong until you change the focus to another application (Apple -> tab) and then you return to Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to www.string-db.org
2.click on "random entry"   (a flash network will appear)
3.click on the "advanced" button  (another flash network with a menu will appear)
4.click on Options -> Background -> Add Background Image -> Select Image
  (the operating system window that gives you the possibility to select the file will appear)
5.click on cancel
6.try to drag the nodes of the network

As soon as you try to drag a node the node will fall in the lower left part of the screen, because the coordinates of the mouse received by the flash player are completely wrong.
This bug happens only with FIREFOX on SNOW LEOPARD.
No problem with other operating systems or browsers.
