Steps to reproduce:

i work on this 2-3 day without close pc so this is hard to tell. nothing special read website, youtube i also work on few windows. on one window this  work fine one other no. 
So on this wrong window i click button open a new tab -> this is first case.
Second case is when i click ctrl+t or i click this open tab in aurora menu. this is two diffrent strory.


Actual results:

When i click open a new tab nothing happend like dont work but this is not all. Right scroll on tab bar dont refresh auto it seem like nothing happend but i when i go a little on left side then i can scroll this right and see there are new tab but i cant click on it (look on attachment). 
When i click ctrl+t it seem like new tab (its white ;-) ) but dont change tab in tab-bar and i have old url and when i change it this page was change and i can go back. When i go to other tab (when i dont change url) and go to this page i see old page not this white screen.
This second window work fine.


Expected results:

in both case tab bar go to end with new tab and clean url and history.
