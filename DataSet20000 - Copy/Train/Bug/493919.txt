Remove or update obsolete default settings in existing-profile-defaults.js
In short:
I think we should remove existing-profile-defaults.js file from user profile directory to keep their defualt config up-to-date and same as all other users.
If some contract between us and Google/Yahoo prevent to do it, we need update values wihtin the file. We should care about them.


Long Details:
We have changed/updated search engine order, feed reader url etc with major update (not only us but for example ro locale will also change default engine to Yandex with Fx 3.5).
But as Atsushi and Kohei wrote in bug 396536, existing-profile-defaults.js file was introduced in Bug 364297 for Firefox 2.0.0.2 to keep their old default engines etc.

All users have new default values but only those users who had used Fx 2.0.0.1 and updated to 2.0.0.2 have existing-profile-defaults.js in their profile directory and they still use the old obsolete search engine order, feed reader url, keyword urls.

obsolete default configs in existing-profile-defaults.js:

current default configs:
http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/l10n-mozilla-1.9.1/ja/file/tip/browser/chrome/browser-region/region.properties

Today enough long time passed from Fx 2 release and as far as we see forums etc, users tend to feel strange (and complain) when they find their default settings are not same as others or new profile.
I think we should not keep really old configs *forever*. Users default config should be updated properly as all other case do. As we change default configs with major update, we should remove obsolete default configs in existing-profile-defaults.js (remove the file).

Anyway, at least feed url must be updated as we did in bug 396536 and other engine order etc should also be updated.
I'm not sure we have to keep their default engine because of the contract between us and Google/Yahoo. If the contract require it, we should update existing-profile-defaults.js to keep only the Google/Yahoo order (remove other configs to use normal default configs defined in region.properties).
# As far as I know we will not keep default engine as Google when ro loclae change it to Yandex.
# I'm curious about why only CJKT users keep old configs.

If we'll update (not remove) the file, we should keep in mind that existing-profile-defaults.js is locale dependent. That is, if a user made existing-profile-defaults.js with ko locale and now using with ja locale, he have ko locale existing-profile-defaults.js and we maybe should not replace it with ja existing-profile-defaults.js.
We should check the file contents or just replace locale dependent values. For example, to update our feed url, we can replace "http://www.google.co.jp/ig/add?feedurl=%s" with "http://www.google.com/reader/view/feed/%s" since google.co.jp is exists only in ja (and ja-JP-mac) one.

To avoid complex situation and confusion of users, I believe it's best just to remove existing-profile-defaults.js.
