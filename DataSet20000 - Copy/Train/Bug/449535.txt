Unable to start Firefox 3.1 while Roboform 6.9.82 is running

Tried starting Firefox after installing it. It attempted to start but immediately disappeared. A popup box appeared and quickly disappeared while it was attempting to start. I barely had time to notice the word Roboform when the popup box appeared. Anyway, I decided to disable Roboform, and was able to start Firefox. I then decided to experiment by restarting Roboform. Firefox immediately disappeared when I did this. Therefore, I decided that your new Firefox is incompatible with Roboform. I had no problems with previous versions of your product, including v2.016. Also, your new version doesn't load my bookmarks or my google toolbar. I am returning to my previous version until you come up with a solution.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have Roboform 6.9.82 running.
2.Install Firefox 3.01 and run it.
3.After Firefox fails to start, disable Roboform.
4.Restart Firefox. If you had a previous version of Firefox v2 or later, check to see if your bookmarks were carried over.
