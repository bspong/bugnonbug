Ok the other night I had to reformat my PC after a virus infected it. It wasn't a complete reformat but a pc recovery. I didn't save my bookmarks because I figured they would be in the Firefox folder after I fixed everything else. Well they are there but its bookmarks from like months ago. Even then when I try to restore them, they don't show up in the bookmarks menu. I keep restoring them from the bookmark organizer but they still aren't showing up. I even tried to import the html files. Is there anyway this can be fixed, and can I find recent bookmarks from like the other night? The ones that were there before doing a pc recovery? I've looked up answers to this but so far everything has been unsuccessful. I really hate to have to start over because I had a lot of bookmarks, but if push comes to shove I guess I'm going to have to. I've been a loyal firefox user for years and I've never had this problem. Though I have always backed up my bookmarks before doing a recovery. So I guess this is partly my fault. Any help though would be greatly appreciated though. Thanks
