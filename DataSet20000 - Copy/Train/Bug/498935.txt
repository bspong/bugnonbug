After I draged the image out side of the browser I atempted to copy it into a document. What happened was I tried to bring focus to the document editor by (super/window key) + tab and the image suddenly becomes fixed and unmovable. Renders above all the other windows even after I close firefox. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Drag Image out side of browser window
2.Press (Window/supper) key + tab (Activates Flip Effect)
3.Close Firefox 
Actual Results:  
Image is frozen and still there, hovering over all the windows on the screen. Fire fox is closed. Have to logoff to clear it. 

Expected Results:  
Image should not be there. Can not select or remove. Firefox is not running.

Well Maybe clear the image or pretend like you canceled the drag and drop. It shouldn't be pasted onto the desktop without not being able to clear the image or to move it. (Fire fox is closed and the image will only disappear when I log off).
