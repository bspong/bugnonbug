Firefox seemingly randomly requires multiple inputs for common commands, such as clicks on website buttons, forward and back commands and bookmark launches.

It acts similarly to a lost internet connection, but there is no indication on the status bar that Firefox is performing an action.  Sometimes several repeated inputs are required (as many as 7 in my experience) before an action is performed.

It isn't limited to any particular set of commands, or even to Firefox commands.  Links on webpages can also trigger this bug.

It's occurred with both Firefix 2.0 and 3.0 beta.  I've spoken to friends that use Firefox and they've confirmed the bug, as well as it's randomness.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
It can't be reproduced by any method I've discovered.  However, once the effect appears, it affects ALL webpage-related functions in Firefox until it's flushed out by repeating commands multiple times.  In that way, it's self-repeating.
