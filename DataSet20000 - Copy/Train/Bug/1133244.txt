In firefox nightly (38.0a1 (2015-02-14)) Enabling the "sync" feature with my 2 year old sync account results in pages loading as if on a very slow internet connection
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0
Build ID: 20150214030238

Steps to reproduce:

I have been using nightly on my primary home desktop for a while. About 3 or 4 months ago, I started noticing very weird and annoying behavior. I browse with many tabs open (probably more than 100), and save the session. I started noticing that when opening firefox, many of the tabs would act like they were still loading the page for many minutes. The browser acts quick, and I can load new tabs and browse around - but many images etc are taking a very time to load. It is almost as if I am browsing the internet on a 56k connection.

I misatributed the slowness to testing e10s and didn't think much of it, but I disabled that mode and the behavior is still there. At times, the browser functions normally, and at other times it exhibits this weird network lag. I switch to chrome when this happens as the internet is barely usable through firefox, and can verify that it is not an issue with my internet connection.

I have a 2 year old sync account with many passwords, tabs, and probably a long history. Today, I disabled sync, and the problem seemed to go away. I enabled sync and the problem seemed to come back. I tried limiting what is synced, but the only thing that seemed to make a difference was whether I was logged into sync or not.

When I go into work I will try moving to a new sync account and see if there is something wrong in my sync account. 

My sync account is the same as my email in bugzilla if you want to take a look at it there.


Actual results:

Internet unreasonably slow while logged into sync.


Expected results:

Functionality should not be impaired while logged into sync
