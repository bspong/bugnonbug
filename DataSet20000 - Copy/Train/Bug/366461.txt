"Clear Private Data" sometimes appear upon startup

As specified in Bug 314755 related to Firefox 1.5 I frequently experience that the "Clear Private Data" windows is displayed upon starting Firefox 2.0.

In Tools - Options - Privacy I have "Always clear my private data when I close Firefox" and "Ask me before clearing private data" checked.

It is (mostly if not always) also displayed when exiting Firefox, but sometimes (appear to be somewhat random - at leats I have failed to find the common denominator) also appears when STARTING Firefox. I suspect that it may have something to do with me sometimes choosing Cancel or X rather that the "Clear Private Data Now" button... Is there a flag somewhere that is reset when clicking "Clear Private Data Now" - a flag that isn't reset when just hitting the X to close the Window...? Anyway it doesn't seem to be constant - at least not in the same "computer session" (without restarting the computer in between starting and exiting Firefox). I'm unsure whether the box sometimes don't display when exiting Firefox - and then displays when starting, but I'm pretty sure it has happened both when exiting and starting Firefox.

In the Firefox 1.5 release notes as well as in the Bug 314755 description it says that it might have something to do with the Adblock extension and that you should ensure that the latest version is installed. I have Adblock Plus installed in it latest version.

A list of the extensions I have installed:

Application: Firefox 2.0.0.1 (2006120418)
Operating System: WINNT (x86-msvc)

- Adblock Filterset.G Updater 0.3.0.4

- Image Zoom 0.2.7
- PDF Download 0.7.8
- Tab Mix Plus 0.3.5.2

I didn't find this bug in Bugzilla pertaining to Firefox 2.0, hence this new bug report.
