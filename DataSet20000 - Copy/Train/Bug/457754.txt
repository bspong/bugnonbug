Firefox refuses to login on certain phpBB forums.

For a few versions now, Firefox has almost consistently refused to let me log into a forum that I visit. Incidentally, it also happens to be the only forum I visit that uses phpBB. There are others that I have spoken to over time who have experienced the same thing, without similar conditions as well as others with similar conditions without the problem. This site, combined with Firefox works perfectly on my other computer, which is XP, while this one is Vista Home Basic 32-bit.

The only conclusion I can draw is that it is a rare defect when Firefox collides with specific versions of Vista. As I am unable to replace the OS, and this problem has occurred since before Firefox 3, I am out of options.

Is there any way to fix this problem, or do I need to wait for a bug fix?
