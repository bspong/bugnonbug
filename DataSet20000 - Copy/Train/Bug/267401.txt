Window does not resize from javascript

Clicking "Normal (video only)" tries to resize the window. THis does not work
with the default settings in Javascript. This seems an important feature, to be
able to make the BBC player as small as possible, and made me view in IE so I
could see it as I wanted.

I would have thought this had been discussed at length in bugzilla, apologies if
it has, cannot find anything on search.

Suggest that web-page spawned windows can be resized by Javascript. I completely
agree that no site should be able to resize my own windows, but if the site has
spawned it I am happy that it has this control in this "sandbox" of its own
window. I argue that in this situation the user expects the site to manage its
own window, and a failure to allow this makes Firefox look unprofessional.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to news.bbc.co.uk
2. Open the video console
3. Click "Normal (video only")

Actual Results:  
Layout changes, window size does not change.

Expected Results:  
Window size changes

I appreciate this is perhaps an opinion-based matter, and apologies if it has
been covered before, but IMHO Firefox appears incorrect to a user using default
prefs by not allowing what in a sense is a basic "web app" ability.
