Linkf from Thunderbird open new Minefield

(I apologize if this is a duplicate, as I'm quite uncertain how to search for this specific problem.)

Clicking a link in Thunderbird, version 2.0.0.17 opens a new instance of Minefield, instead of the currently-running one; if Minefield is not running, then clicking a link opens Minefield.

In both cases, there is a problem: While Minefield opens, using my only profile assigned to Minefield, nearly all of my extensions are inactive, and shown as incompatible.

I suspect that the problem is Vista-related, as someone on MozillaZine, replying to my query posted that TB links work correctly with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1b2pre) Gecko/20081021 Firefox/2.0.0.11 and, if I remember correctly, Windows NT 5.1 is not Vista.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on any link in Thunderbird, see "Details" above for what happens
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
See "Details"

Expected Results:  
Either the link should open in a running instance of Minefield, or open Minefield if no running instance, and extensions should be working.
