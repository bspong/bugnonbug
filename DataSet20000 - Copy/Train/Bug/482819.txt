the firefox directory (C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox) opens itself continuously throughout browsing
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011913 Firefox/3.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011913 Firefox/3.0.6

Since updating to this version of Firefox, the Firefox directory (C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox) opens itself continuously and at an exponentially faster rate with the more links I click. 

I've searched through a list of my active processes and there isn't anything that gives any indication as to why firefox appears to be opening its directory so sporadically. This is especially strange when one considers that no previous version of Firefox has suffered from this rather peculiar problem. 

I would be grateful for any assistance you can offer in this matter. Thank you for your time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open firefox
2. access between 10 and 20 sites (keeping them open in tabs)
3. the firefox directory should then randomly begin opening itself in a sporadic and exponential rate
Actual Results:  
the same thing continues to happen; the firefox directory continues to open sporadically.

Expected Results:  
Presumably the wonderful people at Mozilla did not intend for something of such incessance to occur!

I'm currently using the following addons:

HyperWords v5.3
Orbit Downloader Extension v2.02
Skype Extension v2.2.0.102

(disabling the above makes no difference)

---------------------------------------------

I'm currently using the following theme: 

PitchDark v3.04  (using the default theme makes no discernable difference)
