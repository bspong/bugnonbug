When using a website that uses java applet windows (www.gay.com), I attempted to type the keyboard shortcut for é (Ctrl+0233).  However, the accented e was not typed and the text changed.  I attempted a number of times and noticed that the text size increased whenever I pressed the 2 while holding Ctrl down.  No Ctrl+ combination decreases the text size, and only the 2 in the number pad increased text size when pressed while holding Ctrl down.  Simply closing and re-opening the java applet windows does not re-size text back to normal.  To do this, I had to shut down the Firefox window that the java applets were produced from.  Traditional Firefox keyboard shortcut for decrease text size (Ctrl+ -) is ineffective.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. First, I logged in to www.gay.com using my username and password for that site.
2. Once any of their java applet windows open (messenger or chat room windows), hold down Ctrl and press 2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Text size was increased every time I pressed Ctrl+2

Expected Results:  
Nothing.  Text size should increase with Ctrl++ and decrease with Ctrl+ -
