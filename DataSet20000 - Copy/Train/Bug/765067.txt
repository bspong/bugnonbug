Firefox does not connect to certain intranet sites
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:10.0.5) Gecko/20120605 Firefox/10.0.5
Build ID: 20120605183511

Steps to reproduce:

We have two web sites on our intranet zone, 1 is root1 and the second is root2 - When a user type root1 on the address, the user goes to the intranet site named root1 which matches /etc/hosts and internal DNS but when users enter root2 - Firefox forwards them to google.com


Actual results:

When a user ping root1 from the console, the server root1 replies from IP address 192.168.1.254. When ping root2 from the console, it replies from IP address 192.168.1.253
All of the above is absolutely correct but when the user enter root2 on the Firefox address, the user gets redirected to google


Expected results:

Firefox is not obeying DNS and machine settings and that prevent the user from accessing a web site if the name is similar to a keyword in Google
In prior IE versions, it can be solved simply by instructing IE to not to search from the address bar but since the address and search bar are the same bar in IE 9, that option is not longer available and that's because we moved to Firefox but the latest version is inheriting the same Microsoft bugs and it is much more dificult to configure assuming that there is a configuration for preventing Firefox from using the address bar as a Google search bar
