When running with multiple open browser windows (more than 1 is enough) and you change the position of one window slightly, or you switch from window to another, one window jumps to overlay the other (or one of the others). 
The problem is reproducible but not with 100% reliability but this seems to work. (see below)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open 4 windows. make one of them a child window, i.e. launched by clicking on a link from an existing window, or right clicking (I dont know if this has anything to do with the problem but it is one of the conditions I usually have)
2. move the windows around. make some moves large, say 200 pxl, others small. Switch from one window to another by clicking once on the top window bar.
3. eventually (perhaps 10-20 clicks/moves) you'll see the windows move around unexpectedly, usually aligning on the upper left corners.
