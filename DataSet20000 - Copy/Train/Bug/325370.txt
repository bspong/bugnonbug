In today's world security satrts with every application installed. Thefore
it is essential that each one of them provides *secure* defaults, which
may not necessarily be "convenient". 

Most of the people do not "tweak" the settings, they just install the software
and run it, so any "insecurity" in default application doesn't get tightened.

Firefox in this respect ships with settings that "may be convenient", but
which are unfortunately insecure in present settings.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select "tools" menu
2. Select "Options"
3. Select "Privacy" tab

Under tabs "Saved forms, Passowrds, Download history, Cache" the
default settings are insecure.
Actual Results:  
PÅrivate data is left lying around after shutting dows firefox 
in its default installation state.

Expected Results:  
No private inforamtion is saved by default.

Under the "privacy" topic (Menu Tools => Settings), the following settings
in mentioned tabs (below) would better enhance privacy in default installation. The "[ ]" means leaving the item unchecked, and "[x]" as checked.

saved forms     : [ ] Save information I enter in forms ....
Passwords       : [ ] remember passwords
Download history: [When firefox exits]
Cache           : button "Settings" => [x] Clear data when closing firefox
