This bug appeared only after upgrading my MacOSX operating system to 10.4.4 version. All the bookmarks written in Russian transformed from cyrillic text to interrogation signs (?????). The same was observed with toolbar texts in Russian. Moreover, when I fulfil textboxes in Russian (for example, Google search textbox), only interrogation signs appear instead of cyrillic letters. However, web pages in Russian are displayed correctly.&#13;&#10;With Mac OSX 10.4.3 operating system version everything worked perfectly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open menu Bookmarks -> Manage bookmarks and look at bookmarks saved in Russian&#13;&#10;or:&#13;&#10;1.Open Google homepage&#13;&#10;2.Type Russian text with cyrillic letters in Google search textbook&#13;&#10;P.S. Russian laguage is fixed as second language in Preferences of my Firefox browser.
Actual Results:  
1. I see interrogation signs (???????) instead of Russian text in all mentioned cases.

Expected Results:  
I should see Russian text written by Cyrillic letters instead.

All themes used (classic, noia 2.0, silver skin, aquatint, modern pinball)&#13;&#10;System upgraded from Mac OSX 10.4.3 to 10.4.4.
