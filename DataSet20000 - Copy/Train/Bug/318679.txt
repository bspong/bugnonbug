When upgrading from an earlier version to Firefox 1.5 previously added search engines are overwritten. I couldn't reproduce when running the installer again. I don't have the time to reinstall my previous version Firefox 1.0.6 and and again upgrade to 1.5 but if someone else could try would appreciate it.
