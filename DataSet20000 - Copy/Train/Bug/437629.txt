Selected engine removed but preferences not updated

if a search engine is selected and we go in "Manage search engines" and remove it, firefox does not change the "browser.search.selectedEngine" preference (restore default), the removed engine is still selectedEngine. Firefox does not find the selected engine when it displays the list so it falls back to the default. So for the user everything seems to be OK. As soon as the user selects another engine the preference is fixed.

How I found it: we are developping a toolbar that ships with a search engine.
- Put our search engine
- Remove it while selected.
- Close firefox
- Add an xml file for the same search engine
- open firefox: Our search provider is add and selected (it should not be selected) because we were still in the selectEngine preference.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select a search engine.
2. Remove it while selected.
3. Close firefox
4. Add an xml file for the same search engine in the extensions directory
5. Open firefox
Actual Results:  
The search provider removed and added in the steps is added and selected (it should not be selected) because we were still in the selectEngine preference.

Expected Results:  
The search provider should be added but not selected.
