The window height is decreased by the height of the menu bar from the bottom when in the maximised state only when going from the normal (restored) state to maximised state with the menu bar displayed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox
2. Ensure it is in a restored (normal) state
3. Enable the menu bar
4. Maximise the window (a)
5. Turn off the menu bar (b)
6. Turn on the menu bar (a)
7. Restore the window (c)
8. Turn off the menu bar (d)
9. Turn on the menu bar (c)
10. Turn off the menu bar (d)
11. Maximise the window (a)
12. Turn on the menu bar (a)
13. Turn off the menu bar (a)
14. Restore the window (c)
Actual Results:  
(a) -- the window takes up the entire screen (excluding the windows start bar)
(b) -- there is a gap between the bottom of the window and the windows start bar that is the height of the menu bar

(c) -- the content area takes up the correct amount of space (the bottom edge between the content area and window edge is the same as the left and right sides)
(d) -- there is an extra space at the bottom of the window that is the height of the menu bar

Expected Results:  
(a) and (b) -- the window takes up the entire screen (excluding the windows start bar)
(c) and (d) -- the content area takes up the correct amount of space
