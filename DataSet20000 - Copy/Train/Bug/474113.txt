Images/CSS behind a firewall are shown only after reloading

I have a windows machine which I have installed a proxy (proxy+ www.proxyplus.cz), to this machine I have contected a mac pro notebook. 
On this mac I have installed FF3.1b2, and a linux machine in a VMware fushion with FF 3.0.5. 

when I now open any page e.g. lastminute.de I do not see images/css rendered. When I press enter again in the urlbar so that the page gets reloaded everything works perfectly. 
It cannot be a local setting problem because when I clean the cache an open lastminute.de in Safari it works perfectly already the first time. 

Everytime I reload with SHIFT+Reload (bypassing the cache) I see this problem again. 

I have tried FF 3.0.5 and FF3.1b2 and both versions showed this behaviour.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a Browser on a machine which is behind a proxy
2. Open any url e.g. http://www.lastminute.de
3. No images or css is loaded

Enter the url again everything is correct displayed. This problem can be verified with bypassing the cache.

I dont know if its a proxy+ feature or this is a bug for any proxy.
Actual Results:  
No images/css are shown.

Expected Results:  
Page is shown already the first time and not on reloading.
