wwwn.nrc.nl is a leading dutch daily, i'm a subcriber. 
the last week or two it's not a pleasure anymore to read the paper online. after n i've clicked on an article i have to click again in order to get the version in reality (is that the correct name in english? i hope so), before i can read it. but no way i can with it with acrobat like i used to do: then my pc is stuck. the only way to end this is crtl-alt-delete & everything from firefox disappears. 
i've phoned the webpeople from this daily. they told me to use ie, since firefox 
doesn't support something in javascript. but i don't want to use ie!    

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to www.nc.nl - digital edition
2. click on an article, in order to read it
3. click on pdf
Actual Results:  
well, i've descripted that.  
actually, it's the second time i'm describing this problem for you.
in between i've tried again to read an article (hoping i could give you more
specific information), but firefox crashed including the description i'd made
for you. it's no use trying that again, i'm afraid. 

Expected Results:  
there seems nothing i can do about it. :-( 

give me a decent pdf i could read & send
