Trying to download a file called ";).rar" leads to wrong name in the download-box: "PNpJLb5C.part" or "DpA5gNtH.part", or "j78NWls5.part"...

(Clicking that file with left-click leads to binary data in the firefox-window - which is the second bug in that connection)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click right at the download-link
2. Select "Save File As" (german: "Ziel speichern unter")
3. The Download-Box writes "PNpJLb5C.part" or "DpA5gNtH.part", or "j78NWls5.part"


Actual Results:  
Wrong name in the Download-Box.

Expected Results:  
Name ";).rar" in the Download-Box.

Reproducable every time, problem should be very easy to find.

Caution: The file in the example URL contains virus-writing information, so your AV may give you a warning. Just dont open .EXE files within the .RAR - then everything is good. (I dont have a webspace where I can put a living example with a different .RAR - sorry)
