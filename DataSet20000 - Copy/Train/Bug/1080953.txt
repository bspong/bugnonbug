UITour: tell page when first incoming call is received and if that room window is open
The Hello tour guides a user through creating their first Hello room and sharing that link. When the person receiving the link initiates a call (I.E. the tour user's first incoming call is received), the tour should resume. 

* If the tour page is still open, that tab should be selected. If the tour page is not open, a tab should be opened with the tour (and resumed at the proper point, mechanism TBD).

* If the room view for the call was already open, the call connects and everything is obvious. But if the view isn't open, the tour needs to know so that it can open the Hello panel, indicate how to click an active room, and know when the user has opened the room so the tour can continue. [This bug needs to tell the tour if the incoming call's room is open, those other steps will be implemented by other bugs.]

* Something will need to track tour status (probably the bug implementing the First Time Experience (FTE) panel for Hello), as we only want this bug to do things when finishing a tour. (So, a tristate flag: Tour not started, Tour waiting for incoming call, Tour Completed).

* In particular, we'd like to avoid annoying QA/developers who are not interested in a tour, and don't want the first call in testing profiles to be resuming a tour they never started.
