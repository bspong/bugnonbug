There is a problem with the generation of the Base URI when using scripts for a file:/// access
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

The above URL works, but... if you have the same files in the same structure on a local machine and reference it with:
file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Pictures/Test/thumb.html
It then appears that in the <script> created page the base URI is the URI of the file you first opened. I.e. If I start with Test/thumb.html, click on the image to get Test/Bama/thumb.html -- the image is displayed, but click on the image it is an error, with the image name as: Test/Scan5451-SM.jpg, not Test/Bama/Scan5451-SM.jpg

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open local file: file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Pictures/Test/thumb.html
2. Click on Image (gets Test/Bama/thumb.html)
3. Click on Image to get larger view.
Actual Results:  
1. Works
2. Works
3. Error -- Image name is given as: Test/Scan5451-SM.jpg
Not as Test/Bama/Scan5451-SM.jpg


Expected Results:  
See actual. The results on a web access are right. It is only on a local file:/// access that it fails.
(Note this has worked in the past under Firefox 1.0,2.0, MSIE 6, Safari.)

For reference a zip file of the Test directory used above is:
http://www.visionbib.com/Test/Test.zip

It is either some problem with the URI, Base URI (I tried various base settings and did not get any change in the error), or an interaction with the SCRIPT -- the new window is computed and images referenced in files at all levels seem right.
Note the location bar that is on the computed window reflects this problem -- no matter what page is displayed, the first page you viewed is given (for file:/// access), for http:// access you get the current displayed page (page displayed in the browser, not the computed file.) So that if I first open Test/Bama/thumb.html, then click on the image, it opens a new window with the image.
