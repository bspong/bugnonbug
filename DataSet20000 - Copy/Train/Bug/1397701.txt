Should clean up UITour after closing the onboarding overlay by clicking the Skip-Tour button
STR:
1. Open the onboarding tour overlay
2. Navigate to the Library tour
3. Click the Library tour action button to trigger the UITour highlight on the Library button
4. Click the Skip-Tour button on the onboarding overlay

p.s we could use any tour which would highlight button in the step 2 and 3.

Expected Result:
The overlay closes and the UITour highlight on the Library button closes as well

Actual Result:
The overlay closes but the UITour highlight on the Library button doesn't close

Root Cause:
The Onboarding cleans up UITour at [1] when seeing the overlay or the overlay-close button clicked to close the overlay. We should consider the case of the Skip-Tour button too. However, now there are 3 buttons which should be considered, in case of the future change, such as adding one more button, removing another button etc. We probably need a more general way to clean up UITour while the onboarding overlay closed, otherwise, it is very easy to forget the thing. And some test about this behaviour is needed too.
