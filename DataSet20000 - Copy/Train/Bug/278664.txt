Add a pref to make location bar keyboard modifiers consistent with all other shortcuts
Currently, the keyboard modifiers (Ctrl/Shift/Alt) in the location bar is not
consistent with the rest of the keyboard/mouse shortcuts. This is done by
design, to be compatible with IE. The current behavior is as follows:

* Ctrl+Enter: add "www." and ".com" to url
* Shift+Enter: add "www." and ".net" to url
* Ctrl+Shift+Enter: add "www." and ".org" to url
* Alt+Enter: open url in new tab, which can combine the above modifiers.

This is NOT a request to change these defaults, since they are there for a good
reason. However, for the increasing number of people using tabbed browsing, and
for the (probably) vast amount of users not using this IE feature/shortcut at
all, having a consistent UI across the browser would certainly make it easier to
use. For those users, an about:config pref should be added to make the keyboard
modifiers consistent with the rest of the UI, resulting in the following behavior:

* Shift+Enter: open the url in a new window.
* Ctrl+Enter: open the url in a new tab (background by default).
* Ctrl+Shift+Enter: open the url in a new tab (foreground by
default).
* Alt+Enter: save the url target.
