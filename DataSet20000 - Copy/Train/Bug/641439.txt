Crash when I click on the "Firefox/Mozilla" button after I click start. FF is the browser I always use.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.0; Trident/5.0)
Build Identifier: I downloaded the most recent FF a couple weeks ago

When I click on Start and click on Mozilla/Firefox to bring up my home page, I get a box telling me that Mozilla/FF has crashed and to fill out a crash report which I have done 3-4 times. I have gotten not response from Mozilla/FF telling even acknowleging it was recieved.
I'm having to us IE which I hate. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Turn on computer
2.Click 'Start'
3.Click 'Mozilla/Firefox'
Actual Results:  
I get a pop up telling me that Mozilla/Firefox has crashed and to send in a report even even if I restart or quit Mozilla/FF

Expected Results:  
It should have taken me to my home page which is AT&T powered by Yahoo.
One my home page are all the add-ons, etc which I have installed. On IE they are missing. 

I know of nothing else. I'm practically in a panic. 
It does occur each time I click on Mozilla/Firefox.
It's important to me that someone contacts me and tells me what is going on. Afterall, I've recommended Mozilla/Firefox to everybody I know. 
I feel Mozilla/Firefox is negelecting me due to my filling out a crash report each time I'm unable to log on, which is everytime, to Mozilla/Firefox.
