An added preferences dialog box that addresses cosmetics and options such as the
autofill, pop-up blocker etc.
An options dialog box that addresses the fundamental way in which the browser
behaves such as the download manager, security and plugins etc.

Reproducible: Always

Expected Results:  
A preference box with a greater degree of options (such as file types and other
cosmetics from about:config etc.) that rivals I.E's preferences. (if you like, a
bit like tweak UI)
An options, or advanced, dialog which lets the user change options such as the
way download manager/tabs etc. work. Ideally the advanced dialog is a one stop
set-up that can be reviewed by the user periodically.

The seperation prevents user errors that will negativly affect their experience
using Firebird (if they change options by mistake) and ease clearing up of the
crowded options box.
It also adds to the feel that the browser is an integrated component, making IE
more redundant to the end user (in order to expand firebird's acceptance as an
alternative)
