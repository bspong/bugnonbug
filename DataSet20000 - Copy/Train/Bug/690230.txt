Steps to reproduce:

I noticed the display was truncated and popup menus were appearing offset from where I clicked when testing a non-trivial applet. So I created a simple applet to repro that just displays the xy coordinates from the mouse event when you activate a pop-up. (attached) You can see this is a basic, simple applet, similar to a Sun example.
Versions:
Mac OSX 10.6.8
Firefox 3.6.22
Java 1.6.0_26


Actual results:

When the applet is displayed in a browser local to the same server where the website is hosted, the display is truncated. Instead of a grid of 4 50x50 pixel squares, you just see 3 of the squares with the 4th truncated (see any of the attached screen shots titled LocalFirefox...). Also, mouse event pixel positions are offset. The further you get from the top-left corner of the applet, the larger the offsets. This is demonstrated in the attached applet by displaying the x-y coordinates in the popup menu. The cursor doesn't display in the attached screenshots, but the clicked-on coordinates marked by the 50x50 grid are in the screenshot titles. 


Expected results:

Display should show the entire 4x4 grid of rectangles, and mouse event coordinates should correspond to exactly where the mouse is clicked. This does not repro on locally served Safari (see attached screen shot) or on any browser I tried from remote systems across an intranet, including Firefox & Safari on Mac or Firefox, IE, or Chrome on WinXP.
