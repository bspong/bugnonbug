Steps to reproduce:

1) Make sure that the Flash plugin is installed.  On Fedora 17 64 bit this means having a file or simlink named libflashplayer.so in /usr/lib64/mozilla/plugins.
2) Set environment variables in order to trace the NPAPI interface:
    export NSPR_LOG_MODULES="nsPipe:9,Plugin:9,PluginNPP:9,PluginNPN:9"
    export NSPR_LOG_FILE=/tmp/nspr.log
3) Use Firefox with the Flash plugin to retrieve and run a SWF file from a site that is hosted by Jetty (a java based web server).  Make sure that HTTPS is used:
    firefox http://my-flash-site.com


Actual results:

Firefox hangs (the GUI is unresponsive) for a while followed by the standard "The Adobe Flash plugin has crashed." icon.


Expected results:

The SWF file should be displayed correctly by the Flash plugin.

Sniffing the network between the browser and the Jetty revealed interesting behavior when the SWF file was downloaded - the the plain text data that went into the SSL packets alternated between being one byte, and many bytes.  It was also observed that Firefox sends the SWF to the Flash plugin one byte at a time by calling NPP_Write() many times.  It turns out that these observations are related - the write to Flash is driven by data being received over the SSL connection.  The first call to NPP_Write() is special in that a buffer (mStreamBuffer in nsNPAPIPluginStreamListener.cpp) is allocated at that time.  The size of the buffer is equal to the amount of data received via SSL.  In the case where the first SSL packet received is one byte the buffer is one byte, and then all future calls to NPP_Write() are limited to being one byte in size.

To pursue the theory the crash was caused by the buffer being to small and by NPP_Write() being called too frequently I modified Firefox so that it's possible to set an environment variable:
    export NPAPI_MIN_BUFF=16384
that sets a lower bound to the buffer size.   See the attached patch (firefox-min-npapi-stream-buff.patch), which is for illustration purposes only.  I found that setting the buffer to at least 16KiB fixed the problem.

Possibly the assumption behind the existing logic is that the first segment of data received over the network is typical of all following segments so it's a reasonable guess for the buffer size.  This may be true for webservers other than Jetty + SSL.  Since the patch I attached is for illustration purposes only perhaps this logic could be revisited.

Although the ticket was opened for Firefox 22 this problem has been seen in Firefox as recent as Firefox 30.

Ticket #439558 has been opened with Jetty regarding the behavior seen:
