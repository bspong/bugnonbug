[e10s] Don't display the tab crash badge on not-yet-restored tabs.

So I believe all my tabs crashed when my PC was running out of RAM. I say "believe" because I'm not 100% sure that the tabs actually crashed. The red icon overlaying the favicons implied that something had gone wrong, and the browser console more or less confirmed that the tabs had crashed. But the average user might find the red icon confusing and alarming. And confusing + alarming = shitshitshitwhat'sgoingonIdon'tevenomgcloseeverything.

The non-selected tabs were not actually loaded, but still crashed. They eventually "recovered" (i.e. the red icon disappeared) once the RAM download had finished. The spinner in the selected never stopped and several tab reloads for the page to load. (I can file separate bugs for these if required.)
