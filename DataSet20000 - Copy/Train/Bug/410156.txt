URL files (IE bookmarks) cause remote code to run as local file when opened directly

I added Firefox to my Send To: menu to allow me to open local HTML and URL files in Firefox because these extensions are associated with my editors.

I opened a URL file from my IE favorites folder this way (equivalent of dragging it onto the Firefox executable) and lo and behold, the page loaded as a file: protocol page but then went on to download the HTML from the remote server! This should cause a redirect to the URL embedded in the file rather than running it as a local file containing 100% remote code. I'm sure there's > 20 exploits that could be done after this stage has been reached, including spidering the HD through an iframe and sending the data back via dynamic script tag with relative URL added to the page's code.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add Firefox to Send To menu
2. Send it a URL file

Actual Results:  
Remote code loaded under the file: protocol

Expected Results:  
Remote page URL in the address bar, then page load.
