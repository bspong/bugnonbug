Firefox's main window in Windows 7 mis-renders when moving between Aero Glass and non-Aero themes.  When moving from Aero Glass to non-Aero, the window disappears and seems to have minimized itself.  When moving from non-Aero to Aero Glass, the window remains shown on-screen but can't be interacted with -- being recovered from a minimized state on the task bar.  The behaviour happens whether the window is maximized or a plain window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a Firefox window open
2. If running Aero Glass, switch to a theme without it (i); if non-Aero, switch to an Aero Glass theme (ii)
3. Obeserve what the Firefox window does
Actual Results:  
Case:
(i) The Firefox window disappears from its place on screen and can be revived from its minimized state via the Task Bar or Alt-Tab
(ii) The Firefox window remains rendered to the screen but none of its buttons are usable -- if desktop icons are below the window, they are accessed instead

Expected Results:  
Clean switch between Aero and non-Aero themes, without the window moving from its place or leaving rendering artifacts.
