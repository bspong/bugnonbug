Something seems to be wrong with the implementation of setCaretPosition.  When Orca attempts to set the caret position at the first character of a line in a paragraph, the blinking caret ends up at the end of the previous line. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firefox.  Open http://live.gnome.org/Orca
2. Run Orca v2.17.92 and give the Firefox window focus.  
3. Press Insert+F12 until you hear Orca say "Orca is controlling the caret"
4. Press Ctrl+Home
5. Scroll Firefox to the first paragraph on the page.  Position the caret between the 'p' and 'e' in the phrase "people with visual impairments".  You'll probably have to use the mouse for this (unfortunately).
6. Press down arrow.

Actual Results:  
The caret ends up at the end of the current line instead of the beginning of the next line.  Press right arrow now.  You'll see that the caret jumps to the second caret on the line.

Expected Results:  
The caret should end up at the beginning of the next line.

I've debugged this quite a bit, and I'm pretty sure Orca is telling Gecko to position the caret at the right spot.  In addition, this sometimes works if you load the page and don't press Ctrl+Home.
