A number of sites have started to use flash advertisments which expand when you mouse over them - there is usually a small banner which becomes a large advert if you move the mouse over. An example is currenty at http://www.newscientist.com/blog/space/ (refresh until you see the Technium advert). However, on my machine the main content of the web page is obscured by a big white box, even if I haven't activated the advert. I'm not a flash expert, but I think that part of the flash movie is supposed to be transparent initially, and FF isn't handling the transparency.

I'm probably not explaining it properly, so here are some screenshots:

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.newscientist.com/blog/space/

Actual Results:
