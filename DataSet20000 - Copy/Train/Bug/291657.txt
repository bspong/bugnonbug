browser locks up/freezes when "New Generation of IM Smilies" banner is on page.

this happens every time this particular banner is on the webpage, but since
banners change with each new page opened, it's also a random problem. on
www.imdb.com they have this banner called "Next Generation of IM Smilies" and
when i'm unlucky enough to get this banner on my page, my cursor just spins and
i have to force quit Firefox. if i click my mouse, the banner's "Smilies" start
animating. if i hold down the mouse, the banner fully animates the "Smilies" but
the page still never functions... my cursor just keeps spinning and i never get
control of the webpage!  other websites have this banner, too, and it happens on
those pages as well, so i know it is this banner that is causing the problem! i
have 768MB of RAM.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to www.imdb.com
2. just start looking up movies and clicking on a random movie title to load
it's page.
3. keep repeating until you see the "Next Generation of IM Smilies" banner on
the right.

Actual Results:  
cursor spins and it never stops.

Expected Results:  
loaded the page with the animated banner without problems like all of the other
animated banners on millions of other sites.

i've tried turning off Java and all of that but then i can't navigate anywhere
since the entire web is java now.
