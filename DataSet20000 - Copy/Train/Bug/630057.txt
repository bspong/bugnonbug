I've found that some pages constantly take much CPU time, even in background tabs. This makes Firefox very slow to react (e.g. it can take several seconds to switch a tab).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://strangestone.livejournal.com/110451.html in several tabs (in case something changes with this page, the problem can also be seen with YouTube, but this is less visible: one probably needs more tabs).
Actual Results:  
Firefox takes more and more CPU time and is more and more slow to react when one opens more and more tabs.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should always be fast to react. It can possibly take CPU time if need be, but the priorities should be such a way that this should not affect the UI responsiveness and/or what happens in the active (foreground) tab.

I was initially wondering what was happening, because according to the htop utility, the execution time is almost constant, even when it says that Firefox takes 100% CPU time. But it seems to be a bug in htop (perhaps something wrong with threads). The top utility is more reliable; it shows that Firefox takes CPU time, both in % and in execution time.
