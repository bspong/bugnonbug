overflow-x: hidden; does work on firefox mac os x until you scroll vertically, after this you can also scroll horizontally..

Steps to reproduce:

i have a homepage that gets overflow-x: hidden; on the parent of a 10000px wide div.

<div style="width:880px;overflow:hidden">
  <div style="width:10000px;">
    <ul>
      <li><!-- images that are scrollable horizontally using javascript--></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

if somebody is adressing this bug just send me a mail and i will give you the url to see for yourself, since i have no mac here its kinda hard to supply a test case otherwise.
the styles are not inlined in the html too, just did that here to show the problem.


Actual results:

on mac os x in the newest firefox build (i dont have a hackintosh here right now so cant say which version exactly, it happened in the build before too though but seems to be a relatively new "random feature") 
the overflow is registered correctly, until i scroll.
once i scrolled vertically i can also scroll horizontally.

maybe something bugs because overflow is different in css3 than in css2 and the changes for that are messing something up?


Expected results:

no vertical scroll at all
