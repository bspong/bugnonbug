Firefox 3.0 Table characteristics of first tables are repeated in subsequent tables.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

There is some table nesting on the pages, but not much.
The top and left hand side of the page have a blue and light blue bar.
The color bars should display nowhere else.

Some subsequent tables also display blue areas.

Mozilla 2 and IE worked ok.

The page code has been w3 validated for XHTML 1.o Transitional, and passes except for a piece at the end that Yahoo adds.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Display page.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Observe the blue and light blue bars correctly displayed on the top and left of the page.

Observe all or part of the blue bars incorrectly repeated in the lower tables.

Expected Results:  
The only blue and light blue bar should be on the very top, and the left side of the page.

I have tried to reinstall.
I have totally uninstalled and cleaned out the register, and then reinstalled.
Made no difference.

I see similar repeats of check boxes in the Firefox Tools/Options menu.

I consider this a major problem, and will probably uninstall for now.  It can't render my pages.

Thanks for your help.
