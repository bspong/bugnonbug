Spontaneous switch to Dvorak keyboard layout until Firefox reload

Here's an odd bug. I installed the US-English Dvorak keyboard a few weeks ago (under WinXP's Accessibility control panel), tried it, didn't like it, and promptly switched back to the standard US-English layout. I left the US-English Dvorak keyboard as an available profile, but it wasn't selected, and of course all of my apps are set to the default layout.

Since installing 2.0.0.11 about twelve hours ago, I've had Firefox twice spontaneously switch to a Dvorak layout. When this happens, all current Firefox instances use Dvorak for all purposes (command line, textboxes in webpages, even Alt key commands for menus), while all other apps (Notepad, Word, etc.) use the regular layout.

Shutting down all current instances of Firefox and starting a new instance immediately fixes the problem. Of course, that's also not a very pleasant solution. ;)

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
This is a sporadic and spontaneous problem. In fact, the second occurrence happened while the machine was sitting unused (I left it alone for four hours with some browser windows open, and when I returned, it was Dvoraking.)
