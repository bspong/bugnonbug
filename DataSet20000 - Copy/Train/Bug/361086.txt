This problem does not reproduce using wired connection. Connecting to website with HP dv8000 Wireless Notebook computer using wireless connection to DSL Modem permits logging in to site. But unable to access game pages (online free poker). All other aspects of web site available. HP tech support feels it is a security issue with the Firefox browser. I was able to connect and fully access site with IE7. Firefox 1.5 and IE 7 are the only browsers on that computer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log in the main site using notebook wirelessly connected to DSL modem.
2.Click on Games - Texas Hold'Em - select table to play at. 
3.Site attempts to connect to Table and states loading - but will not progress beyond 8 or 9 percent.

Actual Results:  
See #3 immediately above.

Expected Results:  
Should have connected to desired table and permitted playing against actual online opponents. In identical situation IE 7 performs flawlessly. Prizewagon (beta site) tech support has not encountered this problem; most likely everyone connects using a computer that is directly wired to the phone line.

I really like Firefox but IE 7 is going to give you a run for it. My direct wired desktop connects flawlessly using Firefox 1.5. Only when I use my notebook connected wirelessly to my DSL modem do I encounter the problem. No desktop themes or screen savers are ever used on either computer. Both computers receive top maintenace including clean up and defragmentation. Both computers have up to date AV and firewalls. Zone Alarm was shut down to confirm it was not the problem.
