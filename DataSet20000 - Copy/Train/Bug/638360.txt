when I open a new tab and type a url or google search, the go back button will remain inactive/unavailable so that even after going through a few websites I can not go back by clicking the go back button because it is not active/unavailable as if I never went through those few websites, like I'm still just opened a tab or loaded firefox and haven't done any surfing yet, this did not start happening until after I updated to version 3.6.14 (32 bit windows 7 professional core2duo system with 3 gigs ddr2 ram and large hard drive) however when clicking bookmarks or restarting firefox go back button will be active, this bug only occurs after opening a new tab

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start firefox
2.open new tab
3.type url of website (like www.myspace.com, or www.google.com)

Actual Results:  
go back button will still not be active so unable to return to previous screens as you browse forward through websites, you will not be able to click go back to go back to previous website

Expected Results:  
go back button should "light up" and be clickable after progressing forward
