Scripts work slow (window manager freezes for a few seconds)

Window manager freezes for a few seconds when I'm using one script on the page (and the same pages on this site) : http://db.l2server.ru/etcitem/recipe/recipe_arcana_mace_100 
The script is very simple and there is nothing to be buggy in it. There is no bug in Windows version of FF. I tried with KDE, GNOME, Xfce - got equal results.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open page http://db.l2server.ru/etcitem/recipe/recipe_arcana_mace_100
2.Click on the red "[+]" near the link "Recipe: Arcana Mace (100%)"

Actual Results:  
The window manager freeses for several seconds (5-10). I can only move the cursor, but can't open new window etc. 
After that I saw the result of the script (invisible area became visible). Sometimes you can see the steps of the execution (semi-transparent table that becomes finally visible).

Expected Results:  
The script should be executed much faster without the effect of freeze, like in windows version. 

The bug can be reproduced, but the duration of the freeze is not constant. May be there is some connection with the size of the faded area but it is not constant for the same area. Moreover, other scripts that uses the same manipulations work well. (Try main menu - the same fade effect works well).
