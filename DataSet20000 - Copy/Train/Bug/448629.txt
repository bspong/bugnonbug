   Accessing a hometown web site http://www.wpsdtv.com/ causes FireFox to crash immediately.   Not being familiar with FireFox internals, and not having source or a debug-enabled the information left in the bug report did not mean much to me. I would suppose that there is an error in the web coding at http://www.wpsdtv.com/ but I cannot get FireFox to stay alove long enough to let me see the site source.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.wpsdtv.com/
2. watch the browser crash (at least on my machines)
3.
Actual Results:  
A "bug report" supposedly sent to Mozilla.  I have tried this several times. It doent matter if other tabs are open, or not.

Expected Results:  
  Even though the web site may have nasty errors, it should not take out FireFox. At the least give some sort of message and blank the screen or something. 

  This version of FireFox was installed as a default install.  No plugins have been added by me.
