Dragging JPEG attachment icon from thunderbird to tab bar causes firefox to hang

When viewing an email with attachments, there is a pane at the bottom of the message which displays a list of attachments with a name and an icon. For me, dragging that icon *for a JPEG image* over a firefox window *onto the tab bar* causes both programs to hang. The hang occurs as soon as the mouse enters the tab bar, before the icon is actually dropped.

I'm using nightly builds of both. Based on the behaviour, I think it is a firefox bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open an email with attachments.
2. See the pane at the bottom with the list of attachments
3. Find an attachment that is a JPEG.
4. Drag that attachment's icon over the onto Minefield's tab bar.
Actual Results:  
As soon as the mouse enters firefox, both programs hang. Killing firefox causes thunderbird to start responding again. Killing thunderbird does not bring firefox back to life, however.

Expected Results:  
I know this probably isn't a likely user action. I expected at least a protocol error message ("Firefox doesn't support imap://" or similar), not a hang. Thunderbird supports dragging attachments into the file manager; I think it would be nice to have better interaction here (though I don't know whether that's a firefox or thunderbird bug).
