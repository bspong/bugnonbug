firefox server push javascript problem

we are building a webgame using server-push tech, like the server holds the connections and keep sending javascript tokens to firefox when any new event occur. the javascript token will drive firefox to update the map/players/ etc...

however , firefox will often stop on middle of the tokens, for example, server sends following tokens to firefox:

<script>sv_GameObjectInfo('8', 'hp:5	');</script>
<script>sv_MapInfoBegin('1','xyxw');</script>
<script>sv_GameObjectCharID(100002,1000);</script>
<script>sv_GameObjectCharID(100001,500);</script>
<script>sv_GameObjectCharID(100000,1000);</script>
<script>sv_MapInfoEnd('1');</script>

often, firefox will execute on <script>sv_MapInfoBegin('1','xyxw');</script>, and then stop to execute followed tokens.

also, sometimes firefox will "delay" to execute the tokens, for example, server sent:
<script>token_1();</script>
<script>token_2();</script>

firefox executes token_1() but not token_2(), soon later, sever sent:
<script>token_3();</script>
firefox then execute token_2(), but not with token_3()...

while IE6,7,8 work well on the same game.

Reproducible: Sometimes
