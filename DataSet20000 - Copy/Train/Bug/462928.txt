Toolbar shown in java script popup (new bug in firefox v3)

Since I own a widescreen display I'm used to combine the bookmarks toolbar into the navigation toolbar, to better use the width of the screen and save space in the height of the toolbars, but have the most important bookmarks at hand, see this screenshot:

In Firefox 2 this worked great, but in v3 there is a bug in rendering the toolbar in java script popup windows. There is a crappy rest of the navigation toolbar without buttons, only the bookmarks are visible, but the toolbar should be hidden completely. This screenshot demonstrates the problem:

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. add the bookmarks toolbar to the navigation toolbar
2. klick a link, that opens a java script popup window without navigation controls or status bar
3. on top is a toolbar without navigation buttons, but with bookmark icons shown
Actual Results:  
The navigation/bookmarks toolbar is visible in java script popup-windows, see the screenshot:
http://www-public.tu-bs.de:8080/~y0016047/popup.jpg


Expected Results:  
The navigation/bookmarks toolbar bar shouldn't be visible in popup-windows.

This behavior is new in Firefox v3, it worked correct in v2.
