Steps to reproduce:

Problem recurs occasionally, but I do not yet have minimum set of reproducing steps.

(Rather than a script, it would be better if you tell me now to produce a corefile for you the next time this happens.)


Actual results:

Tab bar freezes or hangs as well as the URL bar.  The entire window becomes unusable, but the visible page seems operational.  It's just that only one tab works and the others are unreachable.  It is not possible to switch tabs using groups view either.  Although it is possible to go to the groups view and select another tab, it shows only the old tabs bar and the one page that works.  Other windows from the same FF session are not affected and work fine.

See the attaches screenshot.  It shows the tab bar from an affected window.  See several unreachable new tabs on the right, which is just one more symptom of the same problem.

This is a long standing problem, but has been happening more frequently of late.  I believe it is the same as bug 344416 that never got fixed, but I don't know how to reopen a closed bug.


Expected results:

The affected window has some rendering bug that needs to be located and fixed.
