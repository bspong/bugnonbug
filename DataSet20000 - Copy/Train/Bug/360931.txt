Acessing preference setting for some extensions from Tool menu directly no apparent way out.

This not only affects this build of FireFox 2 on OSx.3.9 but also OSX.4.8 as well.

After installation of Plug-in, or if Plug-in is already installed from upgrade fro previous version. Certain Extensions In my case User Agent Switcher 0.6.9 and Pdf Download 0.4.7 idicate the preferences setting on tool menu proper. If you go to say for example to Pdf Download and attempt to adjust preferences, from its direct listing on Tools menu; while you can adjust the preferences there is no apparent way out except to force quit FireFox.

If however; I go to Add-ons menu > extensions select the Pdf Download extension and click Preferences The menu comes up as a floating Box which has a way to dismiss the menu. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to Tool menu
2.Select the option you want open, in my case Pdf Download, User agent Switcher
3. Preference shows as a drop down box. You can adjust preferences
4. No way to get out without a force quit.

Actual Results:  
You either must Force quit FirFox.

I've since found out from someone on support list that "dismisses this a minor annoyance" That if you hit escape which is undocumented it will close 

Expected Results:  
there should have been in lower right corner a hot link that said close and the window would have rolled back up

I have a very small jpg image of the tool menu illustrating the reference to the extensions on the tool menu.

IN FireFox 1.0.5.x I was able to access and dismiss the preferences from the Tools Menu proper and could dismiss the item when finished.
