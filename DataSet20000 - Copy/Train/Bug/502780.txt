firefox hangs repeatedly on startup.
you guys should take out the "latest headlines" live bookmark that is automatically in firefox. i did not know this was in my firefox at all. i have been having crashing problems for six weeks where the machine hangs up. i had to search for three hours on the internet to find this thing. i have not added any live bookmarks on my own. this should be a feature that people can select if they want. it should not automatically be in the program so that users don't even know it's there. i have seen numerous reports of firefox hanging for no apparent reason and suspect that this is the cause for more users as well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.startup firefox
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
firefox hangs, sometimes freezes whole computer

Expected Results:  
run normally

do not have live bookmarks automatically installed. someone tell people to delete the "latest headlines" bookmark that they didn't add themselves.
