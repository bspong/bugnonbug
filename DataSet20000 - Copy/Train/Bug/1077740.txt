Reset legacy homepages to about:home
We have millions of Firefox users that are using latest versions of Firefox that have their homepage set to one of the two websites:

https://www.google.com/firefox

http://start.mozilla.org

Start.mozilla.org traffic is many magnitudes larger than www.google.com/firefox and start.mozilla.org is also a website that we control.

After Firefox 4, Mozilla created a static copy of www.google.com/firefox and hosted it internally at start.mozilla.org and it is why these two sites look very similar. We would prefer if Google were to redirect google.com/firefox to start.mozilla.org, but that is unlikely to happen.

A few years ago to help address this problem, Mozilla changed a cname to point users to start.mozilla.org instead of google.com/firefox. While that is great that they aren't using googe.com/firefox as much, when those users upgrade, they have their homepage still set as start.mozilla.org.

I recommend that we add some code to the latest Firefox such that when Firefox finds values matching regex .*(www\.google\.com/firefox|start\.mozilla\.org).* that we override the value in browser.startup.homepage to about:home. We are actively trying to get users to upgrade their browser and it appears that even after upgrading from an old version of Firefox to a recent version, their homepages are still being set of these values. 

The current experience is not good for users or Mozilla. Why? Google.com/firefox has broken UX/content and start.mozilla.org isn't much better. If we combine about:home and about:newtab in the future, these users will also be left behind because of their hardcoded values.

We are currently running A/B tests on start.mozilla.org to get old users (Firefox 3.6 and below) to update, but for some reason we have *lots* of Firefox 32 users that have their browsers set to that homepage.

In the spirit of unifying our message and offerings to our Firefox users, we should get this changed asap. We have successful about:home snippet campaigns running and the users who have their homepages set as these values are not seeing those messages. Also, the design/branding on those legacy homepages are outdated.
