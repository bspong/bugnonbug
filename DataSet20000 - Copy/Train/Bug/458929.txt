The US Postal Service web site lets you print mailing labels and even postage (which you pay for with a credit card) from their site.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work for me -- the acroread window with the postage never opens.

Some investigation suggests this is a problem with the way Firefox and Acroread are exchanging the data.

This has been reported elsewhere -- i found a recent post in forums.mozillazine.org:

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to the USPS web site: https://sss-web.usps.com/cns/landing.do

2. near the top of the page, under "You're shipping label is just a Click-n-Ship Away"  you'll see  "Print a sample Domestic or International label."  Click on "Domestic" (or "International" if you prefer).
	
3. the web site moves to a page titled "Print Shipping Labels", and underneath "Print Verification".  it shows an animation which says "Processing ..." for a little while, which eventually stops.  but no shipping label window has appeared.

4. at the bottom it says "Did your label print correctly?".  if you check "No" it will go back and you can try it again.

5. alternatively, you can click on the link labelled "System Requirements" and it will show that Netscape Navigator 6.0 (or IE 5.0) and Adobe Reader Version 5 are required.  it also has a "test your system" link.

6. you should, of course, have Acrobat Reader installed before you try this.
Actual Results:  
No postage or shipping label appears.

Expected Results:  
I expected acrobat reader to open up with my shippin label so i could print it.

i ran an strace on firefox before i tried to print the labels and have that info.  unfortunately, at 2.5 Mbyte it may be a bit large to attach to the bug report.

i also edited /opt/Adobe/Reader8/bin/acroread, a shell script, so it print debugging output of all the steps that it takes.  i will attach that.
