Windows freezes when I load a page with ActiveX and popups in Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070725 Firefox/2.0.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070725 Firefox/2.0.0.6

Firefox goes "non-responsive" and freezes the OS.  Using Internet Explorer 7 on the same site and url, IE7 handles it properly and does not freeze the OS.  The exception is "Windows Media Player"; the other exception is a Popup reference to a song list.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to url (see Actual Results)
2. Firefox goes non-responsive and freezes the OS

Actual Results:  
The only site where this occurs is GayWatch.com and requires membership to gain access.  The user profiles that reproduce the stated issues are (there are others): 

http://gaywatch.com/view_profile.php?member_id=2284
http://gaywatch.com/view_profile.php?member_id=101901

Expected Results:  
The issues are repeatable.

Firefox should handle the exceptions as IE7 does; i.e., raise the alert bar and ask for instruction (Allow Active X this time; Allow popup this time)
