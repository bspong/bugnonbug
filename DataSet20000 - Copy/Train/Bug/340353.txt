Depending on the direction you scroll in, the lower part of the article is either completely missing or shows garbage that originates from the comments below.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Allow content to load (may take a while)
2. Scroll down until you notice the article just stops with blank space (this is it)
3. Then scroll down enough so that the screen is filled with comments
4. Scroll back up fairly slowly, the blank space should now be filled with garbage

Actual Results:  
As mentioned above, browser seem to just give up displaying the content as if it has run out of memory for the DIV tag and instead displays blank or garbage content depending on the scrolling direction.

Expected Results:  
Content shouldn't be wierdly missing.

As far as I know this did not affect versions of Firefox around 1.0, it also does not affect IE or Opera but you probably don't need to know that.

It does affect Firefox 1.5, 2 and 3, and it affects the latest Mozilla. This may be Windows-only but I cannot confirm this.
