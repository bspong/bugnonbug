The installer does not create Desktop and StartMenu shortcuts if it is run with unprivileged user and Custom setup is selected (tested with FF 2.0.0.16, 3.0 and 3.0.1). This does not affect Standard setup.The QuickLaunch shortcut is always created. Additionally no "Add/Remove Programs" entry is created if the user does not have admin privileges and regardelss of the setup type.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login with a standard user account.
2. Run FF installer for any of the mentioned versions.
3. Choose Custom setup.
4. Finish the installation.
5. Try to un-install FF.
Actual Results:  
The browser is successfully installed, but no shortcuts are created on the desktop or in the start menu. If the QuickLaunch icon was selected at install time it is the only way to start FF without browsing the file system. Normal un-installation is not possible

Expected Results:  
The shortcuts selected during installation should be created in the user's profile. An entry should appear in "Add/Remove Programs" to allow the user to safely un-install FF (this is possible - install any game from www.alawar.com as a normal user; go to "Add/Remove Programs" and you will see an entry and it can be run by the same user or by an administrator; I consider this VERY user-friendly).
