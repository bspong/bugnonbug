Unable to stop partial encryption when full encryption is needed

The problem exist that even though the web site security has been 
verified the browser allows  a website to be "connection partially
Encrypted". IE has the option when setting high security to disallow the 
partially encrypted and loads it as fully encrypted but FF does not.  
This happens on numerous sites but here are two examples

97396790
Because this was allowed by FF to only partially secure these were also =
allowed onto the site

I am not sure what else was allowed through

I also use excite.com mail and sign onto their web site web with a =
secure sign in but with FF it is only partially secure but with IE I can =
keep it secure

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter http:// site.
2. Enter Name and password
3. FF automatically allows partially encrypted site

Actual Results:  
I enter the site and a lock is displayed on the bottom of the page with a line though it

Expected Results:  
There should be a lock on the bottom of the page indicated the page is encrypted.

If FF was going to allow the partially encrypted website to continue a warning should be issued that it will not be totally encrypted. There should be an  option to either allow FF to continue but either full encryption or allow partial encryption. There are obvious times when partial encryption would be necessary that is why IE built that option into it.
