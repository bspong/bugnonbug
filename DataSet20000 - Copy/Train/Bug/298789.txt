Means of identifying "bad" tabs

I frequently browse with about 20-30 tabs open.  And I frequently find that --
even when supposedly idle -- Firefox can be consuming ~300MB of RAM and 95% CPU
or more.  This is not entirely unexpected, although a little irritating.  I've
actually taken to forcing Firefox's process priority to BelowNormal so that it
doesn't interfere (much) with my other apps.

However sometimes I really do need to clean out memory and/or get spare CPU
cycles, and I don't want to close Firefox as a whole.  I'm sure that the
problems are being caused by one or two "rogue" tabs (typically either
containing lots of graphics or plugins), but at present there is no good way of
identifying them.

Expected Results:  
So: what I would like to see in Firefox is a window/dialog that shows you the
amount of RAM and CPU being used on a per-tab basis (ie. if I closed that tab,
how much CPU/RAM would it free up?).  Being able to leave that window open while
performing other actions (such as switching to the "bad" tabs, bookmarking them,
and/or closing them) would be a bonus, but not strictly essential.

As an aside, page-based JavaScript and plugins should always be running in a
thread with lower priority than the chrome, so that rogue tabs won't slow the UI
to a crawl.  Not sure if this is already the case or not, but it doesn't seem
like it.

It's not immediately obvious from the Firefox website where feature requests
should be posted.  This seemed like the best place at the time.  If it isn't,
then you need to make your website clearer :)
