alert ("We're sorry, but our LEF series intercom cannot meet the specification you have requested.\nThe LEF system supports 11 total units if masters must communicate.\nPlease reassess you requirments or look into using the LAF-C System.");
return false;

alert ("We're sorry, but our LEF series intercom cannot meet the specification you have requested.\nThe LEF system supports a maximum 10 sub stations.\nPlease reassess you requirments or look into using LAF, LDF, NEM or NDR.");
return false;

function SystemSpec ()
==============================================


the new page with list of needed products should display. Instead both Firefox and Mozilla redisplay same form with all values reset to default.
When using same form in IE 6.0.2900.2180 returns correct results.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Fill form as following:

   Step 1 - select "point to point communication"
   Step 2 - door/gate stations = 3
            mounting = flush
            vandal = no
   Step 3 - skip this part
   Step 4 - Master stations = 8
            Do stations communicate with each other = "Yes"
            mounting = "semi-flash"
   Step 5 - Check following options:
            "Door Release"
            "All Call/Door Chime"
            "External Signaling"

2. Click "QuikSpec It!" button
Actual Results:  
Displays same page reset to initial values.

Expected Results:  
The page should reload with same URL address and display detail specs for the system.

As long as all information is correct (total number of units in Steps 1-3 doesn't exceed 11), entering different options gives same result.

Entering incorrect data will display a proper error message.

Correct data produces no messages of any kind, just reloads the page.
