/contents/browser/browser.js contains a delayedStartup function (around line 1189, sorry if I mess up the line numbers but in order to track this down I had to insert a few statements) which is calling 
gHomeButton.updateTooltip(homeButton);
at around line 1247.
Within updateTooltip, "this.getHomePage()" is being called, and then without checking whether the return is null or not, the result is used.

On my system, no HomePage was ever set from anywhere, as such getHomePage() returns null, causing a silent error that prevents further initialization code from being run.

Please fix the code so that "The Right Thing (tm)" is being done when getHomePage() is null. As the delayed initialization routine seems to be somewhat vital, please consider reviewing it to prevent other failure scenarios from stopping it to finish.

PS: Yes, as a workaround you can set a homepage, but not everyone wants this...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start a clean firefox without any distro specific additions that set a default home page
2. open any website with an image (e.g. google.com)
3. right click on the image and try to execute "view image"

note: It might be possible that the homepage isn't null, but the empty string. There seems to be no way to distinguish this in the settings menu, so please be extra careful in verifying this (or just have a look at the above mentioned code, it should be quite obvious what happens)
Actual Results:  
nothing happened

Expected Results:  
image should have been displayed in the tab alone
