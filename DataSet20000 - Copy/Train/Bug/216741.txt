"OK" button does not work on Fonts & Colors menu in Options

Clicking on the "OK" button in the Fonts & Colors menu causes no action.
The only way out of the menu is to close it or click on "Cancel".

Moreover, once you have clicked on the "OK" button (with no acceptance)
and then canceled/closed to get back to the other menus, "OK" no longer
works for those menus either.  You have to close Options and open it
again to get "OK" to work with the other menus. ("OK" does work for
those menus if you don't first take the Fonts & Colors "OK" detour.)

This may have gotten broken in the recent move of Fonts & Colors under
Web Features.  I am pretty certain the "OK" button worked in this menu
previously in Firebird 0.6.1.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Tools > Options > Web Features > Fonts & Colors
2.Change some menu item (this is optional)
3.Click the "OK" button.

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.  You have to click "Cancel" or close the menu to get out.  Now
"OK" doesn't work for the other menus either.  No preferences get changed when
"OK" doesn't work.

Expected Results:  
The change should have been accepted.
