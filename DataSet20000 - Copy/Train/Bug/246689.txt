XPInstall should be allowed for all sites, not just "trusted" sites

I disagree with your solutions for malicious XPI installation problems.

>"We want to initially be able to configure Firefox so that xpinstall attempts
>from sites other than *.mozilla.org are blocked by default"

>"blocks XPInstall from "untrusted" hosts.. 
>Instead, you need to download the XPI files and open them in Mozilla on your
computer"

Well, here's a screenshot of malicions XPI installation:
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=144761&action=view

Why not:
- move default focus to cancel button
- disable "Install Now" button
- add checkbox like "I understand the risks, but I do trust [siteName]"
  checking this enables "Install Now"

/*
- if website tries to push installation again show sth like this:
  { ( ) install (x) block }
  default option, block, blocks temporary, just current browser session,
  but it increases xpi annoyance level for [siteName].. onto permanent
- xpinstall blocked if xpi located on a subdomain or subfolder
  ( xxxbar.lycos.com, www.yahoo.com/groups/xxxbar )
  subfolder check should check whole xpi URL to prevent redir expoitation
  ( xpi.php?id=/redir/xxx  xpi.php?id=http://xxx 
    eg some php calls like fopen, work over network
  )
*/

With "sites other than *.mozilla.org are blocked by default" firefox sux totally
