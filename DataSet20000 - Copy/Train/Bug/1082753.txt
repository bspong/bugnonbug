Bookmark "Open all in tabs" deletes current tabs
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:32.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/32.0
Build ID: 20140923175406

Steps to reproduce:

1. Have couple of tabs open in the current Firefox Window (Firefox for Desktop). 
2. Click on 'Bookmarks' menu and select an existing Bookmark folder or its sub-folder and right click and select 'Open All in Tabs'

Found in Firefox 32.

PS: This bug is a historical one and I don't think if it ever got fixed so thought of creating in 2014. Hopefully some dev should give a serious consideration to it.


Actual results:

The newly opened tabs overwrite the existing tabs and any previously opened tabs are deleted forever.


Expected results:

If this not a bug or "as is feature" or 'Will Not be fixed' then it should atleast warn the user that opening all the tabs will overwrite existing tabs and delete any extra tabs.

If this considered a bug "Will or probably be fixed" then it should open the bookmarks in additional tabs in the same browser window and should not overwrite or delete existing tabs of the window.

Devs: Please consider it as a serious one as it is very annoying and user is of the impression that open in all tabs will open the bookmarks in "additional" tabs for the same firefox window. I am seeing this bug being reported in different tickets since 2008.
