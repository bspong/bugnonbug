firefox makes system shortkeys (show desktop) unavailable after fullscreen

After I pressing command+shift+f to make firefox full screen, the system shortkeys (like f8-space / f11-show desktop / f12 - show dashboard / etc.) doesn't work any more, no matter firefox is the current program on top or not. Even I quit firefox, those keys are still unavailable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Before running firefox, press f11, show desktop works.
2. Start firefox, then press command+shift+f.
3. Press f11, firefox exits fullscreen mode.
4. Press f11 again, firefox turns to fullscreen mode. The show desktop function of Mac OS X doesn't work.
5. Switch the current top program to Finder (or any program except firefox), press f11, it doesn't work.

NOTE: f11 can be replaced by f8, f12, etc.
Actual Results:  
The system shortkeys doesn't work after starting firefox and turn it into fullscreen mode.

Expected Results:  
Firefox shouldn't act this way. Since we can toggle fullscreen mode by command+shift+f, f11 is not that useful, esp. f11 is a system-wide shortkey. And currently we cannot customize shortkeys of firefox, so there's no way to turn f11 off.
