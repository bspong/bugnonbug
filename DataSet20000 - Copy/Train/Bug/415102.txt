close multiple tabs prompt confusing on multiple workspaces
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.10) Gecko/20071015 SUSE/2.0.0.10-0.1 Firefox/2.0.0.10

Under some circumstances, File->Quit fails with no obvious cause.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure multiple workspaces under X.  Details may vary with desktop environment (Gnome vs. KDE vs. ...)
2. Open a Firefox window.
3. Open at least one new tab (Ctrl-t will suffice).
4. Open a new Firefox window (Ctrl-n)
5. Move the new window to a different workspace by whatever method is appropriate.
6. Open at least one new tab (Ctrl-t)
7. File->Quit
Actual Results:  
Assuming you haven't previously told Firefox not to warn in such cases, each window will get its own "closing multiple tabs" confirmation dialog, each dialog in its own workspace, and the windows won't close until all the confirmation dialogs are handled.  In some cases, the first such dialog appears on a different workspace, and the user gets no feedback; the visible Firefox window is dimmed but does not close.


Expected Results:  
One confirmation dialog, properly worded, ought to suffice for all windows, and it should appear on the current workspace.  After confirming, all windows should close.

I'm using Gnome/metacity.
