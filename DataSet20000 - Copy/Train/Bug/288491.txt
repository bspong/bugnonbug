The wikipedia site loads painfully slow 'sometimes' in firefox. I have used
apple's spin control tool to see what is happening. It seems that the following
functions take about 6 seconds to complete. I have loaded the wikipedia site
manytimes with the windows version of firefox and it never takes quite as long
as on the mac. This seems to happen on linux too but not as severe as on the mac.

nsBlockFrame::Reflow(nsPresContext*, nsHTMLReflowMetrics&, nsHTMLReflowState
const&, unsigned int&) 

nsBlockFrame::ReflowDirtyLines(nsBlockReflowState&, int)

nsBlockFrame::ReflowLine(nsBlockReflowState&, nsLineList_iterator, int*, int)

nsBlockReflowContext::ReflowBlock(nsRect const&, int, nsCollapsingMargin&, int,
int, nsMargin&, nsHTMLReflowState&, unsigned int&)

nsBlockFrame::ReflowBlockFrame(nsBlockReflowState&, nsLineList_iterator, int*)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start with a clean profile
2.load wikipedia english site
3.watch the spinning beach ball

Actual Results:  
The spinning beachball appears for few seconds then the page loads

Expected Results:  
The pages should appear instantly (providing you have broadband) like it does
with the windows version of firefox, and apple's safari.
