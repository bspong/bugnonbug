Latest update killed Firefox, now opens with only a blank, empty window.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.0.7) Gecko Galeon/2.0.6 (Ubuntu 2.0.6-2)
Build Identifier: No access

Firefox was working more or less normally before I installed the update.  Since  installing the update this evening (3/6), closing Firefox and restarting it, launching Firefox by any method only brings up a blank, empty window with nothing but the title bar.

(Am using Galeon to file this report.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open by clicking on Firefox icon in panel.
2.Open by clicking on a link to a web site in email (Thunderbird).
3.Open by clicking on Firefox icon in Applications menu.
Actual Results:  
Firefox opened with nothing but a blank, empty window with the Mozilla Firefox title bar at the top, in every instance. No address bar, no menu bar, no tool bar, nothing but an empty, blank, white window with only the title bar.

Expected Results:  
It should have opened either with the specified home page (Foxnews in this case) or in the same state as it was in when I shut the computer down from the previous session without closing Firefox first.

Was having problems with video before this happened, will not play Web videos from likes of Foxnews, CNN and local TV stations, and YouTube videos frequently cause it to crash, otherwise it was working fairly normally.  Now nothing works.
