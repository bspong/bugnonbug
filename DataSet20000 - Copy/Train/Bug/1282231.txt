Oddities in WHAT's NEW (Release Notes) - no longer "new", can't see upcoming

Steps to reproduce:

Under HELP, click "About".



Actual results:

ABOUT shows current version, plus a link to "What's New".

(i) If the current version was installed awhile ago, then the info is no longer "new".

(ii) If a new version is imminent (update pending), then there is no way to see what is new in the release about to be installed.

(iii) If a new version is imminent *AND* FF is configured for automatic updates, then the update starts automatically without allowing the option of seeing what's coming in the new release.  (Maybe we don't want it just yet...)


Expected results:

Case (i):  Current version should read "Release Notes", which is more truthful.  (There appears to be plenty of room in the current location beside version number).  Link to current release notes (as now).

Case (ii):  Add "What's New" to the UPDATE panel and link to release notes for the new release about to be installed.

Case (iii):  Add "Release Notes" to HELP menu so someone can get release info from there too.  This could be a sub-menu with two choices:  "Current Release" which would like to current release notes (as now), and "What's New" which (if possible/if practical) would resolve to the next release.
