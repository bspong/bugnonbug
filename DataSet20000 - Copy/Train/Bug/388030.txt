Go to the URL www.cnn.com or www.msnbc.com and click on the RSS Icon.  These sites offer a multiple choice of feeds.  Click either and note the Domain Highlighting goes away.  Clicking Back then results in the location bar no longer displaying the Domain Highlight across all tabs.  

Clicking on the location bar and then in the webpage body restores the Domain Highlighting.
