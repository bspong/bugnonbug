Opening Firefox 3 second time causes home page to display Google, not selected homepage.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

When I open Firefox 3 a second time in a single day, instead of my selected homepage opening, it opens a general Google page.  The "Home" icon does not take me to my selected homepage.  Also, when this happens, my Foxmarks bookmarks do not load, and trying to synchronize them causes Foxmarks to crash.  Finally, when this does happen the address does not update when I click on a link from any page.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox 3 for the first time on a given day.
2.Close the browser.
3.Open the browser again.
Actual Results:  
Firefox displays a Google start page.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should display the homepage I selected in the using the options from the Tools menu.

I have now seen this same behavior on three separate platforms.  One was running Windows XP (SP3) Home Edition, one was running Windows XP (SP3) Professional, and one was running Windows XP (SP3) Media Center Edition.  On all three of them I have the following extensions loaded:
FoxMarks
NoScript
AdBlock Plus
