The initial website for login is here:

You may have to input the company name of "Lengemann" to acquire the error I am getting. It has only come up in the last two days and is repeatable. I have to use (UGH!) Internet Explorer to access my time account, for which I have used Firefox extensively for quite some time now, at least until the last couple of days.

After accessing my particular company, I get the following error:

ezLaborManager does not support the browser version you are using. Most current versions of Internet Explorer and Firefox are supported, but very new or "beta" versions may not be supported.
Please contact your system administrator for assistance.

The browser version you are using is:
Mozilla Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Ant.com Toolbar 1.5 Firefox/3.5.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Is this a Mozilla problem or an ADP.com problem?

Reproducible: Always
