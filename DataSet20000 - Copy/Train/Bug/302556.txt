For CSS first-letter, the first-letter font-weight of bold is removed after you
click and and holding on a link and drag.  This is not conforming to the W3C
standard.  The correct behavior is observed in IE6.  Also, after you apply a
background-color to an outer element of that CSS first-letter, the first-letter
property is removed.

The CSS for the problem is:
body {
    font-size: 14pt;
    font-family: monospace;
    background: url(background_compass.gif) no-repeat fixed;
}

a, a:link, a:visited {
    color: black;
    text-decoration: none;
}

div#link {
    margin-right: auto;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-top: 4px;
    padding: 4px;
    width: 200px;
    border: 1px black;
    border-style: none dashed none dashed;
    text-align: left;
}

div#link::first-letter {
    font-weight: bold;
}
div#link:hover {
/*when hovering, it will remove the CSS first-letter property*/
background-color: yellowgreen;
}

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Apply the detailed CSS.  Apply a font-weight to a first-letter property of
an element.
2.  (Remove the hover property) Hold and click and drag the element, so the link
is not clicked.  OR:  Apply the detailed hover property above and just hover
over a <div id="link"> element with an <a> inside

Actual Results:  
With the CSS div#link:hover in place, the font-weight: bold; on
div#link::first-letter is removed.  

With hover not in place, you click, and drag the link, and drag somewhere else
on the page, and the font-weight of bold is removed from the element.

Expected Results:  
According to the W3C standard, the font-weight for the ::first-letter property
should still be applied even after a hover, or a mouse drag.
