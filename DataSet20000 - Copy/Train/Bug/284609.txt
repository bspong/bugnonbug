Pages are always rendered to at least width of status bar contents, but window shrinks further causing the scroll bars to be hidden.

Note - Best way to understand this bug is to try the steps to reproduce I give
below.
It is possible for Firefox to render any page using a width bigger than that of
the window provided. The scroll bars are then rendered on the edges of the page,
not the window making them impossible to access without increasing the size of
the window.
I noticed this when using Forecast fox with 7 days and nights displayed in the
status bar. When you shrink down the width of the window the page does not
shrink below the width of the Forecast Fox contents, but the window does shrink.
This is a problem because the scroll bars remain out of window on the edge of
the page so they cannot be used.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Forecast Fox
2. Configure Forecast Fox to show 7 days and 7 nights of weather forecasts.
3. Browse to http://www.slashdot.org (or any site seems the same)
4. Reduce the width of the window and notice how the vertical scroll bar is lost
completely and the right hand edge of the horizontal scroll bar is lost too.

Actual Results:  
The vertical scroll bar is lost completely and the right hand edge of the
horizontal scroll bar is lost too.

Expected Results:  
The status bar contents should not have any bearing on the minimum page width.
Even if this was desirable, I would expect the scroll bars to always align with
the window not the page, otherwise they are not useable.


Suggests to me that the window width and page width used by the renderer are
able to get out of line with each other. Perhaps a issue with Firefox / Gecko 
interaction ?
