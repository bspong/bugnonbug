When clicking on a link in my gmail - to open in a new tab - I get the "firefox prevent page from automatically redirecting to another page" SOMETIMES. Seemingly with certain sites, like facebook, while other sites will open it. - This while firefox is opening sites, I have never visited or clicked on, in new tabs, I have not opened.

Then, with some sites, like fb I can go back and forth, but other sites, like "http://forum.virtualwritersinc.com/index.php" I repeatedly have to click on "allow" to go back and forth, between pages in the site.

The reason for selecting that preference, was to prevent the unwanted sites to open, not for firefox to not open limks, I have clicked on. The other problem is that I would like consistency.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open gmail, click on link - facebook would not be allowed, but other sites may be allowed
2. Open site, send message/post - it would not allow the page that should open.
3.
Actual Results:  
1. facebook would not be allowed, but other sites may be allowed
2.it would not allow the page that should open.

Expected Results:  
1. Firefox should not open pages in tabs, if I did not ask for that site to be opened - link/bookmark/ whatever way chosen
2. If I clicked on a link - that page should open, without me having to "allow"
3. If I am in a site - that sites pages should be opening - I do not want strange pages to open.
