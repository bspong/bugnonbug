Navigating to a submenu item with the keyboard arrows, then moving the mouse around in the same menu, will cause the highlight to constantly jump back to the one you selected with the keyboard. It doesn't affect the functionality of the menu -- even though the highlighted item is different from the one under the cursor, clicking on an item will cause the one under the mouse cursor to execute.

The effect disappears when the submenu is closed (by moving to a different submenu within that menu, or moving to a different menu). If you get deep into sub-submenus, the effect only takes place on the topmost one, where your mouse cursor is.

The effect happens any time keyboard navigation is used to get to a submenu, i.e. it doesn't matter if you go mouse-keyboard-mouse, keyboard-mouse, or any other combination you choose.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a menu that has at least one submenu (say, the View menu).
2. Use the keyboard arrows to go into a submenu.
3. Move your mouse cursor around in the parent menu - you'll notice the highlight is under the mouse cursor for a fraction of a second, then jumps to the one you chose with the keyboard when you stop moving the mouse.
Actual Results:  
The highlighted item remains on the one chosen with the keyboard.

Expected Results:  
After moving your mouse into the parent menu, the submenu should close.
