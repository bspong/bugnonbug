Attempting to select submenu items under compiz after lengthy gnome-screensaver lock closes a menu.  Fixed by focusing another app
I've run into this bug repeatedly on two different laptops.
Both are running Ubuntu Linux 10.10 x86_64 and Firefox 4 nightly.

One was running Hide Menubar and the other, Compact Menu 2, to achieve a similar
compactness of space as under Windows / OSX needed on laptops with limited vertical area.

I'm fairly certain I've reproduced this in my clean test profile too, though, with only NoScript installed (which offers a context menu sub menu).

At any rate, on both machines, Firefox would work fine for a while, then suddenly all sub menus would be unselectable.

That means if I right clicked on the context menu, and attempted to access the NoScript submenu, the context menu would immediately close on attempting to mouse over into that submenu.  Or, in Hide Menubar, if I clicked on the Minefield button and hovered over Help or Preferences to get those sub menus, the Minefield button menu would close.  Same thing with Compact Menu.

Sub menus aren't too common in Firefox without addons which may be why I've never had any luck in finding other reported bugs on this.

Anyway. Restarting Firefox fixes things for a while, but it is annoying.
