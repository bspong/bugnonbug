option (in preferences or even in about:config) to disable the switch before button release in tabs.
This option should improve experience when organizing tabs by not exposing the user to interface lag cause by tab switch (rendering) and not causing confusion by loosing tab positions (cause by the switch and by the rendering of the close button changing the original and the switched tabs' width).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. left click a tab and don't release mouse button.
2. release left click.
Actual Results:  
The tab is selected/switched to in the first step.

Expected Results:  
tab should only be switched to/selected when left click is 'released', not 'on click', and only if not dragged.

The behavior makes very annoying and slow to organize you opened tabs, as there's latency every time tab switches (it becomes even worse when firefox is opened for some time or extensions like Weave are "working".), also, if you're opening tabs from a website and wants to drag these tabs near the original one, it's hard to keep track of the original one when switches to other tab (the problem it actually worse now that by default, tabs have their specific close buttons instead of the unified one on right of the tab bar, as tabs keep changing their sizes when selected.)

If this behavior is necessary for some kind of accessibility concern, an option to turn off this behavior should be enough for users' taste (even in "about:config" should be enough).
