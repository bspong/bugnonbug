Print preview - ALT-F4, close button, Ctrl-W should do the same

Regression from bug 178485

Prior to that bug being 'fixed' Alt-F4 and clicking the 'X' (titlebar close
button) did what was expected by most Windows apps and exited print preview,
returning the user to the page they were viewing.

Ctrl-W was the only key combo that was doing the wrong thing.

Expected results:
Alt-F4, close button (the titlebar 'X' and the one on the toolbar) and Ctrl-W
should do the same (exit print preview).

Actual results:
Since bug 178485 was fixed Ctrl-W and the toolbar close button now work as
expected, but Alt-F4 and 'X' close the window entirely which means if only one
window was open then Firebird will exit.

This is the wrong behaviour compared to other Windows apps.

Load up Microsoft Word , enter Print Preview and press Alt-F4 and it just closes
Print Preview and returns to the window you were typing in before.

Typically Microsoft, excel (XP) does something different, it ignores ALT-F4 in
print preview and the close button is disabled.

In IE Alt-F4 exits print preview only - I know IE's print implementation is
hackish and is really another Window on top of the print preview Window but
that's hidden from most users as it doesn't get an extra entry in the taskbar
and the window is the same size and placed directly above the current one.

However, in all cases Alt-F4 or clicking the close button will not close the
underlying window.

'Dataloss' keyword because if you've filled in a form that's not been submitted
when you were printing then you'll lose its contents.
