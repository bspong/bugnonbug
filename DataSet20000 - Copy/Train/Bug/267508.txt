scrollbar appears on  a table with width and/or height equal 100% over the whole page

Sometimes, without any reason, there are scrollbars appearing on my page
(horizontal and/or vertical). It seems to be random if they appear or not
(perhaps it has to do with rendering the page, set a size while build it up and
then some changes were made or so...)


Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. open www.flirtcom.net
2. make sure, you shouldn't scroll the page at least horizontally
3. if the scrollbar stays, the error occured, if not, click a little bit around,
change pages, switch back, until you get a redundantly scrollbar (I can produce
it horizontal only or sometimes also both of them

Actual Results:  
scrollbar(s) wouldn't disappear, also if you resize the window to a size you can
be completely sure you don't have to scroll.

Expected Results:  
scrollbars shouldn't appear in this case

It seems to be a bug in newer versions - I've never seen that before the whole
time I used firefox.
- I've made code canges on the page
- I used the default Firefox theme as usual under Windows XP
