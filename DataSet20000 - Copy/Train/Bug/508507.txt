1,) When first started, system (including KDE, X, mouse) hung for a while completely, then KDE session crashed, after relogin firefox did work

2.) Independently of any website: loading of new pages takes always at least 2 seconds; first, the browser shows no reaction (clicked button does not change, in progress icon does not change etc.), then, suddenly, new page shows

3.) From time to time, loading of new pages causes system to hang as described under (1), and KDE session crashes; new login is possible afterwards
