The above mentioned page is actually used within a frameset. But now without the frameset something weird happens:
If you visit the link above and click one of the numbers, the page opens up in the same window, although the anchor-target is "main" (without the frameset there's of course no frame called "main" and therefore it should open up in a new window/tab).

But what's actually strange is that if you save the page outside of the cache ("on your hd") and then click a link, it opens up in a new window.

I can't really imagine this is part of a W3-Recommendation.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the page above
(2. Look at the page source in order to spot target="main", but no frame called "main")
3. Click a link on the page, it opens in the same window.
4. Download the page mentioned above (you don't really need the images).
5. Open the downloaded html-file.
6. Click a link, it opens in a new window.
Actual Results:  
"Online" it opens in the same tab, "offline" it opens in a new one.

Expected Results:  
AFAIK always open in a new tab.
