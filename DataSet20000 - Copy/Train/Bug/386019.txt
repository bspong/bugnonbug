Firefox install fails. The browsing window itself has almost no width.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-GB; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5
Build Identifier: http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/products/download.html?product=firefox-2.0.0.4&os=osx&lang=en-GB

The browser installs ok and opens fine with tabs, icons, etc all showing nowmally. But below this the browsing window itself has almost no width and you can see it all compressed into a narrow veetical on the LHS of where the browser window should be.
Firefox 1.5 works fine with no problems.
There were 16 Warnings and 4 Errors in the Error Console. I have captured these and can send them by email if required. 
I guess the key thing is one of the Warnings - Error in parsing value for property 'display'

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Also failed on earlier build of 2.0.0.x
2.Uninstalled and Re-installed.
3.Revert to 1.5 and all is fine (no reboot required).
Actual Results:  
Just install 2.0.0.x and it does not work.
The whole 'content' window is compressed into a full height window but with a fixed width of maybe 5mm.

Expected Results:  
Worked like 1.5 - with a full width content window.
