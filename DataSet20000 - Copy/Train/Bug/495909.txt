Trouble after installing Vista Service Pack 2

Installed Vista Service Pack 2. After this Vista shows Microsoft C++ Debug Libary when starting Firefox. With ignore it opens, but Debug Assertion Failed windows remains. Deinstallation and reinstallation of Firefox does not change result. 

Text of debug message:
Microsoft Visual C++ Debug Libary
Debut Assertion Failed
Programm: C:\Program Files\Morzilla Firefox\firefox.exe
File: f:\dd\vctools\crt_bld\self_x86\crt\src\isctype.c Line: 68

Expression: (unsigned) (c+1) <= 256

For information on how your programm can cause an assertion failure, see the Visual C++ documentaion on asserts.
(Press Retry to debug the application)

Then Buttons Abort Retry Ignore. Ignore starts Firefox, but message remains

Thanks
Roland

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. abort, aborts firefox
2. retry changes nothing, but tries to find solution an then blocks firefox, with task manager an stopping firefox restart is possible
3. ignore starts firefox with than can be used.


Expected Results:
