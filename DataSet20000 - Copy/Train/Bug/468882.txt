I just installed Firefox 3.0.4 on a Dell Inspiron 8000 running Windows 2000 Pro SP4 and am having a problem with adding new bookmark folders. When I right-click on a bookmark document or folder object and select the "New Folder" option the modal dialog box for entering the new folder name appears, but the dialog box does not immediately close when I click on the "Add" button. Instead, the dialog box remains open for a very long time (15-20 seconds), during which time I am unable to proceed. This was not an issue with previous 2.x versions of Firefox on my system. Please let me know if and when you will have a patch for this problem. The attached screenshot illustrates this issue with 512MB of memory maxed-out.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.right-click on bookmark document or folder object.
2.select "New Folder..." option.
3.click on the "Add Folder" dialog box "Add" button.
Actual Results:  
The "Add Folder" dialog box is not dismissed for 15-20 seconds, thereby hanging Firefox.

Expected Results:  
Immediate creation of new bookmark folder and dismissal of "Add Folder" dialog box.
