Regression: At launch time, FireFox 2.0 doesn't open local file with correct URL
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

If Firefox 2.0 is launched by double-clicking a local HTML file, the location bar shows an URL of the type "file://localhost/Users/...", but if Firefox is already running and you open a local file, its URL shows as "file:///Users/..."

This bug screws up local files that use cookies. In the first case, the cookies are stored under "localhost" in the "Show Cookies" window. In the second case, the cookies are stored under an empty string.

This bug did not exist with Firefox 1.5.0.7. The files were always opened as "file:///Users/..." and their cookies were stored under an empty string.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure Firefox 2.0 is already running
2. Open "cookietest.html" from the attached testcase
3. ==> note how the URL shows as "file:///Users/..."
4. Click on the "Click Me" button a few times.
5. Reload several times the window
6. ==> note how the counters are increasing
7. Quit Firefox 2.0
8. Double-click "cookietest.html" to open Firefox 2.0
9. ==> note how the counters came back to 0
10. While Firefox is still running, double-click "cookietest.html" again
11. ==> note how the counters have the good values again

Actual Results:  
If you launch Firefox by double-clicking a local file, the URL shows as "file://localhost/Users/..." and the cookies are stored under "localhost".

Expected Results:  
The URL should shows as "file:///Users/..." and the cookies should be stored under <empty string>, which is what happens if the file is opened when Firefox is already running.
