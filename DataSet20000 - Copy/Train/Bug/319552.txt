I use the URL history as a MRU bookmarks list, but sometimes I want to be able to control what goes in there and what gets purged.

Here's an example:
I go to a fatwallet.com, click on the hot deals forum, then accidentally hit the Go button.  The URL history thinks I put this URL in there when I didn't, so it saves it.  I never type this URL in again, but it leaves it there because I visited the URL multiple times by clicking on my fatwallet.com URL history item, then clicking on the hot deals forum link.

The only choice currently is to purge all my URL history and re-enter everything.  Or convert those items to bookmark entries of course.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to a web site's root page
2.click on a forum area
3.click the go button
4.notice the forum area's URL is put in the URL history even though you didn't type it in
5.wait a few weeks (while still visiting site 1 and clicking through to the forum)
6.notice that the forum URL is still in the URL history

Actual Results:  
- extra URL history entries are not purged as expected
- extra URL history entries are entered when you don't expect them to be


Expected Results:  
- Go button stores URL that you browsed to when it should really store URLs that you typed in
- extra URL history entries should be purged if you don't visit them directly (if you click through and visit the URL, the history should purge it because you didn't go to it from the menu)

I'd like the Bookmarks editor to be able to be used to edit the URL history so we have full manual control over it.
Add a content menu entry to the Go button to let us edit the URL history.
