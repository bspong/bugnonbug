Setting a bookmark's Description to be the same its Keyword will make the custom
keyword for that bookmark not work. Erase the Description or change it to
something else and the custom keyword for that bookmark works again.

I stumbled upon this because I thought it would be useful to set the description
to be the same as the keyword so I would remember the keyword easily by just
browsing the bookmark manager.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Bookmark Sidebar or Bookmark Manager
2. Right-click a Bookmark and choose "Properties"
3. On the Info Tab, set the Keyword to something (Ex.: foo) and the Description
to the same value (foo)
4. Click Ok
5. Go to the Address bar, enter foo
Actual Results:  
Example 1:
Name: Blue's News
URL: http://www.bluesnews.com/
Keyword: blues
Description: blues

DOESN'T WORK, I get a 404 on http://blues/

Example 2:
Name: Blue's News
URL: http://www.bluesnews.com/
Keyword: blues
Description: whatever

WORKS, I enter 'blues' in the Address Bar and it goes to http://www.bluesnews.com/


Expected Results:  
The custom keyword should work for a particular bookmark no matter what the
description for that bookmark is. I see no reason for any change in behaviour
based on the value of the description field.
