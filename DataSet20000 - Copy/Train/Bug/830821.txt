Restored window not redrawn until clicked with TreeStyleTab
http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/f9deba82d43b

STR:
- install tree style tab
- have saved session with two windows, the first maximized and the second "restored", i.e. not in the maximized state
- restart

Actual:
- the second window (that is not maximized and displays over the maximized one) doesn't redraw correctly
- there is no treestyletab bar, but normal firefox tabs as usual
- large gap at the bottom
- clicking the title bar fixes it

Expected
- all draws correctly

There were no update to TreeStyleTab AFAIK, I use current version 14.2012122901, just to Aurora, I think.
Other symptoms are that TreeStyleTab doesn't reflect changes to setting of tree expand arrows (Add-on/TreeStyleTab/Options/Appearance/Tree Twisties) and leaves them at default [-] and [+] ugly buttons.


In the error console I can see:

Error: namedNodes.counter is null

From the code:
namedNodes.counter is set to this.document.getAnonymousElementByAttribute(aTab, 'class', this.kCOUNTER_CONTAINER)

Where |this| is TreeStyleTabBrowser and its document is taken from aWindowService.document in the constructor.  This seems to be something we are responsible to call for the extension.  However, I believe the document is correct.

Looks like from some reason call to

			counter = d.createElement('hbox');
			counter.setAttribute('class', this.kCOUNTER_CONTAINER);

at TSTBrowser_initTabContents to create the element is prevented.

Going to investigate.
