ATM when you type something in the Address bar ("AwesomeBar") and press [tab], the cursor goes to the Search bar (next in tab index).

I figured it would be really handy (especially for keyboard junkies like me) if I could start writing in address bar, then figure it's actually a search (sometimes happens), press [tab] and the text gets copied to the search bar where I could continue my input.

I'd find it really convenient to just [alt]+[d] -> type -> "oh noes I want to search that" -> [tab] -> [enter] -> ??? -> PROFIT!!

The same would go for copying text Search bar -> Address bar via [shift]+[tab].

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Focus on Address bar (click or [alt]+[d] or [ctrl]+[l]
2. Type
3. [tab]
Actual Results:  
4. Cursor goes to search bar, leaving your text behind
5. Type all that stuff again
6. [enter]
7. Win!

Expected Results:  
4. Cursor goes to search bar, right behind the text you started writing
5. [enter]
6. Win!

The same would go for copying text Search bar -> Address bar via [shift]+[tab].
