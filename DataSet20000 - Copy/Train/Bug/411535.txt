Using Open All in Tabs (from right click menu) does not work at all in Places for Firefox 3.0b2. Instead of opening all the tabs from bookmarks in a various folder of any size, only one, blank tab is opened alongside any currently opened tabs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click "Show All Bookmarks" or otherwise open Places
2. Select any folder with bookmarks, be it the toolbar or within the Bookmarks Menu
3. Right click to find the option to open all bookmarks in tabs.

Actual Results:  
Notice how only an empty, untitled tab is launched. If "Open All in Tabs" was selected from the Bookmark Toolbar folder, then the launched empty tab replaces the currently open tab. If any folder of bookmarks is selected, then the launched empty tab is placed alongside currently opened tabs.

Expected Results:  
I would expect all the tabs to be opened alongside currently opened tabs. Otherwise, at least prompt to replace open tabs with the new ones that are supposed to be opened. Right now, none of the "Open All in Tabs" are opened from Places.
