XP BSOD (bluescreens) with Google fiber connection

Steps to reproduce:

I have XP SP3.  When using a very high speed connection (Google Fiber), Firefox either crashes or XP restarts or dumps memory (blue screen of death).  This has happened many times.  It only happens when using the ultra high speed connection.  It is very easy to reproduce when on news websites that load and pre-load lots of content.

Steps:
1) Use XP and a high speed connection
2) Start visiting news websites that load and pre-load lots of content, such as www.msnbc.com, but I have reproduced it on various news websites.
3) Visit pages until your computer crashes, usually within a few minutes, as you open various pages.


Actual results:

I have noted one of several results repeatedly:
1)  My computer usually will suddenly begin a physical memory dump, giving me the "blue screen of death",
2)  A few times my computer has just restarted, without the "blue screen of death", a friend with XP has also had this occur several times, or
3)  My friends computer will usually just have Firefox crash.

I have been able to reproduce this repeatedly and a friend using a different computer and the same fiber connection has also replicated it.  We have done it at two different localities that have Google Fiber connections.


Expected results:

I should have been able to continue using the browser and my computer.
