I have a Logitech MX1000 Wireless Laser Mouse which has side buttons for 'Back' or 'FWD' selection.  It worked prior to Firefox version 1.5.0.5, but not since.  It does work in all other 'non-Firefox' programs and Windows XP Pro functions. I have to use the 'back/forward' arrows in order to change pages in Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox v1.5.0.5 & later
2. Select any webpage
3. Press 'Back' button on mouse to return to previous page
4. "Hour Glass" appears next to the pointer briefly at first touch of mouse button, but nothing else happens. The 'hour glass' does not reappear with subsequent presses of the button.


Actual Results:  
In order to return to prior webpage, it requires clicking on 'back' arrow in toolbar, or Right-Click on mouse then select 'Back' in selection window.

Expected Results:  
It should have flipped back to the prior webpage as it has done in the past prior to version 1.5.0.5

My mouse 'back/fwd' function buttons do work with Internet Explorer, iRider, and Opera browsers.
