Potential DoS: Hang 100% cpu when open a large text file

The site is legitimate but it (currently) has a bad mime type.  Therefore the 9meg wmv gets treated as a text file.  

Opening a large text file causes Firefox to hang.  clicking the Stop button has no effect.  I have a reasonably fast (1.5Megbits) dsl connection, waiting for about 7 minutes did not recover from this condition.

AFAICT This problem (with large text files) was first reported in 2005 as part of bug: 242426 but since this issue was only a side note in that bug no action was taken towards it.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open this link  http://media.xored.com/eclipsecon2007/dltk-tcl-debug.wmv

Actual Results:  
Result: Browser Hangs, thus I am calling it a potential DoS because the only way I could get out of it was to kill the browser.

With NoScript Enabled, the browser is totally non-responsive.  

With NoScript Disabled the browser responds with glacial speed on a 1.7GHz Pentium M.  But you are still not able to stop the download or achieve any useful response from the browser.


Expected Results:  
At minimum should be able to stop the download with the Stop button


Here are the headers:

I would expect this website to fix their mime-type bug in the near future.  But you should be able to reproduce this problem with any 9 meg text file.
