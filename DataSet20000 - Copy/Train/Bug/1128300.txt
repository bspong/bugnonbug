Firefox Sync error verbosity, '413 Request Entity Too Large'
Created attachment 8557625
Portion of log from 'about:sync-log'

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:37.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/37.0
Build ID: 20150125004007

Steps to reproduce:

1. Enable Firefox Sync
2. Install 'Stylish' userstyles add-on
3. Install 'Stylish sync' add-on that will sync your styles
4. Install 20-30 user styles
5. Firefox Sync will start crashing silently


Actual results:

Status bar at the bottom have appeared, saying 'Sync Error: Unknown Error'. I have not managed to find any other solution, before I went to 'about:sync-log' debug log.

  "413 Request Entity Too Large"

Out of curiosity, I went to Firefox Sync 'Terms' page and there was no information about maximum sync size at all. I went to Stylish add-on, deleted all disabled userstyles, and Sync have (silently) started working again.


Expected results:

• There should be more detailed error message in the bottom notification bar. Should say: 'Sync file is too large', instead of 'Unknown error'.
• It should specify maximum sync file size on 'Terms' page
• Preferences 'Sync' tag and 'Firefox Account' page is not helpful at all. It should display how much space I am using and how much is left.
