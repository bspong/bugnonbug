The following gives a correct menu resize in IE and Mozilla, but not in Firefox.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to www.reengineeringllc.com
2. click on Internet Business Logic
3. click the GO button
4. select SemanticResolution1 from the menu in the middle of the page
5. at the top of the page, choose "Choose an agent and go to its question menu"
6. click anywhere on the page
7. in the resulting Question Menu, click the first sentence
8. you should get a wide window containing just that sentence
9. in the sentence, click on "some-prop" 
10 a small new window appears. In it, click on "Choices"
11. another window appears, fisrt blank.  Then it quickly resizes and  shows a menu.  In IE and Mozilla, the resize is done correctly, but in firefox the menus is positioned wrong.  In othe cases,yo actually have to resize by hand to see the menu.  
Actual Results:  
Window resize after it is first displayed ignores the resize width params, or interprets them differently from IE and Mozilla

Expected Results:  
Should work the same as IE and Mozilla

Compatibility with Mozilla is very important, and in this case compatibility with (sigh) IE is desrable too.
