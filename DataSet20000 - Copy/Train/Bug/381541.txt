I finally found the reason for a problem I had for a long time with FF 2 (and possibly also with 1.5).

Pop-up windows always appeared narrow - no matter if they were without specific dimensions or with specified width and height.

It turns out that when there are many taskbar icons, no matter what add-on they belong to, the width of pop-ups shrinks. The more such icons are there, the narrower pop-ups appear. I made thorough tests, and found out that this was the problem.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install a large number (say 8-9-10) add-ons that add taskbar icons.

(I made sure it does not matter which add-ons are used. Mine are:
colorzilla, fasterfox, firebug, html validator, zotero, TMN, scrap book, server spy, google notebook.)

2. click a link that opens a new resized window, preferably narrow one, so the effect is clearly visible.

3. You can gradually enable or disable these add-ons to see the how this effects pop-ups behavior.
Actual Results:  
sized pop-ups appear much too narrow.

Expected Results:  
sized pop-ups should appear with the dimensions specified by the javascript command that opens them.

sized pop-ups should appear with the dimensions specified by the javascript command that opens them.
