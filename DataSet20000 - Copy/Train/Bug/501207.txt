Display area of window does not fill its portion of the window while viewing wowarmory.com

Each page loaded from wowarmory.com loads with the page display area filling only a portion of its space in the browser window. This causes a gap of around 100px between the right-hand scroll bar and the application border, and also between the bottom of the page (or bottom scroll bar, if present) and the status bar.

Scrolling in the blank space has no effect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Visit any page from wowarmory.com


Expected Results:  
The page display area should fill its section of the application window.

Issue remains after a clean install. Tried using a Portable Firefox build (3.0.11), which had the same problem.
Any actions that resize the page display area (resizing the application window, opening the sidebar, opening the Firebug pane, etc.) temporarily fixes the issue, but it appears again when the page is reloaded or a new page is loaded.


Will attach a screenshot, if necessary.
