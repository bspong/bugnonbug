Secure sign on (SSL I guess) fails after a few uses, stating that my broswer is rejecting cookies

I use e-Bay a lot.  I use the secure-sign on feature.  For many features, e-Bay
requires occasional re-verification and thus a new sign-on.  This sometimes
happens unexpectedly.  After a while, I have to exit the browser and re-load
before it accepts cookies again.

This is an extremely aggravating problem.  It _always_ happens eventually, and
e-Bay is already so aggravating that this problem is just the last straw.  As it
is, I have to go back to using the blecherous Microsoft product because I can
no longer stand this aggravation.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Sign on to e-Bay and bid on, say, adult auctions which require occasional
reverification
2. Wait until you are really need the browser for quick action, and notice that
Murphy requires at these times for the reverification step to be performed.
3. Observe that the browser has suddenly stopped accepting cookies so that you
can no longer sign on and then watch your favorite auction item evaporate into
someone else's "win" column.

Actual Results:  
I decided to stop using this product.

Expected Results:  
The software should continue to accept cookies even after repeated sign-ons.
