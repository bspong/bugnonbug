Firefox loads new java when app requests older java, then asks to use older java.

When using Rosetta Stone online foreign language apps Firefox starts loading the app and starts spitting out errors, then says the app wants to use an older version of java.  At this time you can click to use the older version but by now the app has already crashed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to play a rosetta stone foreign language app online.
2.
3.
Actual Results:

Click OK

Fatal Application Error: #2121

Click Exit the Application



Expected Results:  
The app starts normally, possibly poll which version of java should be used BEFORE attempting to load the app.

On my windows version it asks whether or not to use the older version of java (after it spews out errors) then continues to crash.  On the linux version it just seems to spew out the same errors then crash.
I think if Firefox were to figure out which java version it needed before trying to run it, the app would not crash.

This app works fine in Internet Exploder (Just to rub some salt in it =P )
