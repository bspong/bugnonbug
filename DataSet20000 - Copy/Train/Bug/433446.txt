When I wish to use a certain addon that is not supported by Firefox 3 Beta 5 (FF3B5) I close the browser, click 'Save and Quit' to save my current web pages, and then open Firefox 2 (FF2). After I am done, I usually switch back to FF3B5 because it seems to be faster over my *awesome* dialup connection. This has only happened to me twice, but sometimes when I close FF2 and open FF3B5, it loads fine, but with no Forward or Back buttons! That end of the Navigation Toolbar just seems to disappear. De-selecting and then re-selecting the Nav bar does not bring it back, nor does resizing the window. Upon restarting FF3B5, the Forward and Back buttons reappear, right as rain. I tried to reproduce the bug, but couldn't with any accuracy whatsoever. Maybe it has something to do with saving the current web pages?

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open FF3B5, load a couple of pages in different tabs.
2. Close FF3B5, and make sure to click 'Save and Quit' to save the pages.
3. Open FF2.
4. Close FF2.
5. Open FF3B5.
Actual Results:  
Haven't been able to reproduce the bug when I want to, only when I'm doing homework :), but sometimes the Forward and Back buttons disappear.

Expected Results:  
The forward and Back buttons should not have disappeared (I don't think...)
