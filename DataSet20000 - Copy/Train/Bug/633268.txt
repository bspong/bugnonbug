Alert on startup: "Could not initialize security component"

This dialog pops up and suggest various sources of the problem, none of which, when remedied, solve the problem.  I also cannot find help on the Support forum, e.g., McAfee Security.  

I am using McAfee, version 1.0.0 patch 1 (915), with McAfee Anti-malware version 9.0.0 patch 1 (4156), DAT version 6251.0000.  This application doesn't offer the same preferences or configurations on the Mac (OS 10.6.6) as is shown on the Support site for Win OS.

Since the security component is unavailable, I cannot access my bank or investment sites, such as E*Trade, and so on.

I am speculating as to whether deleting the browsing history (cache, cookies, etc) may actually be deleting some critical components, but again, this is an uneducated shot in the dark.  I can't think of anything else I have done with the app that would have caused the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. double-click app icon
2. get alert/error msg
3. app starts, runs normally, but unable to access any https:// sites
4. remove app, download, re-install
Actual Results:  
get the  alert dialog: "Alert <space> Could not initialize the applications security component. The most likely cause is problems with files in your application='s profile directory <<where is this EXACTLY?  A path and identifiers would be extremely helpful here>> Please check that this <??>> directory has no read/write restrictions and your hard disk is not full or close to it <<it isn't, not by a long shot>>>  It is recommended that you exit the application and fix the problem <<how?? some Steps here would be helpful.  The forum offers no help in my case>>  If you continue to use the session, you might see incorrect application behavior when accessing security features."

Reinstalling the application does nothing to change this.

Using the Beta build 4.0 doesn't work either by the way, bookmarks are all inactive.

Expected Results:  
I expect that:
1. the dialog offer more support and steps to take
2. that the problem on the support site is analyzed and remedied in a more thorough approach.
