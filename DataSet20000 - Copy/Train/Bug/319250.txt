Shortcut icon is often re-requested if it doesn't exist

If a page has a SHORTCUT ICON reference to a file that does not exist Firefox will try to re-request pretty often.

It will happen if the user visits another page and presses "back" to the page. It will even happen when just switching tabs between the page with the "broken SHORTCUT ICON link" and another page.

Furthermore it seems like Firefox will try to request the .ico file twice at first.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Activate a packet sniffer or livehttpheaders
2. Visit http://stock.ter.dk/iconreload.php (or another page where the SHORTCUT ICON points to a non-existent resource)
3. Switch to another tab and back again. Or press a link and press browser's back button.

Actual Results:  
Firefox attempts to request the .ico twice (when visiting the page the first time), and then requests the .ico every time the user switches to that tab or visits the page even in history.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should only request the .ico once, and not again when switching to the tab or visiting the page when going back in the history.

I think this behaviour is inconsistent with other resources not found (e.g. a non-existent stylesheet or a non-existent picture). The 404 headers returned for a non-existent stylesheet and a non-existent icon are the same.

Of course there is nothing to do about a broken reference, but the behavior for link rel="SHORTCUT ICON" and link rel="stylesheet" could at least be the same when the resource could not be retrieved. At least unnecessary requests could be avoided.
