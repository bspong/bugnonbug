Performance degrades over time -- continually seeing the spinning beachball
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-GB; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

If I keep the firefox browser open for a long time (for example, I last restarted it about 24 hours ago), the performance gradually degrades until it is virtually unusuable.  For example, while typing into this text box, I am continually seeing the spinning beachball and it's pausing then blurting out a few words to catch up with my typing!

I have launched Spin Control to monitor the unresponsiveness this morning while I am submitting this report.  The longest recorded case of  the spinning beachball is 49 seconds and I have included the text report of that below.  Usually, though, it's between 5 and 10 seconds interruption.

If there's any more data I can provide, please let me know.  If you can talk me through using Shark to profile in more depth, I'd be happy to do that, though I've never used it before myself...

Oh, one other note. Recently, two things happened.  I upgraded to Firefox 2.0 and I started using Gmail.  It wsas after doing both of these that the slowdowns became apparent.  GMail has been open in a tab for most of the past 24 hours.  However, it is currently closed and the problem is still apparent.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Run firefox.
2.  Use it for a while.
3.  See spinning beachball!
