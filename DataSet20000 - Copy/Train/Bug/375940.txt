When going to various websites, a stop script message will appear (which is common) and the browser will freeze. I must then force it to close.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up various video streaming websites, open up about 20 at once (and make sure the sites are varied and the more obscure or cluttered layout the better.)

2. Wait for the websites to load or just do something else like edit something in a word process or play a windowed game until a firefox message appears about a script.

3. Try to stop the script or continue the script via the box firefox brings up.
Actual Results:  
The browser freezes.

Expected Results:  
To be able to stop or continue the script.

Could you please do what should have been done in the first place and

1. Give the user an option to not be bugged about scripts???????? Duh? You could have a click box saying "Don't warn me again..."

2. Could you please put in that box also, a section which explains what this script is, it's file name, and which URL is giving the problem (and not just the basic url but the specific one).

Please.
