Very large print spool sizes when "Print Background (colors and images)" option is selected in the File > Page Setup dialog box.

When I try to print certain web pages the print spool grows to about ~100 megs and takes several minutes to print. It doesn't seem to matter what printer I sent the job to.  An example page that causes problems is any record from the Georgia Tech library's catalog search (http://gil.gatech.edu/). 

I think this bug is related to bug 360754. If I unselect the "Print Background (colors and images)" option, the spool file size for a record from the the above url is only about 450k.

I don't recall this printing problem always happening, meaning I think it has just started happening with one of the more recent Firefox upgrades.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure that the "Print Background (colors and images)" option is selected in the File > Page Setup dialog box.
2. Go to http://gil.gatech.edu/, type in any search term and click on the first catalog record that comes up.
3. Print the page and watch the spool size grow!
