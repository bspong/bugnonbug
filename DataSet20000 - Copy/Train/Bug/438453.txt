MSN and CMud open IE instead of Firefox with Firefox set as default on Vista 64x Ultimate

Every Time I Install Vista + Firefox, The Associations Don't Work Properly. Just Looked Into It And The Fix Is As Follows:

Start->Control Panel->Default Programs->Set Program Access And Computer Defaults->Custom->Choose A Default Web Browser->Mozilla Firefox

Leaving it as use my current web browser, even though firefox is my default web browser according to the icon in start menu, and Outlook 2007 manages to open it correctly, but throws an error (as reported in a previous bug), opens things in IE still

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Step 1. Install Vista x64 Ultimate
Step 2. Install MSN, CMud (Or possibly other programs) That Launch URLs
Step 3. Click A URL In Your Chosen Program
Actual Results:  
Links open in IE

Expected Results:  
Links open in Firefox

Has happened to me every time I install, on multiple different machines. Only thing I can see in common is Vista x64 Ultimate + Firefox :D
