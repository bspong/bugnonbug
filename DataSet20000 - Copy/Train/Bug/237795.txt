When you open the options dialog and use the "Stored Cookies" dialog to add
domains to your block list, if you then immediately open the "Exceptions" dialog
those new entries do not show up.  You must completely exit the Options dialog
and reopen it to view your new entries in the "Exceptions" dialog.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the "Options" dialog
2. Open the "Stored Cookies" dialog
3. Click the "Do not allow..." button and remove some cookies
4. Close the "Stored Cookies" dialog
5. Open the "Exceptions" dialog

Actual Results:  
The domains added in step 3 do not show up in the Exceptions dialog

Expected Results:  
The domains added in step 3 should show up in the Exceptions dialog

If after step 3, you close the "Options" dialog and then reopen it and open the
"Exceptions" dialog, the new entries will show up.

I have noticed this behaviour for several weeks on various builds and with a new
profile.  Just noticed that there wasn't a bug for it (that I could find anyway).
