Error when URL handling application is moved
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When the path to a URL handling application changes and Firefox can't find the executable, I get an error message that the files at the URL cannot be found.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add a handler for a new URL type to the registry (for anonymity's sake:  "foo-bar")
2. Click a link to a URL of this type in Firefox for the first time ("foo-bar:url-with-info")
3. Select an application to handle the URL type 
4. Check "Save selection for foo-bar links"
5. Change or rename the directory the selected application lives in
6. Correctly re-set the URL handler in the registry
6. Try to open the same URL in Firefox again
Actual Results:  
An error message shows up:
File Not Found
Firefox can't find the file at [URL]
    * Could the item have been renamed, removed, or relocated?
    * Is there a spelling, capitalization, or other typographical error in the address? 

Expected Results:  
Either Firefox should just show the selection dialogue again so the user has a chance to enter the correct path, or it should read the location of the URL handler application from the registry in the first place instead of saving it locally. 

Failing that, it should at least indicate that the handling application is missing. In this case, the message was entirely meaningless as the URL was used to pass info between a web site and a desktop application, which was not really helpful in finding the source of the problem.
