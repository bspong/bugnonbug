Just re-installed Windows XP this Wednesday, downloaded my trusted browser Firefox. Today I was surfing around (CDN university sites, colleges, my union). I got the update/restart browser message. When it Firefox restarted, I went to google, did search, clicked on a link, then clicked on my Back button but I was trapped. I had to go to the address bar to return to Google and re-search for the same topic. WEIRD! I have scanned the snot out of my system to ensure it is not a browser jacking and I just installed the update on my Vista Based Laptop-same results.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download/Install the Update
2.Restart browser
3.Surf the web to any website
4. Click on Back button... locked in
Actual Results:  
Tested on Vista, exactly the same issue

Expected Results:  
Back button should have functioned as desired and programmed to (return to previous page)

DOM Inspector is the only add in installed
AHHHH I had to use I.E. 7 to research my Psych Paper!!!
