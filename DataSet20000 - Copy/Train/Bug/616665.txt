Firefox locks and freezes and then needs to be force shut down to work again when multiple tabs are opened Other major issue is that Firefox quits often when go into print web page mode as well-again often varying and different web pages. Seems to happen when have more than say 6 tabs open at a time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.link from email to web pages to multi tabs
2.especially more than 6 tabs
3.freezes and cant move between tabs and becomes slow to load tabs
Actual Results:  
Had to force quit Firefox When reopen to restore sessions always get this is embarrassing page

Expected Results:  
Firefox restarted but then often refroze unless I shut down a few pages. This happens on any web pages so I cant pinpoint any particular websites that are main culprits I have reopened these websites again individually and are fine and also in other browsers and are fine

I am getting sick of Firefox crashing and freezing and not sure if my version is bugged or as it  does have add ons these are corrupt and maybe should go back to "clean" version I always update the add ons when info is asked to update and are approved add ons only
