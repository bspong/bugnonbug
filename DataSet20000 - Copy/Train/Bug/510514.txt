When I right click in a popup window and click on Reload, it reloads but it also relocates the popup window and always at the same place.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a popup (in my case it is a stock market trading site)
2.Move the popup window somewhere other than where it came up
3.Right click in the popup, click Reload
Actual Results:  
The content is reloaded and the popup window is moved.

Expected Results:  
The content to be reloaded without the popup window moving.

- I have two screen and it relocates on the local screen and always at the same place.  On my main screen it is in the middle of the screen.  On the secondary screen, it is on the left edge two thirds down.  My two screens have different resolution (primary:1600x1200 and secondary:1200x1600) aligned on the bottom edge, the secondary on the right.
- I installed "ReloadEvery" addon, that's why I saw this problem, but reloading manually does the same as the auto reload.  I did not retry without the addon.
- In my particular case it is a popup on a https site.
