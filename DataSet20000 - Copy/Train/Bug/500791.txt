frequent, multi-second lags and pauses

After running for a while, Firefox gets very laggy.  After a couple days, these hangs slowly grow long enough to have complete "gee, did I have the browser window focused?  Oh, there it scrolls" trains of thought.  This manifests as:

Lag, in the middle of scrolling, especially with the mouse wheel or keyboard, though sometimes by dragging the scroll bar as well;
Long delays before there's any response on many UI events (eg, clicking on another tab);
animated GIFs pause;
flash videos freeze while playing;
typing input stops, whether in the address bar, search box, or in a form, and then catches up after a few seconds;
100% CPU consumption by the firefox[-3.5] process during the lag;
user gradually uses more profanity.

Watching "strace -p `ps -C firefox-3.5 -o pid=` -e '!poll,gettimeofday,read,futex,writev,select'" shows that the lag always occurs during a flurry of madvise(xx, yy, MADV_DONTNEED) calls, sometimes preceded by writing files to the profile.  Based on strace, these events are frequently triggered by: mouse in, or click on a link, or click on a tab, or begin scrolling.

Here's a backtrace from breakpointing at an madvise call during mouse wheel scrolling:

Note: this backtrace is from a time when the lag is not happening, due to a recently-restarted firefox.  I'll upload a better one when I get it.

Just at a guess, there may be two related bugs here:  #1, excessive memory fragmentation or inefficient garbage collection; #2, garbage collection being scheduled at the worst possible time (IE, on user-interaction-active events).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox.  Web surf for 15 minutes to 2 days with normal heavy-web-user habits, until lag becomes pronounced.
2. Open a smooth, looping, animated GIF:  http://www.fur.com/~keepiru/DancingPeaks.gif
3. Use strace command above
4. Don't touch anything, and see madvise calls correlate with long pauses in the animation
5. Try generating events (mouse in, click tabs), and observe madvise calls / UI lag



This bug has persisted across Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04 with Firefox 3.0 to 3.5b4 (Ubuntu builds), and is reproducible with Firefox 3.5rc${recent} from Mozilla.org.
