Java plug-in no longer supports 'Use browser settings' for network connections with Firefox 38
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686 on x86_64; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0
Build ID: 20150504194141

Steps to reproduce:

Run Firefox 38 (or 38 ESR) with Java plugin installed (JRE 1.8.0_45 - from java.com) and attempt to load the Java applet from <https://www.java.com/verify>

I'm running Firefox on Linux (CentOS 6.6) with network settings set to 'Auto-detect proxy settings for this network' - i.e. no direct connection to the Internet


Actual results:

The Java plug-in loads (I'm asked to activate it) but I just get a grey box and eventually the message 'We are unable to verify if java is installed and enabled in your browser.' 

The same happens with various other Java test sites


Expected results:

The Java applet will run and report the version of Java installed

This works with all previous versions of Firefox (i.e. FF 37 and FF 31 ESR)

If I change my user Java preference (via 'jcontrol' that comes with JRE) to not ''Use browser settings" - in my case "Use automatic proxy configuration script" and give the URL to my local autoconfig pac settings - the Java applet runs fine

i.e. it appears that he Java ''Use browser settings" setting (the default) no longer work with Firefox 38
