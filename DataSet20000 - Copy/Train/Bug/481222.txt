Add-on window and "thanks for updating" screen shows up every time I start Firefox

Somewhere between Firefox 2 and Firefox 3 were released I started having an odd problem after an update, and I've had it every since.

Almost every time I start Firefox (I'd say there's a 90% chance of it happening), I'm greeted with the add-on window.

When I close it, a new window appears asking me to check for updates to a few select add ons (these add ons aren't compatible with the latest Firefox- I just never bothered uninstalling them since I wasn't using them anyway).

Finally, after closing that window too, Firefox starts, and I'm greeted with the "Thank you for updating to the latest version of Firefox" page, even if there's been no new update.

Note that on the rare occasions where the add on window doesn't appear, Firefox starts just fine, like it should.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox
Actual Results:  
Add on window, update window and firefox "Thanks for updating" screen appeared.

Expected Results:  
It should have just started without all the fuss.

This problem started happening after a Firefox update.
