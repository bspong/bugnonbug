Stop button remains active on some sites such as Facebook, "Waiting for ..." in status bar

With some sites that automatically update their contents, such as Facebook, clicking on the Stop has no effect: the Stop button remains active (doesn't gray out), which is a problem when one has chosen to merge the Stop and Reload buttons. If the mouse pointer is not over a link, the status bar permanently shows something like "Waiting for static.ak.fbcdn.net..." (in case of Facebook). This bug seems to occur when there has been some problem with the connection (such as an ADSL reconnection?); thus old requests to servers may not have been closed properly.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a Facebook main page (e.g. "Fil d'actualité" in French).
2. Wait (maybe for several hours or days), reloading from time to time.
3. When the Stop button remains active for a long time, click on it.
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens. Clicking on the Stop button several times has no effect either. (In the case of Facebook, the site still updates the page with new contents, but this is normal.)

Expected Results:  
The Stop button should become disabled (grayed out).

This bug occurs both under GNU/Linux (Debian) and Mac OS X.

I've also noticed that after an ADSL reconnection, normal page loading never times out; this may be related.

Perhaps the same bug as bug 326757. If this bug is dupped, please set platform/OS to All/All.
