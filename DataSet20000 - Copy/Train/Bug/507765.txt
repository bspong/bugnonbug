No progress indicator on mouse cursor when pages load

Please put back the progress indicator on the mouse cursor during pageload. In fact, please fix progress indicators in general - there are none available by default!

It is very frustrating being unable to discern whether a page is loading or the browser has crashed, as the behavior is the same for both conditions. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a page
2. Navigate to another page, preferably one with a long load time, either by clicking a link typing a URL into the address bar and pressing enter
3. Observe the confusion that ensues.
Actual Results:  
I had no idea whether the browser had crashed, as I could not click any other links on the page after navigating elsewhere and my current page was still visible, or if the page was just loading and the browser was working fine.

Expected Results:  
I expected some kind of default progress indicator, preferably in the footer bar as well as on the mouse cursor.
