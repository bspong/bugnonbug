When calling window.setTimeout, the first argument can be a function or a string. I would expect the following 3 arguments to work (to call a previously defined function called myFunction):
  1. "myFunction()"
  2. "myFunction();"
  3. myFunction
I would expect the following argument NOT to work
  A. myFunction()
In this example A, I would expect the function myFunction to be executed and the result being used as argument.

In a script I will append, you will see that it is exactly the other way around!
I realy feel that this is a bug and that it should be addressed. The same code in Internet Explorer works as expected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Look at the HTML page I will append. (To understand the code.)
2. Close every instance of FireFox.
3. Open 1 instance of FireFox and use the first window it creates! (This is important!!!)
4. Use the HTML page and click the 4 different buttons.

Actual Results:  
Only the 4th button will give the alert (because it is executed directly) and it produces an error/warning in the error console.
The other buttons will NOT WORK.

Expected Results:  
The three first buttons will work as expected.
The 4th button gives the alert and issues an error. (As it does now.)


I have the following add-ons installed:
Flagfox (3.3.15)
GooglePreview (3.22)
Header Spy (1.3.3.2)
Java Quick Starter (1.0)
JavaScript Debugger (0.9.87.4)
(Microsoft .NET Framework Assistant - 1.0 - incompatible)
Web developer 1.1.8


When I open several instances or tabs, the script does work. So it is always the first instance in the first window.
