Long web pages are truncated while printing
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3 GTB6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3 GTB6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

With Firefox 3.5.3 on Windows XP Pro SP3 when trying to print this long web
page from: 
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/10/05/fraudulent_paypay_certificate_published/print.html
only the first page is printed as 1 of 1.
When I go to the "print story" icon on the top of the page it correctly prints
all 3 pages, but with different layout of the ads.
In IE 8.6001.18702 it correctly prints 2 pages with no ads.

The problem is similar to BUG 154892

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Goto http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/10/05/fraudulent_paypay_certificate_published/print.html
2.Print the long web page

Actual Results:  
Only the first page is printed as 1 of 1 with an ad embedded

Expected Results:  
Two pages should be printed with no ads embedded

Maybe the trick is to avoid including the ads like IE does.

I'm forced to use IE to print long web pages correctly. This bug and its variants have been open since 2002 for almost 7 years.
