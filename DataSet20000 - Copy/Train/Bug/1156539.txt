CPU looping with many windows/tabs
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:37.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/37.0
Build ID: 20150402191859

Steps to reproduce:

This bug is intermittent, but happens to me several times a day.
I do not know what you can do to reproduce it.
(I know, why report it then? Because it's a huge headache for me every single day.)
It has been happening for months.
It probably has to do with having many (20+) windows and many (120+) tabs open.
(I know, you've tested Firefox's JavaScript responsiveness with over 1000 tabs open, "so there cannot possibly be any problem with many open windows and tabs"...).
Before a few months ago, I never had more than about 10 windows at a time, and this never happened to me.


Actual results:

Often, Firefox will just suddenly start CPU looping. On my 4-CPU (8 Logical CPU) Intel machine, it will eat usually 15% CPU (where one whole CPU is reported as 12.5%, I think), but sometimes 20%-30%.
Sometimes I notice because Firefox is being slow in response to mouse clicks, etc. and I look at the Task Manager : Performance : CPU graph (which I always have up). Other times, Firefox actually goes into (or in and out of) the "(Not Responding)" state.
This happens a lot when I wake from idle (monitor shuts off after 5 minutes, but disks are not spun down). CPU graph shows spike at wake, then CPU munching.
Today it happened when I typed Alt T O, to get into Tools>Options.
You may suspect bad JavaScript code, but I've only gotten the non-reponsive script pop-up about 4 times out of the last 100 encounters of this bug (and those on Facebook tabs).


Expected results:

No random CPU looping.

(Sorry this bug report is so vague.)
