Hyperlink always displays file not found, incorrectly
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7

The page is from STLPort, which should be good at standards compliance. The ONLY
link that does NEVER open is the topic titled "How to build libraries for
Windows ...". To make matters worse, I remember opening it some days before.
Whats even more strange, is that if I edit the HTML file and change the
hyperlink from <***>/DCForumID7/2462.html to, say: <***>/DCForumID7/2459.html,
the other page (2459) will not open anymore either. Even if I change everything
back or reload the web document, I cannot open both those pages. Its like
Firefox remembers that they do not exist.

And Internet Explorer 6 SP2 opens it fine.

If you do not hurry to check it out maybe the page may change (its a forum) and
the bug will not be reproducable. In that case, I have a copy of the exact page.

Thank you for your support

Reproducible: Always

Everything is like the standard config of the installation.
