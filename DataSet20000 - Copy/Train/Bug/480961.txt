There is a long delay after left or right clicking a - link, image, button or email address before anything happens.  The delay is 15-25 seconds.  This does not happen on all websites, just most of them.

As examples of web sites where it does happen:

http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/
http://sev.org/
http://www.google.com/

If I right or left click on any of the blue links there is a long delay before anything happens.

As an example where this does not happen:

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the web site
2. Right click on a link
3. Wait for the submenu to open
Actual Results:  
On any of the first three sites there will be a 15-25 second delay before the submenu opens on the other site it will open immediately.

Expected Results:  
I expected no delay on any site.

I thought it may be a bad add-on so I removed all of them (4-5) and I desabled all plugins.  - No effect

I then un-installed firefox and re-installed it with no add-ons and the problem is still there.

I have been forced to go back to IE as this makes firefox unusable.
