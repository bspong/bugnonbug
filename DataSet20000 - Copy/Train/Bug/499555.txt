Safer shopping feature suggestion:
Now that shopping on the web is ubiquitous, we need ways to help improve the user's safety. There are so many scams that even more sophisticated users are getting taken and it gets worse every day.

The automatic Phishing detection built into browsers is great, but we need to take this to the next level.

After my wife got scammed by an on-line merchant, I got to thinking: why can't browsers automatically pop up a warning to users if a site they visit has poor BBB ratings or numerous complaints about fraudulent business practices on other consumer sites?

This would really help consumers get over their fear of the web and on-line purchases.

Consumers need a way to protect themselves *transparently* - without having to research every company they purchase from using Bizrate or similar websites, which aren't very complete, anyway.

Having this built into the browser would dramatically reduce the risk to the consumer and also greatly improve the safety of the web for many users.

Every browser needs an option for this feature. Together, we can starve these nefarious businesses that engage in deceptive practices.
