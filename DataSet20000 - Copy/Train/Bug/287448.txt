Entries in installed-chrome.txt are duplicated when Firefox is installed over an existing installation
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Waterleopard/1.0.2 (Firefox/1.0.2 rebrand)

When Firefox is installed the installed-chrome.txt file is created if it does
not exist and all the default chrome entries are added. 

If the installed-chrome.txt file does exist, all the default chrome entries are
appended to the bottom of the file even though they already exist in the file.
The end result is duplicate entries in this file.

The installer should only add lines that aren't already there.

This has been around since at least 0.9.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox
2. Install something that adds an entry to installed-chrome.txt (step may not be
necessary).
3. Install Firefox over existing installation (eg: 1.02 over 1.01)
4. Look at installed-chrome.txt

Actual Results:  
Each line was duplicated.

Expected Results:  
The installer should have not added any lines to the installed-chrome.txt file.
