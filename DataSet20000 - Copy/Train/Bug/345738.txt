about:config increased font size still uses original font size for selection
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; FreeBSD i386; en-US; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060720 Firefox/1.5.0.4

when using the about:config in the addressbar, and increasing the font size (at all), the highlighted configuration option still remains at it's original font size.  For example, an original font size of 10, increase the font size to 20.  Highlight any line, and the highlighted option is still size 10.

Able to reproduce on Win2000/XP Firefox 1.5.0.4, and custom build firefox 1.5.0.4 on FreeBSD 6.1 (all from source).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. enter about:config in addressbar
2. Use CTRL & NUMPAD+ to increase font size (two or three times is a good marker)
3. highlight any line as if to make a change.

Actual Results:  
The highlighted line item still remains at it's original size.

Expected Results:  
The highlighted line item should follow font size

Since I was verifying this on both Microsoft Windows 2000/XP and FreeBSD (with source build, including OS and applications), the buildconfig will vary.  Cannot obtain the Windows buildconfig at this time (in FreeBSD).
