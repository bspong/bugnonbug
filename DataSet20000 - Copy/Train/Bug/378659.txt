Firefox UI frequently becomes broken; removing places.sqlite "fixes" it

my second places.sqlite that triggers the bug

Twice in the last two days, Firefox (Mac trunk debug) has refused to start up properly until I removed my places.sqlite file.  The address bar doesn't update properly, the bookmarks toolbar appears empty, etc.  There are a bunch of history-related errors in the console:

JavaScript error: , line 0: uncaught exception: [Exception... "ServiceManager::GetService returned failure code:"  nsresult: "0x80570016 (NS_ERROR_XPC_GS_RETURNED_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/places/controller.js :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 1373"  data: no]
