After unchecking all checkboxes under 'Advanced Javascript Settings' on first using the browser, they are now 'stuck' unchecked. On checking any or all boxes and clicking OK to return to the Options dialog, if 'Advanced' is clicked again, then the boxes will still be checked. However, if you check the box then click OK on the Settings dialog then OK on the Options dialog, to go back to the browser, then the Advanced Javascript functions will continue to be disabled (will not work) and when Options is reopened the boxes will all be unchecked again. It is not just the checkboxes being unchecked, all the functions are actually disabled and cannot be re-enabled.
