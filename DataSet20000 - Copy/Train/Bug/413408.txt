This may not be a true bug as it is based on a CSS hack, however the hack renders correctly in Firefox 2 and IE7 so I figured I'd report it anyways.

When you use the CSS hack found on this website:

...it doesn't work correctly.

Note that I basically followed that hack to the letter. The only difference between my code and that code is the margin-bottom number is 398px to match the size of the image in my footer, however that is explained in the hack thread itself.


It brings the image up into the bottom of the page rather than below the page. If you go to the url www.temple-of-lore.com/siege911, you'll notice that it only happens on the Homepage and the Contact Page. I'm not sure why the other 2 pages render correctly but when I was messing around with it, I noticed that occasionally the other 2 pages had the same problem. I haven't been able to reproduce it on those pages though.

Also note that the results may vary depending on screen resolution. I was able to reproduce it on a laptop with 1280x768 resolution and only on the contact page with 1280x1024. I recommend a resolution with a height no larger than 768px.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Change screen resolution to 1024x768 or other medium/low resolution setting.

2. Visit www.temple-of-lore.com/siege911
OR
Follow instructions on http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/showpost.php?p=1239966&postcount=3 using a fairly large image as the footer with not enough text to cover the entire screen.
Actual Results:  
The footer image goes up and behind the text on the index page and contact page.

Expected Results:  
The footer image should be just below the last piece of content as it does in Firefox 2 and IE7.
