toolbar icons (like back button and refresh button) distorted after FF crash, (arrows at end of bookmark toolbar don't show drop down menu, but that seems to work ok now)

The icons of the buttons on my toolbar (like the back button etc.) are distorted, i.e. they don't display correctly (only half with the rest of the imagery blurred)
I have uploaded a screenshot here: http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v507/holasuperthomas/screenshottoolbardistortediconsbug.jpg
They showed like this after i reloaded firefox after a crash when playing kdice, an online game found here: http://kdice.com
The icons in the adjust-menu ( i don't know how to call it), also shown on the screenshot, have the same problem. When changed to small icons, the small icons  display correctly. Furthermore, the bookmark toolbar has little arrows to expand it to a drop-down menu on its right, and that doesnt come up either when clicked on.
Correction: oh, now it does.
