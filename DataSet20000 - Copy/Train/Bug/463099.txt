Firefox - object background not transparent for audio/mpeg controller, shows white
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092414 Firefox/3.0.3

The core problem is that different OSs, using different audio controllers (Totem, Quicktime, WMedia) require different heights for their controller. Thus there will be unused space for the thin ones - like quicktime - if the tall ones - like WindowsMedia - are going to show fully. This leaves an ungly white or black box, either around or above the thinner controller, UNLESS THE BACKGROUND IS TRANSPARENT. Which it unfortunately isn't.

See the example URL above, which is bare-stripped HTML code to demonstrate.

I've viewed this from Mac and Intel hardware, and through Mac, Windows, and Ubuntu OS, in serveral combinations (Firefox, IE, Chrome).

Only Safari on Mac does it correctly - it allows the background to show through the extra vertical space that the controller does not use. 

On my home machine, Firefox, using Quicktime, shows white bars above and below the Quicktime controller. 

(Chrome did the same thing, on a Toshiba running XP.)

IE using WindowsMedia also fails, but differently: it shows black instead of white, and puts the controller at the bottom.

Firefox on Ubuntu 8 does the same, except using the Totem player.

(Firefox on Windows XP has another separate problem - it doesn't show a controller at all.)

I've tried all combinations of parameters for the object that I can find, including wmode transparent, but nothing corrects it.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set up valid object tag for audio/mpeg. Code can be as in my example above:

####CSS: 
	body { background-color: blue;  }
####HTML: 
<body>
	<object type="audio/mpeg" data="../Poems-recs/She_comes-vA1.mp3" width="140" height="70">
		<param name="src" value="../Poems-recs/She_comes-vA1.mp3">
		<param name="autoplay" value="false" >
		<param name="autostart" value="0">
	</object>
</body>

2. View page through Firefox, Safari, Explorer, Chrome
3. If height in HTML, or in CSS, is taller than the controller chosen by the OS to render the audio/mpeg object, then white will show above and below for Quicktime, and black will show above for others. They should be transparent, or at least there should be a way to make them transparent.
Actual Results:  
white border, black border

Expected Results:  
background should be transparent
