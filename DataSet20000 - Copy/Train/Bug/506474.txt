Constant "Firefox must resend data" message
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Almost every site I visit causes a "Firefox must resend data" prompt to appear- sometimes clicking "cancel" resumes normal functioning, sometimes clicking "ok" resumes normal functioning. Received that error 15+ times attempting to log in to bugzilla. I checked to see if this problem had been reported before, and other users reported it occurring when they used the "back" button. This is not the case for me- it occurs often, and repeats itself irregardless of which option I select. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Go to bugzilla.mozilla.org and attempt to login, or eBay.com and attempt to login, or gmail.google.com and attempt to login
3.
Actual Results:  
A dialogue box appeared, saying "Firefox needs to resend data" (or something to that effect). Upon clicking "OK", dialogue box immediately reappeared. Upon clicking "Cancel", dialogue box immediately reappeared. Upon closing dialogue box 2-3 times, it finally stopped.

Expected Results:  
Same.
