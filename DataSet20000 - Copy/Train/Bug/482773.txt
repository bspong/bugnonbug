When I visit certain web pages, all or some of the text is unreadable. Not unreadable because it displays as microscopic (as sometimes happens on a Mac when sites are designed for PC viewing), but rather as literally gibberish characters rather than English language letters and words. It doesn't happen on every site, but it does happen on the page URL referenced above, as well as others I have viewed. I tried increasing the font size, in case it was just too small to be properly rendered, but it was then just larger gibberish.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to the URL above and view.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Still see the text within the page (non-graphic text) as gibberish.

Expected Results:  
Rendered the text as English.

I have not added any add-ons to Firefox, I am just using the latest build 3.0.7. When I was first offered the option to upgrade to 3 from 2, I did and ended up going back to version 2 due to this problem. I figured it would have been resolved by now, so I went ahead and upgraded to 3 and then recently to 3.0.7 - still have the same issue. This is a problem for Mac users.
