Steps to reproduce:

I'm creating a webextension, this is in my manifest.json:

++++++++++++++++++
"options_ui": {"page": "options.html"},
  
"permissions": ["contextMenus", "storage", "tabs"],
++++++++++++++++++

The options.html file has as a last line before the closing body-Tag:

<script type="text/javascript" src="options.js"></script>

The options.js file has (e.g.)
chrome.storage.local.get({
		language: 'de'}, ......);

I'm loading the extension from a local file (via about:debugging),


Actual results:

When I open the options page, firebug tells me "ReferenceError: chrome is not defined"

This might be related to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1197346 (see comment 13/14, I couldn't find any bug opened for this issue)


Expected results:

chrome.storage.local.get should work 

Even the documentation at

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Implement_a_settings_page

says, that it should work! You can copy the complete example from that page and you'll get the ReferenceError.

Either the documentation is wrong or the implementation is missing.

This is happening on Firefox 48.0 on Kubuntu. I'm attaching the source of the example (copy and paste from the documentation above) for convenience.
