Hi

Every time I load Firefox, my home page comes up.


When I try to type, nothing shows up on the screen.

If I wait (approx) 3 minutes, then eventually I can type.  

If I type before the 3 minutes, eventually after the 3 minutes or so is up, the words appear from what I typed a few minutes earlier.

Anywhere I try to type.  In the input fields of my home page, or on the browser search bar.  Just nothing works for 3 minutes.

Can you help??



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on Firefox icon on desktop
2.Once Firefox loads to home screen, try to type
3.The keyboard wont work for 3 minutes
Actual Results:  
All I do is click on Firefox and once I am at the home screen, I try to type ANYWHERE on the screen and nothing shows up.  The cursor just blinks.

Expected Results:  
That I can start using Firefox immediately instead of having to wait.
