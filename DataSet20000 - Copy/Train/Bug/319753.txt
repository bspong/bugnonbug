Opening folders in the Personal Tool Bar Menus, it opens a Blank pull down menu and Locks up Firefox.

In Firefox you can use the Manage Bookmarks (pull down menu) to organize bookmarks, make new folders, rename, etc. I created a folder called Redux. In that folder I have “Redux Home Page”, “Redux Forums”, “Redux Tickets”, and “Redux Annoucements.” Now when you do that, it automatically gives you the additional option to open ALL (bookmarks in that folder) as Tabs.

It has been working great until I upgraded to Firefox 1.5 on the Mac OS-X.

Now when I start the program and click on the folder the first one or two times it works fine. Then about the third time I ask it to open, BAM blank folder and Firefox locks up.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Now when I start the program and click on the folder the first one or two times it works fine. Then about the third time I ask it to open, BAM blank folder and Firefox locks up.
Actual Results:  
I must use Force Quit to regain control of my computer.

Expected Results:  
I expect the menu to open and to be able to click to the next request.

Firefox is in RED letters in the Force Quit menu. All others are Black letters.

I had another Mac user check my results and duplicated it.
