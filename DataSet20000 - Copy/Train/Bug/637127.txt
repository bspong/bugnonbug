Firefox 4 regularly crashes when CPU use is high

Firefox 4 betas are more stable now than earlier, but I still see a regular problem that the browser will crash when other processes are using a large amount of CPU.
For example, just now I was using mplayer to re-encode an aac file to wav, so CPU was running pretty much at 100%. Even though I wasn't actually DOING anything with Firefox, it crashed.
It doesn't seem to matter what's using the CPU resource, but the one thing consistent about Firefox 4 crashes now is that they all happen at times when CPU use is high. Which makes no sense to me...

I'm running the 32-bit beta (haven't seen a 64-bit one) on an AMD-64 bit Mandriva Linux system with twin cores.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox 4
2. Run processes that use LOTS of CPU
3. Watch while Firefox gives up the ghost...
