Browser crashes when in the midst of writing a post; all text is lost.

When using Firefox with about 6-10 tabs open, browser suddenly crashes.
Sometimes, I may have music playing on Jango.com in a browser window.
Mac starts to make noise like it's having to 'think' hard and rev up because something is hanging up. 
Then suddenly, Firefox crashes.
This happens way too often, so much so that I'm starting to hate Firefox.
It seems with Firebug installed, if a webpage codes isn't "Perfect" and an error is reported, that Firefox is rendered useless.
Could FF be getting hung up over less than perfect code and crashing?
I've gotten an error for jquery using Wordpress Simple Forum plugin that renders Simple Forum profile form un-usuable (can't enter cursor in text field), among other types of 'bug' errors. 
When I switch to Opera, there's no problem and everything works fine. 
IF this keeps up, I may have to switch for good.
