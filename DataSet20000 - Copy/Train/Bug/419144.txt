I am running on an HP Pavilion Turion 64x2 with Vista. Recently, late January or early Februrary 2008 Firefox began crashing...concidently after installing latest verison. It seems to crash only with MySpace pages. I can view my email, blogs, even a few friends pages, then unexpectedly it crashes. Sometime after 1 or 2 minutes, other times after 5 or 20 minutes. I can reload the same pages and it works fine one time, another time it crashes. I can't seem to find rhyme or reason. I switched to the Beta Version hoping it would work. My other XP computer is working fine.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use MySpace.
2. Read Email
3. Open other people's profiles in another tab.

Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes!

Expected Results:  
Firefox should load and display the page. NO CRASHES!

Help me PLEASE! Explorer has always crashed with MySpace on this Vista machine, now Firefox has recently started doing so too! And worst of all I have become hooked on the nice features of FireFox.
