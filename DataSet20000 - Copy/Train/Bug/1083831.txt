Adjusting tile-size can lead to too many columns
Created attachment 8506168
usercontent.css

STR:
- Copy userContent.css into the "chrome"-folder in the profile, or create a Stylish-script with its content
- Change browser.newtabpage.columns to 7 or bigger
(the attached picture has been made with the value of 8)

ER:
Only as many columns as defined in browser.newtabpage.columns are shown.

AR:
The number of columns is bigger than the value of browser.newtabpage.columns by 1.
In the attached picture that's 9 columns instead of 8.

As a sideeffect, there are as many tiles as the product of the values of browser.newtabpage.columns/.rows (8*5 in the attached image), but because of the additional column, the last row has not enough tiles to fill the row.
