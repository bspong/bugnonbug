Pressing ctrl-L usually moves the cursor to the awesome bar and allows all the neat features it includes. However, when using full-screen mode, ctrl-L opens up a different dialog.
This dialog does search through the history/bookmarks as the awesome bar but shows the results differently, without the site title and highlighting of the searched terms.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. When not in full-screen mode, press ctrl-L
2. Enter some search terms.
3. When in full-screen, press ctrl-L
4. Enter some search terms.
Actual Results:  
In the regular mode, the bar showed the results nicely with site titles and highlighting.
In the full-screen mode, the combo-box showed only the urls, without titles or highlighting.

Expected Results:  
The full screen mode should open a bar similar to the one when not full screened.
Possibly, one that is docked to the top of the screen instead of a dialog, resembling the standard awesome bar.
