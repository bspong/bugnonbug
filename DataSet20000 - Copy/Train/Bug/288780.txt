malfunction on first time opening the preferences window, works ok otherwise

When opening the preferences window from the Edit menu (only the first time
after starting firefox), the interface seems to ignore any clicks (on the icons
of the categories). After closing the preferences and opening them again, the
last item clicked on is openened, and preferences work ok after this point.

I've seen this problem since before 1.0, but I never got around to reporting this...


Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. close firefox
2. open firefox
3. open preferences
4. select pref. categories (ignored)
5. close preferences
6. open preferences
7. select pref. categories (working now)


Actual Results:  
the first time, all user actions (with mouse) are (or appear to be) ignored. The
options on the right (if visible) are not (visibly?) modified.

The second (and further) time, the options are accessible by mouse clicks and such.

Expected Results:  
it should have worked the first time, like it does from the second time onward,
i.e. the categories and the individual settings should be responding to
user-actions.

I'm using a plain downloaded version (installed by firefox-installer) on
mandrake 10.1.
