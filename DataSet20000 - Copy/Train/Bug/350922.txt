According to a user at mozillazine ( http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=2458738 - third last post ) it is not possible to run multiple instances of FF in different (windows) user profiles with different privileges simultaneous.

Quote:
as for diff windows account, i'm using a diff account while running ff using another account. lets say theres 3 accounts based on privilege a1, a2, a3. i'm using a2 but running several ff using a3 account and some ff using a1 account. what ff does is if i first opened a ff window using a3 account, i can not use ff under a1 account. so, for example, if i have several webpages opened using a3 account and i need to update my flash plugin or download another plugin for only one of the ff window, i cant use ff using a1 account to install plugins; i have to close ALL ff just to run ff using a1 account.

Is the single instance lock implemented system wide or - as it should - only user wide?


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a FF instance using user A in windows.
2. Switch to user B with different (higher) privileges but do not log off user A
3. Try to start another FF instance.

Actual Results:  
It won't work.

Expected Results:  
A new FF instance in that user account is started.
