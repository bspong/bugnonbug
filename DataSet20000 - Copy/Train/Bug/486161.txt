new login access to workstation is denied when FireFox update has been downloaded

If I leave Firefox browser running on my office work station when I finish at the end of the day; after connecting to it via a RDC connection in Windows XP and FireFox downloads an update to FireFox during the night. The next morning when I attempt to connect to my office workstation via a VPN and RDC, the login to the workstation is denied "as there are other processes running preventing further login" is what I see explainging why the login is denied. This has happened twice now in the last month. Each time the cure has been to power cycle my office machine then I can connect to it remotely again.

Is there a better way to handle this situation other than shutting Down FireFox each day? 

What logs can I collect to assist you with this?

BTW, FireFox is my broswer of choice and has been since the first version, keep up the excellent work on this product


Thanks,
