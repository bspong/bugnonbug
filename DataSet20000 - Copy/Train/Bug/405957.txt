crash or freeze if double clicking on a long list of span or div
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; fr; rv:1.8.1.10) Gecko/20071126 Ubuntu/7.10 (gutsy) Firefox/2.0.0.10

Here is my page with n > 700 span :

<html>
<body>
<span>1</span><span>2</span><span>3</span>...<span>n-1</span><span>n</
span>
</body>
</html> 

By double clicking on any number FF froze or crash. If I put a space between the spans (<span>1</span> <span>2</span> <span>3</span> ... <span>n-1</span> <span>n</
span>)  then all works fine. The same problem appears with the div element. This behavior happens with FF 2.0.0.10 on Mac Tiger, Linux and Windows.

As it do not appear with safari, IE and appear with Epiphany, I think it is perhaps a Gecko problem (sorry if it is a stupid idea, I am not a computer scientist).
