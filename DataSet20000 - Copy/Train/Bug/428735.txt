When Firefox is opened the following happens:

a dialogue opens and displays the following script:

chrome://xcm/content/xcmOverlay.js.210

Additonal info:  NoScript is loaded.  I uninstalled this plugin after loading 5.0beta and problem persists with every browser windo I attempt to open.  Also, MS Taskmanager displays memory usage for firefox.exe between 100K to 120K.  When I select the "Stop Script" button the memory usage drops and some functionality in the browser returns.  

Also, when the NoScripts button displays at the bottom right corner of the window, it does not function.  Only the small red "close button functions.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the Firefox browser
2.As the window opens the memory usage skyrockets and the application stalls.  MS Task manager shows 2 instances of the application "not responding."
3. the "No Scripts" box opens and shows a check box for "do not display again" and the "Cancel script" and "Continue" buttons. Selecting the "Cancel button will stop the memory usage issue.
Actual Results:  
As noted above.

Expected Results:  
Open the window immediately.  If there are scripts running that are not blocked a "No Scripts" button should display with options to block or "allow" or "temporarily allow."
