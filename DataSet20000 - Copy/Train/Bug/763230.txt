I absolutely agree with Max. Existing user choice of default search engine should be preserved, as it had been done in past in Bug 364297 for CJKT builds after change of default search provider from Yahoo to Google.
After update users should not find out that their default search engine suddenly has been changed without their consent. This is very bad practice.
