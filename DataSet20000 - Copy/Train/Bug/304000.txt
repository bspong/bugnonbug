URLs with commas handled incorrectly
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8b3) Gecko/20050729 Fedora/1.1-0.2.5.deerpark.alpha2 Firefox/1.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8b3) Gecko/20050729 Fedora/1.1-0.2.5.deerpark.alpha2 Firefox/1.0+

Deer Park seems to mishandle URLs passed from the commandline or from other
applications incorrectly. The URL is clipped at the first comma, usually
resulting in a 404 error. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Pass a URL with a comma, eg: firefox http://www.guardian.co.uk/0,6961,,00.html
2. Deer Park opens http://www.guardian.co.uk/0 - resulting in an error page.

Actual Results:  
Redirected to the site's error page. 

Expected Results:  
Opened the correct page - in this case the Guardian's home page.

The URL is handled correctly when entered directly into the address bar. I first
noticed the bug when opening links from Liferea (an rss aggregator). This
behavior occurs with both the firefox-1.1-0.2.5.deerpark.alpha2 rpm from fedora
rawhide and with the Deer Park Installer from mozilla.org. Quoting the URL or
escaping the commas does not work either.

Note that firefox 1.0.6 handled these URLs correctly, as do epiphany, mozilla
and konqueror.
