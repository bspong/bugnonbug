Mozilla corrupts NFS link to server if server goes through high resource use cycle

a)  Home directory NFS mounted from central server
b)  server has nightly backups with gzip which takes the server to high resource usage
c)  mozilla clients on client machines stop responding and the NFS mount from the
server gets borked.

I can understand why the clients would become unusable during high-stress periods on the server, but this shouldn't be able to corrupt the underlying NFS link, and it should recover after the stress period is concluded.

Note that nobody is actually using the clients at this time (2AM), but in the morning we come in and all of our clients are NFS-dead.   Shutting down all the firefox processes before the backup is a workaround - the NFS links are fine unless mozilla is running.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  leave client computer running with firefox open windows under NFS through server backup routine
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
NFS link becomes corrupted and unusable.  This only happens if firefox windows are open when the server is stressed.
