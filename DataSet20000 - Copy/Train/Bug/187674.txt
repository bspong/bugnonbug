There should be an easy way to clear the contents of the url location bar so
that a new link can easily be pasted to it using the linux clipboard. Having a
'Clear' option in the right click menu for the url bar is how galeon goes about
doing it and it is my favorite method. Konqueror solves this problem by having a
button next to the url bar to clean the contents. Either method would work out
great. Maybe put another icon to Clear URL that you can add when you are
customizing your Phoenix buttons.

Pressing ESC then backspace after selecting the url bar will clear the contents
and allow you to paste something already in your clipboard but this involves the
keyboard and is IMHO a kludge.

You can also just highlight a url you want to load then middle click on an
unused part of the main canvas area to load the link, but this appears hackish
and not very practical.
