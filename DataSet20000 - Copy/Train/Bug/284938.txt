Unable to type into any Text form fields after loading HTMLArea 3.0 from Interactive Tools.  Happens even after the browser is closed, re-opened and still happens after computer is restarted..

I went to this page above, started typing in the HTML Area Box..    clicked  the
ABC icon(spell check).   Fixed the words that it suggested.   Then, clicked on
the Attach paperclip to the right of the Address Book Button..   clicked Finish.  

Now in FireFox on Mac OSX 10.3.7, I can't type in ANY Text Area boxes on ANY
sites.  I tried Google..  I tried logging into bugzilla.mozilla.org.  I can't
type into text fields now.   The text fields don't even look like the cursor
goes into them.

What is crittical about this bug is that even after FireFox is closed and then
re-opened, No Text forms can clicked or typed into.   Even after a computer
Re-Start, No Text forms can be clicked or typed into.   

Apple Safari, does allow typing into text fields, so it appears to be a FireFox
issue.

This issue does not happen on the Windows Version of FireFox

Seems, eventually..  I can type into text fields again..   after I have browsed
the web a little bit..  

One more wierd issue, is when the browser is stuck like that, I can't even type
into the address bar.  It won't get focus.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Unable to Type into text fields on ANY sites including the http://www.Google.com
Search box.  No Text Bar Cursor is displayed in the text boxes when they are
clicked.

Expected Results:  
The software should have displayed a cursor in the text box when I clicked it
and allowed me to type.

One odd configuration that I'm using on my Mac is I'm using Synergy to re-direct
the PC's mouse to the mac, however, I tested the Keyboard and mouse that are
hooked directly into the Mac and had the same erroneous result.
