page display unstable on large pages.

This is a random occurrence.  This product version loaded yesterday.  On large pages, text panel (at washington post, Reuters, bugzilla error report page), the page loads normally.  If user scrolls down and stops, the page scrolls normally, then jumps (can happen several times).   The jump is a few lines up or down, but makes reading very, very difficult.  This has to be new behavior, surely I would have noticed on previous versions had it occurred.  At first I attributed this to new elements being loaded, but have seen it after several minutes on one page.  

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.goto http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,679980,00.html#ref=rss
2.wait
3.
Actual Results:  
page jumped several time.  The interval between jumps increases (they get further apart)  

Expected Results:  
Page should have stopped after loading (I think).  It should move in response to scrolling.  With no scrolling, the display shouldn't move randomly up and down.

Still better than IE, but not as good as FF 3.0 or so.
