no automatic dialup of internet connection with firefox 3.5
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; de; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090624 Firefox/3.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When opening Firefox 3.5, there is no automatic connection to the internet and browser shows a "server not found" message. (In contrast to 3.0.11 and IE8 where aAutomatic dialup works fine). Have worked thru all the obvious routes such as firewall settings and internet settings without success. NB: once an internet connection has been setup (e.g. by starting IE8), Firefox 3.5 works fine. The problem is purely the lack of automatic dialup function at launch.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox 3.5 without an active internet connection.
2. No automatic dialup of internet connection. 
3. "Server not found" message.
Actual Results:  
The browser fails to automatically connect with the internet so opens a page with a "Server not found" message. I have to setup an internet connection by other means (e.g. opening IE8). Then browser works.

Expected Results:  
When starting Firefox 3.5, it should automatically initiate a dialup process (like on Firefox 3.0.11 and IE8) that connects to the internet without any further manual intervention and brings up the correct start page.

The problem is purely the lack of automatic connection at the beginning. Once a connection has been established some other way, browser works fine. Have tried deactivating Windows firewall as suggested on Mozilla support page: no progress. Have checked internet settings and made changes: no progress. Many experienced users are reporting this bug where I live in Germany and nobody has found a solution yet.
