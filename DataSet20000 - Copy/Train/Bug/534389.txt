Session/Tab Restore complains when page has htaccess password

When Firefox is closed, and tabs are saved:

If one or more tabs are web pages protected by a htaccess password, Firefox complains "This is embarrassing" and says it had trouble restoring one or more sessions. It asks to close the ones you think may be the problem.
By ignoring/trying again, it seems to work the next time, but this is quite annoying to have an alert pop up nearly every time I open the browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open multiple tabs
2. at least one tab should be a web page protected by an htaccess password
3. provide htaccess credentials
4. close the browser and select the option that saves tabs for next time the browser is opened
5. open Firefox
Actual Results:  
The alert that says "this is embarrassing" pops up saying it had trouble recovering one or more sessions.

Expected Results:  
tabs all open and the htaccess prompt should pop up for each different site that is protected.  Once entering credentials the sites should load as they normally would.
