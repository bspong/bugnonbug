MozillaFirebird -remote 'Ping()' returns incorrect value if thunderbird is running
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7

It seems that the -remote functionality does not operate correctly (or atleast
as expected) in an enviroment where Thunderbird is running. It seems to interact
with Thunderbird, rather than correctly (or as expected) indicating that
firebird is not running.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
------ If neither are running ------
[adam@persephone adam]$ /usr/local/firebird/MozillaFirebird -remote 'Ping()'
No running window found.
[adam@persephone adam]$ echo $?
2

------ If just thunderbird is running ------
[adam@persephone adam]$ /usr/local/thunderbird/thunderbird &
[1] 26290
[adam@persephone adam]$ /usr/local/firebird/MozillaFirebird -remote 'Ping()'
[adam@persephone adam]$ echo $?
0


------ After thunderbird exits ------
[1]+  Done                    /usr/local/thunderbird/thunderbird
[adam@persephone adam]$ /usr/local/firebird/MozillaFirebird -remote 'Ping()'
No running window found.
[adam@persephone adam]$ echo $?
2

------ With Firebird running ------
[adam@persephone adam]$ /usr/local/firebird/MozillaFirebird &
[1] 26328
[adam@persephone adam]$ /usr/local/firebird/MozillaFirebird -remote 'Ping()'
[adam@persephone adam]$ echo $?
0
Actual Results:  
-remote 'Ping()' indicated firebird was running when in fact it was not, instead
Thunderbird was running.

Expected Results:  
-remote 'Ping()' should not indicate Firebird is running when Thunderbird is
running, only when firebird itself is running.

This bug appears to be somewhat related to 170609. I'm sure they have the same
root cause (though that bug discusses it in the context of Mozilla and Firebird).
