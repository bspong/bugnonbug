Video DownloadHelper add-on causing session to crash.

Initially I used Mozilla as my browser of preference.
When Firefox was released, I changed to that and updated it as new versions were released. Very stable with great features.
Years pass with virtually no problems ..... until I wanted to download .flv's and installed the Video DownloadHelper add-on. My Firefox sessions started to crash. I tried updating Firefox. I changed my OS version and rebuilt my system from scratch on a new hard drive but Firefox still crashed. I tested my RAM and all other system components. 
There did not appear to be anything specific that caused the crashes and I could not make it happen, but it continued to occur (often at a critical time during an online banking session or online purchasing session).
Many post crash feedback reports were submitted.
After months and months of frustration I eventually I stopped using Firefox and changed to Opera.
I happened to read a review of Video DownloadHelper stating 'computer crashed' and tried removing the add-on from my installation.
AMAZING. Not one crash since removing Video DownloadHelper.
I am over the moon.
I can use Firefox with confidence again.
Video DownloadHelper, as handy as it is, causes Firefox to crash.


Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
Feedback reports contain the info, and I could not make it happen but I knew that it would, as it always did. Sometimes it was impossible for Firefox to reload the tabs automatically - it crashed unless you selected 'start new session'.
