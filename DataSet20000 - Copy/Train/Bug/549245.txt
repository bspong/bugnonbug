After entering id # in space, when clicking 'select patient' a new tab should pop up with patient's name,etc., which i then would click to populate the form.  Unfortunately, since upgrading (!?) to 5.0 I only get a blank page ,two as a matter of fact with an error message that tells me I already have this window open.  As you can see, I do switch the rendering engine to ie coral tab since these only work with ie.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.sign on to horizon
2.go to CMS1500 page

Actual Results:  
two about: blanks open with the second one with error message as follows:  you already have a web browser accessing the current web session.  Multiple browsers are not allowed to share the same web session.  To launch a new web session, please open a new web browser by accessing your command prompt on your desktop.  I close out THIS blank page and am left with the other about:blank page, with this in the address bar... SEARCH BOOKMARKS AND HISTORY.
