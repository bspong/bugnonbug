multiple tabs open (over 50) spontaneously; can't stop them. All are titled "untitled.html"

Maybe this is a new worm or something; there doesn't seem to be any chatter on the web about this:

Firefox goes out of control and opens over 50 windows and I am unable to stop the cascade without Ctrl-Alt-delete. 

The first time it happened I was viewing a Changed Pages Report I made in Dreamweaver. There is an option in the report to view each page on the list. When I clicked on one of them the browser windows started opening. Each page was titled "untitled.html". 

Today I came home to find 52 windows open and Firefox was depleting my resources at 147,000 k. This was a spontaneous event. 
I had not used Dreamweaver at all and do not know what, if any web site I had visited. A Thunderbird mail message window had been left open from checking email in the morning. 
I would be happy to talk to you about this. I can make a screenshot or two if you want them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In Dreamweaver, for a web site you manage, make a site report for "Recently Changed Pages".
2. Open the report
3. Click the view link for any of the resulting list

Actual Results:  
The tabs start opening as described and do not stop until crash

Expected Results:  
see above

Should have opened only the one link as descibed
