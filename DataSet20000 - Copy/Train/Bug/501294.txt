I thought it was just because I was scrolling through my Yahoo! e-mail that Firefox constantly crashes about 10 times a day, but that is not true.  I can be away from my computer for a while and come back and get a notice that Firefox stopped working.  Today, I was doing an e-mail when it crashed, and I lost some of my data, so I had to type some of it over.  Even when it crashes, it has problems submitting the crash report most of the time.  I wish you would fix this software.  I am an online, university student, and I cannot have Firefox crashing during a timed test.  It takes several minutes for Firefox to restore the session.  This is valuable time lost during a timed test.  Another thing, there are a couple of websites that teach you to get rich, and they have voice pitches and music to them; and eventhough I close those windows, they are brought back up in the "restore previous session" mode, and they play at the same time.  I look for the window that they should be in, and many times, I cannot find the windows to close them again, so I do not have to hear their pitches and music every time I restore the previous session.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I start scrolling through my Yahoo! e-mail, and Firefox crashes immediately.
2. Even when I am away from my computer, Firefox crashes 10 times a day.
3. Pulls up music and pitches during "restore previous session" on windows I have previously closed.
Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes 10 times a day!!  Firefox surely crashes when I am scrolling through my Yahoo! e-mail.  It crashes even when I am away from my computer.  The crash report does not submit the report about 98% of the time. I always have to listen to the same salesmen pitches and music every time I restore my previous session.  Most of the time, I cannot find how to turn them off.

Expected Results:  
The same as I wrote down in "Actual Results".

I cannot use my Internet Exlorer 8 either, so I am forced to use Mozilla Firefox.  Data Execution Prevention will not let me use Internet Explorer.  Since I am enrolled in an online university, I am desperate for Firefox to work without crashing!!!  Please fix the problem right away!!!  Thank you very much!!!
