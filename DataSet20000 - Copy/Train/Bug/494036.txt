We get a Javascript error when opening in a new tab (the link contains target=_blank) a Citrix Web Interface version 5.1.1 website.  Citrix XenApp plugin is not launched when clicking on an application icon (blank page instead).  The Javascript error is:  Permission denied to get property Window.resetSessionTimeout.

When we open a new tab manually (Ctrl-T) or right-click and select "Open in a new tab" option on the link, no problem at all.  We are able to lauch Citrix published applications after clicking on the application icon.

This problem is specific to Citrix Web Interface version 5.1.1.  Everything worked great with the previous version we were using (4.6) prior to upgrading.

Very weird problem....

Any ideas?


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Make an HTML page with a <a href="https://csg.our-domain.com" target="_blank"> tag.
2.Have a Citrix Web Interface version 5.1.1 installed, configured and fully working.
3.Have the Citrix XenApp plugin (we are using version 11.000) correctly installed.
4. Click on the link at bullet #1
5. Logon to the Citrix Web Interface
6. Try to launch a published application

Actual Results:  
We get a blank (white) page.  Nothing more happen.

Expected Results:  
The Citrix XenApp plugin is supposed to be trigged by Javascript.  The control is then passed to the XenApp plugin, wich initiates a SSL connection to the Citrix Secure Gateway server and start the published application.
