When you save any Web page "Save Page As... - Web Page, HTML only", the HREF links remain. Then when yiour try to view this Web page offline, Firefox opens such Web pages very slowly. Apparently, it waits until the imbedded links time out. Most Web pages  have "HREF references", which are normally laoded when the page is open. When you open such local pages using Firefox, it takes a long time when you are not online. The same Web pages open instaneously using Opera 9.01.  Opera probably checks if the internet connection is available prior to opening a Web page. Thus, it does not need to wait for the links to time ou.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select any Web page that contans a HREF links., and 
"Save Page As... - Web Page, HTML only" 
2. Disconnect from the internet
3. Try to open the saved Web page.
Actual Results:  
 It takes a long time to open it when you use Firefox. 
Note; The same local Web page opens instantly using Opera 9.01.


Expected Results:  
The local Web page should open quickly.

Try the same test using Opera 9.01. It is NOT affected by this problem.
