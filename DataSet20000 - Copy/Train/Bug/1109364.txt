Mouse scroll lags

Steps to reproduce:

I tried to reproduce twice but did not encounter the issue again.


Actual results:

I opened the browser just recently. I have several tabs open --all e10s-- from yahoo, youtube and arstechnica. I was watching a video on youtube and scrolling by rotating the mousewheel became laggy. I could rotate the wheel forwards or backwards and the page would scroll but not right away, or partially and then stop and then partially again. I switched to other tabs and all had the same issue. I checked other applications and they were fine, and also Nightly didn't seem to be using any extra CPU.

What's interesting is using the scroll button (in other words I click the middle mouse button and then move the mouse) to scroll up and down any of the pages is responsive, and so is clicking the scrollbar itself and dragging it up and down the pages, and so is highlighting, and just about everything else.

The only extensions I have installed in this profile are FiddlerHook (changes proxy entries to Fiddler proxy debugger) and Gecko Profiler (stopped).

The problem went away after I opened several Mozilla bugzilla tabs (tabs I had opened to research whether or not this issue had been reported...). Now I can use the scroll wheel normally in all tabs again. Unfortunately I did not have a chance to open a non-e10s window to test before this problem went away.


Expected results:

Scroll should not be lagging, of course.
