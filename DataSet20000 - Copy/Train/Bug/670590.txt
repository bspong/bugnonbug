Firefox 5 hangs for ~10secs with 100% CPU use when clicking on "History" menu
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build ID: 20110615151330

Steps to reproduce:

(apologies in advance if it's not laid out correctly, never filed one of these before!) The last week or so since I upgraded to FF5, doesn't matter what page I'm on, clicking on the "History" menu will cause firefox.exe to hang with 100% CPU usage for ~10seconds, and the menu doesn't appear even after the hanging has stopped.

Started FF in safe mode with everything disabled, same problem. Followed the steps on the firefox site for hangs (http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Firefox%20hangs), still no change.

Also, when trying to clear history (Tools -> Clear Recent History), firefox.exe hangs for approximately the same time, then displays unresponsive script error (Script: resource://gre/components/nsPlacesExpiration.js:684). Letting the script continue seems to put this into a loop.


Actual results:

Clicked "history" menu, firefox.exe hangs with 100% CPU usage for ~10seconds; menu doesn't appear after hanging finishes.

Try to clear history leads to unresponsive script + firefox.exe hanging with 100% CPU usage.


Expected results:

History menu should have opened, rather than firefox hanging

Clear history should work, rather than firefox hanging until you stop the unresponsive script (or closing firefox.exe via Task Mangler)
