Firefox 5 does not warn on Cmd+Q (showQuitWarning / warnOnQuit)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0

This issue is seen in the latest official Firefox 5.0 release.

Until Firefox 4.x, if "showQuitWarning" and "warnOnQuit" were set to TRUE, a warning message was displayed if a user deliberately or inadvertently quits the application when multiple browser windows or tabs remained open. However, since upgrading to Firefox 5, the warning message is NOT DISPLAYED although the settings have remained the same. This causes a total loss of the browsing sessions *without warning*. This is even more critical if the the user has set to clear the browser's history/cache upon quitting the browser.

This issue is currently seen on Mac OS X (10.6.8), and is easily reproducible.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
==ENVIRONMENT==
Mac OS X (10.6.8)
Firefox 5
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0

==FIREFOX ABOUT:CONFIG SETTINGS==
browser.tabs.warnOnClose = TRUE
browser.showQuitWarning = TRUE
browser.warnOnQuit = TRUE

==ADDITIONAL INFO==
Oddly enough, even with the above settings, these user-defined modifications are not reflected in the "Modified Preferences" section under ABOUT:SUPPORT (or)
Firefox 5 > Help > Troubleshooting Information

==STEPS TO REPRODUCE==
1. Open multiple websites on multiple tabs (say www.apple.com, www.google.com, www.firefox.com)
2. On the Mac, press Cmd+Q.
3. Firefox 5 quits without displaying a warning.


Actual Results:  
Firefox 5 quits without displaying a warning.

Expected Results:  
A warning message (similar to what was in Firefox 4.x) should be displayed:
