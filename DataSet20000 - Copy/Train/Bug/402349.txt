While I haven't had any problems, a number of people have been filing bug reports on the Session Manager extension stating that when attempting to save a session.  The reports all contain the following error:

JavaScript Error:"aTabData.entries.forEach is not a function" {file: "file:///usr/lib/firefox/components/nsSessionStore.js" line: 1043}]' when calling method: [nslSessionStore::getBrowserState]

Session Manager calls the getBrowserState API function to get the browser state.  This function should not cause an error.  Since the reports started coming in after Firefox 2.0.0.8 was released and I haven't made any changes to the code I'm assuming this is something caused by a change in nsSessionStore.js

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Call nsSessionStore's getBrowserState() API call

Actual Results:  
JavaScript Error:"aTabData.entries.forEach is not a function" {file: "file:///usr/lib/firefox/components/nsSessionStore.js" line: 1043}]' when calling method: [nslSessionStore::getBrowserState]

Expected Results:  
Should return state data

I am unable to reproduce this problem, but since the bug reports started coming in after Firefox 2.0.0.8 was released and I haven't made any changes to Session Manager since then I'm assuming this is a Firefox bug and filing it on behalf of the following people based on their bug reports at:
