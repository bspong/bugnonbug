Some sites don't log me in every time even when option is selected.

When logging in to eBay.ca and checking the "Keep me signed in on this computer
unless I sign out." checkbox, I still am logged out next time I visit it after
restarting Firefox. eBay was working fine before the last time I formatted my
computer, but then it was other sites that didn't remember me. I have formatted
my computer quite often and every time the sites that didn't remember me changed
but there was always at least once.

I checked to see if the cookies are still there and it seems like yes, however I
still get logged out anyway.

This doesn't happen with IE.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in to a site with said-bug by checking option to always stay logged in.
2. Restart Firefox.
3. Go back to site.

Actual Results:  
Was logged out.

Expected Results:  
Keep me signed in.

This bug has happened with all builds I have tried so far, even pre-1.0 ones.
Also, it happens on different computers.
