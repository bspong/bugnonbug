i just got a new netbook and installed the latest version of firefox as my primary browser.  i use gmail for my emails and organize them into folders i created within the gmail account.  however, when i attempt to place the emails in folders (or apply the proper labels to the files to categorize them), the folder options just flicker open for a moment before quickly applying the first label alphabetically to any email i try to file and then closing.  this does not happen when i use my partner's computer which uses safari.  i contacted gmail to report the issue and they said it was related to my browser.  

i also have noticed that sometimes when i am typing an email, the words seem to carry on beyond the parameters of the box and just get lost rather than moving to the next line.  

i'm wondering if these two things are related and if this has something to do with the new version of firefox?
