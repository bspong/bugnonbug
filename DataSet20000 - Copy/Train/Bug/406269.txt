Collapsing a folder near the bottom of the Bookmarks Sidebar will make the tree control scroll up a bit to fill up the space. The bookmark that is now under the pointer will be visited.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Bookmarks Sidebar
2. Make sure you have a vertical scrollbar (open some folders or create more bookmarks if you don't)
3. Scroll to the very bottom of the list
4. Open a folder
5. Click [+] to collapse the folder again
Actual Results:  
The control will scroll up a bit and the bookmark that is now under the mouse pointer will be visited.
If there is a folder under the pointer it will open if its parent is not the same as the folder you were collapsing in the first place. (not too sure about that)

Expected Results:  
The folder should close without any additional opening of bookmarks or folders.

Bug 237259 and Bug 261307 seem related but cover behavior in the Mozilla Suite.
Could not reproduce with Firefox 2.0.0.9 so it seems to be a regression.
