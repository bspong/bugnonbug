Make the new preferences Nightly-only for now
Upon further discussion with UX & UR, there's some concern that the pref reorg from bug 1335907 isn't _quite_ ready to ship. The implementation is fine, but they'd like to revisit the design of the reorganization to improve the grouping. A new plan should be available in the next week.

With the next uplift only a month away (June 12th), we should consider this not ready to ride the 55 train, and revert to the old pref code.

So let's activate the killswitch from bug 1343682. We can #ifdef it to be Nightly-only, to ensure it stays on Nightly until it's ready to ship (likely 56/57).

2 small complications to consider:

1) Mike points out that even with the pref flip, we will still break XUL addons that overlay prefs (because they would need to overlay chrome://browser/content/preferences/in-content-old/ instead of .../in-content/).

We could rename things so that the old prefs namespace stays the same, and the new stuff becomes .../in-content-new/. If that's trivial, let's do so and just avoid the problem. (Do we know how big of a problem this is from when we switched to in-content prefs? If it's non-trivial to do, we could consider just taking the breakage risk.)

2) We should get some QA testing on the old prefs, since they've been disabled on Nightly for a while now. We could even revert Nightly to the old prefs for the last couple weeks of Nightly, if that help with mitigating Beta-uplift risk.
