META REFRESH URL IGNORED
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071008 Firefox/2.0.0.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071008 Firefox/2.0.0.8

Ever since 2.0.0.8 was released, the META REFRESH command is being ignored on all websites I visit.

A sample of this command would be:

<META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" CONTENT="0; URL=/pas/d/SiteControl/Core/Access/Login.render">

found here:

https://sitecontrol.hostway.com/

Very standard - used everywhere.

It DOES NOT appear to be a issue with SSL since this refresh fails as well

Have not found anyone discussing this

Attempted to un-install / re-install Firefox to no avail

This is causing me and probably many others to use IE =( Almost every login page I go to fails to load correctly....  This refresh method is very common.
