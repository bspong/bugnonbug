behavior after a user clicks a link is not very good
Clicking links is the most important interaction in a browser. I was wondering why it felt like 16 things were happening when I click a link. The answer is that our current behavior after a user clicks a link is not very good.

I've made a screencast showing what happens when I click on a link from TBPL to Bugzilla. Here's a play-by-play:

1.) hover effect on link (red underline). instant.
2.) target of link fades into location bar. faded text overlaps star icon.
3.) star icon fades out
4.) link turns dark red as click down (instant)
5.) gray 0% progress bar appears in location bar, red X appears where refresh button was, tab title says "loading" (window title stays the same), tab favicon changes to default (location bar still has tbpl icon)
6.) progress bar draws blue in at about 66%
7.) things stay motionless at 66% for a while
8.) back button becomes active, forward button becomes inactive, default document favicon replaces TBPL icon
9.) Window title changes from TBPL title to Bugzilla title (it never says loading...). However, focused tab still reads "Loading..."
10.) Tab title changes to bugzilla. faded bugzilla target url drawn twice, overwritten on top of old URL, target URL once again drawn over star icon, progress bar still at 66%
11.) favicon changes to bugzilla icon (still with overprinted text)
12.) overprinted text still visible in left of location bar
13.) favicon of tab changes to bugzilla, bugzilla page drawn (overprinted text still visible), progress bar at 100%
14.) progress bar disappears, as does faded overprint text
15.) red stop button stays visible for a very long time
16.) done
