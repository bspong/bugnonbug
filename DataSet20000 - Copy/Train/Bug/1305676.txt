In some circumstances passive mixed content indicator will override active mixed content indicator

(bug 1304363 moves some of this into %defines instead of variables, in a different file, but the gist of it is the same, cf. http://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/file/c2596f38f83f/browser/themes/shared/identity-block/icons.inc.css#l46 )

This is confusing, because we're basically saying that when displaying the unmodified URL for the page (pageproxystate=valid), for the connection icon, use:

- the passive mixed content icon if the cert has been user-overridden,
- unless the page has mixed active content or insecure forms, in which case use the active mixed content icon,
- unless the page uses a weak cipher, has mixed display content or blocked active mixed display content (??) in which case use the passive mixed content icon again.

That doesn't make any sense.

I *think* all the selectors for the passive mixed content icon should come first (and be combined), followed by a selector for the active mixed content cases.

If that is somehow not right, there really really needs to be a comment in the CSS that explains this... odd... sequence of rules, why there are separate ones, and why they override each other in the way that they do.

Paolo or Johann, can you take a look at what should happen here? Seems you wrote the rules in question modulo the CSS refactoring that Dão has been doing.
