Sometimes Paste doesn't work in Yahoo compose.. Software contradiction between Yahoo and Mozilla..  Same glitch more prevelent in Firefox 1.5..  Seems caused by looped switch that continually reloads Firefox after excessive use of extension buttons...   Can it be "Shorts" and/or "Leakage" between firefox extension switches and desktop icon..?  Can positives modify grounds..?
Glitches started after Yahoo modified their email accounts features, and became progressively worse as Yahoo made progressive changes...  My bet, it's from Yahoo trying to block ad-blocker..?



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. uninstall forefox, and reload fresh...
2. Run for twenty minutes, in Yahoo mail... 
3. Problem slowly appears after 20-minutes, then hits hard...
3. Forefox seems to reload from clicking any switch, except switches that   hadn't been used...  It acts sort of like an "inverse cascade"...

Actual Results:  
Go into Yahoo email account, and play there awhile..  copying and pasting from and to Thunderbird and Firefox, back and forth...

Expected Results:  
Copy, Cut, and Paste, all fail...  and Firefox starts reloading after an attempt to shut down a secondary Firefox window...   I hink that's where the looped switch is hiding...
