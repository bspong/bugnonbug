While using Firefox 3.0.x continuously, it periodically becomes irresponsive: videos jerk and/or pause; links in web pages don't work; cannot switch to other open tabs; menus don't work; toolbars don't work; mouse pointer doesn't change shape while hovering links, forms, etc... This lasts for a few seconds, then everything comes back to normal. The issue repeats again every few minutes. This seems more prone to happen when playing embedded video and/or with multiple tabs open, specially with many images/flash. It also seems to occur more frecuently the more time Firefox keeps running.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a few sites in different tabs --at least one of them with embedded video.
2. Notice that Fx periodically becomes irresponsive after being running for a while (jerky/paused video, scroll not responding, cannot switch to other tabs, etc.) 
3.
Actual Results:  
Fx periodically becomes irresponsive (jerky/paused video, scroll not responding, cannot switch to other tabs, etc.) while the rest of the system remains responsive.

Expected Results:  
Fx should always run smoothly.

I started noticing this kind of problems since version 3.0.2/3. I checked browsing the same sites, same open tabs with other browsers, but they didn't show this issue.
