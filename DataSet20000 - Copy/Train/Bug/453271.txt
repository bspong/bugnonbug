Link to external CSS uses URL-encoded characters if the page is saved with non-English characters

What I did was this:

1. In phpMyAdmin, I queried the server and clicked "Print view" to get a printable version of the page.
2. I chose Save Page As and chose to save the complete page with the name "köror.htm".

Now, if I open that file (köror.htm), the CSS is all gone because in the <link>-tag the href attribute points to "k%C3%B6ror_files/phpmyadmin.css" when it should be "köror_files/phpmyadmin.css". I have to manually edit the HTML file in order to get the formatting right.

Solution: Don't encode non-english characters in linked filenames.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Save a page with a filename that contains scandinavian letters (åäö).
2. Open the saved HTML file in a browser.
Actual Results:  
CSS doesn't show cause the HTML files tries to load the CSS from an invalid path.

Expected Results:  
CSS should work.

I don't know if this happens to *all* non-english characters, all I've tested is with the Swedish character "ö", and atleast that doesn't work.
