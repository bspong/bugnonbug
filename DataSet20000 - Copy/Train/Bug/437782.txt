This is message I sent to Foxmarks. They say error is due to serious bug in Firefox browser, but I could not locate similar bug report here. Difference in their report and my situation, is I'm not losing bookmarks, just getting the report that I am losing bookmarks.

Attached is error message received. (see message in your "Additional Information" below")

My local bookmark set is not reduced and when I look on the
Foxmarks server, the bookmark set is intact. Once I cancel
the autosync process I can sync with no problem. This seems
to has started after recent software updates. I've been using
Foxmarks for more than a year, and this is the first problem
I have encountered.

It's getting very irritating having to deal with this every
time I start my computer. Is there a way to go back to a
previous version of Foxmarks or perhaps Firefox?

I did some searching in help and FAQ areas, and couldn't
find that others were having same problem.

Thanks,
