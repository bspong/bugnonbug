When closing or opening entire windows, the menu bar (Apple, Firefox, File, Edit, View, ..., Help) becomes entirely highlighted in blue, as if each of those menus were selected. This happens when using menu commands or keyboard shortcuts. Note that closing or opening mere tabs does not cause the highlighting. Only closing or opening entire windows will reproduce it.

If I hide the Firefox app (command-H), the highlighting goes away, but it comes back when I switch back to Firefox again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox to a single Web page (one tab only)
2. Click red "X" button or press command-W keyboard shortcut

Alternately:
1. Open Firefox however you wish
2. Press command-N or select "File / New Window".

Actual Results:  
Window closes, but all menu bar items turn blue. Note that no menus display their contents. They simply become highlighted.

Expected Results:  
Window should closes, and menu bar should remain un-highlighted.

I am using Mac OS X 10.2.8 (Jaguar). This problem does not occur with any other software, including Firefox 1.5.
