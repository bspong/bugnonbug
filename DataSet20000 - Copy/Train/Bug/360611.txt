could be a OS Migration problem, too:
If Tab will closed too fast with middlemousebutton, while loading sites with some scripts, like: http://www.arndt-bruenner.de/mathe/scripts/dreiecksberechnungrw.htm
also like

...it hang up. The Content are not repeat while clicking some Link or Forward, Backward button.
Can scroll the appearing sites during closing tabs. Also Able to close Tabs with MiddleMousebutton. Also able to use the Menu and Options. Surf Engine is stucked. if link klicked, traffic work in both directions, but it dont appear the new site.

Reproducible: Didn't try
