Text Is Not King (top left word should not move when resizing window or loading ads)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:46.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/46.0

Steps to reproduce:

resize a window with text, or load a "heavy" web page with text, pics and ads using a slow internet connection (or a slow ad server).


Actual results:

When I resize the window, the word I read last jumps up or down, often off the screen. When I load a web page, I start reading the text, then the pics and ads arrive, and the word my eyes were on jumps up or down to make room for the new items. In both cases, the text is yanked away from my eyes, so I have to scroll up or down to find the word I was on.


Expected results:

Ideally the browser should know what word my eyes are on and not move that word unless I scroll up or down. Since that's not possible, the next best thing is to always make the top left word on the screen the "anchor". If pictures or ads arrive, they should be inserted before the top left word (ie off the screen) or later in the text body. If the window is resized, the top left word should stay in place, while everything else adjusts. 

In general, regardless of how the formatting changes, the top left word should stay in place on the screen. 

Text should always be the top rendering priority.
