FYI: session timeout resulted in inability to move past "login proceeding" page -- used IE8 to circumvent.

This is the most difficult bug report I've ever submitted...  "Something" is preventing a login from proceeding under a very specific condition.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I only have one bank account, so no way to reproduce the steps -- I can only report the steps which led to the problem.

1. Requested an online account from bank
2. Logged in with info provided
3. Changed login ID & password, and created security questions.
4. At this point, bank server required that Terms and Conditions be at least downloaded before Accept/Decline could be selected.  Since I always read EVERY document in its entirety, the bank's server timed me out.  OK, just login again...


Actual Results:  
When I login with the new login ID, the bank server sends a "processing" page and just sits there, never proceeding to the security page (which precedes the password page).

[This is the "Happens every time" part -- BUT, only if in the middle of account setup.]

Expected Results:  
Should have gotten their "security verification" page.

To ensure this wasn't something in the current browser, I went to a different machine running FF4b8 and got the same thing ("processing").

Next, I used a WinXP/IE8 browser and everything proceeded as expected; so I finalized the account setup and logged out.  

Logged in with FF4b8 just fine after that....

Sadly, this looks like an issue where the bank will point to FF4b8 and Mozilla will point to the bank...  :(

As soon as this has a bugid, I will forward a pointer to the bank's IT group.
