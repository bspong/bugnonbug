I have tested the width and height using (em) with windows on fire fox and the browser size scales properly but if I use the same on the Mac the width and height does not scale . If I change the width and height using (%) the behavior works for width but is ignored for height.

Can you make width and height using (em) on the Mac behave the same as windows?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.change the browser size
2. look at an image the is set up with  width and height using (em) on a Mac
3. 
Actual Results:  
 the browser  width and height  will not scale properly

Expected Results:  
the browser  width and height  will not scale properly on Mac's but will work on windows

browser should scale to the proper size
