menu display cleanup issue

the portion of a pulldown menu or a right-click menu/dialog box on one of the browsing tabs that is not fully contained inside the normal Firefox window will remain on the screen after the menu or dialog box is closed, leaving artifacts all over the screen.  Moving another window over them clears them, but this behavior was not present before I upgraded to Firefox 4

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select a long bookmarks list that goes below the bottom of the Firefox window
2. Select a bookmark or close the list
3. Any portion of the bookmark list display outside the Firefox window will remain on the screen
Actual Results:  
On my longest list of bookmarks, i get an artifact window with the last 2 dangling below the firefox window every time.

Expected Results:  
I should see nothing, the bookmark list should be completely gone from the screen, as with Firefox 3.x

This also works for the close tab dialog generated when you right click on the right-most tab (If you routinely have 5+ tabs as I do).  A portion of the dialog will remain on the screen after the dialog closes.
