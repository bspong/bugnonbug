Bookmarks layout is NOT productive. Tags are buried and not immediately visible.

While adding bookmarks I had to click a drop down arrow to select a tag for each bookmark. EVERY SINGLE TIME. I even looked for a hidden option to change this. I found NONE.

No matter how I tried to save bookmarks (with tags, without tags, unsorted or in a folder) I could not access my tags without going 4 folders deep.

***This does not seem to be a bug, But a very serious design flaw.***

At first I thought I could work around this, I tried to 'Organize Bookmarks'
I was not able to move the tags or folders to the main list.

This seriously hinders the productivity of this internet browser!
I am sure I am not the only one. Now that I am heard... Please fix this or at least let us customize how Firefox operates with my bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.select bookmarks from the menu
3.created tags are not displayed! They are buried under 4 menus.


Expected Results:  
When I add a bookmark aka Ctrl-D I expect less than 2 clicks.
For example...
I wanna bookmark this page.
[Ctrl-D]
[type in name of tag]
[enter]
Done.

Or how about...
[Ctrl-D]
[click an existing tag]
[enter]
Done.

Ok, Now I want to review a page I have bookmarked previously...
[Click bookmarks] or [Ctrl-B]
[select my folder or tag]
[click the link] and page begins to load
Done.

Now if you can bring that back I will reload Firefox 3 and try again.
If this current clutsy bookmark interface makes it into a release of Firefox 3 I will be very Pissed off.

I also do not like not being able to delete folders such as 'Smart Bookmarks'
If the user doesn't want let them delete it. When software is made to force users ie not let them customize it to fit them it usually forks.

What was wrong with the old way of handling tags in Firefox 2 ???

I have been using Firefox since before it was Firefox. And I have been very patient with the way it has been developed. Until now. None of the features or problems was as upsetting as this one. Please HELP.
