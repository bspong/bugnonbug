Firefox does not fully adhere to GTK+2/GNOME theme in Linux
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008101315 Ubuntu/8.10 (intrepid) Firefox/3.0.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008101315 Ubuntu/8.10 (intrepid) Firefox/3.0.3

I first submitted this at Launchpad.net under Ubuntu[1], but was referred here for better integration upstream.

I attached a screenshot[2] of the problem, juxtiposing Abiword (a program that fully conforms to the GTK+2/GNOME theme selected) and Firefox 3.0.

I tried changing my theme around, including the fonts and Firefox seemed to have troubles picking up the fonts, even after a reboot. The only other program that does this is OpenOffice.org. Pidgin, GIMP, Abiword, gEdit, etc., all conform to the selected theme properly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try a GNOME-based Linux distro such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, etc. 
2. Run Mozilla Firefox 3.0
3. Change the theme, including the fonts
Actual Results:  
Firefox changed its theme quite diligently, but failed to fully realize the selected theme and its fonts

Expected Results:  
Firefox would fully adhere to my GTK+2/GNOME theme.

The major problem Firefox seems to have is not so much the theme but the fonts in specific.
