Page Setup/Headers & Footers/Custom: only one "code" is expanded, remaining prints "code" it's self.

The URL above doesn't appear to be important.  To produce this problem, go to
Page Preview, click Page Setup, go to the Headers & Footers and select "custom"
for one of them (happened on the upper center for me).  In the pop-up, enter any
text that contains more than one "code" from the list in the help file.  The
below is cut/paste from the help file:

# Custom: Type your own text. You can include any of the following codes to
print specific information:

    * &PT: Page Number with Total (Example: "3 of 5")
    * &P: Page Number
    * &D: Date
    * &U: URL
    * &T: Page Title

It appears that only one of these codes are expanded and the one that is
expanded is not in the order that they appear in the custom text, rather it
seems to expand the first one found in the list above.  e.g., if I have "&T
(Page &PT)" as my custom text, the &PT text is expanded but not the &T (just FYI
on that part).
