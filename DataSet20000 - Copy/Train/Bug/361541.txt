Firefox on Windows or Linux supports complex Bangla Script. But in Mac OS X the script is not supported. Apple has OS level support of Unicode using Apple Advance Typography (AAT) and provide specific libraries for the Developers to develop their Applications with them. Currently Apple is not supporting OpenType fonts and supports only TrueType fonts with AAT 'morx' table. As a result, no OpenType font work with OS X and its applications. So, OpenType is not a recommended font format for Mac OS X. I heard that, Firefox is planning to adopt its own unicode rendering engine. If it does not support AAT Mac users will be in same darkness. I think for Firefox Mac version Apples ATSUI as its a carbon application. Some open type AAT font can be found for Mac OS X at http://www.ekushey.org/projects/osx/

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just go to http://mukto.org/ or any other unicode Bangla or Hindi or any other complex site.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
No complex script support for indic language like Bangla or Hindi

Expected Results:  
Proper Unicode rendering as seen in Safari or Firefox for Windows or Linux. Expect to see proper rendering with AAT fonts like Safari. Firefox team has access to ATSUI libraries.
