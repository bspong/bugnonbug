When I change the colors in Tools>Content>Colors to Text:Green and Background:Black, I can not see the text on the buttons in Yahoo Mail Classic. There is only one white border box around each box and the inside of each box is black. The other problem which I noticed in the recent version after being updated this morning (Dec. 18, 2008), is in Yahoo Mail again. When I want to compose an email the text box is in bright white which is hurting my eyes. Previously, it had a black background with green foreground. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Change color to Text:Green and Background:Black by using Tools>Content>Colors
2. Login to a Yahoo account (I assume you use Yahoo Classic)

Actual Results:  
See the buttons which have only a white border line without a text on them.

Also when you compose an email the text is black on white.

Expected Results:  
See the the text on buttons as before.

The text should be green on black.
