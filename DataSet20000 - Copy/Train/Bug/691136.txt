Steps to reproduce:

After upgrading from firefox 5 to firefox 7.0.1 on my windows 7 the installation routine stated that i had to restart my pc. after that i wanted to start firefox the usual way. But firefox crashed - see below.


Actual results:

firefox 7.0.1 did not start up instead it crashed with: "procedure entry point NS_SetDllDirectory not found in xul.dll" (my direct translation of the german error message) - see attached file (error message in german). After a few tries I tried to downgrade by installing firefox 6. But the installation routine said again I had to restart the computer and did not finish and left firefox 7 installed. After that I tried to uninstall firefox 7 via windows control panel \ programs and features\ but again I received that I had to restart my windows with no effect.
Finally I managed to uninstall firefox by using the helper.exe in the program files\mozilla firefox\uninstall\ folder. After that I installed firefox 6 and everything worked out fine!


Expected results:

firefox sould have startet!
