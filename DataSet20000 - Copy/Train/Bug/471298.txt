full crash after running on noted weather site

I believe I have had similar crashes on other sites but it most often occurs on the wunderground active radar. I have upped the RAM on the system to 1 gig (from 512M) thinking this might be a cause, not so. Lots of ram unused compared to the ram cleaner I use.
I nabbed latest Firefox version and Java. It may run for a while then crash but I have seen short times and crash, I may be mousing around doing things, but then doing nothing and crash.
Note, using XP pro SP2  (not latest SP3)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Latest Firefox and Java
2.visit the Wunderground site
3.have a nice crash!!  (varies)
Actual Results:  
Windows error report wants to send data to report error, I dont send, and it closes Firefox.

Expected Results:  
I don't expect anything but for it to not crash....8-P

not sure but maybe windows detected a problem and shut Firefox down.
No other progs affected. Firefox restart usually can restore the session, but I think its not the crash session but a previous save, as I note a tab or some tabs I had open are not there.

There may need to be an active tab save anytime a tab is opened/closed, not just when you close Firefox and ask if I want to save the tabs, save them flying as you go.
