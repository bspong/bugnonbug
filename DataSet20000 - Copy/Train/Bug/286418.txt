non-responsive https server leaves SSL lock locked showing previous site's DNSname

I have an F5 SSL accelerator (SSL proxy).  It is misconfigured so that it will
accept incoming SSL connections but the server it is proxying to is inacessable.
 I open FireFox to any non-SSL page, say http://google.com.  In the title bar I
enter the URL for the proxy.  It waits for a while and then title bar goes
yellow (to indicate a secure connection), and the lock icon appears for the page
I'm currently on ("www.google.com"), even though I never loaded that page via
SSL.  If I double-click the lock icon I get a "Page Info" dialog that says "The
web site www.google.com supports authentication...".  If I view the security
certificate it is the certificate from the SSL accelerator however. 
Unfortunitely I cannot give public access to the SSL proxy used here since it is
being used for internal testing at my company.  I was able to reproduce this
many times in a row, but after closing the browser window I was no longer able
to reproduce.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup SSL proxy as described in the details
2. Open a non-ssl page
3. Connect to the SSL proxy and see the described results.

Actual Results:  
I closed the browser window I had been doing this in, but not all browser
windows.  After doing this I was unable to reproduce the problem.

Expected Results:  
Given a timeout message and not shown the lock icon.  This is what it did once I
was no longer able to reproduce the problem.
