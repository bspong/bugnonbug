My company uses the DotNetNuke content management system to manage its corporate website. I can use FireFox to access SOME modules of DotNetNuke successfully, such as the File Manager, but the basic web page editing module appears to be completely unsupported. Whenever I try to edit an existing web page, FireFox 1.5 won't even let me SEE the page in the edit window, let alone edit it. So I am forced to edit this site using either a Windows XP machine or by running Virtual PC on my Mac. It would so INCREDIBLY helpful if FireFox completely supported the DotNetNuke CMS system. Any insights you could provide would be greatly appreciated. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Try editing a web page managed by V. 2.0 of the DotNetNuke content management system
2.While you're supposed to see the web page appear inside the editing window, absolutely nothing appears when using FireFox 1.5 
3.




I am the sole Mac user in my corporation. Having Mac-based products such as FireFox work flawlessly versus Microsoft products (Internet Explorer browser) is extremely important if you'd like to see your products used in corporate environments.
