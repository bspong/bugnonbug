In options > settings for clearing history. After I remove tick mark under cookies   it will revert to being check marked again after firefox closes and opens back up removing all cookies . I want all history removed except cookies. but it will not stay unchecked  when i close firefox.

 in fact nothing in history  settings will remain unchecked

 when firefox opens all are tickmarked again

happened after upgrade t 3.5.2

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to options. 
2.tickmark "clear history when firefox closes"
3.go to "settings" 
4.uncheckmark "cookies". 
5.close firefox
6.open firefox 
7.go to "settings" "cookies" are re check marked with no user input
which is causing cookies to be removed every time ff closes
Actual Results:  
cookies  being removed every time ff closes

Expected Results:  
all history being removed when firefox closes "except cookies"

I have no other add-ons themes
