Still seems to be major issues with ssl.google-analytics.com

Many sites I go to including GMAIL logon page hang while trying to loading something from ssl.google-analytics.com.  What is this analytics nonsense and why is it so necessary?  Is there a way to disable that annoying feature?  It NEVER seems to load whatever it's trying to load, just always says waiting for ssl.google-analytics.com.  I have to actually manually click the stop button otherwise the password manager doesn't fill in the password.  Really annoying.  If it aint broke don't fix it, clearly someone added an unnecessary feature that ended up causing more problems than it solved.  Why can't we just have browsers the browse?  Why do we need all this extra bull crap that just bogs down the system?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
• Go to http://mail.google.com/ and look at the status.
• Browse around at http://www.ppctechs.com/ and notice the waiting status
• See how the password manager is hindered due to the page not ever fully loading.
Actual Results:  
Waiting for ssl.google-analytics.com

Expected Results:  
page stops loading COMPLETELY

There are like 500 posts about this crap on here what the heck are you guy doing about it?  Apparently not much!  Just give us the option to disable that; I do not see any reason why when I go to a web site Firefox has to check a google site as well, especially sense it NEVER is able to connect to that site.
