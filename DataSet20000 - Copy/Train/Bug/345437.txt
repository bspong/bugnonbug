Save Page As (Web Page) should save HTTP headers as well
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1b1) Gecko/20060710 Firefox/2.0b1

Saving Page As "Web Page, complete" or "Web Page, HTML only" will only save the HTML content, HTML headers are ignored. This becomes a problem if the character set is specified only in the HTTP header, but not using the META element, e.g. <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">

Ideally, all applicable HTTP headers should be transformed to their http-equiv in HTML head section.

This may be a duplicate of bug 125504. But since I'm talking about Firefox, not the deprecated Mozilla Suite, I now file a new bug here.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View a HTML document encoded in character set other than the default character set of HTML documents (Western, ISO-8859-1). Make sure it doesn't use <meta http-equiv="Content-Type">
2. Save the HTML document using context menus (File menu or right-click menu).
3. Open the HTML document downloaded
Actual Results:  
HTML viewed in wrong character set.

Expected Results:  
HTML viewed in the character set specified in the HTTP header, or based on the setting in View | Character Encoding when saving the file.
