The behavior when double clicking on a paused/in progress download is different in the New Downloads Manager compared with the Old Downloads Manager. 

Steps to reproduce: 
1. Launch Firefox
2. Download a large file (for e.g Ubuntu cd installer: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?release=latest&bits=32&distro=desktop&status=zeroc)
3. Open the panel -> pause the download -> click on Show All Downloads
4. While in the Downloads View -> double click on the paused download started in step 2.
5. Repeat step 4.

Expected results:
- in step 4: double clicking on a paused download -> resumes the download.
- in step 5: double clicking on a download in progress -> pauses the download.

Actual results:
- in step 5: double clicking on a download in progress -> opens the containing folder. 

Note:
- reproducible on the latest Nightly
- reproducible on the latest Aurora:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:20.0) Gecko/20130218 Firefox/20.0 (20130218042018)
- the behavior is reproducible ever since February 6th, before this - double clicking on a paused/in progress download in the Downloads View (in Library) - did nothing.
