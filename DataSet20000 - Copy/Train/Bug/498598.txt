3.0.11 breaks multiple google login sessions

I could previous open multiple/diff gmail accounts and nav around Sites, Documents etc as multiple users. Since 3.0.11 this has stopped working, with a gmail tab open if I try open another gmail account (eg corporate gmail account) the page locks with hour glass and doesn't reach google. The same link opens fine in IE so its not a prob with the google server. 

Similarly, hitting a Documents link now says "sorry you dont have access to this doc..." with "try with another login" option or similar, hitting this link similarly locks up trying to serve up the page to switch users. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open gmail window, log in
2. try connect to another gmail account such as corporate gmail account
3.
Actual Results:  
second attempt results in hourglass and never reaches google

Expected Results:  
happily opens multiple google session, when I hit a doc link say in Documents or Sites links it happily allows me to switch gmail users to access if need be.
