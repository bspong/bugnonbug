Could not write session state file
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:54.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/54.0
Build ID: 20170608105825

Steps to reproduce:

Firefox running for about a week, more than 200 tabs opened. Multiple tabs opened/closed during the time.


Actual results:

recovery.js is not updated. 
Message in the browser console:

22:40:35.485 Could not write session state file  Error: TypeError: invalid 'in' operand exn

Expected results:

recovery.js should be written without errors.
It seems session state JSON first completely formed in memory and then written to the file. And now is no free memory available due high fragmentation. Closing tabs didn't help.
So even browser restart cannot be done without losing session state.
