From the main www.latimes.com page, left- or middle-clicking on the URL above causes the whole window to shrink to (what I assume is) the requested popup size.

The important feature of opening popups in tabs appears to have been broken in Firefox 3. The feature is important because tabs are expressly designed to manage multiple pages. Allowing pages to generate new windows defeats the whole purpose of tabs.

In an earlier version of ff3, popups were allowed even when never desired; now they're put in a tab, but they corrupt the window. Maybe we can just go back to the robust functionality in ff2.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.latimes.com
2. Click on http://www.latimes.com/travel/la-tr-bestbeaches23-2008may23-pg,0,6422590.photogallery
3.
Actual Results:  
Popup is opened in a new tab (good!) but whole window is shrunk (bad!).

Expected Results:  
Popup is opened in a new tab, window size unchanged.

I maximize my ff window.
