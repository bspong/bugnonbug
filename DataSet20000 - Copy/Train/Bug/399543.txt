While watching videos on at least two different websites, if I left the video in full screen mode for an extended period of time (usually 3-5 segments of video) the entire system would crash with no warning. There was no Blue Screen of Death, but a complete system failure, in effect turning my computer off. When I reboot, Firefox (naturally) states that it was closed improperly, but Windows gave me no hint that it had crashed.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Watch flash videos (I had the problem with episodes of Jericho on CBS) in full screen mode.
2. Wait for several (3-5) segments of video.
3. The system will shut down with no warning.
Actual Results:  
The system shut down without warning. This has been reproduced three times.

Expected Results:  
It should have kept playing the video like normal. If there really was a BAD error, Firefox should have handled it properly.

I have Ad Block Plus, Download Helper, Download Status Bar, Chromatabs, All-in-one Gestures, Firebug and Fox Filter enabled on my system. I also use a custom theme, but it only changes the Forward/Back/Refresh/Home buttons.
