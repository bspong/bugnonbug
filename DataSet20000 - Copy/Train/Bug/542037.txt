This problem only occurs when Gmail Manager 0.6 is loaded, but the developer claims he is not at fault: http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=8527945#p8527945

When I start Firefox, the iGoogle home page is shifted to the left and partly cut off, while a white band appears on the right of the page.  

Screenshot 1 - Bad page render: http://web.missouri.edu/~mdmnq5/comp/bad.png
Screenshot 2 - Page is apparently loaded three times on browser startup: http://web.missouri.edu/~mdmnq5/comp/back.png
Screenshot 4 - When Gmail Manager is disabled (and any other combination of add-ons are loaded), page renders correctly: http://web.missouri.edu/~mdmnq5/comp/good.png

Note that I have tried clearing all cookies, cache, history, site preferences... everything.  This problem is reproducible on two computers (both Win7 64bit).

At least one other user has reported a similar phenomenon, but without Gmail Manager: http://support.mozilla.com/tiki-view_forum_thread.php?locale=no&comments_parentId=561814&forumId=1

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Homepage set to www.google.com/ig
2. All add-ons disabled, except for gmail manager 0.6 (http://www.longfocus.com/firefox/gmanager/)
3. Start Firefox (from a "cold" start, don't just hit the "Restart Firefox" button after enabling/disabling add-ons)
4. Page is rendered three times and displayed improperly.
Actual Results:  
iGoogle home page is shifted to the left and the back button is enabled, implying that the page was loaded several times.

Expected Results:  
iGoogle should render completely in the frame, and only load once.
