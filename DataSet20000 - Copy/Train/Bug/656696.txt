selecting a recently used folder at the bottom of the "edit bookmark" dialog does not work after opening the "Show all the bookmarks folders" button and hiding it back to the smaller bookmark dialog.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on star in address bar to "bookmark this page."
2. Click again if this is a new bookmark to bring up the "edit bookmark" dialog.
3. Click the "Show all the bookmarks folders" button (down arrow) on the right.
4. Click the "hide" button to hide the full folder list and return back. (IOW, the down arrow clicked last step becomes an up arrow. Click on that button.)
5. Click on the "folder" drop down and select one of your recently used folders at the bottom.
6. Notice that the folder you selected is not show in the folder box.

If you do the steps above without doing 3 & 4, selecting a recently used folder does work as expected.


Actual Results:  
Folder selected is not used/does not populate the bookmark folder field.

Expected Results:  
Folder selected should have shown in the folder field after the selection.
