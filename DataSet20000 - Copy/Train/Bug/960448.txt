Steps to reproduce:

download manager Open Containing Folder gives consistently old folder

in ff26.0, download manager, open containing folder produces an explorer window that refuses to update in windows 7ult64sp1retail. a while ago it would update if I hit ctrl-f5 but now even that doesn't work (F5 didn't work).

windows 7 provided file (etc) versioning, so you can take a file back to previous dates. I am guessing this works for 
shortcuts which apparently can have a versioning problem in windows 7 where they can get stale or old (this was mentioned against the taskbar on the internet through some googling, including msdn.microsoft.com I think). wondering if it's elsewhere too, or if it's a specific checkbox or setting in the shortcut that's causing this. I don't know if anything in the download manager is a shortcut or not.

I had thought the problem got fixed too. but I only have a guess as to where the problem is, not having seen the source code... it stems from firefox doing something odd with executing explorer.exe?

additionally, there is a recent lack of functionality in windows 7 due to a windows update where the explorer.exe window refuses to update automatically when a file changes. now you have to hit the refresh button or F5 or ctrl-F5 to refresh the window.


Actual results:

update: the last download date is still stuck stuck on 1/13/2014. not sure why. no newer files show, not even with a reboot.



Expected results:

latest downloads should show.
