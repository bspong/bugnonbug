Since upgrading to Firefox 3, Microsoft's Windows Live (my.live.com) times out a lot on the rss feeds. This happens on every Firefox 3 install I use, but not Firefox 2. It also works fine on IE7+8.  Only some of the rss feeds display.

Since upgrading to Firefox 3, Microsoft's Windows Live (my.live.com) times out a lot on the rss feeds. This happens on every Firefox 3 install I use, but not Firefox 2. It also works fine on IE7+8.  Only some of the rss feeds display.

I therefore have to use either IE or use a different my homepage such as igoogle, or my.yahoo.com.   igoogle is no good as it only supports 3 columns, and my.yahoo.com is no good as it has adverts.

I use my.live.com as my homepage, but it's frustrating using Firefox 3 because only some of the feeds now work.

Thanks
