"When a website requires a certificate" in Advanced-Encryption options is incomprehensible
In Options->Advanced->Encryption->Certificates, the pref "When a website requires a certificate" is incomprehensible. I didn't understand it until I learned from bug 395399 that it's about *personal* certificates: It's *you* who's identifying himself to the web site, instead of the usual username/password method. The certificate is about *your* identity, not that of the web site.

I'm updating the help text in bug 384997, but this needs to be fixed in the UI as well.
Explanation from the suggested help text:
  Some web sites require you to identify yourself with a personal
  certificate. In order to do so, they generate one for you and ask
  Firefox to store it. When you visit the site in the future,
  Firefox selects the certificate without asking you by default. If
  you wish to manually choose a certificate (for example, if you have
  multiple certificates stored for multiple web sites), select the Ask
  me every time pref and you'll be in complete control of
  what certificates are being sent to web sites while browsing.

The SeaMonkey text is more verbose: "Decide how SeaMonkey selects a security certificate to present to web sites that require one". It's speaking of presenting a certificate, but still missing that it's a personal certificate, identifying yourself to the web site.

I'd suggest to add the word "personal" to the label like this:
-When a web site requires a certificate:
+When a web site requires a personal certificate:
