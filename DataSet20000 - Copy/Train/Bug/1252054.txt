6. On third device open synced tabs sidebar. (Menu bar > View > Sidebar >Synced Tabs).
7. Compare the order of devices and tabs from Synced Tabs panel and Synced Tabs sidebar.

[Actual results]: 
The order of devices and synced tabs from sidebar is not the same as the order from synced tabs panel. See attached screenshot and compare the orders of devices and tabs.

[Additional notes]: 
- On sidebar first synced device is placed on top of the list and last synced device at the bottom, while on synced tabs panel last synced device is placed on top of the list and first synced device on bottom. 
- On synced tabs panel the last synced device is always moved to top of the list, but on sidebar the device remain on the same position as it was when first synced.
