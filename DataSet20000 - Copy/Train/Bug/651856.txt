FF4: Extremely slow JavaScript fades on large text pages
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1

If you visit this page http://www.heinergoebbels.com/en/calendar and click on "performance history" Firefox becomes unresponsive for a very long time while it tries to render the page. The website loads contents via XMLHTTP and then fades them into the text area.
This problem was introduced with FF4 and is also present in the alphas of FF5 and FF6 but NOT in the 64 bit versions! Please note that no other browser (Opera, Safari, Chrome, not even versions of Internet Explorer 6-9) have this problem.
Turning hardware acceleration off does change nothing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0. Use 32bit FF4 or Aurora or Nightly / make sure JavaScript is enabled
1. visit http://www.heinergoebbels.com/en/calendar
2. click on menu item "performance history"
3. wait for a very long time
4. check with any other browser to proof that it's not the problem of a slow webserver but of extremely slow rendering by Firefox
Actual Results:  
Firefox takes ages to render the new page

Expected Results:  
Firefox should fade the page in quickly like any other browser including 3.x versions of FF

Windows 7 x64 SP1 on a very fast Intel 4 core desktop PC with an ATI HD 5870 GPU (latest drivers).
This problem seems to be specific to Windows 7 (maybe even 64 bit only?), at least I couldn't reproduce it under Windows XP, OS X 10.5 or Linux Mint 10.

I just want to stress that no other browser has this problem on my system.
