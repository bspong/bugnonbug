A script error pops up and graphics are gone even on the toolbar. This isn't juts yahoo. It's all sites I visit. I tried disabling most of my add-ons and even reinstalling. 

The error console comes up with;
Unknown property 'zoom'. Declaration dropped. 
http://m.yahoo.com/
Error in parsing value for 'font-weight'. Declaration dropped  
Expected declaration but found '*'. Skipped to next declaration.

Unknown property 'zoom'. Declaration dropped.
Error in parsing value for 'font'. Declaration dropped
Unknown property 'zoom'. Declaration dropped.
Error in parsing value 'background-repeat'.Declaration dropped.

I think you get the idea.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open browser
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
It seems triggered by graphics heavy sites.
Sometimes I can reboot the browser and it will let go for a few minutes without it happening.


This is horrible it even affects the Tool Bar Graphics, everthing but text is wiped out.
