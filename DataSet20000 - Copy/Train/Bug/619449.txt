When pasting a table containing colspanned cells into tinyMCE from FF4.0b7, the behind-the-scenes HTML becomes badly corrupted

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View the attached file SampleTables.html in FF4.0b7.
2. In a second tab open the tinyMCE Full example at http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/examples/full.php.
3. Using the mouse, dragging from SE to NW select the lower table contents in SampleTables.html. Copy to the clipboard using Ctrl+C.
4. In the tinyMCE sample textarea, click after the word "Google" and press Enter to make a new line. Then paste in the table using Ctrl+V.

The table should appear correctly in the tinyMCE textarea.

5. Drag the mouse from after the word "Google" in order to select the newly-pasted table. Press Delete to delete it.
6. Using the mouse, dragging from SE to NW select the upper table contents in SampleTables.html. Copy to the clipboard using Ctrl+C.
7. In the tinyMCE sample textarea, make a new line as in #4. Then paste in the table using Ctrl+V.

What appears in the tinyMCE textarea is totally messed up:
There are five copies of the first two table rows showing, followed by one copy of the third row.
If you click the HTML icon to view the source code, it appears that there's a lot more trouble behind the scenes. There is more than one copy of the original tinyMCE sample text. There are broken <p> tags of the form <p [some non-ASCII character] <p>. There are broken classed <p> tags of the form <p c class="nomargin">.

This does not happen with FF3.6.13 or IE7 or IE8 or Chrome 8.0.552.215. So it must be something about FF4.0b7's clipboard handling that is causing tinyMCE to malfunction.
Actual Results:  
Rows of the table are duplicated and the underlying HTML is significantly corrupted.

Expected Results:  
A correctly formatted table should appear and the underlying HTML should be correct.

The tinyMCE developer suspects that this may be a side-effect of recent changes in the Firefox clipboard logic.
