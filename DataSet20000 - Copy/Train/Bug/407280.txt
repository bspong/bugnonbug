When I try to view embedded youtube videos in any websites, it buffers extremely slow -so slow that the video stops about every 10 seconds or so. When it gets halfway to 3/4 of the way through the video, the red progress bar on the video starts zipping back and forth without stopping, the video stops playing, and FF freezes for a few seconds. Note that the problem does not occur in IE. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any website that contains an embedded youtube video
2. press the play button on the embedded video

Actual Results:  
slow buffering, video stops and starts, red progress bar moves quickly back and forth about 1/2 to 3/4 way through the video, video stops, FF freezes for a short period of time

Expected Results:  
the video should buffer at a normal rate of speed, the video should play all the way through without stopping and starting all the time, the video progress bar should continue at a normal pace through the end of the video, and FF should not freeze.
