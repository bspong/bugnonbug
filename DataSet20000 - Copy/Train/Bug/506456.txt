Typing in a text box causes shortcuts to be fired - textbox not got focus
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When I click into a textbox, the cursor goes into it, but it doesn't get focus. When I begin to type, it causes the keyboard shortcuts to be started, i.e. if I type an 's' character, the save as dialog opens. The cursor keys do not work either so am unable to scroll page up and down with keyboard. If I switch focus to another application then come back to firefox, I am then able to use the page as normal. Also, page up and page down now scrolls through tabs and does not move the page up and down as the key name suggests.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a new tab in Firefox 3.5 and open any page containing a form
2.Type in the form
3.
Actual Results:  
I was unable to  type in the text boxes until I had switched to another app and then back again.

Expected Results:  
I expect to be able to type in a textbox without the keyboard shortcuts being fired off

It also happens when typing in the 'Find:' (ctrl+F) text box
