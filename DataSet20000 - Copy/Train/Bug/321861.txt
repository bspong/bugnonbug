When retruning to a site that uses frames top, left, right and bottom from http://fxfeeds.mozilla.org/rss20.xml when I try to naviagte through the site the main frame opens displacing the top, bottom and left frames this is not expected.  It is expected to retain the left, top and bottom frames with only the right frame changing content.

This does not happen the other RSS feeds or sites that contain a lessir number of feeds. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. surf to http://www.w9rh.org (others work as well)
2. click on any nagvation link in the left frame new content fills the right frame
3. read BCC headlines http://fxfeeds.mozilla.org/rss20.xml
4. return to w9rh  (the page looks fine)



Actual Results:  
Click on any new navigation link in the left frame, the top, bottom and left frame are lost.

Expected Results:  
Expected to navigate the site as before reading the BCC Headlines

Need to relaunch the browser or open a new tab and revisit the site to allow normal navigation
