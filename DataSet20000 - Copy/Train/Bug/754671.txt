[Page Thumbnails] size of thumbnails directory (in profiles directory) keeps growing infinitely
Since the thumbnails were moved from the cache to the file system, they have become much more visible. At this moment, I have 130MB of images in 1983 files. That's after *only* 10 days.

It's not a new issue, but previously they were hiding among tens of thousands of entries in the 1GB cache, and cleared when that cache got cleared (automatically or manually). They could also have been pushed out of that cache by other content, but that's not happening anymore. They could also have been deleted by the regular expiration algorithm, but since the current history can keep entries for more than many months, that's not an option either. Also note that they are questions about privacy (there's no reason to store images if they're never going to be displayed again).

I do understand that the thumbnails do not only contain the 9 images that have to present on the new-tab page, but that it also contains the images that are needed in panorama. You can also not write an algorithm that would only remember the top 9 sites, and discard the rest.

So what can be our options ?
- at startup, discard all except the top-N sites ? In case people are removing tabs from the new-tab page, we need N to be larger than 9.
- discard images that are older than X days ? Maybe skip their deletion if they're still in the top-N list.
- if a tab is deleted, we should also delete the thumbnail, except if they're in the top-N list
- there could be also reasons why some sites are not stored in the cache, like mentioned in bug 754608.
