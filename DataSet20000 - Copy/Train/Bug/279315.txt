Infinite loop in password dialog-- "cancel" button ineffective
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041003 Firefox/0.10

When connecting to an IIS site that uses NTLM authentication, I wish to cancel
the request for the page since I lack a valid login.  When the username/password
dialog appears I press cancel, only to be presented with another dialog.  Cancel
should prevent a future request for the same page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the / URL on an NTLM-protected IIS server
2. Firefox password dialog appears
3. Press cancel
4. Go to step 2

Actual Results:  
"Cancel" in the dialog generates another GET to the same site, which pops up
another password request

Expected Results:  
Firefox should not re-request the page after cancel and should instead keep
either a blank page or the previous page displayed.

A packet trace of the conversation shows the below, with some fields substituted
with comments in parens.

After pressing "cancel", the same GET is repeated.

I've also tried this with Javascript disabled just in case the returned HTML was
somehow responsible for the reload, but this didn't help.

This problem is similar to bugs 263542, 269138, 129085, 69385, 244718, and
others.  These all seem to be more specific than this bug in that they involve
IMAP, particular username characters, etc.

I'm settting the priority to major since once the loop starts the only way to
get out is to shut down Firefox.
