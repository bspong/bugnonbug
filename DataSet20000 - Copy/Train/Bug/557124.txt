Right clicking locks up the browser when playing flash games

When playing certain flash/java games (I gave an example in the URL), Right-clicking may leave firefox unresponsive for minutes at a time, and in rare cases it locks up my entire computer. I've had this problem since I started using firefox when it was v3.5, and persisted with the 3.6 beta and 3.6 final release. This has happened on multiple computers, all using Windows XP.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find any flash game (armorgames.com, kongregate.com, etc.)
2. Right click
3.
Actual Results:  
It shows a right click menu. However, it doesn't go away even after waiting for long periods of time. It's impossible to click anything, and occasionally the keyboard becomes unresponsive as well. I often have to manually shut down.

Expected Results:  
A right click menu, usually to change the anti-aliasing quality

I've made no changes to firefox other than added themes and AdBlock Plus. Disabling all add-ons, reverting to standard themes, and re-installing does nothing. It happens with only about 1 in 20 games, but a single click will freeze it almost automatically.
