I usually have Firefox open for a longer time, as I'm surfing a lot during the day. I often visit websites with messsage boards and participate by posting a few comments on them.

When I just loaded Firefox, everything works correctly. I have a Swiss-German keyboard layout and can write into forms properly, no matter what website. While the browser is still open, I visit various other websites too. I usually have the browser open for a longer period, 30 minutes and more. After a while, if I decide to write something into a form again, my keyboard layout suddenly changed to U.S. English. Characters like "! @ - /" and many more are on completely different keys (also Z becomes Y) or key-combinations. Of course I can still write, but it becomes difficult for me as I have no clue where the characters are on my keyboard. I then usually load an external text editor, write my text there, then copy & paste it into Firefox.

As soon as I close the browser and restart it, the keyboard layout is back to Swiss-German again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load Firefox and write into forms
2. Have the browser open for a while or visit various websites

Keep the current keyboard layout as I set it on my system.
