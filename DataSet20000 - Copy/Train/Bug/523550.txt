My Yahoo's Flickr module creates pop-up windows instead of thumbnails

Since the first version of 3.6 I have tried the "Most Interesting Flickr Images" module in My Yahoo has been working incorrectly.
The behavior is supposed to be when you hover over an image thumbnail it spawns a larger thumbnail of that image, and if you click on the image the image is opened in a new tab.
It was working fine in 3.5, since 3.6 however when you hover over the image it tries to create 2 pop-up windows as if I had clicked on the image twice.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open My Yahoo
2.Install the module "Flickr Most Interesting pictures"( http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=00bddc2c53bd96b05acea520619302b4&_render=rss)
3.Hover mouse over an image
Actual Results:  
Two pop-up windows are opened and blocked by the pop-up blocker

Expected Results:  
A thumbnail of the image you hover the mouse over should appear

I tried this on 3 different PCs with pretty much all the 3.6 versions on Windows XP and 7 still the same result.
