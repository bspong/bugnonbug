new web pages don't load

I have noticed that in 3+ versions of FF and especially in 3.6, after I initially load FF with four-pre-selected web pages, ( which is prompt and fine) that it takes multiple attempts to load another or access a new web page in one of the existing tabs.  I can get as many as 10 "problem loading or page not found" errors before bring up another page.

Work around is to close all but one tabs.

IE works fine on same computer, and all wireless and wired internet access computers don't have any access or network problems, so I am convinced it is not my local area network.

my home page default:

http://www.nytimes.com/pages/world/index.html|http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?CityName=Ithaca&state=NY&site=BGM&textField1=42.4422&textField2=-76.5002&e=0|http://radar.weather.gov/Conus/northeast.php|http://finance.yahoo.com/

Trying yahoo mail is one page that is problematic, for example.

Apologies, it this has been presented, I have searched, but maybe used wrong terms




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.load home page shown above.
2.Try loading BBC or Yahoo mail in an existing tab, fails.
3.close all but one tab, seems to mitigate.



Work like it did before version 3+
