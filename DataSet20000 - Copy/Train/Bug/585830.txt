A closing tab can be switched to with Ctrl+PageUp/PageDown
STR:
 1. Open three tabs at different sites, which we'll label:
    [ A ] [ B ] [ C ]
   for example:
    [ http://mozilla.org ] [ http://amazon.com ] [ http://wikipedia.org ]
 2. Focus the "Tab B" (amazon.com).
 3. Hold Ctrl, and press W and then PageDown within a second of each other.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
I should end up having "Tab A" focused. (mozilla.org)
(Ctrl+W should close Tab B, moving me to Tab C, and then Ctrl+PageDown should shift me left one tab to Tab A.)

ACTUAL RESULTS:
I end up seeing "Tab C" (wikipedia.org).

It looks like Tab B is still selectable while its closing-animation is playing. This means the Ctrl+PageDown action will select the tab that's being closed, **as it's closing**, and then an instant later it _actually_ closes and forces me rightwards one tab.

(FWIW, the "Ctrl + W,PageDown" action is one that I perform quite frequently, to close a tab and see the one to its left, so I hit this bug all the time.)

Filing as a regression from bug 380960, since that's when this started appearing. (that's when tab-closure started taking a nonzero amount of time)
