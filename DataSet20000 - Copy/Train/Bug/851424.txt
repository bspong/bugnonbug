make 64-bit+32-bit versions of ff, tb, etc available
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:19.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/19.0

Steps to reproduce:

want to use firefox on 64-bit machine natively


Actual results:

I get a 32-bit product (to my knowledge)


Expected results:

the installer should provide the either both or the correct kind of executables.

mingw-w64 (gcc) gives me 64-bit and 32-bit executables (separate compilers for each).
what I usually do is make a 32\ and 64\ directory and for windows I make shortcuts to the 64-bit exe and make the working directory the 64\ or 32\ so it sees the appropriate DLLs in that dir. i believe they also have compilers for linux too.

voila, you now have 32+64-bit ff, tb, etc. and I think this same method is portable to linux and not sure about mac - someone knowledgeable about mac would have to answer on that.

mingw-w64 you have to stay on the mailing list and prod once in a while when compiler landscape changes to see what's viable. right now rubenvb's compilers are the thing to get. they need donations and work to have buildbot working again for windows. so for now, only the personal builds are kept up to date.
these builds work for auto builds (32-bit and 64-bit target, windows):
