i use a custom keyboard layout (mirrored dvorak for so it works for left handed people) so my letter keys have been moved to non-standard locations. the shortcuts within firefox require pressings of keys from the default qwerty English/US locations

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a custom keyboard layout with scrambled letter locations in microsoft keyboard layout creator using "English (EN)" as the language (Project -> Properties...)
2. install and switch to using the custom layout
3. run firefox
4. click within the main area (where the html etc. is rendered)
5. try any shortcut (ex. ctrl + c for copy)
Actual Results:  
shortcuts require remembering qwerty locations of keys (i.e., copy is ctrl + the third alphabetic key from the left on the bottom row, where C is in the qwerty layout -- and not where it is in mine). 

but when the awesome bar or the search bar is in use (text cursor is active in one of those fields), some shortcuts work correctly (ex. ctrl + A works).

Expected Results:  
the letter location of the active keyboard layout should be used to activate shortcuts all of the time

This does not occur in OS X.
