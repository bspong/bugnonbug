URL bar on Polish Windows assumes that accented characters are CP 1250, should use ISO-8859-2 or UTF-8 instead.

CP 1250 is the default character encoding under Polish releases of Windows,
however it is not used anywhere else. The encoding used on the Polish Internet
is almost exclusively ISO-8859-2, with some websites in UTF-8,
and very few in CP 1250.

The problem is not very important, as most of the Polish websites use ASCII-only URLs for compatibility, and only one popular website (Polish Wikipedia) uses accented characters in URLs. It accepts UTF-8 and ISO-8859-2.

A simple workaround is changing network.standard-url.encode-utf8

Possible solution:
* If CP 1250 Windows (or Polish version, whatever is easier) is detected, either assume that the real encoding should be ISO-8859-2, or turn on network.standard-url.encode-utf8.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get a compouter with Polish version of Windows installed
2. Try URL with accented characters, like http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/£o¶
Actual Results:  
It sends URL in CP-1250, getting "Article doesn't exist" page.

Expected Results:  
It should encode URL in either ISO-8859-2 or UTF-8, getting http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%81o%C5%9B (Polish Wikipedia redirects non-UTF-8 links assuming they are in ISO-8859-2)
