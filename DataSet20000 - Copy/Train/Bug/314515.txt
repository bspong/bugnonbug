losing functionality

after a few weeks since version 1.5 (now at v. 1.7) firefox begins to lose functionality.  For example, my tab button on my keyboard won't work in forms using firefox, but it works in IE or text. 
Pages won't load anymore, sites are blocked.  
Also, the speed of firefox diminishes over time, even if I clear all my cache and history etc.
Clearing history, also removes all my form information that was remembered, when i should just clear the url.
the only workaround, uninstall firefox, delete all firefox directories, and  profile information, reinstall firefox, .


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.use firefox normally
2.wait for a few weeks
3.

Actual Results:  
pc keyboard tab stops working,
sites are blocked, for example uscellular.com,
mozilla starts crashing, or freezing up (one site might begin to use all my available pc RAM + more over time,
java script won't work anymore,
java script pop ups wont appear anymore,


Expected Results:  
tab key should work in forms,
sites should load, because I have nothing to block them,
mozilla should not crash,
it should steall all my available RAM + more  ( ihave 512 and sometimes firefox will steal 800 or more)
java script should work all the time
