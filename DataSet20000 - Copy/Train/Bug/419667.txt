The file "firefox.exe" is no longer a "Win32 application," ie. Firefox will not open despite being fully installed.

All FireFox launch icons on the desktop, or in the quicklaunch and Start menus are still there, but they do nothing.  All of the files in the Program Files\Mozilla Firefox folder are there, but "firefox.exe" is not recognized by Windows as an executable file, and FireFox will not open.

I was successful in reinstalling FireFox (and all bookmarks, passwords, etc. still functioned), which worked as a one-time solution, but that no longer works either.  About 20% through the installation process, a window pops up stating:

"Error opening the file for writing:
C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe
Click Retry to try again, or
Cancel to stop the installation"

'Cancel' is the only option that will work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Try to open FireFox
2.Get really frustrated
3.Try to contact Mozilla about the problem
Actual Results:  
So far, nothing.  I've had to do all of this through Internet Explorer.

Expected Results:  
N/A

I've tried to reinstall FireFox 5 times now, and have given up.

It should have worked, as it has for over a year on this computer.
