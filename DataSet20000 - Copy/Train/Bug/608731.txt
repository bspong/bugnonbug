When I d/l English language Firefox update in China, I receive the update that use Chinese.  
The problem is that the Firefox updater has something to do with the country/region and it delivery the update based on the location.
I don't understand why you update package names don't have the county prefix on it? Like Firefox Setup 3.6.12-CN.exe, Firefox Setup 3.6.12-EN.exe, Firefox Setup 3.6.12-FI.exe. It is too difficult to do?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Tying to install English language Firefox update 
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
I get the Chinese installer instead.

Expected Results:  
Start to install the Chinese Firefox instead the English one.

This problem was the same also in the early version. To get the right package I need to d/l it from from somewhere else the Firefox website.
