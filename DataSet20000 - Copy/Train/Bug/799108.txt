Page with embedded pdf does not load in Firefox, works in Chrome
Created attachment 669138
firefox_sos.png As you can see, the bottom of the screen is blank, though a slider appears greyed out, indicating that Firefox thinks it is displaying something embedded.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:15.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/15.0.1
Build ID: 20120905151427

Steps to reproduce:

I navigated to the web page http://sos.nh.gov/Elections/Election_Information/2012_Elections/General_Election/Sample_Ballots_-_2012_General_Election.aspx

then selected the link for the town of Greenville, which took me to:

http://sos.nh.gov/Elections/Election_Information/2012_Elections/General_Election/Sample_Ballots_-_2012_General_Election.aspx?id=27013




Actual results:

In firefox, the embedded pdf at the bottom of the screen does not appear (or is blank). In Chrome, it appears. I am running Firefox  15.0.1 on windows XP sp3.


Expected results:

The pdf file should have appeared as it does in Chrome. This is an urgent issue, because voters need to be able to find and download their sample ballots for November. Apparently this form only allows me to attach one file, but I have a png that shows the pdf displaying correctly in Chrome, which I will try to attach later to a comment.
