Audio playback continues (does not stop) to be heard on the speakers even though I have closed the particular tab playing the embedded video with this particular audio.

I try to close Firefox (close all the tabs) but the audio continue to be heard on the speakers.

The GUI is gone but looking at the task manager firefox.exe is still running.

The ONLY way to get rid of the task is to reboot.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I go to dailymotion.com.
2.I start to right-click on a video link and select "Open link in a new tab".
3.Create several tabs playing each a video.
4.Pause some videos.
5.Only plays 1 video at a time of course to have only 1 audio playback through speakers.
6.Sometimes after closing one tab, the audio continues to play.
7.I even close completely firefox browser ; the audio continues to play.
8.If I try to update Firefox, it says an instance of Firefox is already running.

3.
Actual Results:  
The audio playback continues to be heard on the speakers

Expected Results:  
The audio should stop like it does usually.

It takes at least 5 minutes to reproduce as you have to have several embedded videos playing in several tabs. They do not have to play at the same time. One can play while the other videos are paused.

After a while, the browser becomes unresponsive.

It looks like an audio engine crash because the audio continues to play and I can not terminate firefox normally. Firefox is present in the task manager.

Some resources are still in use even though Firefox GUI is gone.

IMPORTANT! There is no error message from Firefox.
