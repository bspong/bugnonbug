enable live bookmark to display RSS feed

i serve my own rss feeds so that i can always have my bookmarks regardless of the system i'm using that day. for example, this one...

    http://vangilpin.net/rss/blog.xml

...simply shows links to my favorite blog homepages.

what would be cool is if an RSS feed i serve -- and point to w/ a firefox live bookmark -- could itself point to an RSS feed, which firefox would in turn display in my live bookmark. for example, i'm a miami dolphins fan, so i created a feed to show dolphins news...

http://vangilpin.net/rss/dolphins.xml

...but firefox simply displays the XML in my browser, instead of showing links from the feed in my live bookmark.

hopefully i'm describing this well.

thanks & keep up the great work.
