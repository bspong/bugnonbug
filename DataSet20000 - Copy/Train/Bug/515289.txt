ajax calls make firefox think its reloading a page and adds to history breaking back button

I was wondering why my back button seems to go on the fritz, certain pages like news.yahoo.com if you look at the tab indicator, firefox appears to reload the page when its really just doing ajax calls.  The result is I have to hit back as many times as Firefox thinks it reloaded the page. Which is more than the correct number of times I should have to hit the back button which is once.

Ultra lame, using safari until this is fixed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to news.yahoo.com
2.watch the tab indicate more than one page load
3.hit the back button until you get back - its more than once - totally crazy
Actual Results:  
history is wrong, ajax calls cause history to add a page multiple times

Expected Results:  
hit back button once to go back

havent seen this on PC only on OSX.  Not happy this is the most significant downer in years of using firefox.  Can you guys move forward without so much regression? Im sorry if MAC isnt where its at but Im using the really lame safari now because I like my BACK BUTTON to work.
