Can't downloads MP3s from Amazon music due to chrome code throwing exceptions
Steps to reproduce:

1)  Be in non-e10s mode.
2)  Log in to Amazon music.
3)  Click "Songs" under "Your Library"
4)  Check the checkbox next to the first song.
5)  Click the Download button.
6)  When the helper app dialog comes up, select "Save File" and click OK.
7)  When the filepicker comes up, just click OK (in my case on the home
    directory).

EXPECTED RESULTS: File starts downloading

ACTUAL RESULTS: No download.

Additional information:

1)  I can't seem to reproduce this in a clean profile, though I haven't tried
    that hard.
2)  I can't seem to reproduce this in e10s mode.
3)  At the failure point, the browser console says:

[Exception... "[JavaScript Error: "can't access dead object" {file: "resource://gre/modules/DownloadLastDir.jsm" line: 176}]'[JavaScript Error: "can't access dead object" {file: "resource://gre/modules/DownloadLastDir.jsm" line: 176}]' when calling method: [nsIContentPrefCallback2::handleCompletion]"  nsresult: "0x80570021 (NS_ERROR_XPC_JAVASCRIPT_ERROR_WITH_DETAILS)"  location: "JS frame :: resource://gre/modules/ContentPrefUtils.jsm :: safeCallback :: line 47"  data: yes]

which is why a clean profile might not reproduce this; afaik whether an object is dead is GC-timing-dependent.

Blake has blame for that ContentPrefUtils bit, but not sure where the real issue here is in terms of someone holding on to a content object after its window is unloaded...

If someone has concrete steps for troubleshooting this, happy to try them.
