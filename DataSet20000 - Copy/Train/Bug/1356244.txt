Come up with a shim module that keep firefox green while devtools are removed
Once DevTools are going to be shipped as an add-on, various code in Firefox is still going to depend on devtools, like WebExtension for example.
We still need some code in mozilla-central/Firefox to ease interacting with Devtools. This code should expose whatever API is required by Firefox codebase and react to the installation of the DevTools Add-on. It may also automatically install the add-on under some circonstance.

The main goal of this bug is to introduce this module and keep all tests green in the three following setup:
* with this module (and the related refactoring) on mozilla-central tip,
* same, but with DevTools being stripped from mozilla-central,
* on the incoming DevTools repo, with all the DevTools tests (xpcshell, mochitests), we may move some tests from m-c to devtools, like webextension tests related to devtools APIs.

Keeping mozilla-central tests green while devtools is being removed depends on some other bugs like bug 1356231, bug 1356231 and some other to come. In some cases we have to refactor m-c codebase to just stop depending on devtools.

This bug isn't related to the shim layer that will help web developers automatically install the add-on. Instead, it is focused on the low level shim that keep everything working when we do not have devtools and then install it.
