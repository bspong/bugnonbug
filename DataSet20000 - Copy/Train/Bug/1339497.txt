firefox tries to load incorrect url if urlbar autocomplete suggests first-two-letters-duplicated hosts when input url contains % encoded components
Created attachment 8837222
screencast firefox 51.0

the first-two-letters-duplicated hosts bug has already been described in bug 767364
but it is even worse starting from 51.0


Steps to Reproduce:
0. start a local http server on port 80
1. open firefox and load http://localhost/a=&6
2. focus on urlbar and delete `&6`
3. input `%266`
4. delete `%266`
5. input `&6`
6. move input cursor between `&` and `6`
7. delete `&`
8. input `%2`
9. press enter


Expected Result:
1. after 3rd step
    urlbar inline autocomplete shows "localhost/a=&6"
    first entry in urlbar autocomplete dropdown list is "localhost/a=&6 - Visit"

2. after 8th step
    first entry in urlbar autocomplete dropdown list is "localhost/a=&6 - Visit"

3. after 9th step
    firefox loads http://localhost/a=%26


Actual Result:
1. after 3rd step
    urlbar inline autocomplete shows "lolocalhost/a=&6"
    first entry in urlbar autocomplete dropdown list is "lolocalhost/a=&6 - Visit"

2. after 8th step
    first entry in urlbar autocomplete dropdown list is "lolocalhost/a=&6 - Visit"

3. after 9th step
    firefox tries to load http://lolocalhost/a=&6
