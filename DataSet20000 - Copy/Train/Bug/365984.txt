Extremely slow response when accessing browser features and components.

I have updated to the latest version of Firefox (2.0.0.1) and now when filing through my Bookmarks, Tools, History, etc. I am met with a very slow response to anything I select. For example, when moving my cursor down my Bookmark list, the highlighting of whatever my cursor touches moves at a jagged pace. Even by clicking 'Bookmarks' or accessing any of its subsidiaries causes considerable lag. I downloaded a previous version of Firefox as a result, and was not met with this problem (although I lacked all the features the new version had, of course!). I decided to re-install the new version again after some time and had the same condition as before. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Update latest version of Firefox.
2. Let it install. 
3. Boot up the browser. 

I don't think there is any possible way to reproduce the problem as it seems peculiar to my browser or perhaps my install. 
Actual Results:  
Nothing out of the ordinary until I tried accessing my menus. 

Expected Results:  
It should have gone as smoothly as before. 

I have installed browser themes before the (2.0.0.1) version of Firefox was available. When this problem occurred, I did change the theme back to default and was still afflicted. The azureFox theme (0.96) was the one I had used, until the one I have recently iFox Smooth (2.4.2).
