Javascript function (to calculate CRC32 checksum) returns -1 on Firefox 3.5 for Mac, and returns correct value in all other browsers

I tried to implement a crc32 checksum function in Javascript.  In testing, no matter what I did, it kept reporting -1 as the returned value.  Logically, since it's never the browsers fault, I was convinced that it was a problem in the code.  However, when checking in any other browser - be it Safari, Internet Explorer, or Firefox for Windows, the value returns correctly. In Firefox 3.5 for Mac however, it consistently returns the wrong value (whether it's -1 or otherwise).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://sk3vy.com/crc-test.php in Firefox 3.5 on the mac
2. Open up a different browser on the same computer or a different one, and notice the different values.
Actual Results:  
The page returns -1 on Firefox 3.5 for Mac and "1249991249" (the correct value) on ever other browser.

Expected Results:  
It should have returned "1249991249".

This is not a Snow Leopard only issue.  Happens on Leopard and Snow Leopard.

I think this is a major problem when arithmetic on a browser doesn't work correctly, hence my severity ranking.
