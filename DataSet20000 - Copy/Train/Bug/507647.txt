I am unable to install new extensions from the mozilla site.

1) Select extension (such as PunyURL), click on install.
2) Install dialogue completes, ends with "restart to activate."
3) Click on restart. Firefox closes, and does not restart.
4) Restart manually. New extension is not active. Go to addons list. Extension is found under "installation," where it say "restart to activate."
5) Click on restart. Firefox closes and does not restart.
Return to step 4, etc.

I deleted the extension, and tried a different one with the same results.

I have been through all the items on your "unable to install addons" page, including deleting the extensions.xxx files (found four instances of these in various folders).

Still having the problem.
