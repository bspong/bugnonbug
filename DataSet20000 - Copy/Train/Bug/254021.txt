I'm filing a few enhancement request for the coolest features of the wonderful
TabBrowser Extensions, so that they can be considered for post-1.0 and maybe
voted on.

This request is for an "undo close tab" or "recently closed tabs" (sub)menu.
When a tab is closed, it should be saved to a cache, and there should be a menu
somewhere in the UI to show this cache. Clicking on an entry on the menu opens a
new tab with the same contents as what used to be in the corresponding entry.

This should save the "buffer" to the cache, not just the URL, so that
"unclosing" a tab that was displaying the results of submitting a form would
still work.

An UI command that can be bound to a key should be available to "unclose" the
last closed tab; this should be bound by default to something (TBE uses
Ctrl-Shift-Z, but maybe Ctrl-Alt-W or something like that would also make sense).

Reproducible: Always
