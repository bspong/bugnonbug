When you have some tabs in firefox and you want to close it, it ask a confirmation to close all tab.

The event onbeforeunload in javascript was normaly called just before the page was unloaded, but in this case the event is called before that firefox ask the confirmation. If the user press "cancel" the page wasn't unloaded but the code of the event onbeforeunload were executed.
