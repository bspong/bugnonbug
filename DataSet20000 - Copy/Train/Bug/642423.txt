Bookmarks Toolbar tool tips appear when they should not

On Mac OS X with the Firefox 4 RC, the tool tip (or title text) that appears when hovering over items in the bookmarks toolbar will incorrectly appear, and stay permanently, when switching from Firefox to another application, or when Firefox is in the background. It looks like Firefox is getting the 'cursor is on top of the bookmark' message but not the 'cursor had moved off the bookmark' message, so the tip/text appears and doesn't go away until you do some gymnastics with the mouse. It's very annoying.

Could be fixed, I hope, by disabling the drawing of these tool tips whenever Firefox is not the foreground application.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Let a Firefox 4 window, with bookmarks toolbar enabled, be open and visible in the background.
2. With any other application active, move the cursor at medium-slow speed over one of the bookmarks.
3. Pause for, I don't know, 0.2 seconds over the bookmark so it gets the grey coloring, then move off before the tool tip appears.
4. [Alternatively, move the cursor to a bookmark when Firefox is active, then command-tab to any other application and move the mouse away.]
Actual Results:  
A fraction of a second after moving the cursor away, the tool tip will appear by the bookmark in the background window. Then it will stay there forever! Or until you move the cursor back to the vicinity.

Expected Results:  
There should be not tooltips at all in either of these scenarios.

Appeared in one of the Firefox 4 betas, and continues to be constant bug in the RC.
