FF3 loses SSL Proxy but keeps all others

If I set a proxy for all connections it works, but I clear the checkbox, and instead use proxy:8080 for HTTP and proxy:8443 for HTTPS, after I save the settings, and go there again, the SSL box is empty.

Tested with several Windows computer on the company and FF3 final.

On Ubuntu with FF3.0 and 3.1 this doesnt happen.
