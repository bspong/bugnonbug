Windows local file system command line URLs with # bookmarks do not work
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10

If Firefox is launched from the command-line with a local file system URL
containing a bookmark, it complains that the entire URL does not exist. The URL
must not contain file:// and it must use a Windows pathname to the htm file for
it to fail. If the bookmark bit is omitted, the page is loaded as expected.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to command prompt
2. Go to Firefox directory
3. Type firefox.exe c:\mydir\myfile.htm#bookmark
Actual Results:  
Error message reads :-

The file /c:/mydir/myfile.htm#bookmark cannot be found. Please check the
location and try again.

Expected Results:  
Launched the browser with the page specified, scrolled to the bookmark specified.

Microsoft's start.exe also fails, for example this does not work :-

start c:\mydir\myfile.htm#bookmark   <--- does *NOT* work

However, iexplore c:\mydir\myfile.htm#bookmark works fine. And so does :-

firefox.exe c:\mydir\myfile.htm   <--- works fine
