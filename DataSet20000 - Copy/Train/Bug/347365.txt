Details: see below.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open "Edit -> Preferences" (or "Tools -> Options") menu
2. Open the various tabs and submenus, looking for the timeout delay before a script is declared "unresponsive".

Actual Results:  
Preference in question is nowhere to be found.

Expected Results:  
Preference should be found somewhere among the "Preferences", not only as a "needle in the haystack" under about:config


Additional information:
The time delay before a script is declared "unresponsive" and causes a popup message is currently fixed at 5 seconds, and can only be modified by means of about:config (or user.js). This 5-second delay is in many cases too short: after noticing that, in most cases, clicking "Continue" allowed (in Firefox) the page to open normally, or (in Thunderbird) the compose window for the "reply to all" email to open normally, with no adverse effects, I went on a hunt for where that timeout was defined. After a little trial-and-error, I have set dom.max_script_run_time to 30 seconds in Firefox and to 15 in Thunderbird; the result is much more satisfactory for me, with my kind of browsing and my set of installed extensions.

I realise that the ideal value cannot be determined once and for all, for all users of Firefox, Thunderbird, Camino and the Mozilla Suite; therefore I believe that users should be able to set this timeout easily to whatever value they prefer, without having to resort to a needle-in-the-haystack search in about:config.

This is all the more needed because, if and when the popup opens, the corresponding tab becomes focused, which can be annoying if the user was in the process of clicking on a link or a button.
