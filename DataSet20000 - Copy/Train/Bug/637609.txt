.js files referenced by pages contained in iframes not loaded from applicationCache

an application using applicationCache to be accessed offline does not work correctly if it has a js file included in an html file in turn included in the main application page through an iFrame: the js file is not correctly loaded from cache even if correctly referenced by the manifest of the application; instead FX4 always tries to load it from the server.

FX3.6, Chrome 9, Safari 5, Opera 11 don't try to reload the js file from the server (of course, unless the appcache file is changed)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open the test case 
2. accept the offline caching
3. reload the page 
Actual Results:  
if you snoop the traffic on the reload you'll notice that script.js (the js file referenced in the html included in the iframe) is re-requested to the server.

Expected Results:  
the script.js file is loaded from the application cache, not from the server

if you don't want to snoop the traffic I'll attach the testcase: deploy it on a web server on your machine, load it with FX4 then shut down the server and reload the app; you'll notice that the "executed" alert is not shown.

In those cases I noticed that re-include the js file may convince FX4 to load it from cache (sometimes work sometimes not):
      if (!checkThatTheScriptWasLoadedCorrectly) {
        var scr = document.createElement("script");
        scr.src = "script.js";
        document.getElementsByTagName("HEAD")[0].appendChild(scr);
      }


Also note that FX behave correctly if the js file is included directly by the main file: http://www.lightstreamer.com/temp/fx4_appcache/SIMPLE
