No details to report. Instant death of firefox when visiting this page.  Web site has sample graphics and such of a programming language interface called GLOBE_3D. Page starts to render (can see the background color of the page (beige?) and several thumbnail style images and then either Firefox is gone, or the crash dump sender is invoked and after it is done, Firefox is gone.

Windows 2000 SP4 and Firefox 2.0.14 ... Very stable except for this one problem

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.paste URL http://globe3d.sf.net/ into navigation line
2.hit enter / go
3.
Actual Results:  
Either crash report popup or firefox vanishes 

Expected Results:  
Expected the rendered web site without a crash

Crash also occurs with default theme with my extensions loaded. 

Very stable computers running Windows 2000 SP4 and XP SP2 and my Firefox normally is VERY stable: this is the first crash I've had in Firefox in a LONG time ...

Extensions I have (all current versions as of 5-29-08):

Session Manager (0.6.1.13)
PrefBar (3.3.4)
PDF Download (1.0.1.1)
Nagios Checker (0.12.2)
IE View Lite (1.3.1)
Free Download Manager plugin (1.3)
ForecastFox (0.9.6)
FlashBlock (1.5.6)
DOM Inspector (1.8.1.14)
CustomizeGoogle (0.72)
ColorfulTabs (2.0.11)
AdBlock Plus (0.7.5.4)
AdBlock Filterset.G Updater (0.3.1.3)

Disabling all of them still still crashes Firefox, sometimes when loading the http://globe3d.sf.net/ web site, and sometimes after rendering it and closing firefox (i.e. it crashes on close after loading this site).

Sorry I don't have time now to track this down further ... 

A virgin install of Firefox 2.0.14 on a Win2k computer does NOT crash on this page ... but what is Firefox without extensions <g> ...

Why it crashes with the extensions disabled I don't know ... Maybe someone else can narrow it further ...

It's been years since I found a web site that would kill my browser like this.
