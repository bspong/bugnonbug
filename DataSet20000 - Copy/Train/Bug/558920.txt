Profile Manager only prompts on initial profile after upgrading to Firefox 3.6.3
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Prior to upgrading to Firefox 3.6.3 - I had Profile Manager setup to start per the following 
"C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe" -ProfileManager

Profile Manager would always prompt when starting from the above as long as there were profiles available that had not been started.

After upgrading to 3.6.3 the week of 2010_04_05-09, Profile Manager only prompts if Firefox is not running any profiles, i.e. not running. 

I did not nor do not have the "Do Not Prompt" box checked in Profile Manager.

Windows Task manager only shows the same ProcessID. 

Clicking the link from a shortcut or running the link from RUN just opens another Firefox window with the same Windows Task Manager ProcessID.

I can no longer get separate Firefox processes to start. 

It behaves as if there is only one profile and the Do Not Prompt box is checked
in Profile Manager.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Kill Firefox 
2.Clicking the link from a shortcut or running the link from RUN just opens another Firefox window with the same Windows Task Manager ProcessID.

Actual Results:  
I can no longer get separate Firefox processes to start. 

It behaves as if there is only one profile and the Do Not Prompt box is checked
in Profile Manager.

Expected Results:  
I have multiple profiles in Profile Manager - 

I destroyed all the previous profiles and created new ones. 

Same thing - only one Profile Manager prompt and after that no more prompts to select other profiles.
