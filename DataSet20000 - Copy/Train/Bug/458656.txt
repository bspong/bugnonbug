Scrolling with a wheel mouse will frequently "Trash" or scramble the display.  If I continue scrolling, the entire display gets scrambled.  Hitting F5 to refresh at the FIRST scramble, will correct the problem.  The scramble will show multiple colored lines or pixels -- no text -- just garbage is in the area of the web page and propagates to the entire display area if I don't hit F5 at the FIRST scramble. This behaviour can happen on just about any page.  It seems to happen the most on pages that have javascript "pop-ups" or "tooltips" or "notes" or have flash. This behaviour only happens in Firefox -- no other program.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Scrolling with wheel mouse
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Display will get scrambled so that nothing shows except multi-colored lines -- garbage.  

Expected Results:  
Expect the web page to display and be readable.

I can't give a screen shot because when it happens, if I try to do ANYTHING else other than hit F5 the entire display becomes trashed.  And hitting F5 doesn't always work.  If I don't catch it fast enough and keep scrolling with the mouse, the entire page is trashed/garbled/unreadable.
