Mozilla Firefox will crash and not restart, it just re-crashes. Have to work in safe-mode.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20100611 Firefox/3.6.4 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Mozilla Firefox, will crash in normal mode but not in safe-mode. I reset to default on my theme and even deleted all cookies. Still nothing is working. I have to work in safe mode to have any internet access. I tried restarting firefox after filling a report, but it just re-crashes over again. I've also removed it from my computer, and reinstalled, that didn't seem to do anything either. It did as for a few updates today and I did that, could it have been that? also, how do you remove plugins I've notice a few on my add-ons that are no longer safe of firefox but will not remove from the list, I do have them disables, could they be the problem? I've also restarted my pc a few times to see if that could have been the problem but that did nothing as well.

Thanks for the Help

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I was in a chat room, also had a very tabs open to random sites.
2. Then Firefox froze my whole internet and so I hit control+alt+delete and ending firefox.
3. Went to restart firefox and the whole thing just kept crashing over and over again.
Actual Results:  
I went into safe-mode on firefox to see what the site could do to help me fix the problem. I reset everything to the default and nothing worked. I can not run firefox in normal mode, just safe mode


It anything it could be the latest updates or a theme I was using. The theme was Zelda related.
