Page loading issue in version 3.6 on all platforms (fixed with Beta 4.09)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; InfoPath.2)
Build Identifier: Version 3.6.13

This has been tested with version 3.6.13 on Windows (7 and XP) Mac and Linux and is consistant accross all platforms. On large sites (like the one I supplied above) pages (and images) take forever to fully load and the status bar at the bottom is screaming between wait/transfer for a ages. We have found through page counters that each visit to a page with 3.6 can add up to 30 or more tics to the counter where it should be just one. This is causing multiple queries instances to run causing the pages to load slowely and the pipeline to the SQL server to become clogged. 

We can easily recreate this with a clean fresh install of 3.6 with no add-ons, etc. on any platform in different locations throughout the US. The new beta 4.09 doesn't have this issue (nice browser by the way). 

We've noticed a lot of people complaining about 3.6's speed on various forums  and we think this is the real issue. In the meantime this issue is working our servers harder and is an anoyance for users.

We have yet to find a reason why this is happening. It happens on other sites as well, generally larger sites. We think this is an major issue that should be fixed asap. The sites that have the most noticable issues with Firefox 3.6 load great in other browsers. Again your beta 4.09 has fixed the issue - whatever is causing it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit www.yogisinc.com
2. Click on the Wheels icon and watch the status bar and images while the page loads
3. follow the links through to get to a product page and watch the staus and speed. This will not happen with Firefox 4.09
Actual Results:  
The alt image tags display, the status bar goes crazy and everything loads like a snail.

Expected Results:  
It will load the page quickly with one call on other browsers and Firefox 4.09

Feel free to contact me by phone. Happy to help in any way. I feel this is critical because of the load on servers similar to a mini denial of service attack. For instance, if a page normally runs 10 queries to populate the page and someone is running v3.6, it multiplies the threads by the number of times it reloads the page (in the background) so 10 threads can easily becoms 300 threads. Multiply that by the number of Firefox users and we have a big problem.
