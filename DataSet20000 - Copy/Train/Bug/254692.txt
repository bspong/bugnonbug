Bookmarks should open to the top of the list every time; otherwise it appears to scroll on its own.

After I click on "bookmarks" and I scroll down the list I leave bookmarks.  When
I click on bookmarks again, the bookmarks menu seems to automatically scroll
back to the top on its own making me feel out of control of my computer.  I
believe this happens because when I open bookmarks again the 2nd time, it does
not open at the top of the list.  It opens where I left off, and my mouse is
usually pointed at the up arrow when I reopen.  Bookmarks should always reopen
at the top of the list, even in the same browsing session.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Scroll down more than one page through the bookmarks menu
2.  Select a link
3.  Reopen bookmarks, and it will automatically scroll back to the top on its
own unless you move the mouse away from the up arrow quickly.

Actual Results:  
The bookmarks menu scrolled back to the top.

Expected Results:  
The bookmarks menu should have started at the top of the list the 2nd time I
used the menu.
