when I load the mentioned link AND click anywhere on the screen I firefox crashes and I get error message (see details)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT 5.0; MSOCD)
Build Identifier: 

I'm running Windows 2000 Pro SP4
Mozilla 1.0.6

Theme: Brushed 0.9.9.5

I go to website www.marketwatch.com and from there click on article which takes 
me to:

When I click anywhere on the screen, firefox crashes (stops working)and I get 
this small screen which comes up as an explanation:

"Program Error:firefox.exe has generated errors and will be closed by Windows. 
You will need to restart the program. An error log is being created. [OK]"

If I DONT click on the page, everything is fine. But immediately when I click, 
it happens. I've tested it 5 times and it is the same everytime. Even if I try 
to scroll (click on the scroll bar) it crashes and I get the error. Also if I 
click on the border of the window. Anyway, you get the idea.
