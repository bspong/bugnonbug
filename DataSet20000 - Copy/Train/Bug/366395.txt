We have maths quiz software that generates HTML. Frequently, large round or square brackets are needed. These are built from unicode glyphs. The thing is in early version of Mozilla such large brackets displayed just fine, but the more recent
versions of Firefox just display question marks. Here is a code fragments with 
large round brackets:

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td align="left" nowrap="nowrap">
 = f </td><td class="cl" align="left">&#63723;<br>&#63725;
</td><td align="center" nowrap="nowrap">
g(x)</td><td class="cl" align="left">&#63734;<br>&#63736;
</td><td align="center" nowrap="nowrap">
</td></tr></tbody></table></td><td width="50%"></td></tr>
 <tr><td width="50%"></td><td colspan="1" align="right" nowrap="nowrap"><table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td align="left" nowrap="nowrap">
 </td></tr></tbody></table>

The glyphs with entities #63xxx for various values of x appear to be unknown
to Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set the Character Encoding to Western (ISO-8859-1)
2. Put the code fragment above inside (where the dots are) <html><body>...</body></html>
3. It's supposed to render as:   = f( g(x) )
where the outer brackets are large ones.
Actual Results:  
The latest Firefox renders both large brackets as question marks.

An early version of Mozilla:

Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i586; en-US; rv:1.0.0) Gecko/20020605, build 20020605
1

displays both brackets fine, whereas a later version rv: 1.7.8 for Linux displays the opening large bracket fine but prints some strange screwed up
mess for the closing bracket. All more recent versions of Firefox simply display
question marks.

Expected Results:  
I hoped for large brackets.
