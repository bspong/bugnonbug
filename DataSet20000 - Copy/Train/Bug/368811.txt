Firefox crashes on exit after plugin install activated by InstallTrigger.install(xpi,installCompleteFunction)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1

After installing a plugin using xpinstall, and triggering the install with InstallTrigger.install(xpi,installCompleteFunction), the browser crashes on exit in JS3250.dll if the Add-ons window (which pops up during plugin install) is closed after the last page.

I built a debug build of Firefox 1.5.0.9 from sources and the crash happens in 
JS3250.ddl: 

nsXPITriggerInfo::~nsXPITriggerInfo()
{
    nsXPITriggerItem* item;

    for(PRUint32 i=0; i < Size(); i++)
    {
        item = Get(i);
        if (item)
            delete item;
    }
    mItems.Clear();

    if ( mCx && !JSVAL_IS_NULL(mCbval) ) {
        JS_BeginRequest(mCx);
>>>>    JS_RemoveRoot( mCx, &mCbval );
        JS_EndRequest(mCx);
    }

    MOZ_COUNT_DTOR(nsXPITriggerInfo);
}

After some debugging, I verified that during the install, the nsXPITriggerInfo receives the pointer to the callback function installCompleteFunction in the SaveCallback() method, which saves it to the mCbval variable. 

When install is completed, the callback is called and then the method 

static void  destroyTriggerEvent(XPITriggerEvent* event)
{
    JS_BeginRequest(event->cx);
    JS_RemoveRoot( event->cx, &event->cbval );
    JS_EndRequest(event->cx);
    delete event;
}

is correcly executed. 

Then, when the last page has been closed and the add-on window has been closed, the destructor is called and crashes.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a web page that launches a plugin install with InstallTrigger.install(xpi,installCompleteFunction)
1b. The add-on window pops up and display the installation advace
2. Open a web page that uses the plugin 
3. Open another page / tab
4. Close all pages
5. Close the Add-on window
Actual Results:  
Crash 

Expected Results:  
Smooth exit

It was unable to reproduce the crash with Talkback installed.
