Crazy memory management behaviour seen when viewing page with images

probably related to Bugzilla Bug 326611:

In loading a website (and all associated images) firefox showed strange memory mangement (as seen from windows task manager). 

Website: http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~genoway/StintinoAlghero.html
Behaviour seen: Memory climbing from 20M to 100M within seconds due to loading a website that shouldnt take much more than 15M memory. Images are largish, but only roughly half meg each, .. there are around 24 images. 
Firefox slows to whole computer to a halt, response is frozen intermittantly until able to kill Firefox and forefully release its memory. At one stage Firefox reportedly only used 14meg (after closing the tested website) but computer response was still very poor until Firefox as a whole was shutdown.
Website tested with Internet Explorer 6.0.2800.1106 and loads with relatively few problems. Note: Am running on Windows XP with 256M RAM.
Not a developers machine, but one shouldnt need a dual processor machine with a GIG or RAM to load a 20M Website. And besides, Internet Explorer can do it, so so should Firefox be able to. 

Firefox version, as seen from "ABOUT" is:

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6

Thanks

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load website
2. Wait
3. Unresponsiveness grows after each image is loaded

Actual Results:  
load the page
http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~genoway/StintinoAlghero.html
or probably any other page with multiple large images on. 

Expected Results:  
machine responsiveness disappears
strange memory usage as seen on Task Manager
Firefox unresponsiveness

Have no problems. Memory usage should be only what was required for the page to load, not the 60 or so Meg extra that it seemed to use.
