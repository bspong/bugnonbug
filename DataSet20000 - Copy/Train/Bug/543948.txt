Web pages can intercept events in the Firefox 3.6 address bar

It seems to be possible for web pages to intercept events in the Firefox 3.6 address bar. On some pages on nciku.com (a Chinese-English dictionary), pressing Enter in the address bar performs an action on the site, rather than going to the url I entered.

Specifically, on nciku.com search results pages such as http://www.nciku.com/search/all/test , if I go to the page then immediately type another address in the Firefox address bar and press Enter, the page performs a search on that page instead of me going to that address.

Whether or not there's some bug in that site, webpages should not be able to steal keypresses from the browser's address bar.

This happens to Firefox 3.6 on at least Windows XP and OSX; probably all operating systems. Previous versions of Firefox worked correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to www.nciku.com/search/all/test (or any search results page on nciku.com)
2. click in the Firefox browser's address bar (without clicking anywhere on the page first)
3. enter a url into the Firefox address bar, e.g. www.google.com
4. press enter
Actual Results:  
A search is performed on the nciku.com website

Expected Results:  
I am taken to the address I typed in

Tested on Windows XP and OSX 10.6.2, both with the same results on Firefox 3.6. Previous versions of Firefox (up to 3.5.7) worked correctly.
