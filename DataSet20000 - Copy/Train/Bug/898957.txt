Regression: Javascript behavior different between FF 21 and 22/23
Created attachment 782398
Screenshot referred to

We've had a customer report this problem on the enterprise mailing list in their app. Screenshot is attached.


The blue icons in the image below with the "i" symbol.

1 . Using V21, When the user clicks on that, the focus on the page
changes to the "Selected Ad Details" tab.

2.  The user can then click on the "Edition Ads" tab and click on
another "blue i" to move to a different "Selected Ad Details".

However, using V22 (and V23 beta) step 1. Works fine, but for step 2. to
occur, the user must refresh the page using the F5 key.

The icon runs javascript which passes variables back to a php script
which sucks the data out of a mysql database.

I seems to me as if the variables are not being re-set, but I can find
the about:config entry which has changed between the 2 versions that
controls this.

Unfortunately, they can't give us access to the app, but they tracked down the regression range:

I'm maybe other people can look through the log and help me figure out exactly what changed...
