Standards-compliant embedding of realplayer in a web page fails to pass parameters to the realplayer plugin during object initialization.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; AOL 9.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.0.4

When I embed the realplayer plugin in a web page using the OBJECT tag, the 
following code works...

<object id="ExampleOfPluginEmbed"
        data="xxxxxxxx.ram"
        type="audio/x-pn-realaudio-plugin"
        width="230"
        height="230"
        controls="ImageWindow,ControlPanel,StatusBar"
        console="Video1">
</object>

Rename "xxxxxxx.ram" above to the URL of any .ram file that contains a URL to 
any .rm file. "Video1" console can be any name. The code above will not 
validate because "controls" and "console" are private, plug-in-specific 
attributes and are not valid HTML or XHTML attributes of the OBJECT tag. 
Firefox ignores those attributes when parsing, but still passes those values to 
the realplayer plug-in. The result is that the embedded realplayer displays as 
it should with the image window for the video and the controls which have the 
play button and volume control, etc. as well as the status bar which shows data 
transfer rates, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next block of code will validate, but the "controls" and "console" 
parameters and their values do not get passed to the plugin as it should. The 
result is that only the default realplayer controls get embedded, but not the 
image window. All of the controls get embedded by default and not just the 
control panel and status bar and they take up the entire width and height. The 
names and values for the real plugin parameters are not case sensitive. 
Realplayer allows you to also specify exactly which controls to use as well. In 
my example, I only embed the control panel and the status bar plus the image 
window for the video.

<object id="ExampleOfPluginEmbed"
        data="xxxxxxxx.ram"
        type="audio/x-pn-realaudio-plugin"
        width="230"
        height="230">
      <param name="controls value="ImageWindow,ControlPanel,StatusBar" />
      <param name="console" vlaue="Video1" />
</object>

From what I understand, Gecko passes the values of the OBJECT attributes to the 
plug-in using the arg parameter of the NPP_New call that creates the plug-in 
instance. I thought that the PARAM values were supposed to be sent in this 
array as well as the attributes. Obviously they are not.

If PARAM values could be passed to plug-ins in the same manner that EMBED 
attributes are passed to plug-ins then this will enable web authors to write 
valid code and use all plug-ins just as effectively as with the non-standard 
EMBED tag.

I could create functional test pages to demonstrate this if you need me to. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a web page that embeds the realplayer plugin with the methods 
explained in my details.
2.View in Firefox
3.

Actual Results:  
The non-valid code works as it should, but will not validate. The valid code 
will not display the image window...it ignores the private, plug-in-specific 
parameters.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should pass the parameter names and values to the plugin.

I am embedding the realplayer plugin that is installed with Real Alternative 
v1.40.
