Worng Content is displayed in iframe if you reload a page while the page is still loading

If you press F5 while a page is still loading, you may get content of an iframe
from the last page in the reloaded page. This happens if the reloaded page has
less iframes than the last page. In the example we can reproduce it with iframes
but we also saw it with other external? content.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
open http://www.raikosoft.com/reloadbug/main.php
you can download the page source here:
http://www.raikosoft.com/reloadbug/reloadbug.zip

The page uses 4 seconds sleeps to show the behavior better.
On the page there are two iframes:
one shows the text "Top" in a red iframe
the other shows the text "Bottom" in a blue iframe.
The blue iframe is shown always. The red iframe is shown by random.
   
1. load the page http://www.raikosoft.com/reloadbug/main.php until you see both
   iframes.
2. press F5 
3. press F5 again within 2 seconds (while the page is still loading)
4. repeat step 2 and 3 until you see the red "Top" iframe under the hr line
Actual Results:  
The content of the red "Top" iframe is shown instead of the blue "Bottom" iframe.


We think this is not an iframe problem but a problem with content which is loaded
in background. If you load a page while the current page is still loading,
perhaps the background threads? are not canceled. So the content of the last page is shown in the new page.
You can also reproduce the bug with the forward/backward buttons.
