I'd like to report a 2 bugs that occur since I have installed the latest version of Fire Fox browser(3.6).First bug is shortly appearing black screen while loading Java based chat client(that screen with loading yellow status bar),particularly http://czat.onet.pl/(any chat room),which isn't present when I use FF 3.5.7.Second bug is a thin broken line border around main chat window,which appears,when I switch back to chat from another card or window and click on the message window(this one where you put the text of your message to send).Short screen flickering occurs while this action,too.The only way to get rid of this annoying border is to simply click on it,but it is still irritating to me.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Upgrade to Fire Fox 3.6 from 3.5.7
2.Open any chat room at http://czat.onet.pl/
3.Switch to another card or window,then back to chat and try to put the text in message window
Actual Results:  
Shortly appearing black screen is present while chat client is loading and thin broken line border around main chat window pops up,when I switch back from another card/window to chat client.

Expected Results:  
There should be no black screen while chat is loading and no broken line border should ever appear in main chat window.

I wasn't using any Personas themes,when these bugs occured and didn't change any settings in Fire Fox after installation of this latest version.I have no NT Framework 2.0 installed on my operating system(maybe this is a cause of these bugs?).I'm using Java Quick Starter 1.0 and Java (TM) Platform SE 6 U18 6.0.180.7(Next Generation Java Plug-in 1.6.0_18 for Mozilla browsers).
