Tree control with bookmarks selectItems does not appear to work...

I wrote an add-on that uses a tree filled with bookmark folders only (via setting the place of the tree).  The tree is set to select only one item at a time.  

The selectItems call never worked in my tree.  As a work-around I select items down the row until an itemId matches what I want.

I also notice that selecting an item in a single-selection tree does not scroll the tree's control to that area.  As a result sometimes I have something selected but it is not visible unless you scroll down.

Reproducible: Always

There are two issues here.

1) The bigger issue is I could never get selectItems to work for my tree.
My work-around is as-follows.
for (var i = 0; i < rowCount; i++){
      bookmarksTree.view.selection.select(i);
      var folderNode = bookmarksTree.selectedNode;
      var itemId = folderNode.itemId;
      if (itemId == idValue)
	break;
      else
	bookmarksTree.view.selection.clearSelection();
    }

2) The second issue is that selecting a row in a single-selection tree should probably always ensure that the selection is visible/scrolled-to.
