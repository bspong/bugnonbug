There is a menu item for showing the history in the sidebar under the history menu, but no counterpart for this in the bookmarks menu (as explained in bug 351829 No 'Show In Sidebar' menu item in Bookmarks menu). If this menu item were to be kept, I think it should read "show history in sidebar" as "show in sidebar" is ambiguous : being in the history menu does not necessarily make this explicit, and this could pose problems to those using a screenreader for example. (this problem is described in bug 360236 Rename "Show in Sidebar" menu item to "View History in Sidebar")

I would argue against adding an entry to show bookmarks on the sidebar to the bookmarks entry, and to remove the current "show in sidebar" entry from the history menu, as it seems silly to duplicate the functionality in the menu. There is already at least a toolbar button that has this functionality. Why not by the same logic add a "show history" entry to the tools menu and the edit menu while we are at it ?

As far as I can see, the entries from the "sidebar" submenu of the tools menu would be be better placed directly in the view menu. We would have for example "Show history in sidebar" and "Show bookmarks in sidebar", rather than hiding them in a submenu. When people are looking for this functionality, they are probably scanning the menus for "history" or "bookmarks" rather than "sidebar.

Hope this is clear enough, and sorry for reprising those two bugs, but I think it was important to consolidate the issues.

Love, Karderio.
