CPU usage very high with many tabs open. Pages are idle, content is 100% loaded, CPU is veryhigh.

I loaded 67 tabs in chrome, safari and Firefox 3.6.15 and Firefox 4.0 RC1. The Firefox 4.0 RC1 build uses at least one complete core just being idle and sometimes goes over 100% of one CPU and 50% into the second CPU without even counting what the plugin container is doing, thats another 20%.

These pages are not loaded with dynamic content, JS, or flash that is outrageous, so I dont understand how CPU usage could be this high.

I noticed this when testing firefox 4.0 as the laptop got hot for the first time since I've owned it, over 4 months now. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start 67 tabs - should not be overly rich, just basic news sites
2. let them finish loading
3. watch how bad idle CPU is
Actual Results:  
results now is that firefox 4.0 rc1 is at least triple 3.6.15 was in the same situation. safari and chrome are much better as well.

Expected Results:  
Why should idle pages and idle content melt the CPU. CPU usage should be at most 25% of one CPU core. 

Please take these seriously - with all the browsers being optimized for embedded usage, tablets, phones, laptops, its CRITICAL that browsers respect power usage and heat creation in portable devices.
