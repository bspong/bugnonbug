User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506)

After upgrading FROM - 2.0.0.2   TO -  2.0.0.3 Firefox fails to connect to ANY page.
 
I AM able to get on the internet when using IE and Opera and it happened right after installation of the newest update.  I am reporting while in IE because it won't load webpages (RUNNING VISTA)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Double Click Firefox.exe
2. Firefox Loads
3. Unable to connect. Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at www.yahoo.com, www.google.com, www.msn.com or any other site.

        


        
        


    *   The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few
          moments.

    *   If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
          connection.

    *   If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure
          that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.
