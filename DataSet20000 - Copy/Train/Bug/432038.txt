Some pages from Google search are not displayed under the special condition that the search consists of one quoted set of terms, and that no pages are found having that search term 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bring up main Google search page.  
2. Enter search term "Funky Chicken Utilities" (with quotes). 
3. Search.  
4. Google returns page stating that they did not find any pages with the specified search terms _including quotes_ but that they _did_ find the following pages searching _without_ quotes. They show 8 or more pages of search results.  

5. Click on any one of the page numbers in the line of page numbers at bottom of display.  

Actual Results:  
Clicking on a page number other than 1 produces the same page 1 display.  Clicking on Next produces the same page 1 display.  i.e. no way to produce page 2, 3 .... of results.  

Expected Results:  
Clicking on a page number should display that page of search results. 
Clicking on Next should display the next higher page number of results .    

Investigation so far:   Same procedure works properly in Internet Explorer (as bundled with XP Pro), so its probably not a bug at Google . . . .  

Workaround is to resubmit search as       Funky Chicken Utilities    (without quotes)
