Website causes firefox to crash to desktop

Even though this is a problem with a 'broken web page', the symptoms are that it causes firefox to completely crash to the desktop, rather than just display the page incorrectly, so I decided to report it as a bug.

When I go to http://rainbowsixgame.us.ubi.com/home.php, enter my date of birth (needs to be over 18 years ago) and click submit, the next page partially loads, then causes firefox to completely crash. 

This is reproducible on my machine, not tried any other machines yet.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://rainbowsixgame.us.ubi.com/home.php
2. Enter date of birth over 18 years ago
3. Wait for page to load, should crash.
Actual Results:  
Get a windows error dialogue: "firefox has encountered an error and needs to close"

Expected Results:  
The page should load correctly..
