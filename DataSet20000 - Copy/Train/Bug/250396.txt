In my menu i see this:
 > File
 > Edit
   > Undo        Ctrl-Z
   > Redo        Ctrl-Y
   [...]
 [...]
 > Tools
   > Downloads   Ctrl-Y
 [...]


In earlier versions then Shortcut for open
the download manager was (when i remember correct) Ctrl-E, and i think it was
the "better" way.


So i can use Ctrl-Y to open the download manager "in normal sitations", but when
im in an textarea-Field (like now) and remove some text, make it undo and will
it make redo again, Ctrl-Y do it... The same key for two funktions!?


Sorry for my bad englsh, bug i hope you understand me. ;)
