filename and lineno not useful in error event for syntax error hit while loading web worker

I create a web worker:
		worker_instance = new Worker('loader_worker');
		worker_instance.onmessage = readMessage;
		worker_instance.onerror = handleError;

handlerError is:
    var handleError = function(event) {
	alert("Error " +
	      event.message +
	      " occurred in web worker at " +
	      event.filename +
	      ":" +
	      event.lineno);
	return false;
    };

The "loader_worker.js" script has a syntax error:

big syntax error ;

I catch the event, the event has a filename and lineno attribute but filename is the empty string and lineno is 0.

It would be nice if, at least, the lineno could be fixed.  The filename can be deduced kinda/sorta.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a web work via new Worker("path.js");
2. In path.js have a syntax error
3. Catch the error event in the onerror handler for the worker and examine the event.
Actual Results:  
event.filename is "" and event.lineno is 0.  event.message is set for me.


Expected Results:  
event.filename should be "path.js" or something similar.  event.lineno should be the line number that the syntax error was detected.

I tried this on the "last night build" and it still happened.  I have firebug installed.
