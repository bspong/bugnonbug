Actually this is not rally a bug, but i am VERY unhappy and a bit worried and most of all VERY angry about the fact that there seems to be no way to block unrequested Flash-Popups!!! I wasn't able to find any link to somewhere I could post something, which is not a bug, via the mozilla.org web-interface. 
anyway, so here my suggestion:

-> To modem users these poups are a real torture. (me too althogh I have DSL. It is anoying like hell)
-> Flash popups show overlaped within the Window that one wants to read/view!!! 
-> any click on any button/part of the popup forces new UNREQUESTED links to be opened!!!
-> There is way too many users out there who have no clue what happens when they click on something (or not;-): 
Quote: "My daugther always goes into the internet via google." - do I have to say more. ok: "where did it go??? HELP!" - "Whats wrong?" - "I was [...] then clicked on [any link] and suddenly everything was gone and this thing  appeared. did I break something?" - "Take a look at your taskbar" - "What is a "taskbar"???" - "..."
I didn't make up these dialogues!!! The 1st one was a neighbour the other was between me and my mum!
Users like this are a threat to their PCs and their own privacy and must be protected - without me having to be around all the time. ;-)
-> Flash-Popups suck ass and should be illegal or at least BLOCKABLE.
-> there is limit of how many ads a humanbeing can bare!  
-> I'm not familiar with falsh so I don't know if there could be integrated some malevolent code
-> fake-(close-)buttons which open unrequested links to avoid popupblockers are very popular
-> people might not know if they're viewing a site which contains malevolennt buttons/links/scripts/code


PLEASE HELP US TO PROTECT OURSELVES!

P.S. and please tell me where to post suggestions in the future.
