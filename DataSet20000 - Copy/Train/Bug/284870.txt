every time I try to access my yahoo inbox,  it simply loads and reloads without allowing me access.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050225 Firefox/1.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050225 Firefox/1.0.1

  When I try to access http://mail.yahoo.com , after already logging in, since
downloading the newest version of firefox, the site simply loads and reloads,
occasionally flashing me brief sights of the inbox, but does not let me access
it.  I  tried accessing the same account with Mozilla, to see if it was in fact
a problem due to http://www.yahoo.com having a malfunction, I had no problem
viewing the inbox, which tells me that it is Firefox at fault.
  This only occurred after I downloading the most recent version of Firefox;
however, it started about twelve hours after I downloaded the newer version, in
which I had a few problems accessing the site.  As time progressed the problem
got progressively worse.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to http://mail.yahoo.com, either signed in on a yahoo.com screenname, or
simply logging in once the "sign-in" screen appears
2.  Enter password and log in.
3.  Attempt to click on "inbox" link (if firefox even allows that part to show up)

Actual Results:  
  The site remained blank; the bar at the bottom simply re-loaded and re-loaded;
occasionally a flash of the toolbar would show up, distorted, but then it would
return to a blank screen, or a page stating Yahoo was having difficulties at
that point in time.

Expected Results:  
  It should have taken me straight to my e-mail address' inbox, allowing me to
view my messages.
