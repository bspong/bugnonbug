Homepage cannot be reset and I have to unselect "Print Background" everytime I open Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/531.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.3 Safari/531.9.1

Everytime I open Firefox I have to go and uncheck the box in Page Setup regarding Printing Backgrounds, it won't stay unchecked.  Some things I print especially when ordering parts from Dell, print pages of black and it wastes my black toner for my laser printer.  In addition, with the latest version I can't seem to change the homepage away from the Firefox introductory page that you get after an upgrade.  I wish I could find solutions for this.  I have searched high and low on your website and other sites as well and I can find nothing on this.

I have tried reseting Firefox back to original settings and that doesn't work.
I have tried tweaking it using about:config and that works until I close Firefox and reopen it.  It is really getting frustrating and since then I have looked at Opera and Safari and they are not much of an alternative as I see and I don't like IE either.  Surely there is something I can do to fix this problem.
