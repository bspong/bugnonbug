1. Launch new profile. Make sure only 1 window is opened and it is in maximized mode.
2. Open devtools (Ctrl+Shift+I) -> Options, enable "Enable browser chrome and add-on debugging
   toolboxes", enable "Enable remote debugging". Close devtools.
3. Open Scratchpad (Shift+F4)

5. Close Browser Console (Ctrl+W or at least Alt+F4)

AR:  Scratchpad window disappears (hides under Firefox window). Firefox window is focused

Notes:
1) If you do the mozregression, firefox behaves differently. You have to save a build,
   then extract it and launch manually. Create new profile if you want.
2) You can actually do the mozregression too, but Actual Result (AR) is different in this case.
   AR: Scratchpad window is visible and focused, but there's no caret and I can't type a letter
3) This isn't specific to multiprocess mode.
