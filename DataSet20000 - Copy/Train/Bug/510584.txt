After a time (unknown time frame), my browser stops showing this graphic.

I host a site called kasparek.com and one of the background image stops displaying after a time (unknown value). When I restart the browser it works fine. The specific image is at http://www.kasparek.com/templates/jsn_epic_pro/images/module-box-grey-bg-r.png . Never happens with IE7, Chrome or Safari.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bring up webpage http://www.kasparek.com
2. Wait for awhile
3. Do a refresh and the background graphic in the side menu disappears
4. Navigate to the graphic http://www.kasparek.com/templates/jsn_epic_pro/images/module-box-grey-bg-r.png
5. Reload - Nothing shows but the filename
6. Restart Browser
7. Graphic shows fine.
Actual Results:  
http://www.kasparek.com/templates/jsn_epic_pro/images/module-box-grey-bg-r.png shows as a filename rather than a graphic

Expected Results:  
http://www.kasparek.com/templates/jsn_epic_pro/images/module-box-grey-bg-r.png should show graphic

Will attempt to time the event.
