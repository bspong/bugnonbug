enable share button by default with default selection of share providers
Created attachment 8426697

The attached movie of the prototype probably explains this best, but here are top level bullet points.

- share button always visible/enabled (unless user customizes it away)
- there is a "+" button with a panel that lists providers
- providers are one-click activated from the panel, allowing users to quickly share
- a share provider may support more than share, but only share providers will appear in the share panel
- we may have a "most popular" or "sponsored" placement
- we want to show providers based on a users frecency to give them a selection of the most relevant providers for them

Intended implementation:

- panel will load a webpage from our directory (listed in the existing social.directories pref, currently activations.cdn.mozilla.net) that will contain the layout/design.  A link header in that page will contain the url to a json file on the directory (or perhaps we include the manifest in the page itself)

- firefox loads the json file, which contains a list of manifests, compares that against frecency, sends a dom event or port message to the page with the top 3 matches (that are not installed)

- since our initial list of share providers will be less than 20, this should be enough in the short term.  We can manage the json file to limit it to a shortlist of the most popular providers if the list grows large enough.
