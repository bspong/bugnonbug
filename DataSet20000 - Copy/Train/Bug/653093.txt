Rename Workspace to Scratchpad
After landing the Integrate Workspace bug 642176, some concerns about the name of the feature arose during the l10n review.

The feature is intended to provide a simple text editor for creating and evaluating bits of JavaScript code for the purposes of function prototyping, experimentation and convenient scripting.

Discussion occurred here:

I think the currently-preferred name is Scratchpad. I'm leaning towards leaving off "JavaScript" from that name because we will likely add additional, non JS capabilities in the future.

Other suggestions have been:

JavaScript Environment
Scrapbook
Notepad
Editor

(all of which could have JS pre-pended to them)

We should provide a solid description of this feature in the localization note in browser.dtd with a reference to this bug.

Note to localizers:

It's quite possible that you won't have a good analogue for the word "Scratchpad" in your locale. You should feel free to find a close approximation to it or choose a word that means "simple discardable text editor".
