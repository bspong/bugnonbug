I am randomly unable to enter text into the search box on the google home page.  This behavior started with one of the final Firefox 3 RC releases.  The page comes up.  I type.  Nothing happens.  I explicitly click on the search box.  Nothing happens.  If I reload the page, I can type in the search box.  Apparently, waiting for a while can also result in my being able to type in the search box (this happened just now as I was starting to fill out this bug report.)  There does not seem to be a pattern to when this occurs.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to http://www.google.com/
2.  Try to type in the search box
3.  Grieve for the search that could have been
4.  Reload the page
5.  Dance with joy at now being able to search
Actual Results:  
At random, I'm unable to type anything into the search box.

Expected Results:  
I should always be able to enter text into a text box.

Note: I am running adblock plus.  However, I do not block anything on the google home page.
