Tab saving does not work when closing Firefox using the red X in Mac OSX
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

My girlfriend recently got herself a shiny new MacBook Pro, and installed Firefox, as that’s her browser of preference. She kept having a problem that her tabs would not be saved when she closed Firefox, and asked me to look into it.
 
All the settings under Preferences were OK, so the problem was not with the settings. Likewise, the relevant settings under about:config were set correctly. We tried deleting prefs.js, but that didn’t help either.
 
Then, as a last-ditch attempt, I tried closing Firefox using the option on the menu bar. I then got the beloved question “Do you want Firefox to save your tabs”. I clicked yes, then restarted Firefox. All the tabs were reloaded. I then used the red X in the upper right-hand corner, the opened Firefox, and the tabs were not reloaded.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Open several tabs
3.Use the red "X" to close Firefox
Actual Results:  
Tabs are not saved, dialog box asking whether to save tabs is not displayed

Expected Results:  
Dialog box asking to save the tabs should appear, Firefox should save the tabs

I'm not reporting the problem from her computer, will return with full build info.

Bug found and confirmed in versions 3.5.7 and 3.6
