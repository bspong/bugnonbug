From Firefox 4 beta on, the location bar displays a web search instead of redirecting to a specific website when typing text that does not represent a web address (e.g. typing bugzilla would redirect you to bugzilla.org instead of displaying a web search)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; pt-PT; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 Firefox/3.6.8 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b4) Gecko/20100818 Firefox/4.0b4

This was a brilliant feature, present in every firefox version prior to the beta builds of version 4. With these last, upon typing, say, "Bugzilla" in the address bar and pressing enter, instead of being redirected directly to the most revelant result firefox finds on the web (in this case, bugzilla.org), the user is taken to a web search. The problem with this is that the original feature saves the user precious browsing time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type something in the Address Bar in any version of Firefox 4 Beta (this behavior is also present in the latest version of Minefield). (e.g. "Bugzilla")
2.Hit enter.
3.Perform the above steps in Firefox 3.6, for example.
Actual Results:  
While on the beta builds a web search (performed by Google, by default) is performed, reproducing the same steps in a previous version of Firefox would take you straight to the most relevant website (in this case, bugzilla.org), saving you time.

Expected Results:  
I believe it would be a better option to preserve this functionality (redirect to bugzilla.org directly), saving the user time. In case someone prefers the new way it works, such is also possible to reproduce already from the search bar.
