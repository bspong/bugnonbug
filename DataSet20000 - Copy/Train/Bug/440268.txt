Gmail chat will not load, RTF buttons no longer load
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0
Build Identifier: Firefox/3.0

Prior to downloading Firefox 3, about 72 hours ago I began to experience Unable to Load message on Gmail on Firefox 2.  Thinking maybe Firefox 3 beta and today Firefox 3 might fix problem, downloaded Firefox 3.  When Composing on Gmail, I no longer have RTF keys (which permit Bold, Font size, color, etc) functional.  When I switch to MS Windows IE, everything works fine.  Firefox 2 on 5 or 6 other computers here does not have this problem.  Cold booted computer. Restarted router. No joy.  Have not had any prior problems with Firefox versions.  Gmail help has not been forthcoming, so I thought I would see if others using Firefox have had this problem.  Baffled why problem is unique to this laptop, and more baffled that problem does not appear on IE. And I did not touch any settings..........

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log on to Gmail
2. Wait for Chat to Load
3. Message: Unable to Load, check internet connection."

Actual Results:  
No Chat list appears.

Other problem appears when you hit Compose.  RTF buttons do not appear.

Expected Results:  
1.  Chat to load, button to turn green next to my screen name, light green for other buddies on line

2.  On Compose, RTF buttons appear, at worst with prompt by hitting arrow next to Rich Text Formatting on Gmail compose screen

Chat is automatically disabled in Gmail HTML or "Older Version."  "Start Chat" toggle at bottom has no effect.  When you click on my account name in Chat bar, extension for Email. Chat. Other comes up, and Chat is a ghostly gray, like it has been somehow turned off.  Not by me that I know of.
