Reordering subfolders of the same hierarchy level in the left pane of Library (Bookmarks/Organize Bookmarks) using drag-n-drop sometimes produces inconsistent results or doesn't work at all.



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new profile.
2. Open "Bookmarks/Organize Bookmarks" (Library) window.
3. Create several new (empty) subfolders under the Bookmarks Menu folder so that they are siblings of the same level.
4. On the left pane of the Library window, try to rearrange the newly created folders several times using drag-n-drop. Drag folders so that only their order is changed (i.e. they still must remain siblings and direct subfolders of the Bookmarks Menu).
Actual Results:  
Sometimes a folder being drag-and-dropped doesn't move to where it should be according to a drag-n-drop indicator, but instead shifts forward or backward by 1 position; sometimes, it doesn't move at all (the latter case is reproducible, i.e. when the same item is dragged onto the same position again, it doesn't move again).

Usually it takes me 10-20 attempts of reordering folders to reproduce this bug, while having a total of 4 subfolders in the Bookmarks Menu.

Expected Results:  
When folders are rearranged by drag-n-drop, they should always move to the place shown by the drag-n-drop indicator.

I can reproduce the bug only using the LEFT pane of the Library to rearrange items; the right pane, as well as reordering folders directly in the Bookmarks menu, works for me.
