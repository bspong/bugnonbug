Firefox tends to freeze/crash several minutes after visiting Facebook (and/or video sites), also when coming out of Hibernation
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:54.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/54.0
Build ID: 20170628075643

Steps to reproduce:

I visit Facebook, usually in a Private Window (b/c I visit most nonsense sites in Private mode to keep the cache usage down)...
Or, I close the private window, leave the main window open and put the PC into Hibernation 


Actual results:

After FB: Within minutes, FF tends to freeze, slow, or crash altogether. Sometimes the freezing will end, but it will ALWAYS be slow as a result. This same thing happens often after visiting YouTube, but not 100%

After Hibernation: It always slows, whether I've been to FB or not.


Expected results:

It shouldn't slow.

To resolve (whether as a result of FB or Hibernation), I clear cache if able, exit FF -- sometimes have to use task manager to do that -- and then run SAS to ensure that it's not a tracking cookie or something slowing things down (Since FB is often the culprit, I figure it could be).

I have Win10. However, I asked a friend w/a Mac to check it, b/c he was telling me he was having the same issues w/FF and stopped using it. I asked him to open FF, visit some sites, then go to FB. He found the same issue. Then he replicated it with YouTube as well. (For me, YouTube often has NO effect. I'm not sure what could make it sometimes occur and sometimes not -- I'm clearly not a techie.)

This is fairly recent, going back 2 or 3 versions at most, I'd say.
