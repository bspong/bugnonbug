Choppy font is displayed.

The mentioned above uses the font for one of the Indian languages "Telugu". In
order to view the site clearly one has to download the font and install. I have
downloaded the font and installed it in Fedora Core 3. When i view the page the
font is choppy in the sense that there are some embedded unreadable characters
displayed. However, if i copy and paste the text from the browser onto
staroffice (or openoffice) the font is displayed clearly without any issues. 

To give you little more history, i have been using Mozilla for last four years
and firefox from its phoenix days and i love both of them. The problem that i
have just mentioned is persistent from the beginning on Linux platform. The page
is displayed properly in Windows based Firefox and Mozilla.

I am not sure if the font is specific to the OS but again the same page is
displayed properly in staroffice on Linux. The site that i have mentioned is
just an example and there are some other sites which use "Telugu" font that show
the similar behaviour. However, i have to mention about two sites whose fonts
works just fine and those are http://www.vaartha.com and http://www.eenadu.net.
Font will be very clear when i do "View->Character Coding-->Western". The same
trick did not work for the web site i have mentioned in the URL box above.

Thanks
