This is a second bug in the grammer of Devnagari script. In Devnagari, the
Vowels are added as an symbol above, below, before or after the Consonent.

Firefox has a problem when the a symbol is applied before the consonent. Let's
say 'K' is the consonent and 'i' is the vowel. So together they are written as
'iK', but according to unicode convention 'i' is typed in after 'K' i.e.
'K'+'i'='iK'

IE6 displays this vowel correctly while Firefox displays the vowel after the
consonent i.e. 'K'+'i'='Ki' 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open following page in Firefox and IE6
http://www.bbc.co.uk/hindi/science/story/2005/08/050812_nasa_mars_exped.shtml
2. Look at the fifth word in the Title of the article. It's a four letter word.
3. Look at the seventh (last) word in the title of the article. It's a four
letter word.

Actual Results:  
The vowel is displayed at the wrong place in Firefox

Expected Results:  
The vowel is displayed at correct place in IE6, the way it should be, according
to the grammer.
