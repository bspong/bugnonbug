This seems similar to 375887 except that lists specifically Windows. A few more clarifications for the Mac: 

* The Edit menu has Cut/Copy grayed out.
* CMD-X/C (aka CTRL-X/C) results in an error beep.
* Right click on the selected text brings up a context menu with Cut/Copy allowed, as well just right clicking into the context menu and keyboard shortcuts and edit menu all allow Cut/Copy again.
* This lasts until I click outside of the WYSIWYG editor.
* When I click back into the editor once again Cut/Copy are grey out.
* If I right click again then everything is working again.

This is very repeatable since I upgraded to the 3.0 Preview Release and now that I'm running on a nightly trunk as well, no change in what is going wrong.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click in a WYSIWYG text box editor such as: http:/www.vbulletin.org/forum/ ... a similar (though not exact) problem can be seen at: http://flashtexteditor.com/ where you can click "Try Demo"
2. Depending on the WYSIWYG editor try CMD/CTRL-V/C/X and also observe the Menu->Edit bar.
3. Try right clicking on a selection and observe that Cut/Copy/Paste all work as expected.
4. In some cases Menu Bar and Keyboard Shortcuts will start working again.
5. If they do start working try clicking outside of WYSIWYG text entry box and repeat again.
Actual Results:  
Menu->Edit and Keyboard Shortcuts for Cut/Copy/Paste have variable results in working. Right clicking to context menu seems to always work though.

Expected Results:  
Cut/Copy/Paste should work in all input boxes whether they are an applet or not.

This is with a completely blank new profile, reproduced on version listed as well as the 3.0 Preview Release.
