Firefox ignores a change in Theme. Also, the OK in the "Tools->Options" doesn't seem to work even though the data seems to be saved (the dialog doesn't close).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Select a Theme
2.Choose "Use Theme" button goes grey and text changes to "Restart Firefox" to use
3.Restart Firefox
Actual Results:  
Previous Theme is still active

Expected Results:  
Selected Theme should be active

Same behavior for all themes.

This problem seemed to start with the last update 2.0.0.2. I don't believe that I installed any other software at the time and I haven't changed my security settings (although the company has login scripts). I had one theme selected, I think it was iFox but was unable to change it after the update. I deleted the theme and it reverted to the default theme. I again tried to change the theme to "Blue Ice", "Metal Lion - Vista", and "Noia 2.0 (eXtreme)" but wasn't able to. I also tried to change some other settings that seemed to be ignored. I uninstalled and reinstalled. No change. I made sure all files in the "application data/Mozilla" and in the program files directory were read/write. not change. I disabled all add-ons. No change. I started in safe mode. No change. I also noticed that the OK button in "Tools->Options" doesn't work. I click on it, the program "pauses", and then returns but the dialog is still there. The "File->Exit" doesn't work the first time I select it but I think that's an add-on problem because it works fine in safe mode. The "Session Manager" dialog has the same behavior as "Tools-Options". The options boxes in "ChatZilla" and "Update Notifier" work fine.
