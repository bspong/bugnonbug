Printing page always prints the screen layout, no matter what option button is selected.

When printing a page with 3 frames, Firefox prints the screen layout even when 
"The selected frame" option is selected from the print dialog.  The web site is 
unfortunately an intranet page, so I cannot share it, but the layout is like 
this:

|---------------------|-----------------------|
|                     |                       |
| Frame 1             | Frame 2               |
|                     |                       |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
|                                             |
| Frame 3                                     |
|                                             |
|                                             |

The problem occurs when trying to print "Frame 3" no matter how the page is 
submitted to the printer.  

Frame 3 is the results from a report query, and is usually anywhere from 3-20 
pages long.  Firefox always only prints 1 page, and includes Frames 1 and 2.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select File | Print
2. Choose "The selected frame" option
3. Click "Ok"

also

1. Choose File | Print Preview
Actual Results:  
Printer prints only 1 page.

for the second method

Print Preview only displays one page.

Expected Results:  
Multiple pages should be shown.

None, a bare install of Firefox PR1 was used.  Exact same situation occured with 
Firefox 0.9.3.
