Last Opened Tabs not showing when restarting or opening Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.12) Gecko/2009070611 Firefox/3.0.12 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.12) Gecko/2009070611 Firefox/3.0.12 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I have my Firefox set to save all tabs and to "show my windows and tabs from last time".  When I restart Firefox, all the tabs are missing and it reopens with a new tab (not one of the previously opened sites) to my default home page.  This only started happening after the newest version/update was installed (3.0.12).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Went in to history, re-opened all tabs that were last opened
2.  Closed down firefox via task manager
3.  Reopened firefox - last opened tabs not there

This has ONLY been doing this since the new update to Firefox (3.0.12)
Actual Results:  
The last opened tabs are not appearing when either opening or restarting Firefox, even though (in my settings) it is set to "show my windows and tabs from last time".  

Expected Results:  
To have this issue resolved and have the "last opened" tabs and windows open when Firefox starts and/or reopens - as it did in previous versions.

It should have opened ALL the previously opened tabs and windows that were on Firefox when I was last on it.
