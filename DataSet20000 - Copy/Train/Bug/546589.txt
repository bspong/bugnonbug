The only thing new on my system is the the 3.6 update. I have tried reloading it in case something was corupted in the first update. The situation continues. My system is running on a slower DSL link so this is very obvious. If you submit a search or request a refresh, the entire firefox application freezes. Other tabs freeze, other firefox windows freeze. This did not happen prior to the the 3.6 update.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
On a SLOW internet link

1. request a refresh or perform a search.
2. try switching to a different tab or window.


Actual Results:  
the system becomes (not responding) in title bar and application freezes

Expected Results:  
one tab or window paused for refresh, but other tabs and windows should be available for viewing

Windows vista running ok and firefox 3.5x running ok. updated to 3.6 then one tab or window pauses while refreshing, but the other tabs and sessions freeze
