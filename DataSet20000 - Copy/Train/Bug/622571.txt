Firefox button menu no longer works when CTRL-clicking a bookmark from the FF button
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:2.0b9pre) Gecko/20110103 Firefox/4.0b9pre

CTRL-clicking a bookmark from the Firefox button menu breaks the Firefox button itself. After the bookmark is loaded, the Firefox menu no longer opens no matter how much you click on it. The only way to fix this in the same session is hitting ALT to bring up the classic menus and opening a menu from there. The Firefox button functionality returns.

(NOTE: I discovered this bug while filing the report for Bug 622570: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622570)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on Firefox button on top left
2. Hover over bookmarks
3. CTRL-click a website to open it in a new tab

Actual Results:  
Firefox menu closes and the clicked website opens and loads in a new tab. However, the Firefox button becomes broken and no longer opens.

Expected Results:  
Clicking the Firefox button should cause the menu to open.

Only way to get back the menu (in the same session; ie. not restarting the browser) is to hit ALT to open classic menus and the opening a menu from there. The Firefox button functionality returns.

I rated this bug as a major bug because it is a UI break in a flagship feature of Firefox 4.0.
