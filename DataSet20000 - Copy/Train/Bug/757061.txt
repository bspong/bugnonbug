Steps to reproduce:

in reference to bug report: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=756828
menus are faster, but.. 

middle click images (med in size) to 'open in new tab' 3, 4 or 5 images from airliners.net


Actual results:

mozill (firefox Aurora) will hang (processor is zombie or 1 to 6 % only) and upon clicking other tabs to try and get aurora to do something, Crashes kwin plasma (openSuSE 11.2, KDE 4.3.5).
Again, processor is extremely, uncommonly low and this time memory was upto the 'old normal' of 500+ k where 'normal' has been in the last few nightly updates, somewhere around 269k .. 
Something is being done, elsewhere in firefox bin that is causing the low processor and memory numbers, but is causing aurora to be Slower than normal too.


Expected results:

should load 20 images in 'new tab' simultaneously (parallel) or consecutively (serial order), but it should not Hang, Stop and Crash.

Not bitching, just want it at least as stable as was a week ago.. 

Thanks for Everything guys / gals.
