Firefox Browser crashes (Shuts Down) without notice -- on restart, it USUALLY correctly reopens all windows

Usually, when it happens, I have multiple Firefox windows (not tabs) open and am working with one of the many websites at Ancestry.com (such as:  http://content.ancestry.com/iexec/?htx=View&r=an&dbid=7667&iid=ILM653_187-0260&fn=Eliza&ln=Collins&st=d&ssrc=&pid=37459719)
When I restart Firefox, it generally restarts (correctly) all the windows that were open.
Can't pinpoint what specifically caused the crash - but generally I am browsing through an image provided by Ancestry.com

Can't make it happen on purpose.


I can provide a "rtf" file with images of the error messages and a copy of the file that was produced when the crash occurred.

The first error message states:  "Firefox.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close.  We are sorry for the inconvenience.....If you were in the middle of something, the information you were working on might be lost.......For more information about this error, click here........Close button"

When I click on the "more information" link, another error box appears which states:  Error signature......AppName:  firefox.exe..........AppVer.  1.8.2007051502.......ModName:  ntdll.dll...........ModVer: 5.1.2600.2180..............Offset:  000111de.............To view technical information about this error report, click here............Close button"

The file where the technical info is stored is called ...........73ef_appcompat.txt.   

I can send the contents of that file if you request.
