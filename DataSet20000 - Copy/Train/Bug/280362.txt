Program will not load after install
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)
Build Identifier: Newest ver Firefox

Both Newest ver Firefox and Thunderbird Mail will not load after installation. 
Initial install shows working program, second time loading and thereafter will 
respond with an hourglass on arrow icon (desktop) after a few seconds, then 
nothing. Microsoft Outlook works most of the time, often Internet Explorer will 
not load either. After much prompting IE will run. Attempts to reinstall will 
have odd results. Reinstall program claims Firefox is running, but task manager 
will indicate no program running. Reinstall will fail to stop Firefox and 
freeze screen, sometimes. ReBooting will sometimes clear Firefox and it will 
reinstall with working program, second attempt to load Firefox or Thunderbird 
will fail to load after a few seconds showing hourglass on desktop icon.
Using IBM clone P3 1GHz with W2K Professional, lots of ROM/RAM memory and about 
60 Gigs of space on 2 HDrives. Using new Hayes external 56K modem. When IE runs 
it runs without problems. IE seems to fail to load only after Firefox is on the 
system. Anxious to use both programs, not a fan of Bill Gates. Help.

Reproducible: Always
