Updating KB 915597 (to definition 1.51.124.0) makes FF stuck little and little

OS is Vista Ultimate x64. When I updated Windows Defender KB 915597 to definition 1.51.124.0 the FF immideately went ballistic. It gets stuck for 5-10 seconds every time I want to do anything; write an URL, scroll the page, click on a link - anything. All the bookmarks disapeared and the Foxmark Syncronizer fails to fetch them. I was using Firefox 3.0.5 at the time, so I quickly reinstalled 3.0.6 and when that didn't work I even tried 3.1 beta 2 - all without success.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Vista x64 and upgrade defender
2.Install any Firefox version
3.Open Firefox
Actual Results:  
I didn't actually reproduce installation of Vista since that's a rather heavy project, but I uninstalled Firefox and reinstalled it with the same result.

Expected Results:  
I suspected there could have been files gone corrupt during the update, hence the reinstallation. I really expected it to work properly.

I used firefox right before the upgrade and tried to do that right after so I'm pretty sure it's the Windows Defender update that in some way makes Firefox incompatible.
