Today I got my computer back from the shop after they reinstalled the boot sector of my C: drive to cure boot hang-up (I'm not a computer wonk, I just know enough words to be dangerous!).  When I opened Firefox it generated this error message:  Component returned failure code: 0x8000ffff (NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED) [nsIPrefBranch.getCharPref]

I closed Firefox and tried it again and I got the same message.  My roomie has v 3.6 on her 'pooter and it starts with no errors every time.

I deinstalled Firefox using the utility that Windows 7 provides, then I downloaded it from the www.mozilla.org website and I still get the same failure message.  My roomie's system works just fine.

I have no idea what this failure affects.  I hope that it's not security-related.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Failure message appears
3.Click OK in failure message box and continue to tentatively use Firefox, not knowing if this is a security-related issue
Actual Results:  
Exactly as described above every time

Expected Results:  
That after deinstall/reinstall the failure message would go away

I have no idea how serious this bug is except to say that if I don't click OK on the message box, Firefox would stop working.  ***I do not know if this is a security issue.  A perception of greater security is why I use Firefox.

Severity?  I don't know.  

Thanks for hearing me out.
