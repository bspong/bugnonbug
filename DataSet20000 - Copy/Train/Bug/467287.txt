I want to use Minefield to test out, but not as my primary browser.  But every time I run Minefield, it makes itself the default system browser.  (You can see this in Safari preferences.)  If I change the preference back to Firefox, it gets changed back every time Minefield closes (and possibly when it opens.)  On some machines, I've been unable to even change the preference from Minefield - closing the preferences window and reopening it shows that it has been reset to Minefield.  The only way to prevent this problem appears to be to remove Minefield from my system completely.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Check browser prefs in Safari.  Ensure Firefox is selected.
2.  Install and run Minefield
3.  Check browser prefs in Safari.  Minefield is now the default browser.  Change it to Firefox, and close the preferences window.
4)  Close Minefield.
5)  Repeat step 3.  Minefield is now the default browser.  

Actual Results:  
Minefield becomes the default browser in almost all circumstances.

Expected Results:  
Minefield should only be the default browser if you set it to be.
