The page http://guitartabrequest.com/tab/pinkfloyd/thewallpartii/ has a div I
created with a scroll bar. There is a significant lag (espcially when compared
to IE) on the scrolling div. You notice this when you scroll, and you also
notice this when you change pages. When you are on a different browser window
and switch to the one with my url the div lags and takes a second or so to
actually display the data (instead of the previous page glued onto the div space
due to lag). I went to the forums first to address this issue. They said to
enable smooth scrolling (which should be enabled by default, please).. did this
and there was still a problem. ALSO, you can't use the arrow keys to scroll up
or down on this div. I feel the problem is over lack of support for this
feature. I'm not ranting, I love firefox, just wish you guys would address this
issue and continue to improve. Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the provided URL.
2. Scroll where the main data/TAB is located.
3. Repeat above steps in IE to see the difference.

Actual Results:  
IE performed better, and firefox seemed as though they just threw this feature
together without concern of what it would be like. IE rarely performs better,
but in this case, they did.

Expected Results:  
FF to display it perfectly like it does everything else.
