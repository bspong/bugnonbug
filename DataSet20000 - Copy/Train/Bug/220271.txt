So far as I can tell, this is related to bug 189044 and bug 84242, but isn't
quite either.

I'm ftping to bar (local machine @ work, behind a firewall that I don't control,
sorry) as foo, and it puts me into /home/users/foo.  I want to be in /baz.  My
first thought was to enter ftp://foo@bar/../../../baz which worked fine, but
when I clicked file qux in baz, it told me that there was no such file as
/home/users/foo/baz/qux.  I can type ftp://foo@bar/../../../baz/qux and get the
file, but every link just ignores the initial ..s.

I have a workaround in typing ftp://foo@bar//www but that wouldn't work if I
couldn't read the root dir...

I wouldn't have been all that surprised if ftp://foo@bar/../ simply didn't work,
but when it did I was very surprised that it wouldn't give me the files listed
in the directory.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. ftp to a machine as a user with a non root home dir
2. enter ftp://foo@bar/../
3. click on any file listed

Actual Results:  
I was told that the file /home/users/foo/file didn't exist

Expected Results:  
given me /home/users/foo/../file (equiv to /home/users/file)
