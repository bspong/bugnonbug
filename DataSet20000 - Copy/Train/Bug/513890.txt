Since the last two days after updating the nightly build I have not been able to use the Bookmarks toolbar. The bookmarks are reloaded properly when I click on the Reload Live Bookmark tab. When I click on a link it does not open in the browser window. I have tried for various types of bookmark entries, it is not working. Open all in Tabs option is working though and it opens all the links in a folder in multiple browser tabs as expected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Browser
2.Click on Bookmark toolbar and select a bookmark to open
3.
Actual Results:  
Bookmarks do not open in browser window

Expected Results:  
Clicked bookmark should open in the present browser window

I have the nightly tester tools installed and have a couple of addons for old firefox versions running namely noscript, adblock. No Bookmarks related addons have been installed.
