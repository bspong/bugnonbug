Installation stops: US Region Pack: -208 INVALID_ARGUMENTS

I downloaded the latest nightly build -- removed the old installation (without
deleting the installation directory, though) -- and started installing the new
build. The installation proceeded through Licence Agreement, but then stopped
with an error:

Error during installation - US Region Pack: -208 INVALID_ARGUMENTS

I then installed without any problems the previous nightly build I had been
using till so far. I had it's installation package in store.

I downloaded the file FirefoxSetup.exe from
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/
which is what I always use.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Remove the earlier nightly build but not the installation directory (in order
to make sure your bookmarks are safe.)
2. Try to install the latest nightly build (1.12.2004) from FirefoxSetup.exe

Actual Results:  
I got the error message described in details. I clicked on cancel and needed to
close the installation progress window (with the green bar a few centimeters to
go, but stopped) by clicking the red X.

Expected Results:  
Finish the installation.
