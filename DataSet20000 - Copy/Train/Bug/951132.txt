Remove periods in app-manager.dtd tooltips

Remove periods

Originated from a recent change in bug 937607, quite a few tooltips in app-manager.dtd appear to contain periods where they shouldn’t. This should fix it.

Please don’t ask me where to find a Mozilla specific guideline about this (maybe someone else knows?), as far as I know it’s just a common one every developer should know about. This is probably why you won’t find (m)any other tooltips ending with periods in the Mozilla tree, as with menu items and selectable options.

Tooltips are generally written in infinitive mood, as they almost always describe the action (as a verb, not a sentence) and hence answer the question "What does this button (enable you to) do?." Exceptions are when they can be considered so-called infotips, where they tend to be one or more full sentences elaborating on something. Most often, this is where two or more lines exist - this file contains a few - and even then it’s risky to use periods. After all, using a period may cause a descriptive action text to be considered as a command ordering the user to do something, which can even be more confusing for English than for other locales that may distinguish infinitive and imperative mood in their grammar. Maybe it’s an idea to have a look at bug 561534 for further understanding.

The patch has been created against Aurora but should also do for central.
