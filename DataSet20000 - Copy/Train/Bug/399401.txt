All browsing maintains a choppy appearance and takes longer than normal.  I have un-installed and reinstalled Firefox many times but the flickering remains.  If I try to watch a video it flickers throughout, while trying to type the onscreen text is behind the keyboard strokes and does not appear on-screen smoothly, but flickering and momentarily freezing (making typing e-mails very difficult) and the cursor that is used when typing is constantly flashing much faster than is normal, as if it is experiencing numerous and rapid little glitches or freezes. The problem is that the choppyness affects all aspects of my browsing and especially my ability to write e-mails.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just need to turn on Firefox and begin browsing in some way
2.Is felt worst when I try to type and e-mail or watch a video
3.
Actual Results:  
It is a problem that happens everywhere, each site.  I simply need open Firefox and it is slow (I am connected to a T3 University network) - then if I try to type a message or online text field it is very choppy and hard to type - the words come but very late and not smooth at all.  If I try to watch an embedded video the video is also choppy, flashing with a black screen very breifly every couple of milliseconds  


The Software should operate smoothly as it has done for me in the past.


Additional Information
I am using the default theme.  I use Windows Vista on a brand new Dell Ispiron 531S desktop.  The choppyness does not occur if I use Windows Explorer.
