from discussion surrounding bug 266547:

A popup window (opened via window.open function) with no statusbar is perceived as a security risk. This risk is only manifest when the user is presented with a submittable form on an insecure (non-encrypted) page. In this case, the user has no way to know that the form submission will be insecure, because with no statusbar, there is no indication of security status.

Therefore, I submit that the *most effective* and *most agreeable* way to deal with this potential security issue is:

To warn the user *regardless of user's warning dialog settings* via a dialog/request box, that their attempted form submission is insecure and suspect, and give them the opportunity to cancel the submission.

This security enhancement will *force* the user to recognize that they are in an insecure state, and directly give them information they would have passively received via the statusbar.

This solution also has the benefit of not breaking standard and widely-used browser features as in bug 266547.
