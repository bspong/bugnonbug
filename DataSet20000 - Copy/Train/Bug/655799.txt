I'm using a MacBook Pro w/ native resolution 1680x1050.  I have an external monitor attached whose resolution is 1280x1024.  The display settings are set to "mirrored" mode.  I then close the MacBook such that the external display is the only one active.

When I click "Bookmarks" at the top task bar, then mouse down to my first bookmark folder (which contains lots of other folders) its contents are automatically displayed to the right.  However, when I mouse-over one of the contained sub-folders, the contents of *that sub-folder* are not displayed.

This does *NOT* happen when I'm using the OSX laptop in 1680x1050 mode without an external display, nor does it happen when I run FireFox at 1280x1024 under Windows XP.

The work around is to click on the bookmarks tab located at the far right hand side of the screen just to the right of the search engine input area.  When accessed in this way all the folder contents auto-display on mouse-over.
