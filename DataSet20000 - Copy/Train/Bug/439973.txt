My work uses Groupwise Messenger as in-house IM. They are using version 2.0.1 released on 3/29/2006. Had not had problems clicking on hyperlinks in the IMs that are sent, while Firefox is the default browser. After installing Firefox 3 yesterday it now gives an error when you click a hyperlink. 
Error:
 "C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe" -requestPending -osint -url "%1
Windows cannot find 'C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe" -requestPending -osint -url "%1'. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again. To search for a file, click the Start button, and then click Search.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Receive a hyperlink in Groupwise Messenger
2.Click on hyperlink to open

Actual Results:  
Received error listed above in Details section. Click "OK" on the error, and the page does not load, but everything is fine. No programs crash or anything.

Expected Results:  
Should have opened the hyperlink in a new tab in Firefox.

I have tried rebooting the computer, but yielded the same results. I have not re-installed the Groupwise Messenger as I don't have access.
