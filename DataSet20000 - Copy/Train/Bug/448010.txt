You go to the website, gotomypc.com. You sign in and you open a page that will have a "connect" button because it has to open a Java applet or something so it can connect to your computer to sign you in. Press connect, it begins, fails, and goes back to the original sign in page. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to the gotomypc.com website
2.enter email and password to log in
3.Brings you to the connect page, where you press "connect" to access your computer.
4. SHOULD open a java universal viewer where you would then input your access code and it brings you to your remote computer
Actual Results:  
1.go to the gotomypc.com website
2.enter email and password to log in
3.Brings you to the connect page, where you press "connect" to access your computer.
4. After pressing connect it goes to the universal viewer (necessary for mac) fails and you wind up back at the initial login page.

Expected Results:  
It should open the universal viewer and bring you to your computer which it does not.

It worked very nicely in version 2. Ever since version 3 I haven't been able to use it on Firefox. I have to do it via Safari.
