For this Google search, 
entryway site:ci.alamogordo.nm.us filetype:doc
all of the search results are drawn on the right-hand side of the screen, instead of having the regular search results on the left and the sponsored links on the right. This search displays correctly in Firefox 2.0.0.12.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://google.com
2. enter this in the search field and click the Google Search button:
entryway site:ci.alamogordo.nm.us filetype:doc
3. you will see that all of the search results and the bottom links are drawn at the right-hand side of the window (bad, the Sponsored Links should be on the right, the search results on the left, and the bottom links spread across the screen).
4. see attachments for HTML and screen shots. Opening the "bad" html in Minefield or in Firefox 2.0.0.12 displays the problem. Running the same steps in Firefox 2.0.0.12 does not reproduce the problem but operates correctly.
