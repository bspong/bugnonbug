Dialog to allow a new cookie doesn't appear and blocks some functionality
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.1pre) Gecko/20100122 Ubuntu/8.04 (hardy) Namoroka/3.6.1pre

When opening new page that wants to store new cookie -- and having in preferences for cookies "Keep until: ask me every time" -- the dialog window for cookie doesn't show up. Loading the page is of course blocked -- page never loads, and left single click on tabs (on tab bar) to focus them doesn't work (only Ctrl-Tab works to go through tabs). Also when closing Firefox the window is closed but Firefox remains in memory and when I kill it (killall firefox-bin), then for the next start I get Crashed session recovery dialog.

This behaviour first appeared with 3.5.8-pre (Shiretoko), then 3.6-pre (Namoroka) and now 3.6.1-pre.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. set in preferences for cookies "ask me every time"
2. try to open new page that would want to store new cookie

Actual Results:  
Dialog window for cookie doesn't appear, loading of the page is blocked, single left click on any tab to focus it doesn't work, it is not possible to shut down Firefox correctly.

Expected Results:  
Dialog window for cookie would appear, I would choose what to do with the cookie and then the page would load and everything would work just fine.

I install these pre-releases from Ubuntu repositories (since Mozilla still still still doesn't offer official 64-bit release) so I don't know whether the cause of the problem actually lays in Mozilla or in Ubuntu developers.
