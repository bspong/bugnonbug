Page load of weather radar loop requires 100% CPU, much time
Upon clicking "Loop" from National Weather Service (Pittsburgh, PA) to receive a
series of 10 .GIF images of local radar, FF 1.0 pegs the CPU until all 10 images
are downloaded.  CPU then drops to normal and the animation plays as expected.  

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results: CPU pegs at 100% for the roughly 90 seconds required to load 10
images.

Expected Results: CPU pegs at 100% for 10 or fewer seconds, as in Moz 1.7.3 and IE6.

Steps to Reproduce: 
1. Start Windows Task Manager
2. Start Firefox 1.0
3. Go to National Weather Service-Pittsburgh page showing local radar, a single
GIF file: http://www.erh.noaa.gov/radar/latest/DS.p19r0/si.kpbz.shtml
4. Note the time and CPU utilization to load this one image, typically 30
seconds for the first access, 10 seconds for a refresh.
5. In left pane, under "Base Reflectivity", next to "Short Range", click on
"Loop"; URL is http://weather.noaa.gov/radar/loop/DS.p19r0/si.kpbz.shtml
6. Note the time and CPU utilization to load the 10 images, typically 90 to 100
seconds.  

While the elapsed time can be expected to be 100 seconds, the CPU should not be
pegged at 100% for that time.  In both Moz 1.7.3 and IE6, elapsed load times
were comparably 90 to 100 seconds, but 100% CPU lasted only about 10 seconds.

I compared the load times with Mozilla 1.7.3 and I.E. 6.0.  CPU pegs for much
longer, and elapsed time is also much longer.  [Soon-To-Be] Attached are screen
