Firefox Proxy (Port conflict?) problem
User-Agent:       Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 5.1; U; en) Presto/2.5.22 Version/10.51
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.2) Gecko/20100316 Firefox/3.6.2 ID:20100316074819

I am reporting this bug because this behavior is exhibited only by Firefox. In IE, Chrome, Safari, and Opera, I do not have this issue.

We have SQL Server Reporting Services 2008 installed on http://computerName:8080/Reports/Pages/Folder.aspx.
We have a proxy server XYZ which is also on port 8080.
When I start FF for the first time with no proxy configured, SSRS works, but the internet does not.

When I enter the proxy settings into the Network settings dialog box, the internet works, but the SSRS address does not (please read further, setting 'no proxy for' exceptions does not work either).  It gives the following error page:

"The Web site cannot be found
The Web site you are looking for is unavailable due to its identification configuration settings.

Please try the following:

    * Click the Refresh button, or try again later.
    * If you typed the page address in the Address bar, make sure that it is spelled correctly.
    * Click the Back button to try another link.

11001 - Host not found
Internet Security and Acceleration Server

Technical Information (for support personnel)

    * Background:
      This error indicates that the gateway could not find the IP address of the Web site you are trying to access.

    * ISA Server: computername.domain.local
      Via:

      Time: 4/1/2010 9:40:35 AM GMT"

Setting the 'No proxy for' exception for the address does not help either. I have the same problem. Note that this was tested in a new FF profile too, with no addons or other settings done.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set up SSRS and proxy server to same port
2. Open Report Manager
3. 
Actual Results:  
Error message listed above in description

Expected Results:  
Open the SSRS page like it does on any other browser. 

Please note that setting the 'No proxy for' exception for the address does not help.
I would really like this to work since we can then officially recommend FF for SSRS too.
As a side note, SSRS 2008 R2 has actually been built to have standards compliant pages unlike previous versions which makes it even more attractive to alternate browsers.
