Flashing search results and incorrect redirection
User-Agent:       Opera/9.64 (Windows NT 5.1; U; en) Presto/2.1.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

There is a problem with navigation and it may be tied to redirection . . . When I issue a google search from the netbeans.org site, the page result never loads. More correctly, it reloads infinitely. I can never see the result long enough to read it, let alone follow a link.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to downloads.netbeans.org
2. Enter the term nightly build
3. See the page result infinitely reload.
Actual Results:  
The page infinitely reloads or redirects.

Expected Results:  
The page should load and then stop.

I had to file this bug from Opera because when I initially entered it in firefox, I missed the summary field, and the result said to click back to complete the form. When I clicked back, it never navigated, just sort of hung there trying to go back. Also I notice there seems to be cross talk when I change tabs sometimes, like the tab is reloading or something is going on that shouldn't. I can see the little loading icon spinning when I'm moving from one tab to another. Also, I can no longer use my glassfish admin console in firefox. When I click a menu item from the lefthand side of the page, the main content area keeps redirecting to the original page.
