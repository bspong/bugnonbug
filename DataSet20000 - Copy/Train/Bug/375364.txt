I just installed this version over my previous version, 1.5 something or other.  Since, session restore of all tabs and windows isn't working even tho I have it set to do just that upon reopening Firefox.  I did find where someone had such a problem but you closed the problem saying something about not fixing it for meta-tags or some such, but this was working fine before I "upgraded" to latest version.  Only time it worked was when Firefox crashed on me.  It never works when I close all open Firefox windows.  It only opens the window I was working in last.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open more than one Firefox window with multiple tabs
2.  Close group on all open Firefox windows
3.  Reopen Firefox and watch it only open the last window you were in, losing the other window(s) and tabs.  (I have resorted to using notepad to copy all URLS to from all tabs every time I need to reboot my PC so I don't lose track of where I was/what I was doing before I needed to reboot.)
Actual Results:  
Firefox only opens the last window/tabs you had active.

Expected Results:  
Should open all Firefox windows and tabs like version 1.5 ... did.
