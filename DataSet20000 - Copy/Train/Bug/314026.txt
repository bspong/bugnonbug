Firefox, but leave the Bookmarks Manager open, you cannot launch Firefox 
again, evan if you close the Bookmarks Manager.

1. The Firefox browser and the Bookmarks Manager should have different 
process names. 
2. The Bookmark Manager should be a completely separate process. Moreover, it should be able to terminate itself when the Bookmark Manager is closed. Currently. The Bokmark Manager, firefox.exe process, never terminates itself.
Once you launch it, you can no longer use the Firefox browser, even if you close   the Bookmark Manager.
