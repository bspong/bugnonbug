Selecting all text in a user-modify read-only textbox highlights textarea in previous tab.

In first tab I have a large textarea.  For example, a wikipedia page in edit mode.  http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Acid2&action=edit is a good example.  I select the textarea so my cursor is somewhere in the textarea.

In the second tab I open a page that has user-modify CSS property set to read-only.  I move my mouse over the textbox, right click and select "select all" from the menu.

The textbox in the second tab is not selected, but if you switch back to the first window, the textarea is selected instead.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  In first/single tab of browser, open a large textarea as though you would be editing it.  Ensure that the cursor is placed in the textarea.  Perhaps try http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Acid2&action=edit as that is certain to work (where I discovered this).
2.  Open a second tab that includes a textbox with user-modify property set to read-only.
3.  Mouse over the textbox and click the right mouse button.
4.  From the menu, Select All.
5.  Observe textbox text as unselected.
6.  Switch to previous (first/original) tab and observe that the textarea contents were selected.

Actual Results:  
Previous tab's textarea content was selected instead of the textbox intended (or tested against, in the event user-modify property works).

Expected Results:  
Textbox contents should not be selected, nor should the contents of the textarea on previous tab.
