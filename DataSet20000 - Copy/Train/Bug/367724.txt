I recently upgraded to the newest version of Mozilla Firefox and when I attempt to go to Ebay, I cannot get the page to load correctly with pictures and headings. 
When I go to listings, I get no pictures loading and some of the text is illegible. 
I have contacted ebay and they say that they support Firefox. 
I have downloaded various addons and extensions to rectify the problem, such as grease monkey and jsview, but not having any idea what the problem is, I cannot put my finger on what the solution is.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to ebay
2. page does not load correctly, nor do the item listings
3. go to internet explorer 7 to do my ebaying. 
would like to use firefox, but since I cannot see the pictures, it is useless to try to go on. 
How could I load a previous version of firefox? 
It seemed to work. 
The newer version does not work with this site. 
Actual Results:  
Always the same. 

Expected Results:  
happens every time. 

Loaded the page in its entirety.
