firefox reports errors on starting
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041111 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041111 Firefox/1.0

On certain Linux platforms, e.g. FC3, firefox reports these errors when started
from the console:

$ firefox
grep: error while loading shared libraries: libc.so.6: cannot open shared object
file: No such fileor directory
sed: error while loading shared libraries: libc.so.6: cannot open shared object
file: No such file or directory
cut: error while loading shared libraries: libc.so.6: cannot open shared object
file: No such file or directory


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. See above
Actual Results:  
grep: error while loading shared libraries: libc.so.6: cannot open shared object
file: No such fileor directory
sed: error while loading shared libraries: libc.so.6: cannot open shared object
file: No such file or directory
cut: error while loading shared libraries: libc.so.6: cannot open shared object
file: No such file or directory


Expected Results:  
firefox starts without errors.

The problem is that LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5 breaks grep, sed, and cut on these
platforms.  You may not need this at all -- I don't think the 2.2 kernel has
been in use for about 4 years.  If you do, the following seems to fix things, at
least on my machine:

$ diff -c /usr/bin/firefox.bk /usr/bin/firefox
