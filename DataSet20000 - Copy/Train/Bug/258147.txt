When launching Firefox or Thunderbird on Windows XP Professional(fresh install
of everything,Firefox and Thunderbird binaries were downloaded today around 12
ADT(GMT -3)) there appears to be a Netscape related 'user satisfaction survey'
popping up,which I attempted to cancel.This causes Windows XP to error and close
both programs....but not until you deal with the Windows XP error report.The 3rd
time it happened,I simply completed the survey while obstructed by the Windows
XP error....and it seems to have resolved the issue.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch Mozilla or Thunderbird
2.Wait aproximately a minute for the popup
3.Attempt to cancel it


Actual Results:  
Windows XP errored out "An Error Has Occured In This Program" "Program Must Be
Closed" "Send | Don't Send"

Expected Results:  
It shouldeve let me cancel it and return to the Mozilla or Thunderbird screens
respectively.
