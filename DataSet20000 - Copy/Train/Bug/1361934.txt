Problem With Random Facebook Post Comments and Reaction Emojis Not Opening In FF 53.0
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:53.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/53.0
Build ID: 20170413192749

Steps to reproduce:

There seems to be an intermittent problem with the "reaction" feature on random posts in ones feed not opening up to show the reactions to make a choice like love, laugh, cry, wow, or mad other than than the standard thumbs up. All it will let you do is use the thumbs up feature and nothing else and the comment section keeps spinning for about 30 to 45 seconds before it opens to let you make a comment which is much longer than normal. Once the comment section opens you can then change your reactions on posts.

Scanned computer for any malware or viruses with neg results
Closed Firefox and all cookies, cache etc etc cleared
Rebooted computer.
Refreshed.


Actual results:

Tried Facebook again with Firefox and even in Private Browsing and problem still happened in Facebook with random posts.

Opened IE 11 and Facebook worked fine on all posts even in Private Browsing.


Expected results:

If problem was with Facebook then it should have showed up in IE 11 but it did not reproduce. The problem still persisted with Firefox 53.0. This leads me to believe the problem lies with Firefox and this did not crop up until after Firefox was updated to 53.0. I am not having to use IE 11 for Facebook.
