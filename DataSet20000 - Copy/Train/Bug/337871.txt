While editing templates for a forum package I maintain, it became apparent that the page is jumping around when clicking into different textboxes on the form that is generated for this purpose. I have captured the page source for the form data and have determined that it is not the result of CSS styling for the page. I will attach a chunk of code which illustrates the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load test code.
2. Click into text boxes in random spots.
3. Observe how the screen jumps around.

Actual Results:  
The screen jumps around, often scrolling the spot where the cursor ended up to the edge of the screen.

Expected Results:  
The screen should not shift positions while clicking into various spots in the textboxes.

So far this has only been noticed using the Quicksilver Forums package, but may impact other packages which use muiltple text boxed for inputting data in this manner. Test case html does not require administrative login to access.
