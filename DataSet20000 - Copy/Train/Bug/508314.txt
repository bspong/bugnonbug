Firefox will not start when print spooler is hung

If a computer has a problem in the print spooler service where it cannot even enumerate the available printers then Firefox will start but hang (the main window will not appear). 

When the print spooler is restarted, Firefox will finish loading and the main window will appear.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a way to hang the print spooler service so it will not enumerate the printers
2. Try to start Firefox
3.
Actual Results:  
Firefox is listed as a process but the main window does not appear.

Expected Results:  
Could Firefox initialize the printing asynchronously in a separate thread? This would allow the application to finish loading when the print spooler is hung or even just load faster in general. The print functionality could be disabled in this case and the browser could still be usable.

This is a problem with many applications. In this condition Word will not start but Excel and IE will. Outlook will work until you try to preview an email with attachments. In short, any program that tries to enumerate the printers will hang.

In this case an HP printer driver two-way communication service is interacting badly with the Vista print spooler service, causing it to hang, and then affecting a number of applications. Search google for "HPZ12" for info.
