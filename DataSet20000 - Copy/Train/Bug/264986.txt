As of this morning all of the toolbars at the top of my FireFox web browser are
in very basic text, scambled, and pull-down menus are blacked out. This morning
when I tried logging onto my computer at work, XP lost my User Profile. I
believe it was because Windows downloaded an update on Friday, but I didn't give
it permission to install before leaving. It was an update for MicroSoft .NET
software. So, this morning it appeared that the install accured as I was trying
to login. This created problems for much of my system, and I have had to rebuild
most of my preferences. The one thing I can't seem to fix is FireFox. I tried to
completely delete it and reinstall it several times, but the toolbars are still
scrambled and unreadable. Any ideas?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Toolbars automatically come up scrambled with blacked-out pull-down menus.
3. 

Actual Results:  
Can't do anything with the menues, because I can't tell one menu option from
another or the pull-down menu is simply blacked out.

Expected Results:  
Main menu options and pull-down menu options at top of browser should have come
up clean and readable and responsive to mouse interface.
