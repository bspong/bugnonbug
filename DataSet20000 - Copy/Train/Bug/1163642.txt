Save Page As does not work properly for page reached via POST request after cache is cleared
Spun out from bug 1128050.

This will likely be fixed when bug 1101100 is fixed, but I'm filing this just so that we don't lose track.

STR:

1) In an e10s-enabled browser, visit http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/forms/file.html
2) In the section about 1/8th down the page that takes a text input and file input, put in some string and select some non-private text file from your machine to POST.
3) Click Send
4) You should reach a page that echos back the string and the beginning of the text file you sent. View the source of the page and keep the source window open.
5)Now, clear the cache (History > Clear Recent History) - for the last 2 hours, or whatever small time range you can select that encompasses your time on the site from (1).
6) Go to File > Save As to save the page, and save the file somewhere on your machine.
7) Open the saved file.

ER:

The saved file should contain almost the exact same information as in the View Source window.

AR:

The file will contain something like:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
<html lang="en-US">
<head>
<title>Echoing submitted form data</title>
</head>

<p><em>No data was submitted</em></p><p>Processed 2015-05-05T01:56Z

</body>
</html>
