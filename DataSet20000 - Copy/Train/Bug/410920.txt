unresponsive button (ie submit, search) after clicking and going back unless I refresh

When I use a search function or use a submit button within the website, it takes me to the results. When I go back after doing so, and search for new results or submit new information, the button will not respond until I refresh the page. This has happened on several different websites.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. For example, I go to http://www.ssynth.co.uk/~gay/anagram.html
2. I put in a scrambled word for it to solve (for example = ldyahoi), and click "go do it" (submit)
3. It takes me to the next page with results (holiday, etc).
4. I click "back" and put in a different scrambled word for it to solve (for example = nedihclr), and click "go do it" (submit) again.
5. It does not respond or go to the results.
6. I click the "reload" button in the toolbar, and click submit again.
7. It finally goes to the results (children)
Actual Results:  
I had to refresh to get the button to respond.

Expected Results:  
I should not have to refresh to get the button to respond, simply going "back" from the page of results should be sufficient.

It does not have the problem when I use the IE tab. It has had this problem with just about every website with search functions.
