dde not working on some systems and causes unable to open error message
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3

every time Firefox 2.x gets installed or updated it creates the following registry key:
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\HTTP\shell\open\ddeexec
(same for HTTPS and FTP)
I don't really know what is the advantage of DDE here but it cases strange behaviour and error messages here!
I use PC-Pine as email software and click on links there (Firefox is my default browser). I always get delays and error messages when launching an URL (especially if firefox is not loaded yet).
For now I just kill these registry keys after every Firefox bugfix update and everything is working fine thereafter! 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
WinXP SP2, PC-Pine mailer (4.64), Firefox 2.0.0.3, PC-Pine set as default mail application (both for current user and machine)

Click on a link in an email.

Firefox is setup so that those external "launched" links will open in a new tab (I use one firefox windows with multiple tabs, always.)
Actual Results:  
MessageBox which says the browser could not be launched etc. But actually it seems to work (but slower).

Expected Results:  
No messagebox.

kill ddeexec keys and all is fine (for me).
