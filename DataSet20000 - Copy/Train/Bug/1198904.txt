Create two custom Try builds for User Diary Study
We are conducting a user research diary study from 9/2 to 9/4, with followup interviews afterward. The primary objectives are to 1. Compare the "A" list to the "B" list, and 2. see whether users find the new PBM (with TP) to be an improvement on the old.

We will need 2 custom Try builds to provide to study participants.
1.  One build will have the existing blocklist, the "A" list (the standard Disconnect list, which does not include Content category)
2.  One build will have the "B" list (the full Disconnect list including Content category)

For each of the two builds above, we also need: 
* The entity whitelist working on both. 
* To manually turn on the UI tour in both builds. This is accomplished by (comment 2) in bug 1190447. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1190447#c2
* Each test build must create a new user profile. The participants will be existing Fx users. We need to make sure they don't have interfering add-ons (i.e. adblockers) running, and we also don't want to interfere with their existing profiles.
* We need to test all of the above for both builds (A/B): each has the correct blocklist, working entity whitelisting, the UI tour activated, and that it creates a clean profile.
