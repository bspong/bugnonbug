When clicking 'send' in Windows Live Mail Beta Firefox occassionally crashes

After entering an email in Windows Live Mail Beta firefox will, on occasion, crash the second you click 'send'. It happened with the first version of 2.0, however after the first update it was fine and didn't happen. I downloaded the newest update today and since then i've had the problem twice.

I don't know what the catalyst for the crash is, but when it happens the window freezes, you can't access any other tabs and the "serious error" sign comes up with the firefox logo asking me to send error report etc.

The problem is that it doesn't happen everytime (that would be easier to find i'm sure) it's just that it happens on occassion. Originally i thought it may have been my PC but it will do it on other machines.

When it happens you will lose all the data on the page, everything in the email, and you cannot copy paste the text left hanging on the screen as you are locked out, looking at a frozen window.

I have searched the bug a couple of times, but if it has been listed i'm very sorry, i can't seem to find it!

Cheers mate!

Love your work!

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into a Windows Mail Beta email account
2. Create a new email
3. Click "Send"
Actual Results:  
Firefox crashed and needed to be restarted.

Expected Results:  
The email should send and you should be taken to a page which details who you sent it to etc.

I'm not using any themes etc, no add-ons that i can remember... all pretty stock standard.
