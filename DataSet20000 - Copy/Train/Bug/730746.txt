Intermittent leak of 1 AsyncFetchAndSetIconFromNetwork and a lot more, including 2 domwindows opened by test_bug589543.html
This feels awfully familiar, though I might be remembering the network hit and the decision to just wait until shutting off network access makes the feed preview page's requests for the favicons for feed readers just quickly and quietly fail. The intermittency is certainly extreme, since I landed the test a year and a half ago.

The test loads the feed preview page, which we want to do in a test (bug 589543 was about a time when we totally broke it), and the feed preview page loads favicons async, which we want to do, and the existence of this leak probably means that the test can sometimes finish when the favicon load is in the wrong place to get finished off. If it's possible to know when all the favicon loads are done, I guess it could sit twiddling its thumbs until then, or, we could just wait for the network access block to solve it, and live with a leak once every 18 months.
