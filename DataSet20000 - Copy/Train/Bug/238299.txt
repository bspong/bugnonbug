Undesired text resize while using a trackpad

On laptops with trackpads that are configured to use a portion of the pad for
scrolling (newer HP laptops have a dedicated scroll region, Dell models with
Syntaptic pads can be configured to do so), the text often resizes when using
CTRL+L to change to the location bar.  The problem seems to be how Firefox
interperets the input from the trackpad.  

Specifically, when scrolling to the beginning or end of a long page, then
pressing CTRL+L, Firefox associates the CTRL with the input from the trackpad,
adjusting the text size erroneously.  Microsoft Internet Explorer does not
exhibit this bug.

It seems to me that FF should either A) examine the input from the trackpad and
verify it is processing its input properly or B) respond only to resize commands
when CTRL is pressed before +/-.  In any event, FF should not resize text when
using CTRL+L after scrolling via the trackpad.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Configure trackpad use a portion of the pad for navigation
2.  View a long page, use the navigation region of the trackpad to scroll the
end of the page (in either direction)
3.  Press CTRL+L to enter a new web address

Actual Results:  
The page will scroll up or down, as expected.  After pressing CTRL, the page
will resize (larger if you're scrolling up, smaller if you're scrolling down)
one font size.

Expected Results:  
The page should scroll as expected, then move focus to the location bar.
