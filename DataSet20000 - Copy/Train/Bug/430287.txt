I have two proxy servers, which serve different URLs. To make it simple, the first proxy server only serve www.youtube.com, the second proxy server serves everything else. The proxy server is selected by the FindProxyForURL function defined  in my proxy.pac file. When I access www.youtube.com, the first proxy serves the main page of www.youtube.com, all the links from the main page go to the second proxy server which requires authentication. I was buried in many many proxy authentication windows since the main page of www.youtube.com loaded its contents from many other sites that went thought the second password-protected proxy. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set up two proxy servers, the first proxy server does not require authentication, but the second does.
2. Create a proxy.pac file and define the FindProxyForURL function to return the first proxy if the host is www.youtube.com and return the second proxy otherwise
3. Configure the Firefox to use the proxy.pac in connection settings.
4. Restart Firefox and access www.youtube.com
Actual Results:  
A lot of proxy authentication popup windows.

Expected Results:  
One one proxy authentication popup window.

Only pop up one proxy authentication window as needed at all time.
