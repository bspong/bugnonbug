"Show this frame only" error!

When you are on a double-frame page (ex. left menu, right contents) and you open
a link from the menu, that link targets the right menu, and that's ok. But if
you right-click the contents page and select "This frame" >> "Show only this
frame", and then you make an history back, ALL the links on the menu frame, will
be displayed as target="_blank" links instead that inside the content frame.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open for example the phpmyadmin database manager.
2. Select a link from the left column.
3. Right click on the contents page and then This frame >> Show this frame only.
4. Click back on the Navigation toolbar.
5. Click any of the left frame's links.
Actual Results:  
All links open in a new page (target="_blank" behavoir).

Expected Results:  
The links should keep opening in the right frame.

I'm using Firefox 1.0 official release (not beta or preview), without any plugin
or themes. Just installed and tried. I think that this can be a security bug
under some conditions.
