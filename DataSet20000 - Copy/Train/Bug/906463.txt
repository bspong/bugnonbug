Search bar auto-selects text AFTER I have started typing, so when I hit the next key, it replaces what I typed earlier, and half my search query disappears.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.8; rv:22.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/22.0 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:

I cannot reproduce it reliably. I happens about 10% of the time when I search for a term using the browser search bar.

There should be some text in the search bar from a previous search. I'd want to modify that - say I last searched for "komodo dragon" and now I want to search for "komodo island", so I double click on the word "dragon" to select it and start typing "island" to replace it.


Actual results:

After one or two keystrokes Firefox auto-selects everything in the search box -- in this example, "komodo is" -- so when I hit the next key that text disappears. I finish typing and I see "land" in the search box instead of "komodo island".


Expected results:

If I have already started typing, especially if I have already double clicked to select a specific word in the search bar, I do NOT want to auto-select everything a half-second later! Ideally I would be able to finish typing without interference and I would see the phrase "komodo island" in the search box.

This doesn't happen every time but it happens often enough to be intensely annoying.
