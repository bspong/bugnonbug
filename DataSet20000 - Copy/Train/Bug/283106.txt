No sound in Flash movie (plug-in) when sound is loaded dynamically

If you create a flash movie using Flash MX in which you load in an mp3 sound 
file using the following actionscript code:

TestSound1 = new Sound();
TestSound1.loadSound("sndfile.mp3");  //sndfile.mp3 is any 22khz, 64kbit, mono.
TestSound1.Start();

Put this actionscript in frame1 of the only layer.  Put nothing else in the 
movie.  Save & publish it.  Open the generated HTML page - the sound will not 
play in Firefox - but will play in IE.  

Now, create a new Flash movie in Flash MX.  This time, goto File -> import and 
import the mp3 file into the library.  Drag the new entry in the library onto 
the stage.  Save & publish this movie.  Open the generated HTML page - the 
sound WILL play in both browsers.

This bug is 100% reproducable.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. See DETAILS of bug report above.

Actual Results:  
Movie 1 - Sound plays in IE but not Firefox.
Movie 2 - Sound plays in both browsers.

Expected Results:  
Sound should have played in all situations.

Flash plugin was version 7,0,19,0 for both browsers.

You should be able to reproduce this issue very quickly (in about 5 minutes).

Feel free to contact me for further information, or to discuss things (such as 
a work around).  I'm a software developer with a C/C++/.net(c#)/java/web
(asp/php/scripting langs.. etc,etc) background, and I would be glad to offer 
assistance to anyone working on this issue.

Note: I'm rating this as Major only because many Flash WebSites likely exist in 
which sound has been loaded in dynamically in the way described above - in 
which case, Firefox users will not hear it.
