After installing the 2.0.0.13 update, I noticed a problem in the streaming of flash contents.

It worked without bugs for a few days than began to bug.

When trying to play videos (like on www.youtube.com) or sounds (as on www.deezer.com) in streaming, these play during two or three seconds (in "mute mode") than freeze while the buffer continues to load proprely.

It makes these contents unreadable.

Re-booting neither Firefox neither the computer fixes the problem.

The problem is not systematic but happens really often.
Sometimes, in rebooting firefox, the first video I try to watch works correctly, but than the second bugs again.

The update to 2.0.0.14 doesn't fix the problem.

It seems to be a compatibility issue between the last updates of FF and the last updates of Flash Player, as uninstalling both Firefox and Flash player to get back to older versions fixes the bug.

Please note that I don't have neither a firewall neither an antivirus resident protection that would disallow any content to be played. In addition, notice that this happened first as I had watched videos all the day without any problem and without changing nothing to my config.

Hope you'll find the way to fix that bug : It's pretty annoying and forces me to use IE7.0 to watch videos.
