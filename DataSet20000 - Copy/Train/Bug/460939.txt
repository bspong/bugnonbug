I have registered a uri for mailto-links with registerProtocolHandler. When clicking a mailto-link, the uri it goes to doesn't get correctly registered in window.history.

Since our compose page is displayed in a pop-up I want the users to go back to the page were the link was clicked. When issuing a window.history.back() it doesn't always return to the previous page. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://www.plucera.se/setMailHandler.htm and klick on "Set handler"
2.Open new window and go to random url
3.In that window go to http://www.plucera.se/setMailHandler.htm and klick on "user@host.com", select MailtoHandler as your "software" to launch.
4.Click the "Back"-button
5.Do step 3 and 4 again.
Actual Results:  
You are taken to the "random url" page instead om the setMailHandler.htm page.

Expected Results:  
You should always see the calling page when history.back() is called.
