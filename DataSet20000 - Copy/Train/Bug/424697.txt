This bug is related to horizontal scrolling in the interface. First of all, my trackpad is configured (like many Apple systems) to scroll with two fingers, both vertically and horizontally. That means that it is almost impossible to only scroll up and down. Often there will be little left and right scroll events issued. Please note that there is a similar issue with the Apple MightyMouse that instead of a scroll whell has a scroll ball that scroll both horizontally and vertically.

So, when I try to scroll a list (for example in the bookmark manager, or the media list in the page information dialog (Ctrl-I), there are inevitably little horizontal scrolling events. Where it becomes a problem is when these events makes the list scroll one page up or down (like the page up/down buttons on the keyboard) and mess completely with my scrolling.

What I'm asking for is to provide at least an option to change this behaviour for **all** gecko widgets.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a dialog where there is a list
2. scroll horizontally

Actual Results:  
You scroll vertically

Expected Results:  
to scroll horizontally
