Bookmarks and bookmarks toolbar disappears and cannot be rebuilt after computer restart.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

Firefox.exe was running as process on my computer and it caused explorer.exe to seize as well. Needless to say, it crashed so I did a manual restart on my computer. When I restarted firefox did not open upon double click at all. I opened up Internet Explorer to download and install the Firefox 4.exe/setup directly off Mozilla's page. 

After a clean install, all bookmarks are gone and the bookmarks toolbar cannot be rebuilt. New bookmarks canNOT be added. When I try to drag the link to the Bookmarks toolbar, the little blue arrow that appears when you drag it stays to far right of the bookmarks toolbar and no bookmark is visible. Building your bookmarks through "Bookmarks>Bookmark this Page (CTRL+D)" renders no results either.

Error console when dragging the link to the toolbar yields:
