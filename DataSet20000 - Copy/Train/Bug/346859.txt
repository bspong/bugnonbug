First item in Bookmarks subfolder shows Empty
Description:

Test environment:
   Windows XP, Firefox 2 (Bon Echo) build 20060731, Microsoft Inspect Objects

Steps to recreate:
1. Make sure you have at least one bookmark saved in a subfolder in the bookmarks pulldown.  If you do not have a subfolder in your bookmark pulldown, create one like this: 
   a. Open a Web page in Firefox
   b. Press Ctrl+D to open Add Bookmark dialog.
   c. Click on the "down arrow" button to the right of the "Create in:" field.
   d. Select "New Folder" button at bottom of the window.
   e. Select OK in all resulting dialogs to complete the Add Bookmark feature.  This should create a subfolder in the bookmarks menu.

2. Display the contents of the subfolder in the Bookmarks pulldown, using these instructions:
   a. Press Alt+B to open bookmarks menu pulldown
   b. Press Down Arrow key until you have highlighted the subfolder in the bookmarks folder (created above in step 1).
   c. Press Right Arrow to open the subfolder.

3. Note the first item in the subfolder list shows (Empty).  Directly underneath the word (Empty) you see the actual contents of the subfolder.
4. If you close the subfolder (Press Left Arrow) and reopen it (Press Right Arrow), the (Empty) item disappears, and the subfolder is displayed as expected.

Expected results:
   The first item in the bookmark subfolder should not say (Empty).
