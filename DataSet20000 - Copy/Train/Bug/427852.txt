We have a sound which plays every time the page reloads. It works in 2.0.0.13, but not in 3.0 Beta 5. I've written a short program which is included below. You will need to substitute your own .wav file in the embed statement. Any sound will do.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
load and run the following program (after first substituting a .wav file name and path (in the "embed" statement) that you have on your system):

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN">
<html>
	<head>
	<title>Test Sound</title>

	<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript">

        function setfocus() {

            // see if this is a Firefox browser
            var FIRE = navigator.userAgent.indexOf("Mozilla");

            if(FIRE > -1) {

                // the sound file is "embeded"
			    var soundname = "sready";
			    var sound = eval("document." + soundname);

                // alert (sound.name);

                try {
                   sound.Stop();
                   sound.Rewind();
                } catch (e) {
                   // A player that does not support Stop and Rewind
                }

                try {
                      sound.DoPlay();
                 } catch (e) {
                      // If DoPlay does not work, call Play.
                      // This works for all other audio plug-ins.
                      sound.Play();
                 }
            }

            return;
        }

    </script>

	</head>
	
    <body bgcolor="white" onload="setfocus()">

    Test sound.<P>

    <embed src="blip.wav" width="0" height="0" autostart="false" name="sready" enablejavascript="true">

An oddity:

1. If you include an "alert" statement in the javascript (see commented statement above) - i.e. if you uncomment it, the sound plays after you click on the OK.
Actual Results:  
When I uncomment the "alert", the routine runs and the sound plays using the sound.Play() function. If I comment it again, or if I move the alert to a point after the sound.Play() function, the sound doesn't play.

Expected Results:  
When the page loads, the "onload" runs the Javascript function which plays the sound once. i.e. there is no "loop". Since the above program runs correctly in FF 2.0.0.13, I would expect it to run in FF 3 Beta 5, only it doesn't.  I also would not expect an alert, inserted ahead of the Play() to have any effect at all on the outcome.

As noted, it should have played the sound 1 time since the "loop" is not specified.
