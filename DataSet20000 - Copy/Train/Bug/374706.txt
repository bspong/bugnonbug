Hi,
This problem with php has been happening all the way back to 1.5. 
As far as i can tell; Firefox just lacks the php control to run it right. Many sites such as Ogame.org have things like back ground music that can be played in IE but not Firefox because of limits on php support. I believe that Firefox support for PHP if even supported needs to be looked at and checked! Because it seems more and more sites i go to use PHP then Html or xhtml. 

Please note that Firefox did not crash and i have tried this on all version of Firefox on different operating systems and different computers. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just going to a heavy use of PHP sites!
Actual Results:  
Nothing.
Example: A page as a file of music within it. The song is posted on to the web site with php commands. Plays in IE on a different pc in IE. But not Firefox.

Expected Results:  
From Above results, it should have played the 2k file.

I tried a windows xp sp2
I tried a windows xp sp1
I tried a Windows 2000 Server
I tried a windows 98

I still have gotten the same problems or limits
