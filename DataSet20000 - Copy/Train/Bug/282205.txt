Firefox becoming globally unable to load any page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)

Such a general topic will sound strange to most of us, but as this bug happened 
to me on 2 diffrent computers in 2 completely 

diffrent situations, with 2 diffrent OS and at 2 diffrent periods, I think it's 
worth talking about it.

After some weeks of use, Firefox 1.0 became unable to load any page. Any 
attempt to "repair" it didn't work and I 

finally had to reinstall it completely

It happened with the 2 following configurations:

- Athlon 900 MHz, 56k modem, W2K.
- P4 1.8 Ghz, LAN, XP.

If others among you encountered a similar problem, let's share the experiences.
