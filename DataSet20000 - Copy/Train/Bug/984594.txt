Firefox without Proxy compared to Firefox with Proxy

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/34.0.1847.60 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

When behind a Bluecoat proxy with SSL termination, multiple web sites no longer function in Firefox 27.0.1. For instance, the site below (https://dod-emall.dla.mil/auth/noCert.action?dsrf=/auth/login.action), after confirming by hitting "OK", is viewable behind the proxy in IE, Chrome, and Firefox (up through 26). Once upgraded to Firefox 27, however, the following error appears:
"The proxy server is refusing connections

Firefox is configured to use a proxy server that is refusing connections.
Check the proxy settings to make sure that they are correct.
Contact your network administrator to make sure the proxy server is working."

If the proxy is disabled in the browser, it can then be accessed as normal. This error remains, however, even if the site is whitelisted in Bluecoat manager.

Other unusual activity with Bluecoat has also been seen on other random sites (such as https://www.anixter.com/north-america/us/en/products/wire-and-cable/electrical-wire-and-cable.html) will pop up with authentication requests as well, although inputting AD credentials as required will cause them to go away. This behavior was also not seen until Firefox 27.


Actual results:

Firefox returns the following:

The proxy server is refusing connections

Firefox is configured to use a proxy server that is refusing connections.

    Check the proxy settings to make sure that they are correct.
    Contact your network administrator to make sure the proxy server is working.


Expected results:

Site displays as normal.
