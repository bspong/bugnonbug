When using the "Search" get "Server not found" message after upgrade to version 1.5.

After entering criteria in Search and clicking "go" or pressing "enter" get a "Server not found" message.  I tried the same site with Firefox Version 1.0.1, and I do not get this error messge, the search works.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to "http://www.audible.com/"
2.click "Browse Audio" tab at top of page
3.enter "King" or any other name under "Search" in left Window
4.click "go" or press "enter"

Actual Results:  
Server not found
     
       Firefox can't find the server at www.audible.comhttp.

    *   Check the address for typing errors such as
          ww.example.com instead of
          www.example.com

    *   If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
          connection.

    *   If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure that Firefox is permitted to access the Web

Expected Results:  
Display a web page showing the search results with items or message say no matches from audible.com

I also experienced a similar message "Server not found" when trying to view past a transaction history on a secure credit card page.
