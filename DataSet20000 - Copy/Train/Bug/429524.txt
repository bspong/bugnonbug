PNG with transparency over another image not printing correctly

Using Yahoo Sitebuilder, I create a PNG file when I ask for text to be converted to graphics.  This text/graphic is placed over a jpg image and renders as white text over the jpg image.  When I view in firefox it looks good.  When I print preview it looks good.  When I print to the printer, the png image prints with white both inside and outside the text outline and the vectors that make the edges of the text are transparent.

Is this problem with the PNG file or with Firefox?

I'll report it to Yahoo if I know it's the PNG file...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Use Yahoo Sitebuilder and place an image on any webpage.
2.  Use text tool to place text over the image.
3.  Change text properties to "display as graphic" or "convert to graphic"
4.  Once everything is setup you can press F12 to open/display the new page in (default) browser
5.  Print it.


Expected Results:  
Well, I guess if you can display the images correctly on screen then I think you should print the image correctly on paper.

For the record, IE 7 "ignores" the PNG image and prints nothing but the image behind the PNG image
