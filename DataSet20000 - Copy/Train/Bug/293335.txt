Improper space before and after a paragraph (when <p> and </p> are used).
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.3    [and all previous versions]

In the page at http://truecrypt.org/history.php (and other pages as well), text 
appears vertically "squeezed" in Firefox (in IE6 it is displayed normally). I 
traced the problem to the <p> and </p> commands. More space (pixel lines) 
should be added before and after a paragraph. 

It should be less pixels than is added by two line breaks <br> <br> but 
definitely more pixels than is added by one <br>.

I understand you may say that IE chose to display it like that and Firefox like 
this and that there are no strict specs. However, as 99% of web sites are 
optimized for IE, I believe that Firefox should adhere to it, if you want it to 
spread. As a user, I was literally disgusted with the way many of my favourite 
sites look in Firefox. It actually prevents me from dumping IE completely. The 
pages just look right and better in IE. People are used to the way their fav 
websites look in IE and will not switch to Firefox. 

Fixing this will definitely help spread Firefox faster.

Thank you.

Reproducible: Always

visible.

Expected Results:  
More space (pixel lines) should be added before and after a paragraph (when <p> 
and </p> are used).
