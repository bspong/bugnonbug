Automatic Update options dialog contains too much text

The "Automatic Update" options dialog is essentially unusable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Open the following dialog - Tools > Options... > Advanced > Update > Advanced...
Actual Results:  
This is barely readable. As a power-user and software developer, I had
difficulty with the wording. In my opinion, this dialog needs to be re-done
entirely. 

Expected Results:  
Recommended improvements:

1. "Automatically download" should be entirely seperate to "Automatically
install". Downloading in the background and manually installing when ready is
more desirable than not downloading automatically with idle bandwidth. There is
potential for confusion here

2. Word the dialog better as below:

When updates are available, Firefox should:
(o) download updates and install.
( ) download updates but not install.
( ) prompt for instructions.

Install updates only if:
[ ] enabled extensions remain compatible
[ ] the current theme remains compatible

This will obviously affect localisation. Please nominate as an appropriate blocker.
