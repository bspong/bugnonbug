A certain url with flash prevents tab switching

Load any page (say pageA), and in then in a new tab load http://www.ford.ca/english/default_flash.asp

Bring this page in the new tab to the foreground. Now I cannot switch to pageA by clicking its tab. However as soon as I use another application, the "switch" to pageA will occur. 

Also, after trying (and failing) to bring pageA to the foreground by clicking its tab I may then proceed to minimize the application by pressing the minimize button, but the application does not minimize, and instead then immediately brings pageA to the foreground (I can then minimize the application by clicking minimize again).

I don't think this is just a problem restricted to the flash plugin, because I don't see this with SeaMonkey 1.0.5, but I do see it with firefox 1.5, and bon echo. 

    Plugin info:
File name: C:\PROGRAM FILES\MOZILLA FIREFOX\plugins\NPSWF32.dll
Shockwave Flash 8.0 r24

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a tab to any webpage, say pageA
2. Open a new tab to the url http://www.ford.ca/english/default_flash.asp
3. Click the tab to pageA

Actual Results:  
The browser fails to bring pageA to the fore.

Minimize brings pageA to the fore, a second application of the minimize button may then minimize the page.

Clicking on some other application's open window will immediately bring pageA to the fore. 

Expected Results:  
the page is immediately brought to the foreground when its tab is clicked. 

The bug affects firefox, but seemingly not seamonkey.
