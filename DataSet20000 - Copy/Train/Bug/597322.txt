Problems runnning the downloaded file Firefox 4b6
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b6) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b6) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b6

In addition to the above problems (and initial difficulties starting FF4b6) I ran the file while in FF4b5, rather than saving it, and it reported that it didn't complete the process correctly.  Right-click menu from taskbar is wrong; it doesn't show version.  Major work involved in trying to set up favorites, feeds and such all over again.  I've been asked to change browser versions 3 times, and it's the same work each time.  Also, this version seems to require my circling the touchpad (like the spinning icon in blue on the screen) before the window fog clears and I can do anything; I'm assuming this is something other than this version, but I thought it should be reported anyhow, as it makes me wait far too long for the simplest things.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Attempting to change tabs; search for anything, or go to a website, etc.
2.
3.



I've attempted to import things into IE8 from Firefox, once I set it up again, and doing that caused IE8 to start behaving similarly.  The problems are even worse in IE8, as it freezes, whereas Firefox goes into limbo or somnambulance (the circle spins, but it's not responding until I circle the pad over and over, and repeatedly tap and bang the touchpad.  The nuisance and delay factor is enormous, and since it seems contagious, like a cold, it should be fixed fast.  When I save everything again, I'll try rerunning the browser from a saved file (after I remove FF 4b5.)  Maybe that will help Firefox, but poor jammed IE8 -- I may have to offload everything, and take the system back to factory default, and then upgrade to IE8 again, to get it to work right.  What a pain!
