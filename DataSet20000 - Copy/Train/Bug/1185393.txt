Save to Pocket Add-on On FF39 Toolbar - Remove
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:39.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/39.0
Build ID: 2015063000

Steps to reproduce:

Updated from FF38 - FF39


Actual results:

The toobar icons were squashed together. The problem is there is now an add-on "save-to-pocket" icon automatically added to the toolbar. Clicking on it we are directed to sign up for yet another NEW ACCOUNT. 

How do I completely disable/remove the pocket icon and backend for it?


Expected results:

There should NOT have been any new unwanted and unwelcomed add-ons added to the toolbar. We are all big boys and girls. If we want an add-on, we know where to find them. 

What we want/need from Mozilla is a secure, light-weight browser that is consistent between versions, renders quickly and functions as a browser, not some slimy front-end to commercial add-on developers. 

Users should not be forced to go digging through about:config on each new release just to turn off and disable all the unwanted and unnecessary crap that some new wet behind the ears dev thinks we all "just can't live without" -- we can, we want to.

Firefox has grown from a lean/powerful browser to a amorphous bloated disk and memory hog.  In addition to removal of pocket api, or as an alternative to, Firefox should provide a lightweight addition that is just what Firefox used to be - a browser. Split the build into two parts, the base browser with all it core functionality and then a Firefox-Applications package for those who want the full install and don't care about dedicating 8-18% of their CPU to an idle browser window. Today's install was a whopping 40497839 compressed bytes for the Firefox package alone. Really.
