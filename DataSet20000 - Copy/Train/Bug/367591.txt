tabs showing wrong page content

This bug is occuring randomly to me; say once a week or so. It especially occurs when I have many tabs open and when the browser has been running for a long time.
This is what happens then: Given that I have page 1 opened in tab 1, for example http://tools.wikimedia.de/~leon/stats/reqstats/page.php. The page is displayed correctly, everything is fine. Now I change to a different tab, tab 2 which should have page 2. For a second or so it displays page 2 correctly, but then it disappears and page 1 appears - formatted which page 2's css:

In some rare cases it helps to do a shift-reload, but often I get page 1 again.
When I then change to tab 3 with page 3, I still get page 1, formatted with page 3's css this time.

And so on. Then say page 4 in tab 4 has image/png as the mime type:

http://vserver152.masterssystems.com/bug_2.png

Restarting the browser helps.
I hope I didn't file a duplicate, but I couldn't find an existing bug. Well, I'm sure you'll close it as a dupe in that case ;-)
