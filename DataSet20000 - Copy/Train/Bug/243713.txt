Image that should only load in new window loads in new window AND main window as well

If you click on any of the image thumbnails on this page, a window should open
which loads the image. This does indeed happen, but the image loads in the main
window as well, which shouldn't happen.

Safari and MSIE both behave correctly on this page. I have seen this happen on
other image sites, but this is the most recent ocurrence and finally decided to
report the bug.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit above URL
2.Click on any of the thumbnails.


Actual Results:  
A window will appear which will load the image. When the image finishes loading,
it will load in the main window (the window in which the thumbnail was clicked)
as well.

Expected Results:  
The image should only load into the new window. The main window should still on
the page with the thumbnails.

I thought this might have to do with blocking target_new_window, but the
behavior remained the same when I turned it off.

Apologies if this is a dupe, I did about five searches and came up with nothin'.
