[OSX 3.6.12] AJAX queries eventually seem to crash or get cached when using the same browser all day.

When browsing a page which loads bits in using jQuery AJAX queries, I've noticed that eventually the queries just stop grabbing new information.

For example, today I was working on a page which submitted JSON encoded arrays to an API which handled them and sent back another JSON encoded array.

This was working all day, but lo and behold when I walk over to a co-worker to have them look over my work at my desk by the time I came back Firefox had done its magic.

Every AJAX POST returned as 'Failed to load <page>...' (when viewed in Firebug) and the actual data didn't come back to my javascript either.

This seems to happen when I use the same browser window all day. It just eventually stops grabbing new AJAX queries until I close Firefox completely and re-load it.

This has happened a few times with a few different applications now. Sometimes it's Flash sending the JSON and getting nothing back and sometimes it's jQuery.

I'm pretty sure it's a bug with the MacOS version of the browser because with the same content I don't have an issue in Windows or Linux distros.

Thanks for taking the time to read my bug.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open browser and use an application which loads a lot of data using AJAX.
2. Wait all day while doing so.
3. Eventually you should stop getting new results from your AJAX requests.
Actual Results:  
Sometimes the browser stops loading new data and I have to close it to get it to behave properly again.

Expected Results:  
AJAX queries should always return new info considering the server is always returning 200 (new data, not a non-changed condition).
