I'd like to see more than 10 items when I pull down the global "History" menu item
without having to disappear into the hell that is "Show All History".

The number of items _appears_ to be hard-coded to 10 -- at least that's the most I ever see, and poking around in about:config doesn't reveal any promising variables to change.

Poking around in mxr turns up
http://mxr.mozilla.org/firefox/ident?i=FillHistoryMenu
and most specifically
http://mxr.mozilla.org/firefox/ident?i=MAX_HISTORY_MENU_ITEMS
which looks like a promising candidate.

However it is hard-coded as 15, so I'm not exactly sure where the 10 I see comes from, and I don't care to decode the control flow of the code to work
out what's happening.

Anyway, what I *WANT* is to allow 30 or so items to appear when I click on
"History" in the menu bar.  I'm just guessing that the above code might be
implicated, and know nothing about mozilla internals.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on "History" menu item
2. Note stumpiness of pull-down result
3. Wish for a longer, firmer, more assertive set of choices.
Actual Results:  
10 items.  "Any colour you like, as long as it is black."

Expected Results:  
> 10 items, per user choice
