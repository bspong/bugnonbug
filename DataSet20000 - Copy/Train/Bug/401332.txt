Main image (today it's http://s3-external-1.amazonaws.com/wootsaleimages/Polaroid_T737_7MP_Digital_CameradfvStandard.jpg) won't load on the front page of woot.  If you try to view the image directly (put the url in) it shows, but not when in an <img> tag in html.  This may have happened when download helper was added (not my computer), but uninstalling DownloadHelper and restarting Firefox did not change the image not loading.

  Using shirt woot, an image on s3-external-2 worked, but not the ones from s3-external-1.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to www.woot.com

TEST:
put following into text file and view in firefox.
--- START TEST HTML ---
<html><body>
<!-- this one is working on mine -->
<img src="http://s3-external-2.amazonaws.com/wootdesigncontestentries/zewkin/No_dessert_until_you_eat_your_people!-ezoeap-d.jpg" />
<!-- this one is not showing up -->
<img src="http://s3-external-1.amazonaws.com/wootdesigncontestentries/zewkin/No_dessert_until_you_eat_your_people!-a92n91-s.jpg" />
</body>
</html>

--- END TEST HTML---

The first image shows but not the second in the html above.  Both show when entered directly in the address bar.
Actual Results:  
1. main woot image (on s3-external-1.amazonaws.com) doesn't show up

TEST: first image shows, but not second

Expected Results:  
1. main image to show

TEST: both images to show
