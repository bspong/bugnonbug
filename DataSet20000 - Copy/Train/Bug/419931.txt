Sound stops broadcasting in Firefox 2.0.0.12, 2.0.0.11 and Firefox beta 3.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080201 Firefox/2.0.0.12

Sound will work fine when showing a video, or using the URL above, after Firefox has been started.  But at some point sound stops broadcasting and can only be restored by closing and restarting Firefox.  Although Firefox stops broadcasting, other applications will still broadcast sound (Internet Explorer, Winamp, Yahoo Music Player, e.g.).  I had thought there might be a conflict between web sites, but so far cannot consistently identify that.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I can't reproduce it, consistently.  
2.Play a video from say msnbc.com
3.Open a tab - http://www.uclick.com/client/nwk/nwdok/
4.At some point sound will stop working, but there is no consistent pattern that I see and it will happen with other web sites, these are just two examples.
Actual Results:  
At first there will be sound, and then sound will stop being produced.

Expected Results:  
I'd expect sound to continue to play.

I have SoundMAX Integrated Digital Audio, in a Gateway laptop.  There are a fair number of tabs open, but this can happen with 15 tabs or less.
