don't load tabs until selected not working properly in Firefox 9.01
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:9.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/9.0.1
Build ID: 20111220165912

Steps to reproduce:

Upgraded from Firefox 8.01 to 9.01


Actual results:

All pinned app tabs as well as the selected tab that is loaded when Firefox starts, are loaded.


Expected results:

In Firefox 8.01 none of the tabs would load until I selected it. This was regardless whether the tab was pinned as an app or not. This is what I expected, and still expect to happen.

By not loading tabs until they are selected, Firefox starts quicker when multiple tabs are set as apps or simply left on the tab bar using faviconize tab.

If you want to give an option to load app tabs that is fine. But make it an option that can be enabled or disabled by the user.

Having the many app tabs that I do, it is preferable that tabs not load until I select them for viewing. By loading all of the app tabs when Firefox starts, you have eliminated the advantage to having "don't load tabs until selected" checked.

Please default it back to the previous functionality and then add a check box that states: "Load app tabs on start" for those who would like their app tabs loaded when Firefox starts.
