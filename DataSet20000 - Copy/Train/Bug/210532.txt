Cannot complete web form in some specific instances

  I have an account on a game-swapping site, for which I am a system admin.  the
address is www.tradegamesnow.com.  As part of our service, we hook up people
that want to swap games.  We use a built-in messenger servvice that lets the
users use web forms to leave comments for each other.  When these "swaps" are
set to a "Pending" status, then ONLY THOSE pages cannot be displayed properly:
the form actually displays in the browser window TWICE, one atop the other with
a scroll bar, and the text field is unclickable.  This error DOES NOT HAPPEN IN
ANY OTHER MOZILLA BUILD, and seems limited only to Firebird.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Not sure how to reproduce, since this happens on a site requiring a login, which
I naturally don't desire to make public.  I can however send you View Source
info for the page in question if it will help you find out what characters or
code in the page is causing the error.

Actual Results:  
  Every time a page is loaded that's in "Pending" status on our site, the web
form locks.  No other types of messages, which use the same web form have this
issue.

Expected Results:  
Text should be allowed to be entered into the web form.  The browser displays
web forms from any oher status message, and IE and Mozilla both allow text to be
entered as normal.
