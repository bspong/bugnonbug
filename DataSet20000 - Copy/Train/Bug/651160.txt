Update has failed to install at 1st attempt and only succeeded on 2nd attempt. Probably related to slow shutdown of Firefox.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I had a huge Firefox session in memory, ~200 tabs or so. Some data went to swap.
2. I detected that update available
3. I attempted to install update and apply it. 
4. I waited for a while until Firefox process will be shut down. 
5. Then there was error message telling that update is not applied and suggesting that possibly Firefox process is running. 
6. Firefox 4.0 has started.
7. Repeated attempt to apply update has corrected problem.
Actual Results:  
Update has failed to apply, probably because huge FF session has been slow to shutdown and FF process become unresponsive while being pushed out of swap file. 

Expected Results:  
Update applies regardless of slow process shutdown. 

Looks like it was slow FF process shutdown what caused this trouble. FF had to get itself from swap file and it used ~1.7Gb of RAM (~200 tabs open) so there was a lot of swapping and hence FF process shutdown took several minutes or so.
