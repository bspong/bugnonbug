FireFox cannot use the Kerberos authentication protocol to connect to a Web site that uses a non-standard port in Windows (XP, Vista, Server 2003, Server 2008 and Windows 7).

This problem occurs because FireFox does not pass the port number of the target Web site when it calls the InitializeSecurityContext function to build the Kerberos ticket. This prevents FireFox from using the Kerberos protocol to connect to multiple Web sites that run on different ports under different identities.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Consider the following scenario:
1. The computer is running one of the following operating systems:
Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003 or 2008.
2. Verify that the computer has Internet Information Services (IIS) installed.
3. Complete the following steps to ensure that your Firefox browser is enabled to perform SPNEGO authentication: 
a. At the desktop, log in to the windows active directory domain. 
b. Activate Firefox. 
c. At the address field, type about:config. 
d. In the Filter, type network.n 
e. Double click on network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris. This preference lists the sites that are permitted to engage in SPNEGO Authentication with the browser. Enter a comma-delimited list of trusted domains or URLs. 
f. Note: You must set the value for network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris.

4. Ensure that you have two Web sites that have different ports and identities. These two Web sites are running on the same computer. For example, Web site 1 runs on port 80 under identity "id1" and Web site 2 runs on port 81 under identity "id2”.
5. Both the Web sites use Kerberos authentication protocol version 5.
6. Use the SetSPN utility to declare the Service Principal Name (SPN) for Web site 2.
7. Use the same host name to connect to Web site 1 and to Web site 2. Use FireFox to make this connection. 

For example, you use http://example.com to connect to Web site 1 and http://example.com:81 to connect to Web site 2. In this example, you use the same example.com host name to connect to both Web sites.
In this scenario, FireFox can use the Kerberos protocol to connect to Web site 1. However, FireFox cannot use the Kerberos protocol to connect to Web site 2.
Actual Results:  
FireFox cannot use the Kerberos protocol to connect a Web site that uses a non-standard port.

Expected Results:  
FireFox can use the Kerberos protocol to connect a Web site that uses a non-standard port, like: port 81, 16992, etc.
