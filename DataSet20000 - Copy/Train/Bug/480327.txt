Any ASP.NET DropDownList that is databound does not get selected value. The browser is producing a postback on the control before the value is obtained. Example: When a user selects an item and the page postsback to the server, the DropDownList is rebound before getting the selected value. The results is always the first item in the list. I posted an example page so you can test it in both IE and Firefox. The example shows both a databound and none databound listbox. It works fine in IE. This could be a potential catastrophic issue as more and more application move to the web. Bad data from this issue could be detrimental and frustrating to users and businesses.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Select item in databound dropdownlist
2.item select will always be the first item in the list due to postback issue
3.
