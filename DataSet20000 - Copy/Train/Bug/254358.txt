The "Open with" option no longer specifies a helper nor provides the option to select one.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8a3) Gecko/20040802 Firefox/0.9.1+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8a3) Gecko/20040802 Firefox/0.9.1+

When I select the URL of a PDF or other file that needs to be run in another
application I get the "You have chosen to open" panel, but the 'Open with'
option specifies no default application (e.g. xpdf) nor does it provide the
option to specify one. So all I can do is download the file and then view it. I
do not want to use a plugin for pdf or other such files.
This is a NEW bug. If I revert to a slightly older build, the bug disappears,
e.g. Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040626
 Firefox/0.9.1

If I use a more recent version (e.g. Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US;
rv:1.8a3) Gecko/20040802 Firefox/0.9.1+) I get the bug. 
This is a very serious bug.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select the URL
http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/misc/talks/cafe-emotions-machines.pdf
2. Look at the panel that comes up.

Actual Results:  
No application to view the file is specified, and there is no option to select one.
However option to save to disk is there.

Expected Results:
