When opening two external links in the background and the site needs a response to accept or reject 
cookies, the cookies dialog is unresponsive causing the user to force quit. This is often happening 
while using an rss reader, opening a link in the background with another soon following it then 
bringing Firefox to the foreground. There is no way to focus the individual pages and the cookies 
dialog is unreponsive forcing a force quit

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. have firefox settings to always ask about cookies
2. open external link to a site you have never been to asking firefox to open it in the background via rss 
reader
3. repeat step two
4. Bringing Firefox to the front, the cookies dialog should be unresponsive

Actual Results:  
user has to force quit Firefox

Expected Results:  
allowed the user to accept or reject cookie
