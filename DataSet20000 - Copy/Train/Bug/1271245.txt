[Affected versions]:
- Firefox 45.0 and up
- Activity Stream 1.0.15

[Affected Platforms]:
- All Windows
- All Mac OS
- All Linux

Prerequisites]:
- Latest Activity Stream add-on version (1.0.15) was previously installed on a clean profile.  

[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Open the browser with the profile from prerequisites.
2. Visit some websites that would appear in "Highlights" section. (eg. 9gag.com)
3. Click the Activity Stream button from the browser toolbar.
4. Observe the "Highlights" tiles from the Timeline page.
5. Revisit the website from step #2 after 25 minutes.

[Expected result]:
- If the visited website meets all the requirements for "Highlights", then it should be added to "Highlights" after 30 minutes. 

[Actual result]:
- If you revisit the website at every 25 minutes then "Highlights" tiles will never be populated with the content from the visited website. 

[Notes]:
- The issue is reproducible on the New Tab page as well.
- In the current behavior, if 30 minutes have passed since last visit, the website is not displayed in "Highlights". It will be displayed only if you visit another website.
- In my opinion, for a better users experience the "Highlights" tiles should be updated instantly because the content displayed is related to History.
