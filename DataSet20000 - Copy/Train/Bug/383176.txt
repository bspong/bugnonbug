drag and drop URL to file system creates url file whose content is suffed with a few extra characters. Occurs with 90% URL. I assume that the url string being written has a size at least 2 bytes greater than the correct length.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any URL - tested with http://en-us.www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/2.0.0.4/firstrun/ 
2. drag URL to any windows folder 
(Alternatively - creating URL file in file system using drag and drop from a bookmark entry produces the same result described below)


Actual Results:  
edit file with a tool that shows hex data will show extra data following end of line <CR><LF> (hex x'0D0A') attached sample shows hex x'2046'. File size is 88 bytes NOT 86 bytes.

Expected Results:  
Correctly formed ".url" file with no extra bytes. Verify by edit file with a tool that shows hex data and file ends at end of line <CR><LF> (hex x'0D0A'). File size would be 86 bytes.

A hex capable edit/view tool is needed as this extra byte may be x'00' in some cases.

Tested using a fresh profile built with "Firefox -ProfileManager" command

This behavior was present in the previous release of firefox v2.0.0.3. It is really annoying if you use 3rd party tools to process ".url" files. Currently ever ".url" file has to be opened and the garbage characters removed.
Sometime the ".url" file is correct but I think this depends on whatever memory contents is adjacent to the ".url"

Problem does NOT occur when tested on Win 2000 + firefox v2.0.0.3 
Problem does occur when tested on Win 98SE + firefox v2.0.0.3 or v2.0.0.4
