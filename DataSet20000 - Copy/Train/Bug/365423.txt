FF 2.0 fails to start
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Media Center PC 5.0; .NET CLR 3.0.04506)
Build Identifier: 2.0.0.1

I get the following error when trying to start FF 2.0:

The program must close to allow a previous installation to complete. Please restart.

This started after a failed installation of the FlashPlayer Plug in.

The platform is Win Vista Ultimate.

I've been able to remove (including removal of registry entry) and reinstall FF, but the problem comes back. Sometimes FF will run once under a different user, but subsequent uses of FF results in above error.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install FF 2.0.
2. Start the app
3. Automatic FlashPlayer install fails and proceed with manual install.

Actual Results:  
I've been running Vista Ultimate + FF 2.0 for over a month on another PC without any isses. I don't know if the FlashPlayer Plugin version has changed since that install and I don't remember how the plugin got installed.


Something seems to be stuck in Vista/FF that forces this error.

During some attempts to install FF 2.0 I get an error: error opening file for writing: nxpicleanup.exe. Rebooting or trying to install under a different user eliminates the error.
