Steps to reproduce:

0. Install attached BrowserWindowsTest extension for the debug shortcut Ctrl+Alt+D and start a clean session of Firefox, one window open. (Or you can run it with "jpm run -b /usr/bin/firefox").

1. Press Ctrl+Alt+D and observe the Debug console [1]
2. Press Ctrl+N to open a new browser window
3. Press Ctrl+Alt+D and observe the Debug console [2]
4. Enter "javascript:window.open('about:blank');" into the address bar and press Enter.
5. Press Ctrl+Alt+D and observe the Debug console [3]

[A] one browser window open:
console.log: browserwindowstest: windows.browserWindows.length = 1
console.log: browserwindowstest: constructor {"0":{}}

[B] two browser windows open:
console.log: browserwindowstest: windows.browserWindows.length = 2
console.log: browserwindowstest: constructor {"0":{},"1":{}}

[C] three (!) browser windows open:
console.log: browserwindowstest: windows.browserWindows.length = 2
console.log: browserwindowstest: constructor {"0":{},"1":{}}

You can continue opening browser windows with Ctrl+N and window.open() with the same results - those opened with Ctrl+N are added to sdk/windows browserWindows list, and those opened with window.open() are not.


Actual results:

sdk/windows browserWindows list does not contain BrowserWindows opened with window.open().
However these windows are visually no different from BrowserWindows opened with Ctrl+N.

Also no 'open' event is triggered for sdk/windows browserWindows after window.open().

So there is no way to list all opened BrowserWindows.
This renders that SDK API *useless* for performing operations on browser windows from within an addon.



Expected results:

sdk/windows browserWindows should contain *ALL* BrowserWindows opened, both with Ctrl+N and with window.open().
