The javascript within the provided example-html-page simulates a click on a link
in this page through javascript. This brings up an alert box at page onLoad. 

It works within the following tested browser releases:
1) Mozilla 1.4
2) Mozilla 1.7.2
3) Firefox Preview Release 1.0 (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1;
rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10)

It does not work within:
1) Firefox 10rc1
2) Firefox 10rc2
3) Firefox 1.0 

Nothing happens here and no javascript error is displayed within the console.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Display the attached html page.

Actual Results:  
If the error occurs there should not be a javascript alert box coming up
automatically.

Expected Results:  
Because there is a body onLoad event the function click should have opened an js
alert box.
