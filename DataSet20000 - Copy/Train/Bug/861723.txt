Steps to reproduce:

Windows 7 x64 SP1 with two displays. #1 - 1920x1080 and the desktop is extended to the right with #2 - 1024x768. See attached screenshot. Windows display setting is enlarged at 125%.

Recently I upgraded from 20130330042013 to 20130412004014 which included some hi-res changes as described in bug 844604. Those changes are currently undesirable for me in my current configuration and so I have changed layout.css.devPixelsPerPx from -1/auto back to 1.


Actual results:

I run Firefox maximized on display #1. When I do that with the more recent nightly, 20130412004014 22.0a2, and layout.css.devPixelsPerPx is set to certain values then some popup menus will appear on display #2. This happens when popup menus are initiated on the right most quarter of display #1. For example if I click on the display-your-bookmarks star button, which is the rightmost button, the popup menu will appear on display #2. If I right-click on the search box and it's far enough to the right it will appear on display #2. This also happens with tooltips. For example if I mouseover any of the buttons on the right the tooltips will appear on display #2.

I have tested a bunch of combinations in a clean profile and the bug only happens if:
Using 20130412004014 instead of 20130330042013
layout.css.devPixelsPerPx is >= .9 and <= 1.23
Display #2 is functioning as an extended desktop



Expected results:

The popups and tooltips should appear on display #1 where I am interacting Firefox.
