Typing any character on the keyboard causes multiple instances of 'The 'charCode' property of a keyup event should not be used. The value is meaningless.' to appear in the Error Console.

I'm using Firefox 3.1b4pre and I've noticed this in past 3.1b3pre builds as well.  The Error Console has literally dozens and dozens of instances of the following:

Warning: The 'charCode' property of a keyup event should not be used. The value is meaningless.
Source File: chrome://browser/content/browser.xul
Line: 0

It doesn't matter where I go or what I'm doing, this error comes up. Granted, it's just a warning, but it's filling up the Error Console with useless and meaningless information. Line 0 doesn't even exist.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox 3.1b4pre
2. Visit any web site.
3. Tools -> Error Console
Actual Results:  
Look for the mass instances of "The 'charCode' property of a keyup event should not be used. The value is meaningless."

Expected Results:  
The warning should not exist. There is no line 0 in chrome://browser/content/browser.xul
