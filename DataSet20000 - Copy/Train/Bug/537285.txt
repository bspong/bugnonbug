This is an issue I have had for at least 30 days -  it did not exist in October or September.  It is highly repeatable, but not 100%.  Login to WSJ, choose any article.  Click the email (as in email the article link),  at this point a new window opens for entering the email addresses (yours and the recipient) The first part of the problem is FF on my Mac cannot find the server -- I get an error and question do I want to retry.  The second time the issue happens is when I get the email delivered and attempt to click the link in the email.  I have a Vista Machine and have these issue less than 5% of the time on the  Vista Box vs. >90% for the sending link issue on my Mac and about 50% when I click the email link on my Mac box.  Both Vista and Mac boxes are current with all updates.  Both have same addons.  Both boxes are wired to the same router.
