After upgrading to Firefox 3.6 i kept the browser open for about a week since electricity is included at work so we never shutdown the pc's.

At the end of the week having done various things in Firefox i noticed my system was getting slow. When I opened the Task Manager i noticed the 600+mb mem usage of Firefox. This never happend before when i left my browser open for a week.
