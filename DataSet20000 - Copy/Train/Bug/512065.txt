Dragging the bookmark on the bookmark bar does not work, trying to
add it by clicking on the blue star does not work, add it as a bookmark from
the menu does not work because it adds the last page in the chronology, not the
page you are actually seeing.
Moreover, I cannot delete or edit existing bookmarks.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any webpage.
2. Try to drag it on the bookmark bar. 
3. Try to check the blue star on the right of the url.
4. Try to add it by clicking "Bookmarks --> Add to bookmarks" on the menu bar.
Actual Results:  
Steps 2,3: nothing happened. The page was not added to the bookmark strip, and the blue star was not checked.
Step 4: the bookmarked page was not the one I was visiting.

Expected Results:  
Step 2: the bookmark should appear on the bookmark strip.
Step 3: The star should appear full blue.
Step 4: the bookmarked page should be the one I was visiting.

Persists from previous Mozilla version.
