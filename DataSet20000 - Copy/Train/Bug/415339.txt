When the daily built was installed at 2008 01 31, the bookmarks and folders that I had directly created under "All Bookmarks" and not inside one of the default folders disappeared. I couldn't found using the search nor by using the bookmarks manager. How ever, if I started typing their address at the address bar they would appeared with the star next to them. And when I clicked the star, I could see that the bookmark was still saved directly under the folder "All Bookmarks". I can create new bookmarks there and still appear (I haven't checked if they would be there I restart Firefox) but the old ones are nowhere to find.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Previous build of 20080131
2.Create bookmarks directly under "All Bookmarks"
3.Update to the 20080131 built (i don't now if updating to an even newer built will do the trick)
Actual Results:  
The bookmarks under "All Bookmarks" still saved but hidden

Expected Results:  
You should be able to see all your bookmarks

You should be able to recover your bookmarks if you use an earlier built and move your bookmarks under "Bookmarks Menu" or "Bookmarks Toolbar". It worked with me, with the 20080127 built but with some minor problems. First of all, they are still hidden at the bookmarks sidebar (this also happened with every build between 20080127-20080131). I didn't try to search for them, but I was able to see them using the bookmarks manager (tried it only with 20080127 built). The other minor problem was that when I clicked to open the bookmarks manager an error window appeared and i clicked the only available option "OK" to continue with no further problems to the bookmarks manager.
