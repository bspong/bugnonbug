allow social providers to specify less-intrusive "shrunken sidebars"
Part of our goal in implementing Facebook's sidebar is to allow users to continue their Firefox browsing while being in touch with their social circle.  In this way, Facebook is available and scannable, but also ignorable.

Of course, if a user wants to focus, they can temporarily hide the Facebook sidebar.  But what if they're still having a conversation with a Facebook contact?  What if that conversation is part of their browsing task?  For instance, say a user wanted to pick a restaurant eat at with a friend.  They would want to continue talking to that friend while browsing restaurant websites, but the other information in their social feed would be irrelevant and possibly distracting.

The attached mockup shows a smaller, shrunken state of the Facebook sidebar.  All but contacts' avatars and active conversations are hidden.

There's other reasons than distraction to allow users an option halfway between the full Facebook sidebar and no sidebar at all.  Contact names and contact notifications represent deeply personal data.  Any one contact could be a very private part of a person's life.  Any notification could contain private information, profanity, or other data that users may not want to have visible at all times.

By giving users the ability to shrink their bar to just their contacts' faces, we're allowing them to continue browsing with more screen real estate and continue conversations while disengaging from the more frenzied slew of information in their social feed.  With names hidden, potentially private data is less likely to be glimpsed by a passer-by.  But, functionality isn't highly reduced: users are likely to recognize the contacts they converse with.  If an avatar is unfamiliar, the user can mouse over it for the contacts' full name.
