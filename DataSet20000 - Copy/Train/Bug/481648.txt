firebug identified error "key is null" at line 1173 of Firefox/components/nsUrlClassifierLib.js
the offending line was 
return key.replace("-", "+").repalce("_", "/");
This occurred while displaying a web page which cannot be 
reproduced outside the fire wall.
Tinternal uri was
http://localhost:8080/chemicals/ch_act.jsp?service=george_of_the_gorge&frm=sorter&report=0_1_&sku=icz..Report1&closed=ny&fob=S.received_date&wheels=3&potency=600&product=peroxide

REPRODUCIBILITY: does not happen in IE or Chrome; did not happen in Firefox until today's update of Firefox

Reproducible: Sometimes

Actual Results:  
Internally I run the above or similar URI and firebug identifies "1 Error"

Expected Results:  
The error does not seem to prevent the web page from working.

Exactly what it did only without the "1 Error" message at the very bottom of the screen.
