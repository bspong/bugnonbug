No indicator for Private mode on Windows Vista/7 if the Firefox button is hidden
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

If we old-fashioned users eschew the Dreck button in the upper left corner, there is precisely zero indication when we are in Private mode. In the past, a theme developer could use something like this to indicate private mode:

/* PrivateMode URLbar background */

[browsingmode=private] #urlbar {
  background: #FFD5EA;
}

Now, of course, that code no longer works.

Request you put back this capacity so we themers can indicate private mode.

Oh, and just in case you might care about your default theme: some indicator other than a change in the Dreck button that a user is in private mode. For those who use the default theme and use the menu bar, they can't be sure when they are in private mode.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Check the Menu Bar box, so the menu bar is present
2. Go into Private mode

Actual Results:  
No indication of private mode.

Expected Results:  
Some indicator that a user is in private mode.

Firefox 3.6.16 is still available here:

It's a nice workaround for this bug.
