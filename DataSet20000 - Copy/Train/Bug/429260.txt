As of about 3 nightly builds ago, the Cmd-Left and Cmd-Right accelerators no longer move the browser along the history. The history buttons as well as the History/{Back,Forward} menu items continue to work fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
On a page with past pages in the history menu (i.e. the back/forward buttons are enabled), press Cmd-Left to try to go back and Cmd-Right to try to go forward through the history.
Actual Results:  
The History menu highlights when pressing the accelerator, as normally happens for such accelerators, but the browser does not actually change the page being viewed.

Expected Results:  
The browser should navigate one page backward or forward in the tab's history.

Please note: I originally added this as comments to bug 428760, but that bug seems to be different, in that the report there is that many key accelerators are not working. As for me, every other accelerator I've tried works, it's only the back and forward functions which don't work.
