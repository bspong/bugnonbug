Shouldn't be too strict on Content-Type

First,try opening this site with firefox
http://www.sx.hrss.gov.cn/
and this file
http://publish-vip.grandsoft.com.cn//downfile/question_answer/1323574_3.jpg
in stead of directly open them with browser, firefox make you downlod them.obiously it's not what you intent to do.
You may say maybe it's the site want you to do. but when you open said site(file) with IE, you will find you are wrong. http://www.sx.hrss.gov.cn/ appears to be a standard website in IE.
Due to some complicated reasons (server DNS etc), sometimes somehow the  Content-Types are wrong.
Recently this kind of phenomena hapens a lot in my country(China) I suspect the reason is rogue ISPs trying to hijack DNS(long stroy).
Change you DNS to 222.88.88.88, you will find this file can not be opened, but also you can open it with IE.

The outcome is plan and simple, driving millions of potential potential firefox user to IE. there are over a billion people, and most of them are using IE6.
I think the solution is also plan and simple, when opening a site, don't be too strict upon Content-Type, but also consider its Extension Name. in my opinion Extension Name should be your first consideration,because that's common sense, can't not be mistaken. no one will blame you when you open a exe file as text when its Content-Type is actually text/html.
