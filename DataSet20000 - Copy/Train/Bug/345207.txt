Floating table and banner won't position properly.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)

On other browsers, everything looks perfect. In Firefox, however, the banner seems to be spaced over to the right (or the floating navbar is over to the left) and there's a space between the first nav button and the rest of the table, but no where else between any other buttons on the table.

The code looks exactly the same, but it has odd spacing, regardless of how many times I've changed the V or H spacing, the alignment buttons, table width and height buttons, etc. (The website isn't using the newest updated .asp, but whether online, or testing locally with edits, Im getting the same positioning problems).

On another note, tables seem to be resizing all over the place.
I dont understand that if I tell the browser to display a table 311px wide, for instance, it somehow gets the idea in its head to make it smaller. (see some of the Properties by Location pages and notice how narrow the text is on the left portion of the page)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto www.jgbproperties.com in IE and see that it looks fine.
2. Goto same webpage in firefox and positioning is off.

Actual Results:  
Oddly placed spacing between some of the table rows and right/left table alignment.

Expected Results:  
View in IE to see expected look.
