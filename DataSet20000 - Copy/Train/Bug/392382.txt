switching between alpha trunk and fox2.0.0.* causes compatible addons to be marked incompatible

Many addons are compatible with later versions (read: alpha) of firefox, but the developer may not yet have included that in the install.rdf, or may have not updated the install.rdf, etc.  When you switch between trunks, ie from alpha 8 to 2.0.0.6, there is a forced compatibility check, but it must not actually be checking local data (ie modified install.rdf files) because it marks extensions incompatible which I have modified to be compatible.  This can be fixed by reinstalling the addons, but is certainly an irritating bug when switching between an alpha release and a public release.  (All extensions of course work fine on the public release compatibility check, but when I go back to testing the alpha, all are marked incompatible)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run Gran Paradiso Alpha 8, quit.
2.Run Firefox 2.0.0.*, quit
3.Run Gran Paradiso Alpha 8.
Actual Results:  
All extensions that are not listed by their author as being compatible are marked incompatible, even if their install.rdf files have been manually modified (because the extension actually DOES work)

Expected Results:  
Gran Paradiso Alpha 8 should have checked the local install.rdf information to determine compatibility.

Let me know if anyone needs clarification, its a simple enough problem, but I may not have explained it well.  marinebio72 AT comcast D0T net
