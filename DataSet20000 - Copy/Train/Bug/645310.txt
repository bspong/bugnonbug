Firefox 4.0 for Mac uses up a lot of memory

I've recently upgraded Firefox to version 4.0 from 3.6.16. Now I'm experiencing a lot of lagging and memory are constantly being used up. I've checked the Activity Monitor (Mac Application) and Firefox is using at least 875MB of memory when I have 3 tabs open and they are Facebook.com, Stackoverflow.com and localhost phpMyAdmin. When I close to 1 tab remaining, the memory ranges from 860MB to 890MB.

Sometimes Firefox hangs when I open a new tab or close a tab. Other applications will start to lag due to Firefox. I cannot open windows effectively. If I close Firefox I experience no lag from other applications.

Should I downgrade to 3.6.16? I certainly have no problems having memory constantly being used up when running 3.6.16.

I have a white MacBook with 2GB memory, almost half of the memory gets used up by Firefox!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Normal browsing Google, Facebook, etc...
2. As you will see the memory will be used up to at least 850MB+
Actual Results:
