Everything on craigslist.org seems fine. as soon as i enter a search query and get the results, all uppercase letters, numbers, and lowercase 'g' are rendered in a different font. i get the same result on pages that appear to have no stylesheet or font attribute attached i.e. "you are now being redirected >>>"

All item descriptions on ebay appear to do the same thing if there is no style or font attribute attached.
