can't post comments nor see them after added from another browser on YouTube with or without add-ons
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; rv:35.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/35.0
Build ID: 20141008065430

Steps to reproduce:

At first, due to photophobia issues, I've installed Stylish in order to have darker pages and suchlike. Other plugins installed were the Flash Control, YouTube Downloader, Lightbeam, Evernote Web Clipper and Adblock, Adblock pop-up add-on and Adblock Edge. When trying to post comments on YouTube, a page quickly popped up and then disappeared. Turned off Adblock add-ons, Flash Control, YouTube Downloader, Lightbeam, Evernote Clipper and finally Stylish, respectively in order to see if it would work.


Actual results:

Still can't post nor see the posted comments from another browser (Internet Explorer) on Youtube. At first I thought it was an issue with the add-ons, which is why I've turned them off in that exact respective order as mentioned. I do have a static IP, no Anti-Virus (Windows 8 single Language; use only Windows Defender; have a trial of Kaspersky Pure 2013 installed but do not use it except for a few check ups from time to time - it is disabled). Do have Quicktime, Intel Identity Protection (disabled), ShockWave Flash, Java Platform, NVIDIA 3D Vision (disabled) and OpenH264 Video Codec provided by Cisco Systems (came with Nightly; didn't have it before)


Expected results:

YouTube should function properly, allowing me to post comments and see them when posted from another browser.
