Add support for industry-standard safe search
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; Trident/7.0; Touch; .NET4.0E; .NET4.0C; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Tablet PC 2.0; MS-RTC LM 8; InfoPath.3; rv:11.0) like Gecko

Steps to reproduce:

1. Install a family safety product 
2. Turn on 'safe search' in your family safety product
3. Use Firefox to go to the Google search site
4. Perform search



Actual results:

Search engine does not perform a safe search.
This same problem exists with other Search sites when HTTPS is in use.
Read more below to understand why this is a browser issue.



Expected results:

Prior to implementing HTTPS-by-default, family safety products were able to add a query parameter to the search URL to tell Google to turn on safe search for this user. When they did this, Google would perform a search with "safe search" enabled to protect the user from offensive content. This is commonly used to protect kids from harmful content, but is also used by adults. 
   With HTTPS enabled by default, it is no longer possible to append a safe search URL parameter because the URL string is encrypted. Thus, an industry standard has been proposed whereby browsers will insert a "Prefer: safe" HTTP header when they send requests to web servers. If the Web Site receiving this request implements a search capability, it will perform that search using a safe-search setting. I work at Microsoft. I'd like to talk to the Firefox team about implementing this industry-standard approach.
