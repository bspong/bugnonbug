Installer should remove leftover chrome.manifest (on Windows) Startup (crash at pave-over upgrade of Firefox 31 with unpacked omni.ja)
Reproducible with:
Firefox 32.0.2 - BuildID: 20140917194002
Firefox 33 Beta 5 - BuildID: 20140918174809
Latest Firefox 34 Aurora - BuildID: 20140922004004
Latest Firefox 35 Nightly - BuildID: 20140922030204

Environment: Windows 7 x64

Steps to reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 31 cleanly in a new empty folder.
2. In the installation folder rename omni.ja to omni.zip.
3. Using Windows Explorer extract all contents of omni.zip to the installation folder.
4. Rename omni.zip back to omni.ja.
5. Download one of the affected builds (32.0.2, 33, 34, 35) and choose to install it at the same location where 31 is, thus performing a pave-over upgrade.
6. When upgrade completes, choose to launch Firefox.

Expected results: 
Firefox starts correctly without any issues.

Actual results:
Firefox crashes on startup with two different signature:
a) 32.0.2 & 33 Beta 5 - [@ nsFrame::BoxReflow(nsBoxLayoutState&, nsPresContext*, nsHTMLReflowMetrics&, nsRenderingContext*, int, int, int, int, bool)] (same as in bug 1063052)
b) 34 & 35 - [@ mozalloc_abort(char const* const) | NS_DebugBreak | ErrorLoadingBuiltinSheet ] - see bp-25124030-ba65-4bf1-9829-086a42140922 (https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/bp-25124030-ba65-4bf1-9829-086a42140922)

Notes:
- this issue is a follow up on bug 1063052 (startup crash in installations with unpacked omni.ja). Prior to this fix all branches were crashing with nsFrame::BoxReflow.
