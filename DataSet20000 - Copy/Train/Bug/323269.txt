Mouse moves on its own when dragging window or resizing

I am unsure on how to generate this error (last time it happened I was on world of warcraft forums).  I should also note that I often leave firefox running for weeks at a time and have many windows and tabs open.  I don't know if that is related to the errors, but I have included it anyways.

When this error occurs trying to resize the window by clicking on the edge will cause the mouse to move constantly and smoothly (1 pixle at a time) to the left immediately after the click.  When trying to move the window by dragging it with the top bar; after the mouse is moved it will intermittantly (2-3 times per second) jerk about 10-20 pixles to the left.  When it reaches the end it will jump back to where it started and begin again.  Both of these errors will continue to happen while the left mouse button is held down.  While these errors are occuring the program responds as if the user was making these inputs (ie, the window will move or resize).  Once the error occurs it will firefox will continue to operate in that fassion until it is completly closed (not just the window, and the problem will affect all windows).

note: the program still does respond to user input, so if you move the mouse fast enough, you can get the window to resize or move to the right.
