Firefox down loads large PDF (33MB, approx 1min). If file is explicitly saved to
disk Acrobat 5.05 24/09/2001 can open it ok. Unix diff says file down loaded from URL is bitwise perfect. Indeed Firefox/Acrobat can read back file and display it ok if firefox File|Open file is used to read disk file. However if firefox is asked to display PDF it calls acroread 5.05 24/09/2001 which produces caution box saying 'The file is damaged and could not be repaired'.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. point firefox to http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/W.Langdon/ftp/papers/csrp-98-10.pdf
2. wait for download to finish (33MB)
3. acroread gives blank screen inside firefox window and acroread caution box pops up saying 'The file is damaged and could not be repaired'.

I have tried this three times and the error occured each time.
I do not think the file has been corrupted by crossing the network.
One time firefox got stuck in a cpu hungry loop and I aborted it using the windowsNT task manager.


Expected Results:  
Display first page of scanned document.

The acroread caution box seems to be generic rather than specific to firefox
but I have not found anything useful about why it gets triggered (other than s/w other than firefox also produces it).

NB work around is to save PDF to disk and then read it back.
Either using firefox or standalone acroread.
