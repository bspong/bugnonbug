Part of test/browser_dbg_multiple-windows.js seems to be disabled
If you look at a log after bug 876277 landed, the log for this test looks like this:

Conspicuously missing is any mention of "Tab1 should be gone." or "The original tab is selected."

I assume this happens because the test got rejiggered like so:

      .then(testRemoveTab)
      .then(closeConnection)
      .then(finish)

but testRemoveTab kicks off a new async operation (listTabs)... but nothing now waits for this operation to complete.  I assume it should return a promise that's resolved when the operation completes?
