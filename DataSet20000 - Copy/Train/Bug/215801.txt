Style sheet selctor does not display if there is no stylesheet with a title.

If a web page loads a stylesheet, but does not specify a title as in:

 <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css" type="text/css" media="screen">

Then it is not possible via Firebird to render the page ignoring the style
sheet.  This is becuase the status bar style selector does not appear in this
case. The extension StyleSelector did not have this limitation (although the
taskbar item was grayed out in this case it did allow style sheet changes).

When you load the page http://www.raytheon.com/newsroom/  which has the above
stylesheet reference the problem exhibits itself.  If you load the page
http://www.raytheon.com/  which uses the exact same stylesheet, but I changed
the reference to:

 <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" type="text/css" media="screen"
title="main">

the stylesheet selector icon is displayed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the page http://www.raytheon.com/newsroom/
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
The style sheet icon does not appear on the status bar

Expected Results:  
Displayed the style sheet icon
