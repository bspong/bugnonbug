PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
when using Firefox and Tabbed Browsing to search for Images using Google images and after playing YouTube videos, Firefox consumes GIGABYTES of memory, slows down, and wont terminate. i have to kill the process before i can restart Firefox. when terminating, either Firefox or Plugin Container will crash.

PROPOSED SOLUTION
prevent Memory Leaks and work with Adobe to fix bugs and Memory Leaks


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use tabbed browsing.
2. Search for images using Google Images.
3. Search in YouTube and play some YouTube videos.

Actual Results:

* slowly, it slows down
* try to close Firefox
* run Task Manager
* see the memory consumed by Firefox and Plugin Container.
* i dont see a Crash Report by Firefox, i only see errors reported by Windows.



Expected Results:  
* Browser should not consume too much memory.
* Browser should warn on too much memory usage.
* On termination, memory should be released quickly.
* Browser should have strict guidelines for plugins and apps to avoid mem leaks
* Browser should monitor correctly its own behaviour and send crash reports


* Don't crash.
* Report your own problems.
* Run some monitor for BAD BEHAVIOUR in YOUR OWN space.
* Behave correctly and never do anything wrong in the first place.
* do not tolerate wrong behaviour.
