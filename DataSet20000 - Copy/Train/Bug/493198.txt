Firefox can not be bound to multiple Windows Desktop Objects (virtual desktops)

Virtual desktops in windows (in XP and vista, from what I understand) are managed using "Windows Desktop Objects". 
See http://www.codeproject.com/KB/system/VirtualDesktop.aspx for more information. 

On my virtual windows XP (hosted from a Windows Terminal Server) machine, I have the following problem: 

When I try to open a new instance of Firefox in a second desktop (after having already opened Firefox in one desktop), Firefox reports that is is active, but not responding, and that I need to restart Firefox. 



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0. Install the Virtual Desktop Manager (http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/Downloads/powertoys/Xppowertoys.mspx)
1. Open Firefox on one desktop
2. Switch to another desktop
3. Try to open Firefox on that desktop. 
Actual Results:  
An error message that firefox is already active, but not responding and must be restarted. The firefox on the first desktop does not have any problems. 

Expected Results:  
Another instance of firefox should be opened.
