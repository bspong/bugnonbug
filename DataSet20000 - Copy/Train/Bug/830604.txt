ability to import/export settings, tabs, tab history, cookies as XML file
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:18.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/18.0
Build ID: 20130104151925

Steps to reproduce:

every month, a support technician recommends I create a new firefox profile.
things should not be this bad.
at least to be nice to the user, provide a way to import and export their precious settings,tabs, and tab history, and cookies to an XML file. this way, they can re-import when doing  firefox -p and it won't be so "painful" and full of data loss.
there is an existing partially-related feature-request here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=218245


Actual results:

every time I do "create new profile" with firefox -p, I lose my settings, tabs, tab history, cookies. at least I can backup and restore my bookmarks, but everything else is lost.
please go a big step further. thanks.



Expected results:

firefox should allow import/export of settings, tabs, tab history, cookies. I realize there are individual plugins for stuff like this, but some of them are "request donation" and I can't spend anything on that kind of stuff right now. also, it would be VERY nice if all of this were built into the menu. Not everybody knows where these plugins are or that they exist. unless you are prepared to provide support to a lot of people telling them where the plugins are,maybe this is the best way.
