After exiting sleep mode, Firefox always ask for saving again two files which were already downloaded in the past (always the two same files).

These two files are pdf that were downloaded a few weeks ago on a scientific journal web site. Now, every time Firefox restarts or the computer comes out of sleep, Firefox opens the save file window and ask me where to save the two files. Pushing cancel puts an empty file name with the extension .part in my download directory...

Reproducible: Always

1a. Exit from sleep mode.

or

1b. Restart Firefox.
