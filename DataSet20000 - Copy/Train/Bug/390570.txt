Live feeds display article dates instead of titles (in debug build only)
With recent trunk builds of firefox, all of my live feeds display article dates instead of article titles. When I click on a live feed bookmark to display an article list, the list is just a series of dates with no article titles.

I subscribe to about 25 live feeds in all, including slashdot's main feed (see the sample URL) and planet mozilla. I have a FF build from July 8, 2007 which works correctly; live feeds display article titles. When I shut down this build of FF and start a newer one (e.g. from July 28) my live feeds initially display article titles, but after a couple of minutes--presumably after the feed is reloaded--the article list switches to showing dates. When I switch back to my July 8 build, it displays article dates until the feeds are reloaded, then switches back to titles.

I also produced this with a new profile. Using the July 28 build, I created a new profile and waited for the "latest headlines" live feed to load. All entries in the menu were dates instead of titles. 

My July 28 build is a debug build, and it prints many copies of the following message which may be relevant:
