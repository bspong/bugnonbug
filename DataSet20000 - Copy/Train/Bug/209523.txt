clicking button "Close" in print-preview results in normal browser view of page but with toolbar of print-preview instead of main menus/toolbars [using German build: Close-button is called Schlieﬂen]

Im using a German build of Firebird 0.6, and this is reproduceable with every
web page:

When I open a print-preview (German: Druckvorschau) of any page, and then click
the "Close"-button (German: Schlieﬂen), I get back to the normal browser view of
that page. But instead of also getting back the normal menus and toolbars of the
browser, (only) the print-preview buttons stay on top of that page. So it&#180;s
impossible to enter a new URL or click the back button, etc.

When I click the upper right window-corner (close-X) instead of the
"Close"-button, everything works fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View any page.
2. Switch to print-preview.
3. Switch back to normal browser view by clicking "Close"-button.
(German build: "Schlieﬂen")
Actual Results:  
The browser is back in normal view of the page, but still shows the buttons of
print-preview instead of its normal menus and toolbars.

Expected Results:  
Switch back to normal menus and toolbars, like it does when closing by clicking
the upper right window-corner.

This leads to a need to completely quit and reload Firewords.
