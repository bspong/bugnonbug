Navigating back loads some pages twice, removing the forward history item

When I navigate back to some pages using the Go Back button, such as the URL above, the page is reloaded twice, the second time adding ann additional duplicate item to the history. This clears the forward history, so it removes the history item from the page where I was moving back from. I checked this also in the latest nightly build (sep 3). It does not happen with versions before the 2.0 beta. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the URL above
2. Click a link to some article
3. Press the Back button

Actual Results:  
The URL above is reloaded twice. After that, the Forward button is grayed out and the menu of the Back button shows the site for the URL above ,even though it is the current site. 

Expected Results:  
The URL should just be reloaded twice. The forward history should not be erased, so it should show the article I moved back from. The backward history should show no sites, or perhaps sites I visited _before_ the site I moved back to. 

This might be related to the meta tags (expires = 0 and pragma = no-cache)
