browser stalls when I try to move a window, moving windows doesn't work

If I try to move a window by grabbing the titlebar, everything stalls for a long time (or indefinitely). If I alt-tab to pick a different FF window and then switch back, it goes back to normal. The mouse cursor can't even move to the taskbar or select other windows/programs. I can see a slightly grayed outline for the window I try to move until I do the alt-tab adjustment.

If I try to use the window move menu item it stalls to the point I can't access anything and even the alt-tab trick doesn't work, I have to wait it out.

If I use the lower right hand resize corner, I can drag a new size, but if I try to move from the left side, it does the same stall as if moving the window.

It happened with RC1, then I upgraded to RC2 and nothing is different, WRT this issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Attempt to move a window
Actual Results:  
Programs stall/don't respond.

Expected Results:  
It should have move the window to my new chosen location
