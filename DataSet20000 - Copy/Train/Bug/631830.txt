Ive spent the past two weeks trying to determine what was the cause of drop frames and stuttering in FF4. I've

-tried every video format, flv, mp4, webm, theora, lagarith, uncompressed, various mov formats, and apng.
-tried all the players i could get FF to recognize, flash, VLC, <video>.
-tested each combination with hardware acceleration on/off. I get 64fps with it on (23off), but video is just as bad regardless.
-uninstalled and cleaned driver/codec remnants and reinstalled latest.

Ive tested mostly on 720p/24fps material (except for flv which requires 30fps) on my system:

Win7x64 on OCZ vertex SSD
Corei7 920
12GB Ram
4drive raid10 media drive (200MB/s read)
9600GT

Ive also been testing this on another system (gets 46FPS on hardware acceleration test):
Win7x86
Core2 w/onchip intel HD graphics
4GB RAM
Seagate 500GB (100MB/s read)

Playback performance is identical. Drop frames are difficult to detect for most people unless the video drops so many frames as to stagger, but it best seen when viewing fluid motion or stroboscopic material (the pattern will change frequency like spokes do when a bike wheel changes velocity). One method ive found to cause the footage to basically freeze is to click on the tab bar (but not on the tab) while it is playing. Oddly enough HD youtube footage plays fine and doesnt exhibit these problems, yet VLC, <video>, and the default dreamweaver flash player all do. My guess is that google leveraged its vast resources to make their player work around FF's faults, but as for the rest of us, we're SOL. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Play video
2.Repeat
3.Become frustrated at how terrible FF has become.
