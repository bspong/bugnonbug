Requesting UPS Tracking Number Status Update Fails.
I completed your normal Bug Report, and tried to "Submit" it, which failed (Did Nothing), so I am trying this, unless this is BROKE TOO?

Requesting UPS Tracking Number Status Update Fails.
1.
I bring up a UPS Tracking number (1Z74W0A60146303067) screen, then click on "Request Status Updates". (Firefox Ver: 38.0.1, which my updater say is current?, as well as previous versions.)
 
This screen (When it is not going to work) appears like an IBM "Line Drawing", rather than the usual "Graphics" screen.
 
When I enter the required data (E-Mail twice, My name once, plus boxes for current status, exceptions, and Delivery), and then click on "Done", nothing happens, I remain on that screen, and no updates are generated?
2.
Basically, "Nothing".
 
I have experienced this problem, on several occasions, and reported it to UPS, who really never could tell me that they fixed it, although it didn't happen with all UPS Tracking Numbers, and it "Went Away" all by itself, after a while?
3.
I should have been transferred to the screen telling me I am done, and will receive the updates.
 
When the UPS trouble Shooter asked me to try the same thing with another browser, it worked correctly when using IE-11 (Ver: 11.0.9600.17801)?
