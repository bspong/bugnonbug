Thunderbird to Firefox IPC goes via X11 screen instead of via user (with multimonitor config)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070725 Firefox/2.0.0.6
Build Identifier: version 2.0.0.5 (20070716)

If X-Windows is configured to treat each monitor as a different "screen" in a multi-monitor setup, Thunderbird can't communicate with Firefox if they're running on different screens, even if they're running on the same PC as the same user.

If Firefox is loaded on DISPLAY=:0.0 and Thunderbird is loaded on DISPLAY=:0.1, then clicking on a URL in an e-mail message will try to load Firefox on screen 0.1, but because it's already running on 0.0 a message pops up saying "Firefox is already running, but is not responding."

If another user runs Firefox on the same display as Thunderbird, then when User-A clicks a link in User-A's Thunderbird, the page opens in User-B's copy of Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Load Firefox on one display (export DISPLAY=somehost:x.y ; firefox)

2. On the same computer, load Thunderbird on another display (it shouldn't matter whether it's a local screen or a remote X11 display on another PC.)

3. ps -A | egrep 'firefox|thunderbird' should verify that both programs are running on the same PC as the same user

4. Click on a link in Thunderbird, and it won't open in Firefox

Actual Results:  
A message pops up: "Firefox is already running, but is not responding...etc"

Expected Results:  
The link should open in Firefox, as it does when Firefox and Thunderbird are running on the same screen.
