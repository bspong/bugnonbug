de-hibernation infinite loop of firefox, mozilla, netscape
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7

Problem applies to:
- XP-home & XP professional
- Firefox (all versions), Mozilla & Netscape 7.2 and earlier
- IBM, Fujitsu, Dell, HP, etc. machines
When one of these browsers (or a combination of them) is used when one stops the machine via hibernation then one has a fair chance that they enter infinite loops when the machine is de-hibernated.  If so they will consume all cpu cycles and on older machines it may take upto 15 minutes before the user gets control back of the machine - obviously then squashing the run away processes in the Task Manager.

Reproducible: Sometimes



Expected Results:  
Perhaps the browser processes are not always stopped properly; perhaps their saved info gets damaged by MS; perhaps they recover erroneously.  Who knows?
Perhaps it is caused by defective disclosure by MS about hibernation.
And if one is paranoid enough this could be deliberate ....

I have reported this problems >>>for years<<< to different vendors, but they do not want to deal with it.  They are only willing to deal with IE problems  ....
