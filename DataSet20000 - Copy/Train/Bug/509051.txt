Inline SVG and MathML in a document with <!DOCTYPE html> should work in Firefox 3.5.x according to several sources on the web. If not by default than at least after "html5.enable" option is set to true in about:config.
It didn't work by default for me so I've tried to find that option in about:config and it's missing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Put basic inline SVG in your html5 document. E.g.: <svg><circle r="50" cx="50" cy="50" fill="green"/></svg>
2. Look for a green circle.
3. Do you see one?
4. If not, try to enable html5 parser in about:config. It should be the "html5.enable" option
5. Option not found.
Actual Results:  
* No green circle.
* No html5.enable option in about.config.

Expected Results:  
* Little green circle.
* html5.enable option in about.config

This is where I found it should work: http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-parsing/#postcomment
