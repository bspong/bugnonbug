Flash is set to be started by user but won't play when triggered
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)

The URL above is actually a page set (a page with an embedded flash file and an 
embedded IFRAME) that normally comes up in a pop-up window from a link on the 
page http://www.muckmusic.com/songs.htm.

The embedded Flash file is an audio MP3 file. It is set to trigger when 
the "play" button is clicked but the file doesn't play. It works in multiple 
versions of IE and in Netscape v 4.6 and up.

The flash file has been created and embedded exactly according to instructions 
on the Macromedia web site.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to page
2. Click play
3. 

Actual Results:  
No sound

Expected Results:  
Audio should play

I have noticed other bug information on the site about embedded Flash files not 
working but I haven't had any problems with other Flash files that are auto-
start, they all seem to play appropriately. A report on the site suggested 
upgrading to Firefox v1.0rc1 (I was running v1.0pr1), which I did to no avail. 
Have tried upgrading the Flash player as well. File is set to play in Flash v6 
plugin.

There is another embedded Flash file at http://www.muckmusic.com/moses.htm that 
is set to autostart and it works fine so it would appear that Firefox isn't 
responding to the Javascript start button but I'm not totally sure.
