selectItems in Places no longer selects items within Toolbar or Sidebar folders

Steps to reproduce:

This is a regression in an API call which cannot be invoked directly through the GUI, introduced in FF-34.

1. Create a bookmark folder in the toolbar (unfortunately UI has no easy way to get the ID).
2. Open the Places organizer (aka 'Library'), and select 'All Bookmarks' (just to ensure target is not selected).
3. From the `places` tree object, invoke `selectItems([id])` with the id of the folder created in step 1

I am in the process of creating a test which demonstrate the issue, to be attached to this bug.



Actual results:

Nothing: the selectItems(...) method returns without selecting the target folder.


Expected results:

The folder created in step 1 should have been selected in the tree of the Places view.

The regression, introduced with the intent of avoiding infinite loops while traversing a bookmark tree (i.e. shortcuts to a parent), inadvertently broke the ability to select bookmarks by ID starting at the root of the Places Tree.

The Places tree has 'All Bookmarks' contains shortcuts to 'Bookmarks Toolbar' and 'Bookmarks Menu', neither of which are traversed.

Note that even if traversal is started from one of the top level folders (i.e. 'Toolbar Folder', or 'Bookmarks Menu'), the issue can occur if a shortcut points to a sub-tree of the other top level folder.
