debug webapps running in desktop webapp runtime
Now that the debugger is remotable, we should make it possible to debug webapps running in the desktop webapp runtime.

I'm not sure how much knowledge of the runtime the eventual owner of this bug will need to implement the functionality; here's a general overview:

The runtime, like Firefox, is a GRE/XUL application.  It gets built and packaged with Firefox on Windows/Mac/Linux as the webapprt-stub[.exe] executable in the Firefox installation directory and the webapprt/ subdirectory of the Firefox installation directory.

Firefox makes a copy of the stub for each webapp it installs, but all copies share the webapprt/ subdirectory, which contains the runtime-specific code (chrome/, components/, modules/, the application INI file, which is called webapprt.ini due to bug 747394, etc.).  The runtime also has access to GRE code, including all code in toolkit/ that is built/packaged with Firefox.

The runtime's XUL code is minimal and stored in the webapprt/content/ source directory.  Starting a webapp opens a single window with one <browser> element in which the webapp's primary launch URL is loaded.

Webapps may open multiple windows via the standard mechanisms (<a target="something">, window.openWindow), each of which contains one <browser> element.  The runtime does not support tabs, so there is never more than one <browser> element per window.
