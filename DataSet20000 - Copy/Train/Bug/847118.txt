A broken image, blank for the lenght of the window height

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:19.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/19.0

Steps to reproduce:

I like to read webcomics so I collect the ones I like more in a folder in the bookmark bar. I usually hit the "Open all in tabs" and let all the websites load in the background. This is something that caused no problem until version < 18.

Tested only on OS X 10.6.8.


Actual results:

Completely randomly, some images of the webcomics are left unloaded, blank space. Then if I scroll down and then up, the image appears; if there is too little space to scroll I select all and the image appears. Sometimes the image is blank for the whole height of the page and when I scroll down the remaining portion appears (and when I scroll up, the full image appears).
The image is restored not only when I scroll, but also when I leave Firefox window and select another open application (this has given me some fun times in taking the screenshot too).

Needless to say I tried this with my add-ons enabled and disabled, with the same result.


Expected results:

If I load each website one by one no problem appears. However this is what should have happened when loading multiple tabs (and what happened until version < 18).
