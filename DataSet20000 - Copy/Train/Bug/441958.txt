User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9b5) Gecko/2008032620 Firefox/3.0b5

The browsing history stored for the down arrow to the right of the address cannot be cleared and is not cleared when clearing private data.  The information of past web sites visited remains even though you clear private data, check all options under settings for clearing private data, and even when you select to clear private data on exit.  This is true for both Firefox 3 beta 5 and the newly released Firefox 3.0.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to tools, options, privacy tab, settings and select to clear all privacy items when asking to clear private data
2.Clear private data.
3.Left click on the down arrow to the right of the address in the address bar.
Actual Results:  
Past web sites visited are displayed.

Expected Results:  
No sites displayed.  History should have been cleared when clearing private data.

I reported this bug about a month ago for 3.0 beta 5.0 and I cannot find the report listed.  The bug now shows up in the newly released 3.0 version that I just downloaded.
