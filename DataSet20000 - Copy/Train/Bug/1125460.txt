Problems E-Mails Issue 2: Links on E-mail alerts cause problem on web page

Steps to reproduce:

I am filing two different bugs because of issues with E-mail Alerts from Mozilla Support.
Good day, all. I have a very strange problem with alert e-mails from Mozilla Support. At the bottom of the message is the 'Post Reply' button. I press the button, and the page opens. But while the page looks normal, it does not work properly.

When I press the 'More System Details' button, the 'Common Responses' button, or the 'Post A Reply / Quote' button, the web page re-loads.

I wish to point out, this only happens if the support page is opened using the link in the e-mail alert. When the same page is opened any other way, there is no problem.


I first asked about the issue here:

Actual results:

I started doing some testing, and discovered that the web-links are not working, or displaying normally.

Here is what I found.   Web=normal link.
