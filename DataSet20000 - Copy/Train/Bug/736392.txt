Description of issue: Flash install did not work properly in firefox 11

Steps taken to get issue:

1. Went to http://www.mozilla.org to install Firefox 11 beta
2. After basic install without importing favories went to www.cnn.com
3. Went to sports section of cnn at http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/?xid=cnnav
4. Unable to view one part of rotating stories, clicked on link provided to install Flash
5. Installed adobe flash from http://www.adobe.com, closed browser to complete install
6. Re-opened Firefox and went back to CNN's website and back to sports section without using 
restore last session
7. Looked at same rotating stories, first story still required flash to be installed
8. After host OS rebooted in middle of night, came back and resumed VM, after Windows reboot, Flash is now working properly


Actual results:

Flash did not install properly.  After reboot of Firefox, flash should have been working immediately, not after system reboot.  Verified install of Firefox 11 is x86 and install of flash was x64 and was auto-detected by adobe's site.


Expected results:

Firefox should have been properly displaying flash images after install of flash and reboot of Firefox.  It did not and a system reboot fixed the issue.  First time I have seen flash not install properly.  I have installed it on many Windows 
7 images with Firefox versions 4 - 10 and have never had to reboot to get flash to work.  Same 
thing goes for IE.
