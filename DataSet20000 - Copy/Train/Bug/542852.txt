Summary: New 3.6 issue - Product problems

Comments: 
Your latest issue of your Firefox browser 3.6 has some serious problems.

When trying to access various sites to log-in, such as AT&T email,
Gmail, Facebook, MySpace, etc., the browser rests to a blank log-in window.

When attempting to make changes on a site, such as updating information,
etc., the browser resets everything back to the original information, or
goes to a blank window.

There is no longer any "Properties" selection on the File menu.  This
selection is also missing when 'right clicking' on any object to check
the properties.

We have tried several themes, including your default and all of these
same problems occur regardless.

These issues must be corrected as soon as possible or we will be forced
to uninstall Firefox from all of our systems.

Thank you.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Any attempt to log-in to a site
2.Any attempt to change information
3.No "Properties" selection
Actual Results:  
Reverts back to blank or original unchanged state

Expected Results:  
Log-in
Change information
Read "Properties"

We reverted back to the previous issue of Firefox - 3.5, and the problems have gone away.

We conclude that all of these problems are as a result of changes made in your 3.6 version.
