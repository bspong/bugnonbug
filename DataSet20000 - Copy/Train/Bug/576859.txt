selection loses sync with the last loaded page when opening links from search results in history

When loading links from search results in history sidebar or in library, the selection doesn't stay in sync with the last loaded item when the list of search results is repopulated. This leads to a weird effect in history sidebar, that the selection moves to the next item in the list couple of seconds after a link from search results was loaded. When the last item in the list is clicked, the selection goes one item back. Sorting doesn't matter.

This behavior was introduced between 2010-06-04 and 2010-06-08. Maybe related to Bug 549192?


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.mozilla.org/
2. go to http://planet.mozilla.org/
3. go to https://wiki.mozilla.org/
4. open history sidebar, search for "mozilla"
5. click the link to http://www.mozilla.org/ in the sidebar
6. click the last link in the list

Actual Results:  
Directly after Step 5 the item "Mozilla.org - Home of the Mozilla Project" is selected in the history sidebar. Few seconds (3-4) later the selection moves to the next item in the list.

The behavior after Step 6 is similar to Step 5 except of the selection moving to the previous in the display order item.


Expected Results:  
The selection in the history sidebar after Step 5 stays at "Mozilla.org - Home of the Mozilla Project" and after Step 6 at the last item in the list as long as no other page is loaded or until moved by user.


The library behaves visually slightly different as the search results are automatically refreshed but the selection stays at it's position.
