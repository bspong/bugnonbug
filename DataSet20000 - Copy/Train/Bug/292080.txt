Problem with page built using Yahoo Sitebuilder

On the home page of www.classypartyfavors you will see a grouping of pictures.
When you click on the picture, it takes you to a product page with order
capability. Some product pages work just fine and appear with the "order" button
active, but a selection of product pages don't. 

Example: First picture of "love" coaster - when you click on the picture, the
product page comes up fine, but the order button is not active.

Next picture to the right: This one works.

I can't find a pattern for what product pages work and what ones don't, except
that ALL of my products that have a color option don't work. To see an example,
click on the 3rd picture down in the left hand column (rose ball candle).

By the way, when you open my site in IE, all product pages work.

This site was launched using Yahoo Sitebuilder. All product information is
linked to the catalog in my Yahoo Store.
