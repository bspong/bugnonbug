drag and drop from location bar to another application includes extraneous characters at end

When you drag and drop URL's from the location bar to a new mail message being
created in Eudora 6.2 the result includes extraneous extra characters after the
URL.  Here are a couple of examples of the incorrect results produced:
http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1630837,00.asp p">
http://my.yahoo.com/ >

These URL's should have produced:
http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1630837,00.asp
http://my.yahoo.com/

When I use Internet Explorer 6 or Netscape 4.78 with Eudora I always get the
correct results.  Funny thing is that when I perform the same test between
Firefox and MS Word 97 I always get the correct results too.

Therefore I can only produce the incorrect results between Firefox and Eudora
which might indicate that it is a Eudora problem yet when I use the other
browsers with Eudora there is no problem which indicates that it is a Firefox
problem.  Why does the drag and drop work correctly with MS Word but not Eudora?
