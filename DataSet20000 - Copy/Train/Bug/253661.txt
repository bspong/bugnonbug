nine steps to better menus in Firefox
This may be partially covered by Firefox bug 243078 and browser bug 37694 but
this bug is to track Firefox improving the usability of menus by making style
and positioning adjustments. If we can do that by moving to nsITheme native
menus, great. If not, we'll need to see how much of this we can do in the
winstripe theme and minor XUL hacks. 

1. Sub-menus should be moved three pixels to the left and raised 4 pixels
vertically.
2. Main menu toolbar menu items need to have a blue highlight hover and click
style rather than the raised and depressed bevel button on highlight and click.
3. Menu border needs to be reduced to 1 pixel from the beveled 2 pixels.
4. Menu checkmark needs to be moved two pixels down and one pixel to the right.
5. Blue selection highlight for menu items needs to be moved down one pixel in
relation to the menu item label (or the label moved up within the highlight,
whichever you like.)
6. Topmost menu item in the menu needs to be raised 2 pixel vertically.
7. Padding below a menu item label and above a separator needs to be increased
by 2 pixels and the padding above a menu item label and a separator needs to be
increased 1 pixel.
8. The entire set of menu item labels need to be moved three pixels to the left.
9. Separators need to be at least two pixels wider, reducing the padding between
the ends of the separator and the right and left borders of the menu to 3 pixels.
