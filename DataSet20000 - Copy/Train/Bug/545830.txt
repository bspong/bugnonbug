This is a Request For Extension: 

I am using:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.2pre) Gecko/20100211 Namoroka/3.6.2pre


When a new Update is downloaded (fairly often) I am asked to re-start Firefox.

The Update's "Session Restore" should cache all (possible) pages for the re-start so that everything does not need to be re-downloaded again. 

The 'secure pages' and pages with passwords may need to be re-loaded but when I have many PDF files (sometimes many megabytes each) open in a few Tabs it is sad to see that they also need to be re-loaded.

It makes sense that since the Browser already has the Pages, and all their Data (assuming the page is completely loaded), that it should simply restart and present itself promptly without reloading Data that was valid only moments before.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Wait for an Update.
2. Choose to restart Namoroka.
3. Wait a long time for all your Tabs to re-load.
