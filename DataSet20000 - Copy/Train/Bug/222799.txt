Options dialog assumes white background/black text colours

The Firebird options panel inherits the default Windows colours for dialogs.
Usually these include white window backgrounds and black window text. For me,
these are dark blue backgrounds and white text. This is not a problem for most
things, but the selected and mouseover background colours for the sections are
light, and they do *not* force the text to be black, so the selected/mouseover'd
section text is barely readable. Similarly, the selected group of options in the
right panel has a light yellow background, and does not force black text, thus
causing the options to be unreadable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set system colours to white text/dark background (either manually or using a
skin that has them)
2. Start Mozilla and go to the Options dialog
3. Expand an option on the right

Actual Results:  
The expanded options were not easily readable, and mousing over an item on the
left caused it to be unreadable.

Expected Results:  
If the options dialog is going to force a light background on some things, it
should stop assuming that the background is going to be white and that text is
going to be black and instead force these things as well (if you're forcing it,
at least force everything! ;-). Alternatively it could use a different *system*
colour to do so, but it should be careful and choose a colour that will never be
unreadable on another.
