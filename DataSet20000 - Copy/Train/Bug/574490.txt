Crash upon Flash load/object! FF v3.6.4

I click on a video to load (Zero Punctuation was the one that occurred for me this afternoon, however it happened when I tried RedVSBlue, as well as my news links for Engadget/Gizmodo).

I have made sure to have the latest FLASH version as well as FireFox before doing this report, I check these sites daily and only updated to v3.6.4 yesterday.

I also would like to note that it doesnt just crash a tab or that process, it kills firefox.exe ENTIRELY and DOES NOT bring up the crash reporter but does bring up the restore window upon relaunch of FireFox.

I will be downgrading to FireFox v3.6.3 after I have submitted this bug as its a "deal breaker" for me.



Still love firefox but latest update is a "showstopper".

Thanks! 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Browser (FireFox)
2. Go to Zero-Punctuation
3. Click on the "Click to play" button in the flash video
4. Crash!
