printing (preview, to file, to printer) does not work properly

Printing (previewing or paper printing or even file printing) does not work on
most of web pages I've tried.
Two cases:
 - no text appears, only frames and pictures. Perhaps a font problem?
(http://www.w3.org/)
 - text is present, but completly screwed up, with every characters overlapping
(http://www.emse.fr/~xserpagg/)

Moreover, on the last page, styles (cCSS) are not properly rendered (fixed
position header for example).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. http://www.w3.org/
2. File -> Print Preview
3. No text

4. http://www.emse.fr/~xserpagg/
5. File -> Print Preview
6. Text overlapping


Expected Results:  
- Correctly format the page so it is pretty printed!
- Replace fonts if they do not exist for printing.
- correctly handle CSS.

Moreover, what would be really great is that Firefox scale the pages (fonts,
pictures, ...) so the width of the display matches the width of the selected
paper type.

This happens with pages containing style (CSS) or not.
