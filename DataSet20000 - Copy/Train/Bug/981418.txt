CustomizableUI type:view and type:button widgets need an onBeforeCreated handler
This bug affects type:view widgets.

There appears to be an inherent race condition with view panel creation in the window listener of bootstrapped add-ons.

When new windows are opened add-on code in the window listener(s) and CustomizableUI code run independently. 

However, CustomizableUI needs a given view to exist before buildWidget is executed: http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-aurora/source/browser/components/customizableui/src/CustomizableUI.jsm#1125

This means that if add-on code that creates the relevant view is sufficiently delayed for any reason, CustomizableUI fails to create the widget with the following error:
console.error:
[CustomizableUI]
Could not find the view node with id: myapp-view, for widget: myapp-toolbar-button.

There is an onBuild handler intended for custom widgets only.
Specifying type:custom and rewriting type:view code in onBuild() is not an ideal solution for what I hope are obvious reasons.

It seems to me that this should be fixed at the platform level. Namely, there should be an onBeforeBuild handler (at http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-aurora/source/browser/components/customizableui/src/CustomizableUI.jsm#1075) to allow creating panelviews in time regardless of any circumstances.
