In some languages (e.g. French), typography rules demand that a space is
inserted between a word and a colon or a semi-colon. For instance, in English,
we write "Example: dadidooda"
whereas in French, we write "Exemple : dadidoooda".
The space between the word and the punctuation sign should be dealt with as a
non-breakable space.
However, when the colon occurs at the end of a line, the browser may wrongly
insert a carriage return between the word and the punctuation whereas it should
be inserted either before the word or after the punctuation.

Tricky !

Expected Results:  
As said before, the browser should cut the line either before the word or after
the punctuation but NOT between them.

This looks as if it was a tongue-dependent problem but it is not : in no
language written in Latin alphabet should a line be cut between a word and the
following punctuation sign.
