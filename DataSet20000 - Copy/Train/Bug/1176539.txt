Multiple Cycle Collection markers in waterfall
Check out the attachment in bug 1176537: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8625104

There are multiple CC markers stacked on top of each other, with slightly different times, as if a cascade of CC markers triggered. Looks like a CC marker bug, as if many markers can be spawned slightly cascading. It seems that each chunk is always the same type, so if this is the case, maybe we should filter it.
