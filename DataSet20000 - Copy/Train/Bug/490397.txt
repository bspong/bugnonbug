Opening file window cut off (doesn't display "Do this for this automatically for files like this from now on"

After installing Firefox 3.5 Beta 4, when Firefox reopened the download page for Firefox 3.5 Beta 4 opened again and I was asked to redownload the file. That's normal. What wasn't normal is that the Opening <file> window asking me whether I wanted to "save as" or "cancel" was truncated. The grey box that outlines the available options was cut off as it reached the bottom and the option to "do this automatically for files like this from now on" was also missing, obviously due to the fact it was in the area that was truncated. All was fine in Firefox 3.1 Beta 3. Testing other links (such as items at Microsoft Download Center) also produced this "cut off" opening window.

Closing Firefox 3.5 Beta 4 and opening Firefox 3.1 Beta 3 the Opening <file> dialog box was fine again. Going back to Firefox 3.5 Beta 5 produced the problem again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a website (using Firefox 3.5 Beta 4) that has executable (exe) files you can download
2. Click a link to download an exe
3. Observe the window that pops up asking you what to do with the file
Actual Results:  
An Opening <file> dialog box appeared with the options to 'save as' or 'cancel' but the option to 'do this automatically for files like this from now on' was cut off.

Expected Results:  
An Opening <file> dialog box should've appeared with the options to 'save as', 'cancel' or 'do this automatically for files like this from now on'.

Using the default Firefox theme
