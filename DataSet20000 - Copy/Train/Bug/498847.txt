ASP.NET LinkButtons Javascript running incorrectly

With the latest version of firefox, us and out clients have found that some LinkButtons have stopped working and are now throwing Javascript errors i.e. _dopostback is not defined.

On closer inspection we can see the Source code is correct (__doPostBack) yet Firefox tries to run (__dopostback), ONLY when the ASP.Net LinkButton is contained in a content page that has a MasterPage set. Why firefox is changing the case is not known.

LinkButtons on stand alone pages and on the masterpage work correctly, only on content pages Firefox runs javescript incorrectly.


(We have also tested this on other sites throughout the web)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click a ASP.NET LinkButton on any ASP.NET website that has a MasterPage.
Actual Results:  
Throws javascript error __dopostback is undefined

Expected Results:  
Page should post back and run server code.

LinkButtons (exact same code) still work on IE, Chrome and Safari.
