Gmail stops loading

In cases where a user logs in and out of multiple Gmail accounts, Firefox will likely load the first one or two gmail account pages without issues--not referring to pages within a single account. However, when logging into the third or fourth (or more) gmail account(s) subsequently, the page stops loading. Gmail HTML option or clearing the FireFox cache is the workaround. This is not limited to ver 3.5, but seems to only affect FireFox. This bug will also be reported to Google's Webmasters to correct the CSS.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into a Google Gmail account.
2. Log out and into additional Gmail accounts (possibly three or more). Two in my case.
3.
Actual Results:  
Browser states "Done" in status bar, but page remains blank. the only usable text on the page is Google's way of asking you to switch to HTML if the page does not load.

Expected Results:  
Gmail account pages should load normally.

It's possible FireFox has an issue with caching gmail accounts when shifting from one Gmail account to another?
