Session restore fails for mutliple windows and tabs (deadlock caused by SwitchProxy?)

I often have three browser windows with several tabs and Firefox/SessionManager usually fails to load the complete session. Two windows are loaded correctly, but the window in the middle of the Windows task bar is completely empty (white). It
does not even show the menu bar. I guess, there is some kind of deadlock
situation.

First, I thought it might be the session manager plug-in, then I discovered that session restore works sometimes if I disable the HTML validator plug-in. However, after further testing, this issue does not seem to be related to the two plug-ins at all as the deadlock(?) situation can be reproduced by even deactivating both plug-ins.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set the start-up option to "Show my windows and tabs from last time"
2. Open three browser windows, go to the http://www.apache.org/ website and open the projects from "HTTP server" to "Directory" in separate tabs of the first window, from "Excalibur" to "Labs" in separate tabs in the second window, and from "Lenya" to "Perl" in separate tabs of the third window.
3. Close Firefox and restart
Actual Results:  
After startup, one window is blank (interestingly, in my case it was always the one with the projects from "Excalibur" to "Labs") and does not even show the menu bar.

If the session is restored correctly, repeat step 3 of above.

Expected Results:  
After startup, all windows should be restored correctly.
