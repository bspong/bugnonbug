Yahoo mail account login stuck in loop from mismatched certificate
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.7) Gecko/20070914 Firefox/2.0.0.7

After I sign into my Yahoo account, and before the mail interface page loads,  Firefox gives me a message that says:

"You have attempted to establish a connection with "mail.yahoo.com" However the security certificate presented belongs to "login.yahoo.com". It is possible, though unlikely, that someone may be trying to intercept your communication with this website. If you suspect the certificate shown does not belong to "mail.yahoo.com", please cancel the connection and notify the administrator."

Viewing the certificate offers nothing and cancel is obvious.

If I choose "OK" it then gets stuck in a page load loop until it finally times out. Main mail interface page does not load.

I have cleared cache, cookies, everything and this did not solve the problem.

I have 2 other Yahoo mail accounts and they work fine.

Problem began after previous (not last) FF update.

Yahoo account works fine with IE 7.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.login to Yahho mail account
2.May or MAY NOT get certificate message
3.Page load loop. Main interface never page never loads.
Actual Results:  
Exception to above is that I do not always get the certificate message. All other actions the same.

Expected Results:  
Yahoo mail main interface page should download.
