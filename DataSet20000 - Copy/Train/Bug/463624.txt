Firefox hangs by switching between websites, for >30s and more.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; de; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; de; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

OK, when I open an website and switch to another website, Firefox 3.0.3 hangs for 30s till 1 min before the new site is shown. Sometimes Firefox shows an erromessage, that there are no connection. (but that is not true)
But when Firefox hangs and I open an new session of Firefox and load www.google.de, the first window of Firefox shows the right site instantly!
In Internetexplorer this error doesn't appear.
I think that Firefox have an problem with W-Lan, because the W-lan connection is not allways stable. If I load an website and during loading there is an short interrupt by W-lan connection, Firefox hangs and wait for an to long time bevor it do an second try.
It also can be an general error in Windows Vista (64bit) Networkarea.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a website with an Computer that goes by W-Lan into the Internet.
2. Switch as long between the sites as Firefox hangs (need to much Time to load) 
   during loading.
3. If Firefox hangs, start an new session of Firefox and load a new site.

Actual Results:  
The first opened windows of Firefox that hangs loading the website, now loading the Website instantly.
When the second session of Firefox begins to load the new site, the first session of Firefox loads the hanging site instantly. Without waiting time.


Expected Results:  
Firefox shold load every site instantly, if the site is aviable.
Independent from short W-lan connection breaks. <I think thats the reason.
