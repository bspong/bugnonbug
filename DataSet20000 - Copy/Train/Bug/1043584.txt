Enter/return key opens entries from drop down menu without pressing arrow keys first on FF 31+
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; Win64; x64; rv:34.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/34.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140724030201

Steps to reproduce:

step 1) use Firefox 31 or above
step 2) let auto fill and auto suggestions from bookmarks, etc. enabled or use a clean profile
step 3) type any address in the URL bar (e.g: mozilla.org)
step 4) move your mouse to the drop down menu with suggestions and move the cursor towards one entry of the list that differs at least slightly from mozilla.org, for example: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/firefox
step 5) press enter/return key while neither using arrow keys nor using left mouse button and while the cursor is still over a (slightly) different entry from the URL bar



Actual results:

Enter/return key opened the address in the drop down list, in this example:  
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/firefox

It behaved exactly like the extension "Enter Selects" (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/enter-selects/)




Expected results:

Enter/return key should have opened the address in the URL bar, in this example:
mozilla.org (redirected to https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/ for EN-US localizations)

from the official description (https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/awesome-bar-find-your-bookmarks-history-and-tabs):

"How to use the autocomplete list

Just start typing in the location bar and the autocomplete drop-down will show matching sites from your browsing history, as well as sites you've bookmarked or tagged. Matched terms are highlighted, making the list of results easy to scan. When you see the site you want, just click on it or use the up and down arrows on your keyboard to highlight it and then press EnterReturn. "

and 

"URL autocomplete

Firefox will also complete URLs of websites that you've been to before. For example, if you type "aw" Firefox may autocomplete "awesomefoundation.org" if you've visited that site in the past. Pressing EnterReturn in this case would take you directly to that address. "

To sum it up: enter/return doesn't open the address in the URL bar when the cursor is placed on a different entry from the drop down list of suggestions.
