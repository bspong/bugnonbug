The URL contains two lines of text in a TD cell, along with a select button. Clicking it calls a javascript function which turns on designMode, selects some text, and then turns designMode off. (This is not contrived because copying to the clipboard with execCommand will succeed only if designMode is on.) The visual selection does not correspond to the logical selection.

Since the visual highlight is updated when the window loses focus, calling blur() followed by focus() restores the highlight. This is done by the 'Select then blur and focus' button.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.blindrut.ca/tmp/visual-feedback-with-selection-in-designmode.html
2. Click the select button
3. The two sample lines are selected
Actual Results:  
Nothing is highlighted, although both lines have been logically selected, as you can verify by pressing Ctrl-C and looking on your clipboard. If the browser loses focus (click on the start menu) or you switch to another tab and back, the selection highlight updates to show the logical selection.

Expected Results:  
Both lines of text are highlighted when they are selected.
