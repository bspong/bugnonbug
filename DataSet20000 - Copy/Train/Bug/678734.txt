manual password save button
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:5.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0.1

Steps to reproduce:

reinstalled newest version to get browser to reliably bring up the password save dialog


Actual results:

dialog came up once and then quit appearing. Apparently clicking the little x in that window turns off the dialog permanently without telling me. I went to options to "remeber passwords" and that was still checked. I unchecked it and the dialog didn't come up . I rechecked it and still didn't get the dialog.


Expected results:

What should happen is that the programmers of this browser need to completely redo the save password function. As it is now, half the time it doesn't come up or it comes up only for passwords I don't want to save and is annoying. It also is very erractic in asking me if I want to store a changed password. This is occurring right now afer I just installed 5.01! since IE came out with it, this save password thing has never worked properly for any significant length of time in any browser I have ever had. So it should be taken off automatic and made manual or have manual and automatic so that if the automatic doesn't work and I still want to save a password, i can click the manual button and add it to my saved passwords. Or just get rid of the auto part of it and prominently display the manual option. The fact is that right now. no browser does this right. they all suck and quit working for one reason or another. But that is because they are all auto and there is no manual override and no meaningful controls over them. IE is the absolute worse in that it reliably brings up the dialog for brand new passwords but never old ones I haven't been able to save yet, nor the "Change password" dialog.
