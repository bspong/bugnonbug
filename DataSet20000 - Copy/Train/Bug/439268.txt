(mostly copied from the list)

With many (20+) tabs displayed (not just loaded), scrolling through tabs is visibly slower than FF2.

The main culprit seems to be the smooth scrolling in the tabs; disabling toolkit.scrollbox.smoothScroll makes it a lot faster (though still slower than FF2).

The rest of the time seems to be spent in gURLBar.value = value under browser.js onLocationChange's URLBarSetURI call.  Commenting out this call (in addition to having smooth scrolling off) makes tab switching look as fast as FF2.  I didn't dig down into further than that (to see if it's some event listener that's taking time or something).  This takes 60-80ms.

I'm not sure this is all; it still doesn't seem as quick as FF2.  This should be compared less subjectively, but I'm not sure where to do that.

For perspective, this is a visible performance drop, but not a catastrophic one: quickly scrolling the mouse wheel 6 stops in FF2 (with TMP) moves down 6 tabs; in FF3 it's slow enough that it misses some, and only moves 2-3.  (I navigate like this a lot, so this is very noticable.)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Set browser.tabs.tabMinWidth to a low value, load many tabs, and hold ctrl-pgdn.  (My actual case is vertical tabs with TabMixPlus, scrolling with the mouse wheel.)  It's slower and much less responsive than FF2.

Note that to reproduce the URL bar part of this, consecutive tabs must have different URLs, or the gURLBar.value = value call seems to short circuit.
