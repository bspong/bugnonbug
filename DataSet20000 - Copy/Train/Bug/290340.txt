In my bookmarks menu I've separated groups of subdirectories with separators. I
tried to move one of them and got an empty bookmark where it should have been
moved to. The separator remained in its original place.

I thought this was weird, but I didn't bother much at the time and went on with
my life. However, since that time I've seen it more times and I thought it was
time to report it even though I can't always reproduce it.

I'm going to attach a screenshot to this bug...

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just start with your own set of bookmarks and make sure you have separators
in the menu.
2. Try to drag a separator.
3. I dragged it upwards, between two folders for example. Try that if you can't
reproduce it, I guess.

Actual Results:  
The bookmarks menu closed as soon as I had dragged the separator, and when I
opened it again, in the place where the separator should now be, was an empty
bookmark with a standard blank icon. See screenshot.

The separator stayed in its original place and stays there even after I delete
the weird empty bookmark.

When I right-click the "dummy", I get the normal 

Expected Results:  
The separator should have moved to its new position and not have stayed in its
original position.

No "dummy" - weird empty bookmark entry - should have been created.

I can delete the "dummy" - sometimes that's fine, and then maybe I can move the
separator if I try again or move it to another place, but sometimes it happens
again. I can't figure out what the behaviour is caused by.
