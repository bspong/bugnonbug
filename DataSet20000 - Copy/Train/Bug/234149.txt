I routinely get crud in my clipboard because I use linux and like to highlight
what I am replacing. anyway, I got the above snippit in the address field, and
the  behavior suggests that additional bounds checking is required.




Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.paste what's in the URL field into browser address field
2.hold down enter
3. watch the alerts pile up (I got to 8 or so before it crashed)



Expected Results:  
1.  keydown and keyup event should be watched instead of keyboard input (if
possible) for the enter key on the address field, or any in which enter implies
an action.

2. additional alerts of the same type should/could be represented with an error
tone instead of the formation of a new dialog box.

3. It is good that the alert box does not recieve focus, (because alert boxes
stealing key hits suck) but this results in a more complicated situation



marked normal because of the hint of other related problems...

also results in loss of work because of the browser crashing
