FF31+ does not let me add an exception for self signed certificate under Linux
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:32.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/32.0
Build ID: 20140831201947

Steps to reproduce:

I create a self signed SSL key and certificate by for instance using this

openssl req -x509 -nodes -sha256 -days 768 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout tuv.key -out tuv.crt

I then activate this Certificate in an Apache Webserver for instance




Actual results:

When I visit sites with such a standard self-signed certificate (independent of the fact whether I create it as a v1 or v3 with extension cert and cacert:false) I get the usual "this connection is not trusted" page. 

I receive a "sec_error_unknown_issuer" error, stating the (self-signed) certificate is not trusted, as it is self-signed (duh),

I do not get a possibility to add an exception, no button for this is displayed.

If I try to add an exception manual in the menu by downloading the cert I can add an exception - visiting the page gives me the same "sec_error_unknown_issuer" error though.

This does only happen on Linux / Fedora20 for me - on a Windows FF32 I get the normal Exception dialogue which works




Expected results:

Display an Exception button to add an exception and access the website.
