QuickTime streaming major glitch

Our Darwin server streams H.264 and Apple MPEG-4 to Safari Mac and Firefox 3 on Windows with no major problems. Also streams to Firefox 2 on Mac with no problem. 

When I open the same streams with Firefox 3, QuickTime 7.6 on Mac OS 10.5, the video plays fine for the first 12 seconds or so and then hangs. From that point there is a total breakdown in the decoder. There are large block artifacts with smaller blocks sliding around the picture. It never fully recovers. 

I've seen it on systems with QT 7.6 pro and non-pro. With and without the Flip4mac WMV components installed. Since the QT 7.6 plug-in works fine with Firefox 2 and Safari, it would seem to be a problem in Firefox 3 or in the way the plug-in works with Firefox 3. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Stream video to Firefox 3 on Mac OS 10.5 from Darwin streaming server. 


Actual Results:  
picture always plays fine for a few seconds then freezes and plays garbled from that point on.

Expected Results:  
The same MPEG-4 and H.264 (.mp4) files play correctly to Firefox 3 on Windows, Firefox 2 on Mac OS 10.5 and Safari on Mac OS 10.5.  All environments have QuickTime 7.6 plug-in.
