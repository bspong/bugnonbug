Steps to reproduce:

Description:
Starting with Firefox 7.x, when playing any Flash video displayed within a page, the picture "glitches" randomly (but typically several times a minute). The problem does not appear if the video is switched to "fullscreen" mode, nor if viewed in other browsers (IE/Chrome/Firefox 6 or earlier), nor if hardware acceleration in Flash is switched off.

To recreate:
1. Visit any site with embedded flash video (e.g. www.youtube.com).
2. Select any video and press play. Observe the problem.
3. Switch to "fullscreen" mode. See that the video now runs smoothly.
4. Switch back to "normal" mode. Observe the problem again.
5. Right click on the video, select Settings, untick "Enable hardware acceleration"
6. Restart firefox and navigate to the same video.
7. See that the video now runs smoothly.

Tested environment:
Firefox: v7.x, v8.x (does NOT happen with Firefox v6.x and earlier, nor with IE9 or Chrome)
Flash: v11.0.1.152
O/S: Windows 7 64bit SP1
Machine: ThinkPad T410s
Video: Nvidia NVS 3100M (driver v8.16.11.9223)



Actual results:

Using screen capture software, it's possible to see that each random glitch is typically a single frame which contains a displaced picture and vertical bands of corruption (example attached). There appears to be no obvious link between the glitches and events on the machine (e.g. CPU spike) - they seem to appear randomly.
