Text size is unstable--usually (not always) reverting to tiny, almost unreadable size as pages change; sometimes the opposite--text is huge when page changes.

Default ("always use my fonts and colors") does not seem to hold.  Sometimes
yes, more often no.   Ithen readjust the size, but it may hold for a page change
or two, or not.  OR, if I enlarge the font (since the problem is usually too
small type), the next change may bring giant ! type size. I most frequently use
netidentity.com for my mail, and etrade for my finances, but this problem does
not seem to be specific to any particular url.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to a url
2.there it is.
even if I readjust font, even if i re-open tools, options, etc. and make sure it
says "always use my fonts" it does not change the problem
3.

Actual Results:  
usually the new page arrives with type so small that it gives me a headache
within a minute, so I readjust, but this adjustment evaporates if i go to a
different page.

Expected Results:  
use the fonts and sizes i specified in tools, options.  OR, ANY readable type,
and the same size every time.  unless and until changed by me.

my machine is a sharp, winows xp, usual boring ms software, nothing special.
