4. Click "Get map", giving base map, with pan/zoom controls
5. Either pan ("Next map" on edge of map) or zoom ("street/suburb/state" slider)
6. In all cases, get error message ("Could not generate map. You may have panned too far or may need to restart your search.")
7. Javascript console shows many css errors regarding "width"/"height".
8. Happens with Firefox, SeaMonkey, and Opera. Works for IE. Also happens on Linux.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. See steps above
2. etc
3. etc
Actual Results:  
Unable to pan/zoom map.

Expected Results:  
Map pans/zooms.

"Whereis" changed their implementation recently. The old system
is still available through "http://ww2.whereis.com".

Enter the town/state ("Perth"/"WA"), click
"Search". Choose "City Centre" and "Continue". Map is presented,
and pan/zoom works. Unfortunately, map data is old and not
being updated, apparently. Javascript console shows different
css errors, none regarding "width/height".
