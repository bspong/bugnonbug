Firefox crashes

Expected Results:  
Should have gone to link and not crashed

Have used Firefox for years. Have not been able to use since Firefox 3.6 came out because it crashes immediately when I click on a link.  I have installed each new update with no improvement. I now use Safari as my browser, but keep checking to see if the bug has been fixed because I prefer Firefox.
