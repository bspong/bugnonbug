Some text implies the Firefox logo is under a non-free copyright license

Apparently when the Firefox binary was changed to being distributed under the MPL, this include the icons too. However, no documentation was changed to reflect this, nor was a specific announcement that the logo now had a free copyright license made.http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/archives/2010/01/packages_and_trademarks_an_observation.html

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Look for the license on the Firefox logo
Actual Results:  
other-licenses/branding/firefox/LICENSE says "You are not granted rights or licenses to the trademarks of the Mozilla Foundation or any party, including without limitation the Firefox name or logo." which to me implies copyright and trademark licenses.

about:rights says "Mozilla does not grant you any rights to the Mozilla and Firefox trademarks or logos."

Expected Results:  
It says something like "The logos' copyright is licensed under the MPL/LGPL/GPL, but use is also subject to trademark licensing". about:rights says the same thing in respect to the logos.

Gerv has changed http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/license-policy.html to reflect the above, but apparently further changes require a bug, so here we are.
