Steps to reproduce:

Log in to my Gmail, I just wait there (after inbox loads) without doing anything. Then the following message pops up:

Error
Some Gmail features have failed to load. If this problem persists, try reloading the page, or using the basic HTML version. Learn More.

When I open up a message and attempt to reply, I press on the textbox (Click here to Reply or Forward), and "loading..." appears at the top, but nothing happens, I cannot compose the message. The same message later appears:

When I open up a message and attempt to reply, I press on the textbox (Click here to Reply or Forward), and "loading..." appears at the top, but nothing happens, I cannot compose the message. An error message pops up 1 minute later:
