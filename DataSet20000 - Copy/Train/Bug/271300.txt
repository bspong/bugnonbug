Firefox causes processes to hang on OS/X (data loss, cold boot required)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Often, when I run Firefox, I find that I am unable start or close program
processes.  For example, I launched about ten applications after a cold boot.
I then closed and reopened those apps repeatedly with no problems.  I then
started Firefox.  I then tried to open some of the previously closed apps and
they all hung.

The behavior I observe in the "Activity Monitor" diagnostic application is that
the application processes never get started.  Instead, a WindowServer process
gets started for each of these apps and then never quits.  Usually, when the
system is happy, launching one of these programs causes a WindowServer process
to be spawned.  The WindowServer app appears to the start the client program and
the WindowServer exits.

Also, I often find that I am unable to exit Firefox.  What I notice is that even
if I try to force quit the program, "Firefox" disappears from the process list,
but firefox-bin replaces it and firefox-bin cannot be killed by Force Quit.  At
that point, I have to cold boot the machine.

Unfortunately, no stack trace is generated and I don't know how to debug this.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open the Activity Monitor
2.  Open and close Firefox repeatedly until either Firefox refuses to exit or
starting another program fails with that program locking up.


Actual Results:  
Firefox refuses to exit or and OS/X will no longer start other programs.
