Ruleview breaks if there're invalid CSS (all rules are duplicated; editing works for wrong rules)
>>>   My Info:   Win7_64, Nightly 49, 32bit, ID 20160526082509
STR_1:
1. Open url [1]
2. Open devtools -> inspector -> ruleview, inspect <div>
3. Click on text "50px" in line "width: 50px;" to start editing the value
4. Press Shift+Up to change value from "50px" to "60px"

AR:  The black rectangle moves by 10px to the right (i.e. browser changes "left" instead of "width")
ER:  The black rectangle should increase width by 10px


STR_2:
1. Open url [1]
2. Open devtools -> inspector -> ruleview, inspect <div>
3. Click on text "translateY(0px)" to start editing the value
4. Type "gray"

AR:  The black rectangle becomes gray (i.e. browser changes "background" instead of "transform")
ER:  No visible changes


STR_3:
1. Open url [1]
2. Open devtools -> inspector -> ruleview, inspect <div>
3. {Click on text "50px" in line "height: 50px;". Press Escape to cancel} several times (N times)
4. Switch to another node and back
5. Open style editor

AR:  CSS rules in ruleview and style editor are duplicated N times. I.e. there're 6*2^N rules
ER:  No visible changes
