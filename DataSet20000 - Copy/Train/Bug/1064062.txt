Steps to reproduce:

Probably a hardware combination of Windows 8.1 and an Ivy Bridge Intel CPU is required - people have been complaining of stutter with this particular setup on Adobe forums before, for example.

The Firefox setup consists of Firefox 32 (stable release channel) with no add-ons and no plugins currently enabled.

Video test: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V0N1x675FQ
Audio test: http://webaudiodemos.appspot.com/MIDIDrums/index.html

I've tested for the same behavior under the same system running Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit (whatever version of firefox Canonical ships Ubuntu with) and a desktop running Windows 7 and an AMD FX CPU with Firefox 32 - on both targets similar behavior couldn't be observed.

Chrome does not experience the same issues and runs the tests smoothly.


Actual results:

Animation experiencing lag spikes and not being smooth, as visible to a naked eye, especially so when other tabs are open.

Visible stuttering of video on YouTube at varied frequency of lag spikes.

Severe, persistent stuttering and crackling of audio for the MIDI Drums WebAudio demo.


Expected results:

Animation should have been smooth regardless of other non-media content being browsed.

YouTube video should have been played smoothly.

Audio should have been clear and with no crackling.
