3.0.11 - Firefox and java do not unload after visiting page with Java, and quitting
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

This appears similar to a bug supposedly fixed in 3.0.11...
I visit a page like the one above (National Weather Service Radar)
I click on a radar loop - left side of page, Reflectivity, Base - Loop, for example
Java applet begins to load
I use back arrow before radar animation begins - 1 or 2 seconds
I continue to use Firefox with no apparent problem, then quit the program.  It appears to unload completely
I try to restart Firefox, and am told via dialog that it is already running
When I check Task Manager, both Firefox and Java are still present
Firefox is using up to 100 Meg of RAM, and continues to count up as I watch
I can only restart Firefox normally by ending its process and Java in Task manager.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox
2.Navigate to http://radar.weather.gov/radar.php?rid=iwa&product=N0R&overlay=11101111&loop=no
3.Click on Short Range Images - Reflectivity, Base, Loop, left hand of page near top
4.Before Java applet has a chance to load fully, click back arrow (1-2 seconds)
5.Quit Firefox
6.Try to restart Firefox after a moment - Dialog pop up Firefox already running
7.Check Task Manager - Processes.  Firefox running with huge memory usage that continually increases, Java running as well.
Actual Results:  
Cannot restart Firefox without ending it in Task Manager, Processes.  Cannot free Ram without doing the same

Expected Results:  
Closed and removed itself from memory, allowing a normal restart.  Same with Java.
