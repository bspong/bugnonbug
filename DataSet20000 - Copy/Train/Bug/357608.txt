Firefox will not load the plug-in library (provided by Apple) for a SmartCard reader (SCR331)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

This affects Firefox (up to and including v2 RC3) and Thunderbird. 

I go to Preferences-Advanced-Encryption-Security Devices, select "Load," select "Browse," navigate to the library "pkcs11.shlb" and select "Open."

The dialog box now shows a very long ASCII string in the Module filename field. When I hit "OK," an alert box appears asking for confirmation that I intend to load this module. This alert box fills the width of the screen with the incredibly long ASCII Module filename running off the right side of the box. There are no buttons, where I would expect a choice between "Cancel" and "OK."

I have tried using every key to confirm. The only key that has any effect is "return," which simply closes the open boxes without loading the module.



Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Module does not load

Expected Results:  
Module loads and I can use US Government CAC to access password-protected sites.

I have screen shots off the process if they help
