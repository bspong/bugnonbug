Opening 6 or more browser windows causes the web browser to stop responding.

When I open more than 6 browser windows, the memory usage is close to or above
95,000 k each web browser stops responding and nothing happens.  I cannot switch
to another window at all.  The only thing I can do is click on the minimize
button and it will minimize that window.  The close button stops working as does
any menu item and I cannot right-click in the taskbar to close any browser
window.  The only way I can fix the problem is to open the task manager and
click on the process for firefox and click End Process.  Also the entire system
keeps on running and it is just firefox that stops responding.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
First of all open up the windows task manager and monitor how much memory
firefox uses and when it gets close to 95,000 k the browser should be locking up.

1. goto www.fileshack.com
2. scroll down a little and click on Unreal Tournament
3. then click on Unreal Tournament 2004
4. then click on Mods and proceed to open 6 or more different pages and it
should begin to lock up.
Actual Results:  
Firefox locks up and it has to be shut down by shutting down the process.

Expected Results:  
I think that each new browser window should open up and use its own process. 
That way when firefox.exe terminates, every browser window won't close down with
it.  Internet Explorer will open up in a new process but you have to turn on the
feature yourself.  I think that will probably fix the problem because I haven't
had any problem going to fileshack with Internet Explorer.
