browser_*_behavior.js fails when run as a standalone directory
we are close to changing our mochitests to run one directory at a time.  Unfortunately while doing this we run into cases where tests fail, usually because they accidentally depend on the state of the browser being set by a previous test.

In this case we have a consistent set of bc1 failures:

running this locally, I can reproduce the problems easily:
./mach mochitest-browser browser/components/search/test

If there are any pointers for me to hack on this, please speak up.
