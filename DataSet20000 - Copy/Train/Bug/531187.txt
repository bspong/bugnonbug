Why the version 3.x is so bad for saving complete web pages? Because, in the version of 2.0.0.20 I can easily save full a web pages without any error messages and without waiting time for scanning such as in the version 3.x



Download Error

...could not be saved, because the source file could not be read.

Try again later, or contact the server administrator.

That happened every time I use Firefox 3.x

I was tried more to reload and then save complete web pages,
but that download error messages always appear.

I was tried to save another web sites,
and download error messages still appear.

I had to make sure my internet connection in good condition.
There was no problems in my internet connection.

Then,
I decided to turn back use Firefox 2.0.0.20
Download error messages was not appear and it saved full web site succesfully.

I was tried compare Firefox 2.0.0.20 and Firefox 3.x
(Load a web site, then save complete)
When a web site load succesfully :
Firefox 2.0.0.20 can immediately to save complete succesfully.
But, Firefox 3.x has remaining time to save complete.

In Firefox 3.x,
I was turned of the scanning (browser.download.manager.scanWhenDone) by change the value to false,
but it still has remaining time to save complete.

I had tried more another ways to compare Firefox 2.0.0.20 and Firefox 3.x
(Load a web site, then disconnect internet connection, save complete)
When a web site load succesfully,
then after internet connection disconnected :
Firefox 2.0.0.20 can immediately (without remaining time) to save complete succesfully.
But, Firefox 3.x give such above downloads error message.


Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
Back to version 2.0.0.20 settings
