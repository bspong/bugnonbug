firefox save dialog doesn't support non-local folders
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071023 Epiphany/2.20 Firefox/2.0.0.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071023 Epiphany/2.20 Firefox/2.0.0.8 -- this is wrong I filing this bug about firefox, not Epiphany

From the Red Hat Bugzilla (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=384711):

When using "save link as" or "save page as", the GNOME file save dialog appears,
and it lets the user enter URLs for non-local folders in the "Name" box - it
even does suggestion and completion on such urls where possible (for example
when using an ssh:// url to a host that has private key authentication), but
when entering a full url for such non-local folders, including target filename
and pressing enter, the dialog is dismissed without an error but no file is
actually created at the target. Doing the same for local folders (typing the
entire path and file name at the "Name" box) works.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

1. open firefox and go to some web page
2. select "File"->"Save page as..."
3. In the name box type a non-local url including file name, for example
smb://someserver/someshare/somefile or even trash:///somefile and click on the
"Save" button.

Actual Results:  
The dialog disappears and nothing happens

Expected Results:  
Either an error message should be shown about not being able to save to
non-local folders, or the content should actually be saved to that location. I
of course would prefer that the second option will be implemented :-)
