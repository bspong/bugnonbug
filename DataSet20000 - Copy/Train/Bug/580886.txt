Flashplayer no longer works since the last two upgrades. It worked before. And the download box does not show the downloads anymore, just blank.

After Firfox upgraded two times ago, just recently it upgraded to 3.6.7, but it was at least one before this one, then I could no longer play on my application games in facebook (Zoo World, Li'l Farmlife, etc..) and I could not view youtube videos either. I hate using Internet Explorer, but I have to to play my games and watch videos.  I checked out an old bug listed about the same problem it was sent to a support problem and fixed, but I did uninstall Flashplayer and reinstall it and it still does not work. And I had tried that before this update too. I even disabled Microsoft .Net as I had just added that to, but it did not change it. Can I have an old version of Firefox, like version 2 it worked then. * And the download box does not show the downloads anymore, just blank.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log in to Facebook
2.Go to Zoo World
3.
Actual Results:  
An almost blank page. It used to show everthing else on the page and just the square where the game action was supposed to be was blank.

Expected Results:  
Would like to see the game again so I can play it, that and youtube videos too.
