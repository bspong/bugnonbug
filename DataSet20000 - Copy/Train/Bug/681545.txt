method to allow user to grant more (or perhaps unlimited) storage for web applications
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/535.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/13.0.782.112 Safari/535.1

Steps to reproduce:

I am a web developer, with applications that will require more persistent storage than is currently offered by many web browsers:
http://dev-test.nemikor.com/web-storage/support-test/

My web applications may need to store (and later retrieve) a single string that is several megabytes long. They may also need to store multiple strings that cumulatively occupy hundreds of megabytes.


Actual results:

My current experience is that most browsers fail to provide unlimited persistent storage (localStorage, indexedDB, webSQL, etc) to web applications. Safari (and Mobile Safari) seems to be the only browser that will ask the user if they will allow more space to be used by a web application (and it is buggy). Other browsers will just throw a storage exception when the limit is reached.


Expected results:

When an asynchronous storage request is invoked in JavaScript, and the request would exceed the current storage quota, the user should be asked for permission to increase the storage permissions for the current web application. If they accept, then the asynchronous storage request should continue to execute as normal, if not then an exception should be thrown.
