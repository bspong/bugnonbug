Steps to reproduce:

I opened FIrefox Aurora on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS in a Unity session.


Actual results:

Recently, with the Aurora builds (at least on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS), Unity launcher support has somehow managed to break itself. You have to click the original icon to launch Aurora, but it appears under a second icon. Opening up other Aurora windows group normally, but opening up another windows containing, say downloads or add-on preferences (for example, Adblock Plus) makes yet another launcher icon appear, ungrouped with the rest of them. Also, the proper quicklists are missing with these new windows (Right clicking gives no option to open a new window) and no matter what I do, each different type of window opens up under a different icon in the Unity launcher. The original launcher icon needed to launch Aurora also has no white indicator dots next to it.


Expected results:

All windows for Aurora should be grouped together under the one original launcher icon, just as in previous Firefox versions.
