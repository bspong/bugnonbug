Firefox does not authenticate on ISA proxy server
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040910
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; WinNT4.0; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041026 Firefox/1.0RC1

I am in a corporate network that uses Microsoft ISA server to access the
internet. This proxy requires NTLM authentication (domain username and
password). The domain is an Active Directory one.

The PC OS is NT4.0 workstation and the Firefox proxy settings are configured
properly.

Firefox 0.9.3 is working perfectly behind this proxy, while Firefox 1.0PR and
1.0RC1 fail to access outside pages with the following error:

"HTTP 407 Proxy Authentication Required - The ISA Server requires authorization
to fulfill the request. Access to the Web Proxy service is denied. (12209)
Internet Security and Acceleration Server"

Firefox 0.9.3 pops up a window to request the username and password needed to
authenticate on the proxy server, it carries on the auth correctly and then it
shows the requested web page.

Firefox 1.0PR (and also 1.0RC1) instead does not pop up any window for asking
the proxy authentication details and it shows directly the error page generated
by the proxy server.

Clearly something broke up in the transition from 0.9.3 to 1.0xx.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Firefox 1.0PR or 1.0RC1
2.Set proxy server settings to use internal LAN ISA server (proxy1:80)
3.Try to access whichever page on the internet


Actual Results:  
The browser cannot display any page outside the intranet or that requires NTLM
authentication. The browser fails authentication with ISA proxy server.


Expected Results:  
Negotiate correctly NTLM authentication as 0.9.3 did.
