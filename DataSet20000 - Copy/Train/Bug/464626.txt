Firefox 2.0.0.18 crashes while opening the site http://tataskyplus.com/.

Greetings!
I would like to report a major bug in Firefox 2.0.0.17 as well as 2.0.0.18. In 2.0.0.17, when I open the link http://www.tataskyplus.com/, Firefox simply shuts down (all open tabs are automatically closed), without providing any reason or bringing up any dialog box. Windows also does not provide any reason for shutting the browser (such as "Application needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience caused...blah...blah...blah"). Also, I have not tried to open this link in Firefox 3. I'm not a fan of IE, but just as a feedback, this particular site opens just fine in IE 7.

I then downloaded the latest update for Firefox 2 (updated to v2.0.0.18). The problem is present in this version too, except that now, Windows brings up an error dialog (firefox.exe has caused an exception and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience).

Thanks for going through this feedback (and for providing us with such fantastic products like Firefox and Thunderbird).

May God bless you all.

-Amit.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox 2.0.0.17 or 2.0.0.18.
2. Open the site http://tataskyplus.com/
3. Firefox 2.0.0.17 crashes without any message. v2.0.0.18 crashes with Windows providing a "firefox.exe has caused an exception and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience" dialog box.
Actual Results:  
After performing the sequence of steps mentioned above, Firefox crashes (shuts down).

Expected Results:  
The site should open and allow the user to see its contents as well as navigate to the several links provided on it. It is basically a newly launched site of a subsidiary of the Tata group in India providing DTH television services.

Hopefully, the details provided by me above will enable you to reproduce the problem.

I have categorized this problem as 'Critical' since if a user opens the above mentioned problematic link in one tab, while he/she is doing something important in another tab (such as modifying a buy or sell order on an online stock trading page), he/she is bound to have a tough time, perhaps, even incur a financial loss.

Thank you for your time in going through this bug report.
