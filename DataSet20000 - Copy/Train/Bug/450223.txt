This is a separate bug report to bug 449193, which has been labeled Tech Evangelism. Note that the owner of the website in question has been informed, so this report is solely to find the bug causing the crash.

When opening the website www.europcar.de, Firefox freezes, which probably has to do with the site being very badly coded (XHML, CSS and Javascript validators show a large number of violations). However, a local copy of the page loads fine, which renders creating a test case impossible. This bug should be fixed soon, as the website owner stated that they are working on the problem and without test case it won't be possible to find out what the bug in Firefox is once they fix their site.

A peculiar thing is that after loading a local copy of the site, even the online version loads correctly. When the Firefox cache is emptied, however, the crash occurs again. It seems that the problem occurs when the website is loaded into cache.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load www.europcar.de --> freeze

But:

1. Open local copy (html only with added <base href="http://www.europcar.de">)
-> no freeze
2. Open www.europcar.de --> no freeze
3. Clear cache, open www.europcar.de --> freeze
Actual Results:  
Firefox freezes and does not accept any mouse or keyboard input, neither on the website nor in the Firefox menus.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should not freeze, no matter how badly a website is coded.

These two errors appear in the error console when opening the local copy:

Error: Permission denied for <file://> to get property HTMLDocument.open from
<http://www.europcar.de>.
Source File: http://www.europcar.de/EBE/module/js/home.js
Line: 186

Error: urchinTracker is not defined
Source File: file:///C:/europ4.htm
Line: 2618

Note that the second error only occurs sometimes. 

The urchinTracker seems to have to do something with Google analytics, as
there is a piece of code a few lines above the error that reads <script
src="https://ssl.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">. This .js file contains the urchinTracker() function.

Loading the online version of the website leading to a crash does not display these errors, as the browser freezes before. Loading the online version without crash (as described above) does not display these errors either, but a lot of warnings. The warnings also appear when loading the local copy.
