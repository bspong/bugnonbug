Most computer functions freeze when Firefox 2.0.0.3 and "NoteBox Disorganizer" program are open

Running XP 2005 Media Center Edition, Toshiba Satellite U205-S5044 with Core 2 Duo (2 gigahertz), 2 gigabyte RAM. 

This problem DOES NOT OCCUR when running Firefox 2.0.0.2.  (I used GoBack to restore ver 2.0.0.2.)

When FireFox Ver. 2.0.0.3 and NoteBox Disorganizer (http://www.geocities.com/goosnargh37/) are both open, Computer almost totally freezes.  

1)  Windows Task Manager (ctrl-alt-del) will open, but it will not properly close NoteBook Disorganizer.
2)  Clicking on a program, folder, or file icon on the bottom task bar will not open the item.
3)  I have to reboot using Windows Task Manager.
4)  Have same problem after a warm or cold reboot.
5)  Using Task Manager to close other files and programs (if I can) does not help.
6)  I have some Firefox plug-ins loaded
7)  Freeze occurs even if NoteBox Disorganizer is just started with no file opened in it, nor any other operation being done on or with it.
8)  Freeze appears to occur independent of which program is started first
9)  No error message is displayed when computer freezes
10)) Versions prior to 2.0.0.3 have not caused any problems (except Hotmail sometimes has a defective display, which I attribute to Hotmail problems, not to Firefox.


Reproducible: Always

3.
Actual Results:  
See details, above

Nothing special.  Just boot, open programs, get freeze.

Expected Results:  
Run normally, just as they appear to do with FireFox 2.0.0.2.

After one reboot, Windows displayed a "serious problem" message.  This message did not reoccur after I used GoBack to go back one hour.  However, even after going back, the Firefox 2.0.0.3 - NoteBox freeze still occurred.
