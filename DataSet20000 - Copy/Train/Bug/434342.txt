Dragged image blocks view of browser, making dropping difficult

When dragged, large images (like photos) obscure your view because they are not scaled small enough and are 100% opaque.  Essentially, when dropping images the user is blind.  This is a real usibility issue that popped up with Firefox 3.  I don't know if this is a gtk only issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/img_png/png-8passes.png
2.Try to drag the image to the URL bar
3. Notice that sense of "blarg" you get when you realize how difficult it is to find the url bar under the dragged image.
Actual Results:  
The only clue that you have that you are over the url bar is when the cursor turns into an arrow.  Otherwise, you are just moving the cursor back and forth over the areo, hoping it changes.

Expected Results:  
There are different ways this problem could be coped with.
1. Make the dragged image semi transparent.
2. scale down the image more
3. When  the user is dragging the image, make sure the image is anchored to the cursor by the corner, instead of the center.
4. Treat dragging like FF2 did, not using invokeDragSessionWithImage()

I had some users report this problem when I added dragging support to my extension "F-Spot Importer" https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7091 . The problem exists whether the extension is installed or not.  

Because of the nature of the size of photos this causes big headaches with my extension.
