Firefox browser interferes with full-screen applications, causing them to not display.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.2) Gecko/20100316 Firefox/3.6.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.2) Gecko/20100316 Firefox/3.6.2

Whenever a full-screen application is used e.g. a game, it will not display while the Firefox browser is open.  The game however still loads, but will not let the user use it.  Closing the browser seems to rectify this.

Sometimes, already having a full screen application up and alt-tabbing to desktop and starting Firefox, then alt-tabbing back to the program may not make it display.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox browser
2. Open a full screen application e.g. a game (In my case C & C Red Alert 2)
Actual Results:  
With most of my games, they do pop up, but not always.  With C & C Red Alert 2 it never pops up at all.  This may be because of its older engine.

Expected Results:  
The game should have started up normally, regardless if Firefox was runing.

With my results and experience, it seems Firefox has trouble working alongside some game engines, mainly older ones from several years ago.
