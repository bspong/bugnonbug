Browser window does not open on launch
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_8; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.375.125 Safari/533.4

The application launches but no window opens. The view menu is greyed out. I an create new tabs and they will be listed in the window menu, but I cannot open a new window nor can I get the browser window displayed. Live bookmarks home page seems to load in the background. I can open the error console.

I suspect the problem to be related with a faulty chrome or addon (see error-console snippets) but after the add-ons are now managed in a browser tab, there is no way to change the chrome using the interface.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
The application did work after install and it is unclear what event has caused this problem, only I did close the application, and the problem occurred at next launch.

1. Launch application
Actual Results:  
No window

Expected Results:  
Browser window
