Stopped displaying yahoo web mail page correctly after a month or two of use.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; en) Opera 8.01
Build Identifier: 1.0.4

Whe I log into Yahoo Web mail account, it used to display correctly. However, 
after using Firefox for a month or two all of a sudden, it no longer renders the 
page correctly. I end up with yellow/orangish background for all displayed text. 
I used to use Netscape and also Mozilla. Both of these developed the same 
problem afte using them for a while. I have about given up on anything 
asssociated with any of the Mozilla based browsers. I have never experienced 
this problem with either Opera of Internet explorer. So I have had to switch 
over to Opera because I refuse to use Internet Explorer. 
This has been a problem that I first ran into under NetScape almost a year ago.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log in to my yahoo Web based e-mail account
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
The colors are rendered incorrectly behind each of the areas that text is being 
displayed.

Expected Results:  
Diplayed the results with my defined color scheme that is defined from within 
the Yahoo Web based e-mail page. The color scheme is defined and controled by 
the account attributes while logged in to yahoo web mail.
