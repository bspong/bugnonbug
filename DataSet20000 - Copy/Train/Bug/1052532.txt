Steps to reproduce:

I am running Firefox 30 (because I never reboot, bad me) with at least Ghostery, Greasemonkey, BetterPrivacy, Flashblock, oldbar, and something that's supposed to delete my old search results out of the menu bar and there are at least a couple of defunct Tor add-ons floating around in here somewhere that I should probably clean out.

And I go to Men's Pants at LL Bean and get this weirdly blank page (http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/590?nav=gnro-). It *has* to be something I've done, probably years and years ago.


Actual results:

I had to go buy pants in Safari. Indeed, in recent months I have had to do most of my online shopping in Safari.

You can observe the lack of pants in the attached screencap. I cannot buy pants which I cannot see.


Expected results:

I should have bought pants in a nice open-source browser. Ideally a nice open-source browser which doesn't permit Facebook to stalk me through every online transaction in which I might care to engage, just because I want to see my cousins' baby pictures.
