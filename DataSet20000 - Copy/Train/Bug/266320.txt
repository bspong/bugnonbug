customize toolbar window may appear partially offscreen
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1

If I move the Firefox window so that it is partially offscreen (i.e., the
toolbars and only half the content area remain visible) and then go to
View->Toolbars->Customize, the Customize Toolbars window is also partially
offscreen. This makes the "Done" button offscreen and I have no way of clicking
it. I also cannot resize or move it so that it becomes onscreen again. I tried
moving the Firefox window but the Customize Toolbars window does not move with
hit. My first intuition was to try to "Esc" key but it didn't work. I also tried
a couple of keyboard mnemonic hoping that they would work but they didn't (i.e.,
Alt+D/O/N/E). I didn't want to tab over the buttons incase I got the "Restore
Default Set" by accident. In the end I got out of this by changing my screen
resolution higher to 1152x864 so that I could see the "Done" button.

Suggestions:
1. Pressing the "Esc" key closes the Customize Toolbars window.
3. Moving the main Firefox window (using titlebar) also moves the Customize
Toolbar window accordingly.
