Provide longdesc discoverability
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:21.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/21.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130511120803

Steps to reproduce:

Tried to discover the longdesc attribute for an image element. 

Test cases:
http://www.d.umn.edu/~lcarlson/research/ld-tests/tests/

They include the following 5 tests and expected results.

1. longdesc on a different page using an absolute URL:
http://www.d.umn.edu/~lcarlson/research/ld-tests/tests/index.html#ld1

2. longdesc on a different page using a relative URL:
http://www.d.umn.edu/~lcarlson/research/ld-tests/tests/index.html#ld2

3. longdesc on the same page using a fragment identifier:
http://www.d.umn.edu/~lcarlson/research/ld-tests/tests/index.html#ld3

4. longdesc as a descendant of an <a> element:
http://www.d.umn.edu/~lcarlson/research/ld-tests/tests/index.html#ld4

5. longdesc data URIs:
http://www.d.umn.edu/~lcarlson/research/ld-tests/tests/index.html#ld5

Expected results are at: 
http://www.d.umn.edu/~lcarlson/research/ld-tests/tests/index.html#results


Actual results:

No visual affordance provided.


Expected results:

The browser should supply a way of obtaining a longdesc according to the specification, which states, "User agents should enable users to discover when images in a page contain a long description."

Providing longdesc discoverability serves use cases. Longdesc is not only an accommodation mechanism for people who are blind or have a visual impairment and use a screen reader, it also can assist others who need or would like textual reinforcement when deciphering the contents of a complicated image. 

The fact is that, some people may want or need to consume or access long description content but do not use assistive technology (AT). The following sighted people may be aided by access to a longdesc:

* Users who have a cognitive or visual impairment. 
* Users with either a keyboard or pointing device without screen reader or assistive technology.
* Users with a custom input accommodation, such as a mouth-stick or sticky keys.
* Users who have small screens (e.g. mobile phone or screen magnifiers).
* Users who turn off images to decrease bandwidth use in order to lower their Internet usage fees.
* Authors, for ease of authoring, testing, and maintenance purposes. 

Innovative browser vendors provide ways that make longdesc discoverable:

I expect that Mozilla  UX Team could develop those ideas into a great implementation.

As John Foliot said in Bug 854848, "Currently, the discoverability of @longdesc is fairly well handled by screen readers, who, when they encounter an image with longdesc, will usually announce the presence of the longer description and await user input (consume/skip). The lack of support we have today is primarily in the GUI interface, of which the "best" we have today is still contextual (right-click) menus, which already presumes that the end user is specifically hunting for the longer description already (the text-book scenario that Janina pointed to). To facilitate discoverability for sighted users then will require something that is not dependent on a screen reader, which one can only then conclude requires a visual indication of sorts. We have a few proof of concept examples of this type of visual indication, and the 2 basic models are either a) a (semi-transparent) on-screen indication (see: 1, 2, 3) or a chrome-based indication (see: 4). Since either/both solutions *do* have an impact on the authors original intended visual output (#4 less so), it would seem that the reasonable compromise is that any sort of indicator would be browser-based, and a user-selected option (likely) shipped with a default of "off", (as Mozilla currently does with DoNotTrack)"

Notes:

1. This bug is being filed to help fully complete the successful resolution of "Support the longdesc attribute", which is Bug 854848. Bug 854848 was filed with one of the expected results being that "User agents should enable users to discover when images in a page contain a long description." 

2. This bug is being filed per David Bolter's [:davidb]: recommendation
