Firefox 3.6 bug on Mac with Flash MouseEvent

In a Flash Application, if you're using somewhere a MouseEvent.ROLL_OUT or MouseEvent.MOUSE_OUT, this event will be fired even if you only click on a object without leaving the object with the mouse.

In short, MOUSE_OUT and ROLL_OUT flash events are fired when it shouldn't, details there:

This appears on Firefox 3.6



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. embed a flash movie that uses MouseEvent.MOUSE_OUT
2. click on the object where the event is added
3. the MouseEvent.MOUSE_OUT will be fired on a click
Actual Results:  
The Flash event MouseEvent.MOUSE_OUT will be fired on a click.

Expected Results:  
The Flash event MouseEvent.MOUSE_OUT shoudn't be fired on a click.

The flash mouse events, such as Mouse_CLICK and the others, are coming from the browser.

I believe that, or Firefox is firing mouse-out events when it shouldn't (on a click event), or somehow the flash is removed then put in place again on a click, so the flash loses the focus and fires a mouse_out event.
