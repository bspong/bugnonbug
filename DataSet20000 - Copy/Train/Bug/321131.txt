Pressing tab for location bar autocomplete should only complete up to longest common prefix (instead of selecting first item)

This is a variety of of bug 109758 for Mozilla Suite.

When hitting "tab" in the location bar after entering a partial URL, the filled in URL should be the longest URL-substring of all matching URLs in the location history. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type something like "mo" into the location bar.
2. Hit tab.

Actual Results:  
Assuming you have several URLs that start with "mo" in your history, step 1) will start listing them, as it should. 2) will then fill in the location bar with the first url in the list.

Expected Results:  
On top of actual result step 2 should select all but the largest prefix matching your history. Something like "mozilla.", if the only things in your history are
"www.mozilla.com" and "www.mozilla.org". 

In this way you can continue writing from the largest common prefix. The described behavior would strike a compromise between unix style tab completion and current behaviour.

I have a patch almost done.
