other programs fail to open links in "default browser"(set to firefox) since updating to 36 (Xubuntu)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:36.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/36.0
Build ID: 20150224134236

Steps to reproduce:

Possibility 1:

1. Open Thunderbird
2. Check a mail that has a web-URL in it
3. Control-click it

Possibility 2:

1. Open QuiteRSS
2. Open any link with the external browser

Possibility 3:

1. Right-click IBus tray icon
2. Select "about"
3. Click "Website" link

Possibility 4:

1. Open Pidgin
2. Click a link someone sent you

etc.


Actual results:

A new empty Firefox window is opened. The link is not followed at all.

NOTE:
This only happens if the program is set to use the "default browser".
I don't actually know what programs do when it's set to that setting. Some programs like Pidgin and QuiteRSS allow me to set the program to open links in manually, and setting them to any of "x-www-browser", "sensible-browser" or directly to "firefox" actually makes opening links work again.

However, all programs worked by default before the 36 update I installed last friday. And this breaks many programs that don't have this setting(like the IBus example).


Expected results:

The link is opened in a new tab. This happened before, and this is what happens if you configure all external programs' browser choices manually now(if that's possible to do).
