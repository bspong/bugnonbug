Both in the FF 3.5 and in the current nightly as above, basic keyboard navigation in the media list is broken. You cannot use cursor keys to navigate along the listbox entries to preview them. Which is a complete nuisance in terms of usability when you are looking for a certain image and are forced to click them one by one instead of much more efficient cursoring down. I sometimes wonder how such things can go unnoticed...

Steps
1) Open Tools > Page Info > Media
2) Focus first item of media listbox
3) Try to press cursor down at least twice in a row (!)

Actual results:
After first cursor down, focus automatically shifts to "Save" button, which doesn't help an inch as it's (supposed to be) the default button on that page anyway! Using keyboard navigation only, try getting focus back into the list and preview the next couple of images without banging your head against the wall.

Expected results:
TB should never ever move the focus away from where I placed it, especially not in list boxes with items that cry to be selected/viewed one after the other.
Cursoring up and down the list should just work, as in any other such list.
