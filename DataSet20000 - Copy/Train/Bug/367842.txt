Hello,
I'd like to report a little bug: I use to organize my bookmarks in subfolders, i.e 

Computers
  .
  + Hardware
  .     + Dlink
  .     + US Robotics
  + Software
      + Graphics
etc.

It happens that if I want to add  a new subfolder to the "Hardware" section (in eaxmple, "Netgear" and I right-click the corresponding folder, then select "New folder..." from the context menu, the new folder is created at the same level of the one pointed, instead of a new sub-folder.
It's not a critical bug, but it is quite annoying to drag every new folder I create to its appropriate place...

Thanks for your attention!
MAx
