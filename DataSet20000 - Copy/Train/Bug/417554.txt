The page will not print and the "Printing" dialog box is hung with "Progress: Preparing...".  The Cancel button is disabled.  The Browser is still active.  Other tabs can be opened.  I am entering this bug report on a different tab of the browser that has the problem.  I was trying to print the page to an Epson Stylus Photo R800 printer.  I was able to close the dialog box using the [X] in the top right corner. The content of the page contained a printable copy of XML code displayed.  After closing the dialog box, clicking the printer icon again gives a dialog box "Printer Error" with message "Not Available". clicking OK closes it.  Using the File,Print to print the page gives the same "Printer Error" message.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Got to a website that has XML code displayed on the page
2.Click the Printer icon
3.The printer status shows that it is Spooling but no pages are available
Actual Results:  
The print function seems to work as long as there is no XML code displayed as text.  Sample:
<br>--------------- XML data --------------------------<br>
&lt;order_info&gt;<br />
    &lt;order_type&gt;Individual&lt;/order_type&gt;<br />

    &lt;store_info&gt;<br />
        &lt;store_id&gt;4&lt;/store_id&gt;<br />
        &lt;store_name&gt;Real Pizza&lt;/store_name&gt;<br />
        &lt;store_location&gt;&lt;/store_location&gt;<br />


Expected Results:  
Expect the page to be printed

Opening a new tab will not let the printer work.  Closing the browser and starting a fresh copy allows the printer to work properly.  Closing the browser does not remove the print output that is spooling.
