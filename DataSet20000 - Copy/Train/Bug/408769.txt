Mozilla crashes every time I try to visit http://www.reedermusicacademy.com/ .  I would report this as a broken website, but frankly I don't know where the problem lies.  Also, to report the site I need to navigate to the site and then click "Help->Report a Broken Web Site," but that involves a successful navigation to the site.  Basically, I type in the entire URL, hit Enter, and - after a long pause - "Not Responding" appears in the title bar.  The site works in MS Internet Explorer.  Researched compatibility issues et al., and checked settings under Tools - Options, but recognized nothing.  Then again, I am not an expert.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox.
2. In the address bar, type http://www.reedermusicacademy.com/
3. Hit enter, or click on the green arrow to commence navigation.
4. Firefox becomes non-responsive
Actual Results:  
Firefox stopped responding.

Expected Results:  
Navigated to the website located at the address above (http://www.reedermusicacademy.com/)

Tried using a new profile with all default settings, only to end up with the same result.
