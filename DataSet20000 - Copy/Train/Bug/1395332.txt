Firefox Refresh causes Sync to forget it's signed in, even though FxA credentials exist
Verdi brought up an interesting issue in https://github.com/mozilla/fxa/issues/258#issuecomment-326050303.

Here's what I think is happening: Sync checks the `services.sync.username` pref to see if it should initialize at startup. Firefox Refresh keeps the FxA credentials in `signedInUser.json` (https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/51b3d67a5ec1758bd2fe7d7b6e75ad6b6b5da223/browser/components/migration/FirefoxProfileMigrator.js#135), but wipes all preferences, so Sync doesn't think it's configured (https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/51b3d67a5ec1758bd2fe7d7b6e75ad6b6b5da223/services/sync/Weave.js#103-112,132-133).

However, opening about:preferences#sync calls `ensureLoaded` (https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/51b3d67a5ec1758bd2fe7d7b6e75ad6b6b5da223/browser/components/preferences/in-content-new/sync.js#71), which forces Sync to start up. At that point, Sync queries FxA, which realizes it's signed in, signs an assertion for the token server, and lets sync proceed as normal.

However, I think there's another problem. Sync stores the last sync times for each engine in prefs, to avoid redownloading everything from the server on every sync. Wiping these preferences will trigger full syncs. Most of the data should be unchanged locally, so I think our reconciliation logic will pick up on that and skip upload...but I suspect we'll increase load on the server downloading every record, or introduce corruption if the server data are inconsistent.

Mark, does this theory sound correct to you?
