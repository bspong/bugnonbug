trying to open a separate tab does not do as intended at news.google.com

The webpage at news.google.com has a script that navigates clicks on links to a
new location. However, the tabbed browsing feature should disable this onclick
event when a user presses a modifier key and they click on a link.

The problem with the present behavior is that the following occurs:

1) User presses modifer key and clicks on a link such as "Science/Technology" in
order to open it in a separate tab while retaining a view of the existing page.
2) The tab is opened as desired, containing the new page.
3) The script action, which is now undesired, is performed. Thus, a view of the
existing page is not retained, and both current tab and the new tab show views
of the "Science/Technology" page.

Links which are not true links, but which work only by using a script, should
work the same as they do now. It is the problem of the web designers that the
result will not work with tabs, because they used temperamental designs.
However, links with traditional structure should work with tabs even if they
normally would cause a redirection to occur.



Other browsers' behavior:

Safari 1.0.2 does the same thing as Firefox, so it has the same problem.
IE on mac doesn't have tabs.
Presumably, Camino does the same thing as Firefox.
