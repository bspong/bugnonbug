The Lan Administrator has blocked Facebook in my office. Don't care about Facebook, but the problem is that with Firefox I cannot access sites that contain a Facebook widget such as "This site as xxx fans on Facebook" or "Share on Facebook" or "Login with Facebook ID", etc. etc.
The site starts loading, but when it gets to the widget it goes to an "Access Denied" page. This does not occur using IE7+.
I always want to use Firefox, and I don't want to have to use IE for some sites.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
The software should not load the widget or load it partially. The important thing is that the page is viewable.

This thing happens also on a specific site I visit: http://www.tvsquad.com/.
It's probably related to the ads. It loads it as if it is another page. Check it out yourselfs.

Problem started with Firefox 3.0 and it's still going on with the 3.6 version.
