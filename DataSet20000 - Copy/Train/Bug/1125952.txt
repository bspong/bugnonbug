New about:sessionrestore UI's list of tabs to restore is too small & doesn't grow to accomodate window size (impossible to keep your place when scrolling through it)
STR:
 1. Trigger about:sessionrestore with a bunch of tabs to be restored.
    (e.g. by crashing via bug 1125304 comment 2, and then restarting firefox.)
    (I don't exactly know how to *reliably* make a crash trigger about:sessionrestore on the next run, but setting browser.sessionstore.max_resumed_crashes to 0 seems to help.)

 2. Resize your window to be large. Try to scroll through the list of restored tabs.

ACTUAL RESULTS:
- The list of restored tabs stays the same size (5 lines tall), regardless of window size.
- When you scroll with your mousewheel, 3 lines are scrolled at a time -- so given the fixed 5-line height, this means the majority of the pane is *completely new* with each scrollwheel tick. This makes it impossible to keep track of your place when scrolling with a mousewheel.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- The list of restored tabs should grow to take advantage of the extra space when your window is large.
- It should also perhaps start out larger. (5 lines is not very tall, particularly given that one of the lines is occupied by "Window 1")
- (The 3-lines-at-a-time scrolling thing should also perhaps be reduced, but that's an issue that predates this new UI, and I filed bug 1125926 to cover that.)
