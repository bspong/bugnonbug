Some but not all secure pages, and occasionally non-secure pages (such as the
URL above) will bring up an alert window with "https is not a registered
protocol."  Clicking OK will repeat the alert window, this time with "httpshttps
is not...." and repeated clicks will give "httpshttpshttps..." etc.  The browser
window freezes and can only be closed with End Task.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Entered again the URL given above:
http://www.networksolutions.com/en_US/popexit/popstealth.html
2. Received the same alert window.


Actual Results:  
Repeated clicking of OK or X to close the alert window only results in expanding
the message endlessly: "httpshttpshttpshttpshttpshttpshttpshttpshttps is not a
recogized protocol"; oringinal browser window is not accessible and has to be
closed (along with the alert) with End Task.

Expected Results:  
Clicking OK (or X) on the alert window should have closed it and returned you to
the browser window.
