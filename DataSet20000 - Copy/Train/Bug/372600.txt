On restarting Firefox - bookmarks are overwritten so only half remain.  Seems to have occurred after latest FlashGot update.

Even if correct bookmark file is copied back into place - will overwrite & default back to half-file while Flashgot is enabled.

Disabling FlashGot prevents this from happening - and stops bookmark file being overwritten & allows correct bookmarks to be loaded.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.If FlashGot is enabled.
2.Close down Firefox
3.Start Firefox
On starting - Bookmark file is over written/changed to be same size each time & only half of previous Bookmarks are loaded. 

Actual Results:  
Only half of my bookmarks are displayed.
Bookmark file content is changed & overwritten to be smaller file size - as Firefox starts up.
Where there should be six subheadings/menus - the last three and their contents  are deleted from the bookmark file each time.  
File size changes to be the same each time.

Expected Results:  
Contents of the bookmark file are not usually changed or deleted on Firefox starting up - and bookmark file usually loads fine.

When FlashGot extension is disabled - Firefox bookmark file does not change or overwrite.

When FlashGot is disabled - bookmarks work fine.
------------------
NOTE - 1st bookmark backup in the backups area contains the half-deleted file - so anyone wanting to restore their bookmarks will need to look back far enough to get the appropriate complete file.
