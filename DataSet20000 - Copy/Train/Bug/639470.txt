Flash content disappearing when placed above position-fixed div
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0b12) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b12
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0b12) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b12

System specs:
- Firefox 4.0b12
- OSX 10.6.5
- Flash 10.1.102.64

The issue:
On this example page, the background consists of several "position fixed" div elements, which have a z-index that places them behind the main content of the page. In Firefox 4.0b12, when scrolling the page vertically, the flash player placed in the middle of the page sometimes disappears, leaving a black box (the background color), depending of it's position relative to the page background elemend with "fixed" position.

What works:
- Works fine in Firefox 4.0b12 on Windows XP (Flash 10.2.152.26)
- Works fine in Firefox 3.6 on OSX 10.6.5
- Works fine in Seamonkey 2.1b1 on OSX 10.6.5
- Works fine for other pages (with a same background structure) using the HTML5 video element with an ogg file.
- When the "Firebug" extension (1.7X.0b1) is installed in FF 4.0b12/OSX, the issue does not occur *as long as the Firebug tab is open*. As soon as the Firebug tab is closed, the issue occurs again.
- If the fixed background elements are set to position:absolute or to display:none, the issue disappears.

Note:
- The same issue occurs for videos displayed using the QuickTime plugin: we see the same black background instead of the video. Again, the behavior changes when expanding the Firebug tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the example URL.
2. Scroll up and down. You may need to resize your browser window to a small height, to have the ability of scrolling.
Actual Results:  
The Flash object is not displayed reliably.

Expected Results:  
The Flash object should be displayed, independently from its position in relation to the fixed background.
