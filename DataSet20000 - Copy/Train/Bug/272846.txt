removeChild behaves oddly when dealing with nodes containing form inputs

In the linked test case, clicking an X will remove the associated
table row and recalculate the total price of all the items.  This seems to be a
simple task, but it does not execute consistently or correctly.  I've observed 
the following behavior:

- When the table row removal function is called normally, an item's price input 
gets stuck although its row has gone.
- Sometimes a form input gets duplicated when its parent row is removed.
- Inserting delays (for example, alerting the ID of the input being added to the
total) increases the likelihood that the code will execute properly, but it
doesn't always work.

This script works as expected in IE 6.  To the best of my knowledge, I am not
using any nonstandard methods.

(If the test case seems like an overly complex means of handling the task at
hand, keep in mind that it's a simplified version of an interface that I'm
working on.)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type numerical values in the boxes next to the products.
2. Press the Calculate Total button.
3. Click an X next to a product.

Actual Results:  
The JavaScript calculates a new total, which is virtually always incorrect
because the form fields are not removed properly when the table rows are deleted.

Expected Results:  
It should have removed any form fields inside the element deleted via removeChild.
