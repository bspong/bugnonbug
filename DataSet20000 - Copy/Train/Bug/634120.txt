I see little to no decrease in the memory usage of Firefox after closing a tab, and there is a steady increase even while it's inactive, to the point of freezing and crashing.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b11) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b11
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b11) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b11

As the summary states, after I close a tab, there is very little decreasing in Firefox's memory usage, and most times it doesn't change.

It also seems to steadily (albeit slowly) increase as time passes, even when you're not doing anything and no pages need loading.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Task Manager to Processes (this way you can see the amount of memory being using) and start Firefox.
2. Open a new tab in Firefox to a website and wait for the typical increase in memory usage.
3. Close the tab that was just opened and monitor the change in memory usage.
4. Repeat Steps 2 & 3 as needed for confirmation.
Actual Results:  
After performing the steps, I saw a very little, or even absolutely no decrease in the memory usage of firefox.exe, and after I left it alone to watch the process, I only saw a small increase every second or so. This accumulates quickly, too.

Expected Results:  
I expected Firefox to decrease its memory usage after I'd closed a tab, but it never does.

With or without add-ons and themes, this problem doesn't seem to cease, and after a short time of use on even just a 2GHz computer, the program begins to hang and freeze, even to the point of crashing because it's using too much memory.

I've only performed this on my Windows 7 x64 computer, but it may affect other OSes as well.
