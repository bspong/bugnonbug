Add telemetry probes for tab animation smoothness
Tab animation smoothness data should be collected.

Smoothness is ultimately measured in frames per second (FPS) of the animation, however, measuring also paint times can be useful for further analysis (especially on faster systems where frames times are not always affected by changes in paint times). Frame intervals and paint times can be measured using the system from bug 826383.

I think we should have 2 main probes (and per probe, record average FPS and average paint times for each animation):

1. A case with minimal variance and controlled variables:
- E.g. newtab page open when other tabs stay put (e.g. only the 2nd or 3rd tab in a window).

2. Any tab animation - to get an overall view of the experience.
- E.g. All tab open/close, regardless if other tabs are shrunk/expanded, regardless of the URI of the tab gaining focus, etc.


Concerns raised by vladan:

A. (only applies to scenario 1) With newtab page opening together with tab animation, first/some intervals/paints would be longer than when tab animation is unaffected by other intensive computations. He suggested to trim the first few frames out of the averages.

B. To get accurate results, frames recording should not include frames which are unrelated to the tab animation. I currently think this should never happen as animation should be rendered on each presented frame, but I'll look into it to make sure.
