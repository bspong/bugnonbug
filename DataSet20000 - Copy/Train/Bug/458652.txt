Updated to 3.0.3. Requires restart of computer, even though computer was restarted
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; InfoPath.1; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; MS-RTC LM 8)
Build Identifier: Mozilla Firefox (3.0.3)

I updated Firefox to version 3.0.3, as requested by the software.
Now when I try to start firefox, I get the message box:
"Your computer must be restarted to complete a previous upgrade of Firefox. Do you want to reboot now?"
I have rebooted many times, but the message will not go away.  If I say "no", then Firefox will not open.
I tried to uninstall Firefox using "Add or Remove Programs", but I again get the same message box, and it will not uninstall.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the 3.0.3 update
2. Reboot when asked to
3. Start Firefox

Actual Results:  
I get a message saying: "Your computer must be restarted to complete a previous upgrade of Firefox. Do you want to reboot now?".  Restarting does not make the message go away


Expected Results:  
Firefox should have started.

Firefox should have started.  Is there another way to remove Firefox and start over other than "Add or Remove Programs"?
