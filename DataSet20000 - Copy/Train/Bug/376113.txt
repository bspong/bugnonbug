[win95] installer reports sufficient disk space, but says "disk full".
User-Agent:       Opera/9.01 (Windows 95; U; de)
Build Identifier: http://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-2.0.0.3&os=win&lang=de

In the (german) Installer I change "C:\Programme\Mozilla Firefox" to "D:\Programme\Mozilla Firefox" (on d: is more space left -
about 320 MB).

The dialog says "installation needs 19.0 MB, there is 321.6 MB left",
but clicking on Next gives an error message constating that there is
not enogh space left.

(It doesn't help using another drive.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. download the installer from the location given above
2. execute it.
3. accept the license
4. elect "default installation"
5. select any drive with enogh space
6. "Next"
Actual Results:  
A message box states there is not enough disk space, and I should select another location to install.

Expected Results:  
Install Firefox.

Here is a sceenshot:

(This will stay there at least until end of april, but after
that I may have to reuse the space - so make a copy of this,
if you need it.)

(I'll be offline until about 15th of april - hoping that the next
version doesn't show this bug.)
