When performing a clean install of Firefox 1.0.7, the installer places a copy of
nsIQTScriptablePlugin.xpt (Dated 09/19/05 8:37:37 AM) in the plugins directory.

This xpt is used by QuickTime, and should be installed in the components folder,
not the plugins folder.  If it should be included with the Firefox install at all.

This problem does not occur if you install 1.0.7 over a previous version of
Firefox, and also does not occur with any previous version of Firefox.

This problem occurs with both Standard and Custom Installs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Uninstall any previous version of Firefox, if one is installed.
2. Delete the Mozilla Firefox program folder
3. Install Firefox 1.0.7 using Standard or Custom.
Actual Results:  
A copy of nsIQTScriptablePlugin.xpt (Dated 09/19/05 8:37:37 AM) is installed to
the plugins folder.

Expected Results:  
npnul32.dll (Dated 09/15/05 06:26:00 PM) should be the only file in the plugins
folder.

nsIQTScriptablePlugin.xpt (Dated 09/19/05 8:37:37 AM), if it is supposed to be
included with the Firefox install at all, should be installed to the components
folder, not the plugins folder.
