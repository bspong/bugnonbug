XPCOM Event Receiver stops OS shutting down by not closing
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.8

Whenever I try to close down my Windows 98SE machine, after running Firefox 0.9
(and therefore, XPCOM Event Receiver) the OS comes up with a box saying 'Do you
want to close this program etc.' I click yes...nothing happens.
I try to close down my computer again, and the same thing happens.
I have sat there for about 1/2 an hour trying repeatedly to close down, and now
I just immediately resort to the mains switch.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bootup Windows 98SE (I don't know about other OSs)
2. Start Firefox and do a little browsing - let XPCOM Event Receiver get warmed up
3. Close Firefox, and try to shut down.
4. Try to shut down again.
5. And again.
6. Yet again.
7. You can see where this is going, can't you?!

Actual Results:  
Went round in a loop, so I pulled the mains plug in frustration.

Expected Results:  
Closed, and let the computer shut down.
