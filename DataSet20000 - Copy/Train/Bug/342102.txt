When viewing a page which uses UTF-8 character encoding that contains Chinese characters, some of the characters are displayed as "?" or they aren't displayed at all. Only some specific characters are affected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure Firefox is closed.
2. In "System Preferences > International > Format > Region", set your region to United States or Australian (or other Western/English regions)
3. Open Firefox and go to http://tandj.webndchina.com/asiancharbug.html
4. You should see the 1st Chinese character correctly (in green) but all other characters are displayed as "?" (in orange). Also the tab title (show tab bar) displays "?" for some of the characters. The window title displays the characters correctly.
Actual Results:  
Some Chinese characters are displayed as "?" on the page and in the tab title.

Expected Results:  
All Chinese characters should be displayed correctly on the page and in the tab title.

To display the Chinese characters correctly on the page:
1. Make sure Firefox is closed
2. Set your "System Preferences > International > Format > Region" to "Chinese > China" (or other Chinese region). You have to check the "show all regions" check box to see Chinese.
3. Open Firefox and go to the page http://tandj.webndchina.com/asiancharbug.html
4. You should see all the characters on the page. Although the tab title of the page (show tab bar) still displays some of the characters as "?".

I tested this on Mac OS X 10.4.6 on a MacBook Pro with the OS Language set to English and Region set to Australian/United States. The OS Language doesn't seem to have any affect on the results. Only the selected region seems to affect the results.

This was tested and reproduced with current release of Firefox 1.5.0.4 and latest Bon Echo 2.0a3 build.

When tested with latest-trunk (Minefield) it worked as expected.
