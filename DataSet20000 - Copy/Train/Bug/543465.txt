"Add a keyword for this search" does not properly escape input data.

I've built a PHP page with a POST form on it with just one text input. Input text is returned to the user with the HTTP header Content-Type: text/plain. If I type into the input field "test this+that", this is what is returned to me. If I add a keyword for the search, and type into the menu bar "keyword test this+that", what is returned to me is just "test this that". The plus sign is lost. Input data has not been properly escaped. (Similarly, input data for GET forms is not properly URL encoded when using a keyword.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add a keyword for a search (not necessarily an actual search).
2. Use the keyword to do a "search" on data containing a plus sign.

Actual Results:  
The plus sign is interpreted as a space.

Expected Results:  
The input data should be properly escaped so the plus sign is preserved as is.

(Incidentally, the equivalent function in Opera works fine.)
