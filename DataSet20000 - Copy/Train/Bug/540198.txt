Firefox will crash if compiz-fusion crashes
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; fr; rv:1.9.0.16) Gecko/2009121610 Iceweasel/3.0.6 (Debian-3.0.6-3)

Sometimes on some computers compiz-fusion may crash.  The main effects are that opened windows have no decorations anymore and that you cannot focus on them anymore.  However, all windows are still there, and if you happen to find access to a terminal or have a launcher on the desktop you just have to launch metacity or compiz-fusion again (if your system is nicely configured, it may even fall back automatically to metacity after the crash of compiz-fusion).

Unfortunately, there is one and only one program that will disappear at the very time compiz-fusion will crash : Firefox.  It used to happen back when I was using Arch Linux with Firefox 3.5, and it still happens now that I'm using Debian Lenny with Firefox/Iceweasel 3.0.6.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox within a compiz-fusion gnome session.
2. Make compiz crash.
Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should just loose its decorations, just as every other window.

Happens with Fx 3.0.6 as well as with 3.5 and on different and (mostly) unrelated distros.
