When viewing a page with multiple frames, moving the pointer over a frame sets it as the target for scroll-wheel events, but it's necessary to click in the frame for it to receive keyboard page-up, page-down, home, and end.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to a site with multiple frames
2. Adjust window size so at least one frame has a scroll bar
3. Click in a different frame
4. Hover mouse in the scrollable frame and use scroll wheel to scroll it
5. Press page-up and page-down keys without moving mouse

Actual Results:  
The frame the mouse is over scrolls when the scroll wheel is moved.  The frame that was clicked in scrolls when the keyboard is used, if it has a scroll bar; otherwise, nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
Scroll wheel and keyboard-based scrolling should use the same criteria to determine which frame they apply to.

One example of a page in which this is easily viewed is
