If default (helper) application is not available firefox will always try to save file even when "always ask" is selected.

Hi.
I experience a problem using the helper application settings in firefox 3.5.6 and seamonkey 2.0.1 (probem has been around some time).

In Edit -> preferences -> application.
i have the content: PDF document
set to take the action: Always ask.

if i expand the drop down box i can see:
Always ask
Save file
---------------
Use Okular (default)
Use xpdf
Use other
---------------
Application details



The problem is that the default application is picked up from somewhere, but is not working. Now, even if i have set the Always ask option, firefox will fall back to save file since it cannot find the default application.

If i instead set the action to be "Use xpdf", which exists in /usr/bin/xpdf
files open in xpdf, but at that point i never get a chance to choose if i want to save the file or open it.


What i think should be done is that if the default application is not found, firefox should fall back to the selected option (in my case Always ask), rather then just saving the file.
also, it seems impossible to change which application is default...(but that is another story).
