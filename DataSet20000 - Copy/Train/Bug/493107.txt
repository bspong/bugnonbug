when downloading a bigger set of images
the virus checking indicator wont vanish
and FF gets quite inresponsive

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. select a web age with lots of (small) images, e.g. an album preview of the picasa web album
2. select page informatin panel, select media tab, select all images (hold shift key and drag with cursors) -this might be some 50 images...
3. klick file download and select target location
Actual Results:  
the files are probably already in the browser cache.
they will get added to download panel in a noticeable lengthy process.
when file size meter is done a quite infinite indicator for virus checking gets diplayed.
overall responsiveness of FF is bad, especially saving other files seems to block.
closing the download panel looks inresponsve.

state remains for more than 15 minutes, probably even hours.

Expected Results:  
normal downlaod completion in a near time frame.
