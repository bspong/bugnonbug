MSWord attachments sent in Yahoo mail not seen in received message

I've checked the base, and this is similar to Bugzilla Bug 300994 but not resolved.

I send the same DOC file using the same Yahoo mail account to myself at Yahoo (and other, non-Yahoo accounts) from both Firefox and IE. The message sent from IE can be seen in both IE and Firfox with the attachment.

However, the message sent in Firefox has no attachment visible in the message window in either Firefox or IE (but, the subject line shows the correct file size and paperclip icon). It is also not visible by recipients using other mail applications on different platforms.

I've also tried this in Firefox 1.5, and the same happens. (Please note, the details on your website for 1.5 are contradictory - in places it says you need OS10.2 but in others is says 10.3 or later.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Compose a Yahoo email in IE and Firefox, attach any Word document
2. Send
3. View messages in IE and Firefox

(I can email you a message with attachment.)
Actual Results:  
Message is received, subject line shows correct file size and attachment icon (paperclip in Yahoo), but the attachment is not visible at the bottom of the message window to download if sent by Firefox.

Expected Results:  
With other file types (and DOC until yesterday around midday), there is a box with the attachment name and the option to download visible after the body text, at the bottom of the message window.

Started around midday (UK time) yesterday, 4 January.
