Open various tabs to various sites, and I end up not being able to switch to different tabs at a certain point.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open multiple websites including ebay.
2. Try switching to various sites.
3. Wait for the inability to switch to other tabs.

Alternate steps:
 
1. To take the windows installer out of system32 or after deactivating it (don't ask me how I don't want to explain but ms's site says how  use google) and then do those steps.

2. Open firefox however many times you have to till getting an application error message.

3. Don't click ok when you see it.

4. Let firefox start and load.

5. Open multiple tabs to sites.

6. Now click ok on the error message.

Actual Results:  
Was only able to use one tab.

Expected Results:  
To be able to use all the tabs.

This seems to be tied into xp's built in installer, the one Bill Gates doesn't want to fix. Somehow it get's corrupted or the registry does by products which use his stupid installer, and bizarre bugs occur. I get an error message for firefox almost everytime when starting it up which in the titlebar says, "firefox.exe - Application Error ... The instruction at blah blah referenced memory at blah blah. The memory could not be "written". Click on OK to terminate the program"

I don't click ok and firefox starts up, but I have to keep that error message to the side, ugly looking but oh well.

If I click ok then the tabs lock it seems.

I think this may be a problem with firefox if it is reliant on windows' crap installer which it seems to be, why else is it triggering the application error message?
