We use Kerberos tickets to authenticate in the system. After a ticket expires files on hard drive (i.e. home directory in which .mozilla directory is) become unaccessible. After getting a new Kerberos ticket the search engines (Ctrl+K) in firefox do not work any more, i.e. if I try to search for anything, just NOTHING happens (it is even not possible to change the current search engine to any other in the list). Restarting firefox restores full search functionality.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. On a system which uses Kerberos tickets (http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/) for authentication (used in all research organizations in physics at least) start firefox.
2. Wait till your current Kerberos ticket expires.
3. Renew your Kerberos ticket - everything is accessible again and works except firefox search engines.

Actual Results:  
Firefox search engines completely loose functionality. Restarting firefox restores full search functionality.


Expected Results:  
Firefox search engines functionality is restored after the home directory (.mozilla) access regained.
