On logging on to pcu at cpfcu.com from main site, I can walk through the log into the online banking, but cannot complete the process due to incompatibilities in browser. Their OLB module reports Firefox 3-6-3 on Windows 6.1.
The OS version is incorrect in their window (6.1 was Vista sp2). Belarc advisor 8.1 reports OS as 12.0 - and Windows should report the version as 7.0 or 7.1 for version 7.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log into cpfcu.com
2.Walk thru an online banking log on
3.Supply secret answer and password - should return improper credentials 
4.Click on supported browsers
Actual Results:  
Browsersupport page will open when clicked on from last window an report incompatible browser and/or OS.

Expected Results:  
Improper logon credentials note came up on page. 

I should have received a banking summary for each account I own, both savings and checking. 

No special themes were installed but I do have the "Add bookmark here", "forecastbar", "Roboform pro", "download sort", "download helper" and "Tab Mix Plus" installed. Winamp with application detector is also installed. Was able to log on previously when only one media player was installed, VideoLAN. 
Will test again without the winamp player installed. This will be done after the credit union unlocks my OLB account.
