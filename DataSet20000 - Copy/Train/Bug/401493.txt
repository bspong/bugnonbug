On opening .mml file I am told something like "you need the Math1, Math2, Math4 fonts, go to url http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/fonts/". On the url there are 3 links to obtain different fonts (actually only texcm-ttf were installed successfully), but none of the links contain Math1, Math2, Math4 fonts. There are Mathematica1-Mathematica7 fonts (actually installed by default on my system), but they does not help, and I get message again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a MathML file.
2. Put the path to it in the address bar.
3. When popup displayed, go to proposed url.
Actual Results:  
My page looks correctly, though it is pretty easy (attached). But every time I start the browser I get the popup which tell me that I need some fonts.

Expected Results:  
No popup if my fonts Mathematica1-7 are good, or a link to the correct fonts on the "http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/fonts/" url. 

Maybe "Math*" font names are only for Mac, while "Mathematica*" are their brothers for f****** Windows.

Thank you for great soft!
