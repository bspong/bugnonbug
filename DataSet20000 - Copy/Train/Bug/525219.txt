There are many actions a user can perform to cause a page to reload, some of
these actions don't work if the URL includes a local anchor (ie:
http://www.foo.com/bar#local_anchor)

NOTE: The page does reload correctly if you explicitly click the "reload"
button.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  

The fact that the URL inclues a local anchor should not affect wether or not
the
page reloads ... it should reload after steps 5 & 6 as well.


The URL listed in the steps to reproduce was choosen at random from Google
results, purely because if had javascript to update a timestamp with seconds
granularity, and no "Expires" info.

In the example above, the local anchor doesn't acctually exist on this page,
but
that doesn't affect the behavior.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. visit this url...
   http://www.foodallergyalliance.org/foo.html
2. click in the Location bar, and hit enter/return a few times
3. click the "Go" button a few times
4. now add a "#foo" to the end of the URL...
   http://www.foodallergyalliance.org/foo.html#foo
5. click in the Location bar, and hit enter/return a few times
6. click the "Go" button a few times
Actual Results:  
After steps 2 & 3, the page reloads each time (you can see the time stamp
update)

After steps 5 & 6, the page does NOT reload.

Expected Results:  
The fact that the URL inclues a local anchor should not affect whether or not
the page reloads ... it should reload after steps 5 & 6 as well.

The URL listed in the steps to reproduce was choosen at random from Google
results.

In the example above, the local anchor doesn't acctually exist on this page,
but that doesn't affect the behavior.
