Intermittent browser_dbg_reload-same-script.js | Timed out while polling for the scripts. followed by 10,933 other failures
The dump() is rather unpleasant, but the really unpleasant part is that while in the success case in http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/7129a1d713f4 there's a call to clearInterval(), in the failure case where we poll 50 times and spew with the dump 50 times, there's no clearInterval(), there's only the destruction of another ten thousand other tests after this one.
