set desktop background image leaks the page
I accidentally clicked on "Set as Desktop Background" yesterday, then I cancelled out. This morning while examining the cycle collector graph, I noticed that the page that I had clicked on for Set as Desktop Background was still in memory. It appears to be kept alive via a node in the chrome://browser/content/setDesktopBackground.xul document. I'll try to reproduce this later today.

If anybody else wants to try this, about:ccdump is probably the way to go ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/cycle-collector-analyzer/ ).  Basically, go to a page, do set as desktop background, cancel out of it, then close the page. Go to about:memory and run some GCs and CCs, then see if the document for the page you closed is still around.

Here's the start of the path if that is useful:

0x131da98b0 [nsGenericElement (XUL) command id='Tools:PrivateBrowsing' chrome://browser/content/setDesktopBackground.xul]
    --[[via hash] mListenerManager]-> 0x1398e9c80 [nsEventListenerManager]
    --[mListeners[i] mListener]-> 0x136db7a80 [nsJSEventListener]
    --[mScopeObject]-> 0x1208c7100 [JS Object (ChromeWindow)]
    --[]-> 0x15bac0240 [JS Object (Array)]
    --[]-> 0x12d228340 [JS Object (Proxy)]
    --[]-> 0x132ae2820 [JS Object (HTMLImageElement)]
    --[xpc_GetJSPrivate(obj)]-> 0x12ed5a510 [XPCWrappedNative (HTMLImageElement)]

From there, it connects to an img DOM node, and from there it leaks the entire page, it looks like.

It isn't just that one element of the setDesktopBackground document, there are many other ones that are being held alive somehow:

0x1352c67d0 [nsGenericElement (XUL) menuitem id='historyRestoreLastSession' class='restoreLastSession' chrome://browser/content/setDesktopBackground.xul]
0x134fa9a10 [nsGenericElement (XUL) menu chrome://browser/content/setDesktopBackground.xul]
0x134dc60d0 [nsGenericElement (XUL) menu chrome://browser/content/setDesktopBackground.xul]

The references to the XUL document itself are all accounted for, so it is just some elements of it that are being held alive somehow.
