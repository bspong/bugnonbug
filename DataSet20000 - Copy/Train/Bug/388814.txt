The URL given above is part of an online dictionary. It should display a list of radicals (the parts of Japanese kanji used for lexicographic classification). Since a lot of radicals / radical variants don't form characters of their own these days, their glyphs are rarely used outside of dictionaries.

I use FF on a PPC Mac (iBook G4 10.4.10), an Intel Mac (MacBook 10.4.10) and various Windows XP sp2 boxes. Nowhere can Firefox render all radicals correctly (i. e. not as question marks), but it's different characters in each case!

What follows is a list of browsers and the positions at which they show question marks (all in default configuration as far as fonts and such are concerned):

PPC Mac OS X 10.4.10, FF 2.0.0.4:
3:162, 4:74, 4:87, 4:140, 8:173

Intel Mac OS X 10.4.10, FF 2.0.0.4 and 2.0.0.5
1:5, 3:61, 3:162, 3:163, 3:170, 4:174, 4:187, 4:140, 8:173

Intel Mac OS X 10.4.10, Safari
no ? at all

PC Win32 XPsp2, FF 2.0.0.4: 
2:26, 3:162, 4:61, 4:74, 4:87, 4:140, 8:173

On the Windows boxes it looks like a font problem, but the Mac font firefox uses has these glyphs (copy & paste into NeoOffice is fine, as is Safari)

At least on the Intel Mac, these are not the only characters affected - they pop up quite regularly in my Google results. Maybe FF isn't using the fonts it says it is?
