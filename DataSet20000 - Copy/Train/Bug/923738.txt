Move the Awesomebar dropdown marker to the right of the go/stop/reload button.
alex_mayorga brought this up in bug 594050, comment 31, and it sounds like an idea worth considering:

The dropdown marker next to the go/stop/reload button suggests that the Awesomebar is like a combobox, but the fact that it's not immediately at the end of the bar kind of breaks that idiom.

The heatmap study from 2012 (https://blog.mozilla.org/ux/2012/06/firefox-heatmap-study-2012-results-are-in/) suggests that the dropdown marker is interacted with by ~38.4% of users vs the go/stop/reload button which is interacted with by 40.1% of users (split over 3 buttons). This suggests that users might find this button more useful than the individual go/stop/reload buttons, and perhaps we can give it more prominence by anchoring it to the end of the Awesomebar.

Also of note that one of the reasons to keep the go/stop/reload button at the end of the Awesomebar (that being that these buttons can be separated out via customization magic) is going away by default with Australis, so we can get away with tucking them one level deeper into the bar.

Totally open to argument here, but alex_mayorga has a gun to my head and is making me type this in at Moz Summit 2013 (Toronto). :)

(Also this is a super easy fix if it's one we're gonna roll with).
