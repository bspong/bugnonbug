Firefox will not connect to localhost or named LAN machine if it previously tried to connect to www.localhost.com or www.[machinename].com
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:34.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/34.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140722030201

Steps to reproduce:

Scenario A:
In a new tab, type "localhost" <enter>.
Scenario B:
In a new tab, type "localhost.com" <enter>.  After the page loads, correct the input by typeing into the url-bar with "localhost" <enter>.

Scenario B:
In a new tab, type "www.localhost.com" <enter>.  After the page loads, correct the input by typeing into the url-bar with "http://localhost/" <enter>.


Actual results:

Scenario A visits localhost as expected.
Scenario B initially visists localhost.com (currently this redirects to google, but it doesn't matter what it is, really).  After the correction to "localhost" it appears to automatically append a "/", but it actually visits loads the same page as localhost.com.
Reentering localhost and deleting the preselected "/" does actually visit localhost.
In scenario C, despite the corrected URL being complete and valid (http://localhost/), firefox nevertheless autocompletes to http://www.localhost.com/

This is much more annoying for LAN machines, because in difficult to pin-down situations, firefox automatically converts a machine name into a search or into www.[machine-name].com.  Once this happens, it's very hard to ever again enter http://[machine-name]/ - you basically need to close that tab and try again.


Expected results:

Previously mis-typed or interpreted-as-search or really any entry should not affect the address "localhost" from resolving to "http://localhost/".  Either it should also resolve or never so the UI is consistent.  Furthermore, a valid URL such as "http://localhost/" should never be silently autocorrected to http://www.localhost.com/" without recourse.

I doubt there's a security aspect to this, but if an attacker could somehow intentionally trigger this behavior (and register the appropriate www.[machine-name].com domain), this might enable phishing.
