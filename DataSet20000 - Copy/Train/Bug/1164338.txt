[marker] Styles markers should be on DoProcessRestyles, rather than Flush_Style
In this attached image, there are three big areas going, for around 400ms each. The first chunk (PresShell::Flush (Flush_Style)->RestyleTracker::ProcessRestyles) we get a marker ("Styles"), but the second two chunks we do not.

Reading all sorts of information about our layout internals, and digging through code completely new to me (so please tear apart my assumptions):

Why do we use the same area for "Styles" marker as the Gecko Profiler in PresShell::Flush for Flush_Style, but we mark "Reflow" in PresShell::DoReflow, rather than PresShell::Flush (Flush_Layout)[0]? The two giant gaps in the timeline are half Flush_Layout and half Flush_InterruptibleLayout (is this sync vs async layouts?) My understanding from reading around is Flush_Layout means it has to layout now, whereas the interruptible version can do it later if it takes too long[1]? Is DoReflow actually where the reflow is occuring? In which case, what are Flush_[Interruptible]Layout? Because those need marked somehow!
