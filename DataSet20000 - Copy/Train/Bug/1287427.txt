Steps to reproduce:

1. Visit https://community.skype.com/t5/Linux/Skype-for-Linux-Alpha-and-calling-on-Chrome-amp-Chromebooks/td-p/4434299/page/26
2. Attempt the Ctrl+L, Ctrl+F, Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Shift+T, and / (quick find) keyboard shortcuts
3. Tap Alt to call up the menu bar
4. Nothing will happen for any of those shortcuts
5. Try holding Shift and repeating the previous actions in case it works as with right-click
6. Nothing will happen
7. Switch tabs and try Ctrl+F again to make sure it's not a broken Firefox
8. It will work normally
9. Switch back and confirm it's still an issue.
10. Click "Reply" one one of the posts in the misbehaving tab and try Ctrl+F
11. It works normally, indicating it's not a bug causing the tab to be broken
12. Click the link in the breadcrumb trail to navigate the same tab back to the thread view
13. Keyboard shortcuts become non-responsive again, indicating that it's not a transient error fixed by any navigation


Actual results:

The site is able to block pretty much every predefined keyboard shortcut except those on a whitelist such as Ctrl+W and Ctrl+T... and, given the shortcuts in question, I suspect the whitelist is implemented on skype.com, not in Firefox.


Expected results:

I'm not entirely sure what would be the best option to balance the needs of normal websites and in-browser apps, but a badly written website should not have that much power to ruin a user's browsing experience.

As-is, this feels like the kind of broken functionality which led to Firefox implementing Shift+RightClick and Chrome inventing the "prevent future popups" checkbox for alert() and friends.
