Firefox hangs with a spinning pinwheel for up to 20 or 30 seconds after launch, or when performing the first bookmarks bar search

When I launch Firefox in the latest builds (since about b3), I get a spinning pinwheel, and Leopard reports that the browser is not responding.  This goes away after 20-30 seconds.  It is probably more likely to occur with multiple tabs open on launch, however I do not have very many tabs open, and the problem continues even after all tabs have long since loaded.  I get a similar hang when I first try to type a location into the location bar, although that one usually just results in extremely poor performance rather than a spinning pinwheel.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Create a window or two, with a few tabs open.
2.  Close Firefox.
3.  Launch Firefox.
4.  Get spinning pinwheel.  Can't interact with Firefox until the pinwheel goes away.  Sometimes, get hang in bookmarks bar.
Actual Results:  
Get spinning pinwheel.  Can't interact with Firefox until the pinwheel goes away.  Sometimes, get hang in bookmarks bar.

Expected Results:  
Shouldn't get browser hangs or pinwheels.

This has occurred in most recent builds of b3 (perhaps all of them?)  It did not occur before b3 if I remember correctly.
