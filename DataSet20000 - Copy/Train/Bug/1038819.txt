FF/Linux/KDE: File input field of a form does not react after a  2nd file selection or cancel
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:30.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/30.0 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:

I run FF in its latest version 30 under Opensuse Linux KDE 4.13.2. Whenever I use forms with <input type="file" ...> I experience severe problems when clicking the input elements several times : 

The KDE file selection dialog opens the first time - I can choose a file. OK. I click once again on the input field (without any submit) - the KDE file selection dialog opens again - I choose "cancel" now. Afterwards a third or fourth click on the input field does not open the file selection dialog any more. It seems that the input field is not reacting to any event any more. 

The same problem occurs when I choose a new and different file after the second click in the reopened file selection dialog. 
   


Actual results:

After the second click and a "Cancel" or selection of a new file in KDE's reopened file selection dialog the input field does not react to mouse clicks or keyboard events. 


Expected results:

The file selection dialog should open again - independent of what exactly you did the 2nd/3rd,... time in the file selection dialog. As it does in Opera, Chrome, Chromium, etc.. under exactly the same conditions. 
One can reproduce this every time with a most simple HTML file containing one simple form with a filreinput field.
