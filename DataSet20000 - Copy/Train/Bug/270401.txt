Desktop shortcuts for URLs are opened always in the same window of the browser,
when they should be opened in different windows of the default browser. There is
no way to configure this. This does not happens with other browsers. When I load
a page, then I go to my desktop  and want to open another URL, Firefox opens in
the one I am surfing. This is not the way it works with other browsers, clicking
in other URL shortcuts it makes the page open in a separate or blank browser window

one opened in step 2

window of the browser
