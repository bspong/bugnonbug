Certain tabs restore to "background" and as such cannot be closed

The most recent occurrence of this was when I opened the referenced URL.  Quicktime came up with a dialog asking whether to upgrade (or something along those lines) and when I chose cancel, Firefox crashed. (I did send a crash report, if anyone wants to try find it)

The problem itself is that after the reporting, when I chose to restore my session, the only tab as such that was obviously opened was the other one I had open.  After a while however, I music started playing out of nowhere, and upon closing another, new, tab the content being rendered was the site that caused the original problem, even though it was not amongst my tabs.  

Further experimentation showed that I could not close this "tab" either with shortcut keys or from the menu.  Also, despite not being on the main tab bar, it was listed in the dropdown on the right.  Selecting that did not provide a real tab.  I can change to other tabs, and then the only way to return to this hidden one is to close some of the others so that the problem one receives focus at whatever point.

This has happened at least once before, with a different site and if memory serves a different plugin causing the initial crash.  Unfortunately I cannot recall the exact circumstances of previous occurrences.
