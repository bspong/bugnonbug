 As written in the title an online browser game dose not work after update.Tested if it was the website by trying Internet explorer and the website worked fine there. The game works on clicking on images that i gather act like a menu but when you go to select the destination or link it dose not respond at all.

From what i can gather it may have something to do with the update its self i

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to the Pardus website (http://www.pardus.at/index.php) 
2.setup an account (free to play)
3.Follow game instructions and you will soon find it will not respond how its meant to.

Actual Results:  
What happens is you get given a small window to select tiles from but after trying to select a tile you will get no response.

Expected Results:  
The window will refresh but the small window tiles would have changed or moved.

Tested game in internet explorer and it worked fine after having problems with Firefox. Was working in Firefox before update
