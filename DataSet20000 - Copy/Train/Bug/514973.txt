In actual printouts, it's not WYSIWYG on Firefox, but only on IE.

Print Preview looks identical in both Firefox and Explorer, but only Explorer prints out like the Print Preview shows. Whereas Explorer prints out on 1 page exactly what the Print Preview shows, Firefox does not, and prints out separate parts on 4 separate pages; there's no way in Firefox to print it out WYSIWYG, but only Explorer is WYSIWYG.

Actual Results:  
See "Details" above. Firefox isn't WYSIWYG.

Expected Results:  
Firefox is supposed to be WYSIWYG, just like Explorer actually is.

It should have behaved like Explorer does. This is a "Major" flaw with Firefox, because I encounter it on so many different web pages at so many web sites; this is an area of enormous superiority of Explorer over Firefox, and unless Firefox can match Explorer on WYSIWYG performance, Firefox will remain inferior to Explorer. The problem is so bad that I have finally switched my default browser back to IE; I've finally lost patience with Firefox because Firefox isn't nearly as good on WYSIWYG as IE is.

This is not a "request for a new feature." WYSIWYG is supposed to be an existing feature of both browsers, but whereas IE is 100% WYSIWYG, Firefox falls way short of that, probably only around 95% WYSIWYG.
