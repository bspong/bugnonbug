Sun Java 6 rel. 13 / Mozilla Problem?
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Recently updated Sun Java to latest; also found that Mozilla had updated itself to 3.5.5.  Problem:  Certain Java actions on various sites wouldn't do anything AND, of allthings, the File/New Window option in Mozilla refused to open a new window.  Additionally, after exiting Firefox, Firefox wouldn't shut down; had to manually kill the app using ctrl-alt-del.

What I did:

Uninstalled Sun Java 6 rel 13.  Problem still persisted.
Manually d/l'd Mozilla 3.5.5 and reinstalled.  Problem went away.

Complicating factor:  I'd recently started going to this site to play the Flash game Drench:

Don't know if this has anything to do with anything, but having Firefox go weird on me totally freaked me out (okay, I've just dated myself into the 5th decade, so pfffft!).

Didn't dare try to reproduce this, as I need Firefox to work!

Side item:  Ran ZoneAlarm spyware/virus scan a couple of times; found nothing.


Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Haven't dared try to reproduce it.
2. Wondering if anyone else had encountered any weirdness.
3.
