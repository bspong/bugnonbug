browser_canvas-frontend-open.js leaks toolbox when running the mochitests as a standalone directory
I am trying to land --run-by-dir for devtools, it is landed for regular runs, but with e10s I had to turn it off due to:
https://treeherder.mozilla.org/logviewer.html#?job_id=4076967&repo=mozilla-inbound

I went to reproduce this locally on my linux64 development machine:
./mach mochitest-devtools --e10s browser/devtools/canvasdebugger/test

it reproduces easily and reliably:

I did a bit of test debugging and removing and found that doing this in the browser.ini will let it pass locally:
[browser_canvas-frontend-open.js]
skip-if = e10s 


of course I would rather see the root cause fixed if that is easy.
