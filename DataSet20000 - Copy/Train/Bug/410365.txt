Whenever I zoom with ctrl+mousewheel in firefox, the system hangs. If I zoom say 4 or 5 clicks on the wheel, the window will gray out and it takes about 20 seconds to catch up. Same problem if I hit ctrl++ or ctrl+- more than 3 times in a row. No other significant speed problems on the whole system.  It just slows down when zooming in firefox.  The amount of text on a page affects the problem, i.e. zooming www.google.com is faster than en.wikipedia.org, however google is also very slow.  No problems on same system with windows firefox.  Same problem on other PC with ubuntu 7.10.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Zoom with mouse wheel to a much larger or smaller size than default to cause heavy slowdown.
2. Zoom with ctrl++ or ctrl-- 1 time to cause minor slowdown
3. Zoom with ctrl++ or ctrl-- 3 times or more to cause increasingly drastic slowdown.
Actual Results:  
Depending on the amount of zoom, system slows down more and more.

Expected Results:  
The zoom should be very quick, anything less than 4 or 5 zoom increments quickly should not be noticably slower.  Should work the same as windows firefox.
