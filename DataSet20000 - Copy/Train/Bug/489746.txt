You can go to "http://www.starshipctm.com/morehead/index.php?pg=allsongs" to see the list of songs available.  Same results for all songs (there are a few which are not functioning as I am in the process of changing the underlying format)

I'll be putting it as a "Normal" severity but I must say that if it isn't fixed soon I'll be taking my Firefox recommendation off of my pages.
