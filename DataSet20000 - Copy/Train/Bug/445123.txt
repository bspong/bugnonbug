Bookmarks become dead unmovable & non-editable blocks in my bookmarks toolbar and folders

When I click on the star to edit the bookmark all information is blank. I can't move or place the affected links anywhere. After repeatedly trying to add a particular bookmark back into my toolbar that I managed to remove using a synchronization program the bookmark did not appear. Upon restarting restarting browser all attempts that appeared to have done nothing appear as several clones with correct titles. Attempting to delete any of those clones will not do anything as the delete function appears to not have any affect with these certain bookmarks. Checking the properties in order to fix the link shows that there is no information for the bookmark, not even the title which is clearly visible within my Bookmarks Toolbar. Dragging is bookmarks doesn't do anything. I've been using Firefox 3 for awhile now and I'm not sure what could be causing it. I've run Firefox in Safe Mode with all forms of combinations of the different options, including disabling all add-ons and still the bookmarks in question remain dead blocks within my bookmarks toolbar. Trying to delete bookmarks in the Organize Bookmarks area also is impossible.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox.
2. Attempt to use one of two particular bookmarks within my toolbar.
3. After that fails, attempt to edit bookmark.
Actual Results:  
Bookmark does not follow link. Properties for said bookmarks appear blank in all fields.

Expected Results:  
For the bookmarks to work as they have for all previous weeks of existence.
