I have two soundcard devices loaded (pc-Speaker and the on-board sound card):
daniel@venus:/$ aplay -l
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
card 0: pcsp [pcsp], device 0: pcspeaker [pcsp]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 1: NVidia [HDA NVidia], device 0: AD198x Analog [AD198x Analog]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 1: NVidia [HDA NVidia], device 1: AD198x Digital [AD198x Digital]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0

In xine, amarok, skype, etc. I can select the output device like this: default:CARD=NVidia

But in Firefox this is not possible. Firefox always uses the first soundcard.
Only if my systems loads the NVidia soundcards first (card 0) I can hear sound. The load order is random at system startup.
