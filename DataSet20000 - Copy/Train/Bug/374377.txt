The Add Bookmark dialog box has a silly expando UI element. i propose a simpler way of doing it that provides more functionality.

Please get rid of the drop down menu and the expansion dohicky and instead:
Have current tree/folder widget be made resizable
Have the dialog window be resizable.

That should take care of the people who want to keep the window short, and take care of the people who want it expanded, and take care of the people who want it really really expanded.

It reduces the number of elements in the add bookmark dialog box, and it avoids the current duplication of the dropdown and list.

Thanks for your time --Aaron

This might.. be in the real of hack that I can handle.. so assign the bug to me if you hate the idea and I'll try to make an extension demonstrating it.. (Might be a while though before I get to it)


btw, I added all of the  keywords that I searched with in my short description, which resulted in not finding another copy of this..  It may look redundant, but it's there to aid in reducing duplicate bugs.
