Whenever i use Firefox, it consumes more 905 of my CPU usage, but still works very slow. Even to switch a tab it takes more than 5 secs. And also after closing the browser application the CPU utilization by firefox.exe is more 90%, the doesn't end until i manually stop it in the task manager.. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start firefox
2.browse few websites with tabs
3.then the problem occurs until i stop firefox.exe manually in task manager
Actual Results:  
the computer becomes unresponsive for sometimes or very very slow until i stop firefox.exe in the task manager

Expected Results:  
Firefox should use less CPU resource and the process firefox.exe should terminate when i quit the browser.

i'm using everything default..
