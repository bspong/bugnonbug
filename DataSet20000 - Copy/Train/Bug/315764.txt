Browser reads CSS file but fails to follow font color instructions eg
table {
font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
font-size:	0.90em;
font-weight:	bold;
color:	darkgreen;
}
color portion of the above instructions are ignored.

In fact other font color instructions ignored as well.

Font color instructions unlike other font related instructions dont have prefix font eg: font-size, but just color, which is by default relates to fonts. May be this is a reason.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create CSS (stylesheet) file with the contents described
2. Create HTML document with the link to CSS stylesheet and a table with some text in it
3. 

Actual Results:  
Table fonts remain black. It's not good for the sites with black background

Expected Results:  
Table fonts should be automatically changed to darkgreen

I have tried different instructions for the font color using hexadecimal and RGB, same result. It is not only table fonts are affected, but all other CSS elements which contain color instructions eg body, links etc say in the following CSS instructions color: brown will be ignored and the link by default remains blue
A:link	{	
	text-decoration:	none;
	color:	brown; 
	}
