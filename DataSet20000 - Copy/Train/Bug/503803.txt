Page up or down or space bar all inoperative on 'stale' tabs: only scroll bar & button function

For about the last 3 years and still a problems in both Windows Vista and Ubuntu Linux 9.4 as well as previously when using SUSE, the following controls (although mostly effective immediately after a page loads) stop being effective after a while: 1) page up; 2) page down; and, 3) space bar.

On both/either OS, I typically operate with 5 - 8 windows present; each with 6 - 30 tabs open; many open continuously for days.  Whereas the three controls typically operate correctly initially (right after loading), FF invariably ceases to respond to those three keys after the page becomes 'stale' (an indeterminate period of time).

I assume this happens to me because I typically leave my computers on indefinitely along with FF, for periods of many days and possibly 2 - 3 weeks.

One can typically get rid of the problem by reloading the page.  It's obviously not a showstopper but it erodes user confidence in the application coding.

I did not see this problem listed before submitting this bug but for me, it's been around what seems like forever.  I gather this problem must be difficult to reproduce much like the memory leaks. 

Good luck & best regards.  

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open lots of windows and tabs.
2.Refer to these pages/tabs 2 - 5 days later.
3.Try the problem keys starting with the space bar because that's usually the normal page/window down key.
Actual Results:  
as above

Expected Results:  
as above

page up; page down; page down
