Academic scientists are asked to review manuscripts. Each journal has its own site on the "manuscriptcentral" website. The journal CHEST and the journal American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine send emails asking if I will review a manuscript. Firefox allows me to get into the REVIEWER CENTER of "manuscriptcentral" for both of the journals. However, when I click on the words that should provide an upload of the pdf file, Firefox hangs up and I am unable to upload. If I switch to Internet Explorer, both journals' pdf files upload quickly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. One must be invited by medical journal to review a manuscript
2. One gets a login and password
3. One logs into the journal's site
4. One is admitted to the REVIEWER CENTER on Firefox
5. One then attempts to click on html words to upload the pdf file

Actual Results:  
pdf file always fails to upload -- Firefox just gets hung up in the process.

Expected Results:  
pdf did not upload

If Mozilla were to contact the medical journals' IT people, (CHEST and American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine) you might find what is blocking the upload of their material. I have already emailed both journals IT people and told them of this problem.

I wish to continue to use Firefox, because I want to avoid IE. However, I must use IE to actually upload the medical manuscript files. Then I switch back to Firefox.
