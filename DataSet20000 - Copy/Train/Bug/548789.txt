Hotmail and Firefox 3.5.8 ("return" button won't work properly) and Firefox 3.6 (transfert of message is almost impossible)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; fr; rv:1.9.1.8) Gecko/20100202 Firefox/3.5.8 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

You recommend to go to Firefox 3.6. But this new version does not allow Hotmail to work properly : transfert of messages is difficult, not to say impossible.
When I want to transfer a message, I click on "transfer" button, and the page that opens is just blank.
I have tried to inform you of that many times times but the problem persists, whereas on IE8 (I am obliged to use Internet Explorer again...) there is no such a problem.

After having uninstalled Firefox 3.6, I went back to 3.5, trying to get 3.5.7 again, but unsuccessfully.
Had no choice but to install 3.5.8.
And then the problem is the "return" button, top left of the screen.
After opening a hotmail page, I cannot use this "return" button anymore, and I am obliged to click on the hotmail choice i.e. "sent messages", but it is not as convenient as using "return" button.

I cannot be 100% affirmative, but I think that was not happening on Firefox 3.5.7

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open the message on hotmail (with Firefox 3.6)
2. click on "transfer"
3. the page is white and there is nothing to be done
