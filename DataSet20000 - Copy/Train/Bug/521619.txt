No way to disable dialog box when clearing history in 3.5 [regression]
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20091007 Ubuntu/9.10 (karmic) Firefox/3.5.3

When clicking the "Clear Recent History" (Ctrl+Shift+Del) in Firefox 3.5, a dialog box appears which asks you to select the type of information to clear. However, there is no way to bypass this dialog box.

In Firefox 3.0, there was an option to "Ask me before clearing private data" that could be deselected. In Firefox 3.5, this option is missing.

Having to accept this dialog box every time you clear history is very annoying. If developers are testing applications and they want to clear cookies, cache etc. They either have to go through the extra click of accepting the clear history dialog box or close Firefox altogether.

A workaround could be to include a checkbox in the dialog box saying "Don't ask me again."

Another workaround could be to include a setting in about:config that disables the dialog box.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set custom privacy settings.
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+Del or Tools>Clear Recent History.
3. A dialog box appears asking what data you want to clear.
Actual Results:  
There is no way to bypass the dialog box that appears. This is a click regression from Firefox 3.0. Developers may have to accept this dialog hundreds of times during testing. This is extremely annoying.

Expected Results:  
Including a setting that allows the user to disable/bypass this dialog box.

There is a plug-in that allows this behavior: Sanitisminau

This is evidence that the regression was significant enough to make a plug-in workaround.
