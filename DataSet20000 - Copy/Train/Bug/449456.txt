Upon first startup of Fikrefox 2.0.0.15 and Firefox3 the browser does not go to the correct home page url. The pref setting for home page is set in users prefs.js

user_pref("browser.startup.homepage", "http://www.google.com/");

However the browser defaults to the home url in lib/browserconfig.properties instead and will never go to the url in "browser.startup.homepage" unless it is set by the firefox-->tools-->options-->HomePage. After manually setting it there then browser will then go to the home page. I have done that and ran a diff against the files and cannot find any changes in the pref files after manually setting the home page. This problem/bug first appeard in Firefox 2.0.0.15 and I have also noticed Firefox 3.0 has this issue. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install firefox 2.0.0.15 or Firefox 3.0 with an autoconfig.js setting the users "browser.startup.homepage setting. This should set the users prefs.js upon first startup without a ~/.mozilla directory.

2. Launch firefox, verify that it puts the home directory tab in the default url and not the one set by autoconfig.js.

3. Use tools-->options-->home-page to set the home directory. Actually autoconfig.js will set the new home url there already. However the browser will not go there when user clicks the homepage button and instead goes to orig default home page.

4. Reset the home page under options-->tools--home-page and the browser will then to to that url after it is manually reset using the gui.
