Implement FHR measures & feedback for developer tools usage
Telemetry is not going to provide us with an accurate picture of developer tools usage because it is off by default in release channel. Instead I'm proposing to introduce a minimal set of measures into FHR for developer tools usage to give us a more accurate picture of absolute user numbers and usage frequency.

Roughly what I want is the equivalent of our existing probes for the major tools, but collected by FHR:

DEVTOOLS_TOOLBOX_TIME_ACTIVE_SECONDS

DEVTOOLS_INSPECTOR_OPENED_PER_USER_FLAG
DEVTOOLS_INSPECTOR_TIME_ACTIVE_SECONDS
DEVTOOLS_INSPECTOR_OPENED_BOOLEAN

DEVTOOLS_NETMONITOR_OPENED_BOOLEAN
DEVTOOLS_NETMONITOR_OPENED_PER_USER_FLAG
DEVTOOLS_NETMONITOR_TIME_ACTIVE_SECONDS

DEVTOOLS_RESPONSIVE_OPENED_PER_USER_FLAG
DEVTOOLS_RESPONSIVE_OPENED_BOOLEAN
DEVTOOLS_RESPONSIVE_TIME_ACTIVE_SECONDS

DEVTOOLS_STYLEEDITOR_OPENED_BOOLEAN
DEVTOOLS_STYLEEDITOR_OPENED_PER_USER_FLAG
DEVTOOLS_STYLEEDITOR_TIME_ACTIVE_SECONDS

DEVTOOLS_JSDEBUGGER_TIME_ACTIVE_SECONDS
DEVTOOLS_JSDEBUGGER_OPENED_PER_USER_FLAG
DEVTOOLS_JSDEBUGGER_OPENED_BOOLEAN

DEVTOOLS_WEBCONSOLE_OPENED_PER_USER_FLAG
DEVTOOLS_WEBCONSOLE_TIME_ACTIVE_SECONDS
DEVTOOLS_WEBCONSOLE_OPENED_BOOLEAN

We should probably only report the existence of this data. For the about:healthreport side of this, what seems to fit is this:

* if the toolbox or responsive design view has never been opened, nothing should be shown to the user.
* if we do have data for the toolbox or responsive design view, we should show the user something similar to the 'This Month' section on the side with a 'Time open' number for total time open ( based on DEVTOOLS_TOOLBOX_TIME_ACTIVE_SECONDS ) as well as a 'Favourite Tool' item showing which tool the user has spent the most time in ( the leader for the  *_TIME_ACTIVE_SECONDS measures ).

Aside: I think it would be interesting to create an add-on that implemented about:webdevlopement or similar that provided the user with more in-depth details on their usage as well as links to MDN resources.
