tab restore function makes browser jam on starting (FF 3.6)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; nl; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Ever since I updated my Firefox to version 3.6 it often jams when starting. This only happens when I have the function to restore tabs on. (The ones that were open when you last closed FF)
On starting, Firefox will open, show the tabs that were open, and then jam. The only solution then is to close Firefox trough task manager and restart it. On restarting, it will jam AGAIN, and you will have to go to task manager again to close it.
On the second restart it will show the page that FF couldn't restore the tabs and ask you if you want it to try to restore them anyway.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open one or more tabs
2. Close Firefox
3. Restart Firefox
Actual Results:  
Firefox starts, opens the tabs that were open when it was last closed, and the jams.

Expected Results:  
Not jamming would be nice.

The only thing that was changed was updating my Firefox from 3.5 to 3.6. After that, this bug started occurring.
Reverting to 3.5 would fix the problem, but going backwards isn't really an option either, is it?
