Tabs are not rendered correctly with FF3 under KDE

This is not restricted to tabbed browsing, but affects everything where tabs appear (so even on a fresh profile, simply open "Edit->Settings" and go to the "Advanced" page, which also has tabs - the 3rd screenshot on the provided URL shows this). This only reproduces on Linux with KDE running (proved on 2 installations) - crosschecked with some other installations of FF3 on Linux (using 1xGnome, 1xFVWM and the last one FluxBox) did not bring up this issue.

On KDE, it looks worst with KDE defaults. Switching the default behaviour to let GTK apps use their own themes and colors (and tell them to use the "Human" theme) makes it less nasty, but still not going away (this can be done by opening the KDE control center, opening the "Appearance" screen, select "GTK Styles and Fonts" and apply the described changes here.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox 3.x
2. Go to "Edit->Preferences", select "Advanced" and see
3. or: Install TabMixPlus, edit the settings to have tabs displayed in multiple rows, and open enough tabs to make the line wrap
Actual Results:  
Tab height seems to be incorrect - except for the active tab, which then looks like a top-down T (see screenshots in URL provided). Inactive tabs are all to small (looking like cut-off).

Expected Results:  
Tabs having normal size - i.e. looking the same as with other window managers
