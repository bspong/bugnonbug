After FF detects updates to add-ons at upstart, user is presented with a dialog to install, cancel or skip the installation. "Skip" is placed where a user assumes continue to be [bottom right] , often preventing intended upgrade and irritating users (I just became a plurality). Assuming the placement is to make users aware of what they do, I think there are better ways to convey that notion with an additional are-you-sure bugger a la windows. It's bad too, just not as bad...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Leave your browser outdated. 
2. Start it. 
3. Grind your teeth when the update you *wanted* to install got skipped and you have to restart your browser to get back to the update. 
Actual Results:  
Unupdated misery

Expected Results:  
Instantly updated with the latest security patches, new fancy features, and fast spreading extension-distributed viruses. All that by just hitting yes/continue/install 

I have been using Shiretoko/FF 3.0.10 in concert, triggering the add-on update dialog quite a bit, and I'm not sure which one version I used when it happened. I believe it happens in all versions that support add-on updating...

Delicious toolbar is being updated fairly often.
