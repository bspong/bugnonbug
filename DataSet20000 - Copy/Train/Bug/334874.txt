I can't believe this hasn't been reported a hundred times, but I can't find any relevant bugs, nor could I find instructions online about doing this by manually editing configuration files, so...

I want a way to increase (or simply set) the limit on the maximum number of cookies stored by Firefox beyond the current (reported) limit of 300.  The reason: I have set up accounts at hundreds of related websites that I would like to visit in a systematic way on a regular basis (i.e., run through all of them in the same day, a few times a month).  I'd like to be able to log in to all of them and have all the cookies persist for the maximum amount of time (expiration date on each cookie is one month after creation date).  Unfortunately, by the time I finish logging in to the last of the sites, the earlier ones have already lost their cookies, so I have to log in again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create accounts at over 300 websites that use cookies to "remember" you on your next visit.
2. Log in to all of the sites.
3. Revisit the first few sites you logged in to.

Actual Results:  
The sites don't remember you, so you have to log in again.

Expected Results:  
The sites do remember you, so you don't have to log in again until the site's cookies actually expire according to their set expiration date.
