Some widgets are showing the entire spritesheet in the nav-bar.
This was reported by beautiful_people on Reddit[1].

Here's a screenshot of what this user is experiencing: http://i.imgur.com/ZAukmwT.png

Some relevant comments of that Reddit post:

"As far as I can tell, it isn't a button at all. There is no missing button on my toolbar, I can't click it or remove it with the customize tool."

"i removed the google search box, which somehow inserted itself onto my toolbar - it isn't part of my normal config. now clicking on the errant sprite puts the first item in my bookmarks toolbar items into "clicked" state, but takes me to my homepage. i can drag the extra sprite off my toolbar and into the customizer and it shows up as bookmarks, but also remains on the toolbar.

edit: dragged the extra sprite off again using the customizer, this time it showed up as the 'home' button and went away for good. in my normal config, i don't have a home button on my toolbar either.

so to summarize:

* first time removing the extra sprite, did nothing.
* second time removing the extra sprite, it turned into a button called 'bookmarks'. this is apparently not the same thing as 'bookmarks toolbar items', which have remained on my toolbar as they should.
* third time removing the extra sprite, it turned into the home button."

The user was able to fix the icon after fiddling, but a recent start-up of UX is showing the problem again. The user PM'd me their browser.uiCustomization.state:
