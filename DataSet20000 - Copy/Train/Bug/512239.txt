Firefox error message fix
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2

I am running Firefox 3.5.2 on windows XP.

The version is: (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv: 1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2

When windows recovers after a crash and firefox is restarted it starts with a message like this:
"Well, this is embarrassing....."

I request you that please, please do not use such unprofessional error messages. It might be a good way to express humour, but for most users out there on the edge concerned about malware and other viruses, this message rings alarm bells as if some virus has taken over the computer (because these kind of soft humor messages are usually associated with malware, prompting for some follow up action). This is all the more alarming as it happens after a crash.

Please, please use only professional error messages. 

"Firefox encountered a problem while trying to restart..."
or 
"Firefox could not recover from a previous failure..."

etc...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Windows XP crash when firefox is running (crash unrelated to firefox)
2. Windows XP restart
3. Restart firefox to get the "Well this is embarrassing..." error message
