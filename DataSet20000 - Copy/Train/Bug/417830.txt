Multiple pop-ups should be opened when adding a site to the whitelist

When pop-ups are blocked, you can add the site to the whitelist via the pop-up bar at the top. However, there is no way to re-pop-up the blocked pop-up. Often, this is not a problem, but this can happen for single instance pop-ups.

And in either case, it would seem to be ideal to do things that way. We can anticipate "most" (I use that word loosely) users' next actions: after allowing a site, we will want the pop-up that triggered the toolbar in the first place. :)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to http://www.popuptest.com/popuptest1.html.
2. 6 pop-ups are hidden.
3. Approve popuptest.com to allow pop-ups.
Actual Results:  
Pop-ups are allowed, but the 6 previously blocked are not accessible.

Expected Results:  
The 6 pop-ups that triggered the pop-up bar would be opened at this point.

Some sites have pop-ups that are one-time only, and while this is bad behavior IMO, Firefox should handle these situations gracefully.
