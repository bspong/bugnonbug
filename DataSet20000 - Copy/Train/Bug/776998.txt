[gcli] Behavior when part of a command is entered is unhelpful
I was looking for the first time at the Developer Toolbar, tried to explore it and found it a bit difficult to discover the functionality.

One issue is that if I enter "help" I get a list of top-level commands, but I expected to be able to use those top level commands (instead really each one requires further help in order to use it).  For instance, if I enter "console" then nothing happens, and hitting Enter is ignored – no error, help, or anything at all.  Some of the commands (like inspect) do show a little bit of help.

In many cases I think there could be a default.  For instance, if you enter "console" you could treat that as "console open".  "cookie list" and "addon list" also make sense – and ideally you'd default to these *and* show the other commands available.  Kind of like git does.  Another approach would simply be to do something to indicate that more input is required.

Making "console help" etc work would also be helpful here – when I realize I've entered something I don't know how to use I now have to rewrite "console" into "help console".  Help could also be a default – if I enter "console" and hit enter, you could leave the text in the input box but also show help in a popup.
