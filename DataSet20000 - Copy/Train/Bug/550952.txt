All my bookmarks are gone. Instead, when I click on Bookmarks, 19 occurrences of "Keri Fitzgerald com ... e Olympics, now this?"  When I click on Bookmarks Toolbar, 5 more occurrences of same text appear.  When I try to restore, just get a message that it can't be done but not WHY.  Trying to add or import Bookmarks doesn't work--no messages, nothing but no new Bookmarks. Under Tools/Add-ons, Extensions is empty.  Under Bookmarks/Organize Bookmarks,  Library is empty.  

I have no idea what happened or when.  I don't know what to do to even try to fix this mess.  I attempted to follow steps in Help for Lost Bookmarks but nothing works.
