Contextual Menu item "Open Link in a New Window" sometimes opens a new window reduced to the size of an icon [32x32 pixels or 48x48 pixels]. In an 8 hour browsing session this happened about 10 times out of approximately 500 "Open Link" operations.

Most of the links were from a "Google Products" page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. on a system with multiple monitors in a new blank browser on the main [menu bar] screen
2. enter a product search term in the google search tool
3. scroll down to the google product comparison link and "Open Link in a New Window"
4. sort by total price
5. select the best [trustworthy] link and "Open Link in a New Window"
6. some links open normally and some open reduced to the size of an Icon 


Actual Results:  
some links open reduced to the size of an Icon 

Expected Results:  
the links should open in a new window of the same size as the parent window and positioned in the normal cascade window position.

This bug may be connected to another bug where "Open Link in a New Window" does not open a window if the active window is not on the main [menu bar] monitor.
