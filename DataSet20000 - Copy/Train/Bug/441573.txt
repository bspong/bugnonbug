Whenever multiple Firefox windows on the Windows Vista OS, the windows cannot be minimized, maximized, or closed. The - button doesn't work at all, the "restore down" (make window smaller) button just constantly flashes upon clicking but does absolutely nothing and the closing button (X) also flashes upon clicking and does nothing. Works only when multiple (2 or more) windows of Firefox are opened.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Mozilla Firefox: Wait for page to load up.
2.Start Mozilla Firefox again (for a second page): Wait for page to load up.
3.Try to minimize, maximize, close, or make the window smaller, but they don't work.
Actual Results:  
None of the top-right-hand-corner buttons work.

Expected Results:  
It should have maximized/minimized, made the window smaller/bigger, or closed it upon clicking the buttons.

Occurs with default theme (have not tried with 3rd party themes yet) and happens only on Windows Vista OS (tried on XP but the buttons work fine there). The only way to reasonably work around it is to either select the page and press Alt+F4 or press Ctrl+Alt+Dlt, select the Task Manager, and End the Process.
