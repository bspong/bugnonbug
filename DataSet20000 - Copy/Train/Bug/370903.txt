I have an Administrator account in my laptop with Vista Home premium, i have already disable the UAC feature and turn off the windows firewall to have a better test on my problem:

When i open firefox everything works perfect, but after a few minutes around 10-15 no page will load, the progress bar doesn't move and i got a timeout in every page i have open, if i try the same page in IE7 it loads ok and if I close firefox and open it again it starts working again for a few more minutes.

As an additional information when i close firefox the application closes normaly but an extra firefox.exe process keeps there which i have to kill by the task manager.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox 
2. Use it normally for about 10 15 minutes
3. It stops loaing any page
Actual Results:  
Firefox doesn't load any page either new or even reload a page which i already have open.



Expected Results:  
Continue its normal function loading the web pages.

I check my router for any internet related problems and there was none, also I opened IE7 and load some pages there and the same on firefox when firefox got the problem and IE7 continued working ok.

I turn off the windows firewall off.

I have a windows vista enterprise computer at work which doesn't present the same problem, i just have this problem in my vista home premium computer.

Also my vista home premium doesn't have any add-in, it just add "Adblock plus" which i remove and also i reinstall firefox.
