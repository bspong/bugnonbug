I originally posted this as a minor issue in the general section, but its possible it is a security issue.

The passwords in Firefox memory sometimes disappear until it is restarted.

When they disappear they are not visible even in tools > options > security > etc

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. (See previous bug report)
2.

The problem may be associated with files uploaded to a website.

I have some websites dealing with local corruption issues. Recently a local (Alaskan) who is very involved in researching corruption issues offered me a load of files for the website. I uploaded them, unzipped them on the server, and have reason to think the problem may be there.

The files are all just news clippings, but it may be someone inserted some malware into them on his computer and I then put it on the site, and now the site does something weird with Firefox's password memory.

The files that seem odd are the following at alaskanpolitics.info

The cpanel for the site is accessed through a different domain, but has the same ip 174.120.152.194

I've been off the computer the last day and have not yet cleared the browser history, but I will experiment to see what else I can do to reliably reproduce the problem.
