Unquoted path to Firefox executable written to HKCR\FirefoxHTML\shell.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040704 Firefox/0.9.0+

When Firefox writes the default value to the registry key
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\FirefoxHTML\shell\open\command], it does so without quotes.
On some systems it uses a short path, but when there is no short path the full
path will be used unquoted, even though spaces can appear. This means, for the
default installation path, that something called C:\Program.exe or C:\Program
Files\Mozilla.bat, etc., would be executed before C:\Program Files\Mozilla
Firefox\firefox.exe. This has minor security implications (hence the restriction
on regular users writing to these locations under modern versions of Windows).

Regardless of the security implications, there are bugs here. I'm bothered that
the short path is written to the registry by default. It also pops up in error
messages (like those due to the annoying default-registration bugs). The
registration as default browser doesn't seem to report errors, by the way, even
when ran without admin permissions (where it didn't work properly). Probably,
the whole of the registration code should be reviewed by a professional Windows
developer.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log on as a user that's a member of 'Administrators' or 'Power Users' or has
appropriate permissions.
2. Delete the HKCR\FirefoxHTML registry key, if it exists (make a backup, yadda
yadda - other apps get here, so maybe restore it later).
3. Set IE as default browser to subvert the Fx check, then set Fx as the default
browser.
Actual Results:  
Unquoted filenames are written to the values under the key mentioned above, such
as the icon path and the shell\open\command key (and print, etc?).

Expected Results:  
Nothing left to chance.

As mentioned before, the short file name seems to be written to the registry on
some systems. I haven't investigated this (it could be caused by something the
installer does, or something the OS does, etc.), but that doesn't seem right.

Short filenames can be disabled under XP by running:
  fsutil behavior set disable8dot3 1
or by setting the appropriate reg key (see the KB). The regkey exists on Win2k
at least. Read about this before changing anything.
