Firefox installer should be signed to suppress Internet Explorer Security Warning (XP SP2)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10

In Windows XP SP2 Microsoft added some security enhancements to Windows XP. 
Specifically this security warning is a new feature, added to make it less
probable spyware applications will be installed by accident.  When the Firefox
installer is downloaded from the mozilla.org site using the "Run" option in
Internet Explorer, the following warning appears.

**********

Window Title: Internet Explorer - Security Warning

The publisher could not be verified.  Are you sure you want to run this software?

Name: Firefox%20Setup%201.0PR.exe
Publisher: Unknown Publisher

Choice One: Run / Choice Two (Default): Don't Run

This file does not a have a valid digital signature that verifies its publisher.
 You should only run software from publishers you trust.  How can I decide what
software I want to run?  (The last sentence is a link to a related help topic).

***********  

I believe this is a problem now that SP2 is public.  I have no idea what the
process is to obtain a digital signature but I believe that Firefox's installer
should have one in order to not confuse novice users.  I think that having to
deal with this warning detracts from the idea that Firefox is more than secure
than Internet Explorer because the computer is telling us that this software may
not be safe.  This error only appears on Windows XP SP2, earlier versions of XP
and other versions of Windows' Internet Explorers do not have this security
warning.  What's more, Don't Run is the default option.

Clicking Run launches the installer with no problems.

Click Don't run causes the security window to disappear and the install to never
 start.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Service Pack 2 for Windows XP
2. Launch Internet Explorer 6
3. Click the download for Firefox on the mozilla.org site
4. Click Run is the displayed dialog box

Actual Results:  
The dialog box discussed in the details appears.

Expected Results:  
I belive Internet Explorer has a similiar screen but with pretty check marks
that says the publisher is verfied when a digital signature is present.

This bug may be in the wrong place, if it is I appoligize.
