When I log into my Windows file, and Try to start Firefox it takes a while
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2

So I log into my Windows file, I wait for every thing to load, once that Happens then I start up firefox, It takes like a minute (sometimes a little longer) to start up. And Also if I log into my file, then I go and watch tv, till commercial (15 min) then i go back, and I know for sure my comp loaded, so when I start up firefox, it takes like a minute or longer, but when i start up IE, it starts up after I click on it. This Problem isn't happening on my Windows vista laptop, but on this Windows Xp comp! And this problem DIDN't Happen with Firefox 3, it started happening with Firefox 3.5. 
ALSO! So once I close Firefox, then I open it back up (like pretend I forgot to do something), then it loads when I click on it. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into My file in Windows
2. Wait for my comp to Load
3. Start up Firefox, then it takes a minute or longer to load
Actual Results:  
Firefox Takes a minute to load, but AFTER that, if I close firefox, then I open it back up, it will open up once I click on it. This problem started happening in Firefox 3.5. Oh and in Firefox 3.5.1, it loaded quicker (in firefox 3.5it took 2 minutes or longer), and now I have Firefox 3.5.2, I thought it would fix the problem, it made it a little faster when I open up firefox, but didn't fix it completely 


I know it's not the Add ons, I have the exact same Add ons on my Windows Vista Laptop Firefox 3.5.2, and It loads when I click on it.
