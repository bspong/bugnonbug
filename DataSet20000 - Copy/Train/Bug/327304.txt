The criteria for Firefox not retaining session history for forms seem to not be tilted enough in the data-retention direction. I've had many instances of filling in a form to submit a comment, clicking a link before hitting submit, and then going back (via Back button) and finding my form cleared. It seems that Firefox is reloading pages instead of using the already-loaded page in much wider circumstances than, for example, Safari. 

Perhaps the criteria for retaining form session history can be expanded. Losing form data just by looking at another page then going back does result in a lot of pain for users who can easily lose large quantities of data.

There are other bugs that mention this, but they don't seem to directly address just how frequently this can occur, nor do they describe what the criteria are for dropping form data. One bug is #303638.

Is there a document that explains this choice, if it truly was a choice to drop data so often?

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a site with a form (example: http://babelfish.altavista.com/)
2. Type in some information.
3. Click a link (or choose a bookmark) to load another page.
4. Go Back.
5. Realize everything you had typed in is gone.
Actual Results:  
Data loss.

Expected Results:  
Data retention.

Now, I understand there are cases where form data should not be retained, but it seems to me that the examples I mentioned are NOT cases where form data should be disposed.
