Dragging and dropping links to tab bar does not strip whitespace...

If you highlight a url that is not a hyperlink, (either because you are viewing a plain text document or the url is simply not wrapped in an <a> tag) and drag it to an empty space on the tab bar, a new tab is opened with the link you selected.  However, if you accidently highlight additional whitespace on either side of the url and drag that to the tab bar, nothing happens.

For example, if you came across a plain text url like http://www.example.com/path/file.ext in a document, highlighted "http://www.example.com/path/file.ext", and dragged the highlighted text to the tab bar, a new tab will be created with that url.  If you were to highlight " http://www.example.com/path/file.ext", "http://www.example.com/path/file.ext ", " http://www.example.com/path/file.ext ", or any other combination of text that includes the link plus leading and/or trailing whitespace, nothing will happen when the highlighted text is dragged to the tab bar.

As a matter of convenience for the user, either of the following two things should happen when highlighted text is dragged to the tab bat:

	A) Leading and trailing whitespace should be stripped from the text before it is used as a url with which to open a new tab.
	B) The browser should attempt to use the highlighted text as a url with which to open a new tab like it currently does.  If the url is invalid and a new tab cannot be created, rather than simply ignoring the drop event (like it currently does), the browser should then attempt to create a new tab using the highlighted text with the leading and trailing whitespace stripped.  If the resulting text *still* represents an invalid url and a new tab cannot be created, *then* the drop event should be ignored.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a document with a plain text url.  (Assuming Bugzilla doesn't automatically convert urls to hyperlinks, you can use the example url provided in the Details section on the page for this bug report.  It doesn't matter if the url points to a non-existant page, just that it's well-formed.)
2. Highlight the entire url plus some adjacent whitespace.
3. Drag the highlighted text to the tab bar.

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.  No tab is opened and the drop event is apparently ignored.

Expected Results:  
The browser should strip the insignificant whitespace from the url and use that to attempt to create a new tab.
