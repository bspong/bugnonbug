I have had no luck adding new bookmarks with any reliability and have found that pages I have never visited before automatically appear with a solid blue star. If I click on the star the remove bookmark button is useless. If i wish to add and organize a new bookmark it will likely create a "dead link" with no information or description information. Once one of these type of bookmarks is created it is impossible to delete by any method. If one of these "dead link" bookmarks is created and added to a folder you will not be able to use the open all in tabs feature. I have not figured out a way to create a new bookmark.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click solid blue star on new page and attempt to remove bookmark.
2.Click on hollow star and try to add new bookmark.
3.Use Organize Bookmarks drop down menu and attempt to delete any newly created "dead link" bookmark
Actual Results:  
1. Can not remove bookmark.
2. New bookmark will create a "dead link"
3. New bookmark/"dead link" can not be deleted and will disable the Open All in Tabs feature.

Expected Results:  
Obviouse.

Please help ;)
