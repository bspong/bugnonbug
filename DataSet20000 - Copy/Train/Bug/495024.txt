firefox is still running in background and needs to be closeded to open a new process
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.28 Safari/530.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla Firefox 3.0.10

Firefox fails to load a new url, and will sit there for minutes until I hit escape to close that request.  Hitting the 'Go Back' arrow produces the same result of sitting there with the 'loading circle' going round and round.
  
Closing all open versions of Firefox and reopening a new Firefox window results in an error message 'Firefox is currently running and needs to close before opening.'   

I can find firefox in Windows Task Manager processes, but cannot kill the process.  Cannot kill with Sysinternals Process Explorer either.

There maybe an IO awaiting closure, but I have not yet found one.  The only solutions are to use another browser or restart or shut down the system.  

This situation does not appear to have a pattern.  I can have many duplicates of Firefox open or just one.  I can have Skype running or not.  I can have the gmail account open or not.  

This can happen 2 or 3 times per day.

I have noticed that if I download a large file from many levels within a site, that after the download finishes, 90% of the time the above situation occurs and I have to reboot.

I cannot deliberately reduplicate the problem.
