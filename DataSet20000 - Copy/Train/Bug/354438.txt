Pressing "Enter" button no longer triggers Firefox 2.0 to load page.

After I put an address into the Location Bar in Firefox 2.0 RC 1 and press the "Enter" button, nothing happens.  I started noticing this problem in Firefox 2.0 Beta 2 mostly after an address was autocompleted, but now I can't even get an address I type in or cut and paste in to work when I press the "Enter" button.  This results in me having to use the mouse to go up and press the arrow button next to the Location Bar, which I find inconvenient as I like to use keyboard shortcuts. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.type an address in to the Location Bar
2.press the "Enter" button
3.watch nothing happen




Expected Results:  
When I press the "Enter" button while in address is highlighted or a little "I" bar is in the Location Bar, Firefox should load the webpage listed.

I'm marking this "Major" because both Opera and Internet Explorer 7 along with Firefox 2.0 Beta 1 can load a web page when I press enter in their Location Bars, so I don't see why Firefox 2.0 RC 1 can't.
