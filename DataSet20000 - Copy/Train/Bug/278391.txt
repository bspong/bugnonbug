bookmarks sidebar will go into endless scrolling ...
The "bookmarks" sidebar will go into endless scrolling by the actions described
below

I have validated this on different PCs with Windows2000 as well as Windows98SE.
I would expect that the bug will show with all Windows versions. The problem
cannot be reproduced on Linux (I tested with SuSE 9.0).
I have tested with firefox 1.0 and mozilla 1.6b, but most likely all versions
will show the problem.

The problems seems to be very similar to 227772 .

How to reproduce the bug:

With the mouse pick an object (e.g. icon from desktop or file out of Explorer)
and drag it (without releasing it) into the "bookmarks" sidebar area (which is
assumed to be lenghty). Still not releasing the object drag it quickly (!) out
of the "bookmarks" sidebar area via the bottom (!) boundary. (You may then drop
off the object whereever you choose, e.g. in the place you got it from.) Very
often the bookmarks list will go into endless scrolling when you pass over the
bottom boundary. (Once it has reached the end of the list, scrolling seems to
stop, but will immediately commence when you try to scroll upwards, e.g. with
the scroll bar.) Other than restarting firefox/mozilla scrolling will stop only
if you once again drag an object into the "bookmarks" sidebar area and don't
drag across the lower boundary.
