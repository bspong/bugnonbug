Crash on restart when sessionstore.js is too large (more than 128K)

If Firefox crashes or is closed when sessionstore.js is too large, it crashes almost immediately on startup.  This appears to be triggered when sessionstore.js is 128K in size or greater.  I'm regularly near this line due to having many (approximately 100) tabs open at once, each contributing its own cookies and history to the session.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox.
2. Verify that "When Firefox starts" is set to "Show my windows and tabs from last time" in the Main tab of Firefox Preferences.
3. Open many tabs and navigate to several pages in them, watching the size of the profile's sessionstore.js file.
4. When sessionstore.js reaches 128K, exit Firefox via File|Quit.
5. Restart Firefox.
Actual Results:  
Firefox attempts to reopen all of the tabs, then crashes.

Expected Results:  
All tabs in the previous session should be restored, and the browser shouldn't crash.

Removing sessionstore.js allows Firefox to start.  Alternatively, the file can be trimmed to less than the maximum size in a text editor, although it's not easy.  Both involve data loss to some extent.
