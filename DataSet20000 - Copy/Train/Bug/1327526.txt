Bookmarks panel opens in unexpected place in window.open()
>>>   My Info:   Win7_64, Nightly 49, 32bit, ID 20160526082509
STR_1:
1. Open the following "data:" url or click URL in the form above
>   data:text/html,<html ondblclick='window.open("http://example.org","","resizable,width="+window.screen.width+",height="+(window.screen.height-180))'>
2. Doubleclick on the page
3. Press Ctrl+D in window opened in Step 2

AR:  Bookmarks panel opens at the bottom of the window, so I can't change name/keyword
ER:  No bug, i.e. X or Y or something else
 X) Bookmarks panel should open in normal place
 Y) Bookmarks panel should be restricted in that window


Notes:
 Somebody may say that it's unlikely for window.open() to open a window that shows bookmarks panel at
 the bottom: (1) it happens for any height less or equal to "screen height - 180" 
(2) There's also STR_2 showing troubles of bookmarks panel opened at the top of the window.
 So, all bookmarks panel experience is broken anyway, and therefore arguement above is useless.
 
 Actually STR_2 looks like a XUL bug, but I don't want to report it separately, because the only known
 testcase will be fixed with STR_1 (by setting an appropriate target for bookmarks panel ofc).

STR_2:
1. Open   data:text/html,<html ondblclick='window.open("http://example.org","","resizable")'>
2. Doubleclick on the page
3. Press Ctrl+D in window opened in Step 2
4. Click twice on the dropmarker to the right from the field "Separate tags with commas"
5. Click on the page, ~30px below the bookmarks panel

AR:  Bookmarks panel is still opened
ER:  There should be no bookmarks panel after Step 5
