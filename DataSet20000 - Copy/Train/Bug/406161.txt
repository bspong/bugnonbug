I cannot find the list of existing tags (labels) in neither bookmarks sidebar nor in Places organizer. I can see the list of folders, but not the list of labels I used. They only appear as additional properties of some bookmarks.

In my opinion this predates the whole idea of labels. They should provide a flat categories system to navigate the bookmarks. The tag-oriented user wants to see which labels are there, and which items are marked with them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add some tags to bookmarks
2. Try to find which tags are there and which bookmarks `belong' to which tag.
Actual Results:  
Tags (labels) are viewed now as an additional property of the bookmark. It is impossible to view all the available tags or navigate the collection of bookmarks using only tags.

Expected Results:  
I would expect tags (labels) to be visible in bookmarks sidebar and Places organizer as
* either special type of folder (they are parents for bookmarks)
* or as an element of tag cloud (web-style)

In fact I would expect tags (labels) and folders to be identical from the user  point of view.

I would like to point to Epiphany web browser, where tagging system is used in bookmarks for years. They are called topics there and are identical to (virtual) folders. In fact, it also simplifies the process of adding a bookmark. It is sufficient to think which topics it relates to, and check them, no need to deal with a hierarchic folder trees each time one adds a bookmark.
