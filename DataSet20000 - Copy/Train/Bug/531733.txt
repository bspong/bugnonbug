With php "session_start()," the selected option for a <select> element is not remembered if you refresh or navigate back

Normally if you choose a select option and then refresh the page or navigate away and press "back," the option you had selected begins selected.
This seems to break if you start a php session before outputting the page data.

See, for example: http://www.tutortrove.com/select_w_cookie.php
//CODE START
<?php
session_start();
?>

<select>
	<option></option>
	<option>opt 1</option>
	<option>opt 2</option>
	<option>opt 3</option>
</select>
//CODE END



The alternative:
http://www.tutortrove.com/select_wo_cookie.php

//CODE START
<select>
	<option></option>
	<option>opt 1</option>
	<option>opt 2</option>
	<option>opt 3</option>
</select>
//CODE END




displays the expected behavior (change and refresh, the change is remembered).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.tutortrove.com/select_w_cookie.php
2. change the option to 'opt 2'
3. refresh the page
Actual Results:  
opt 2 is not remembered (select starts with the blank option selected)

Expected Results:  
opt 2 should be remembered (select starts with 'opt 2' selected)

Interesting note: 
http://www.tutortrove.com/select_w_cookie.php# works as expected, so the '#' seems to make a difference
