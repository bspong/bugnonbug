hanging when adding security exception/certificate not being retreived

On windows Vista, when going to a site with a not trusted certificate, a dialog pops up, saying that the certificate is invalid (untrusted_issuer).

On this dialog, 2 buttons : See certificate and Cancel
I click See Certificate, and the cert is displayed
I click cancel, and the page "uncertified connexion" shows up

I click on "Add a security exception", and when FF whould retrieve the certificate, it just hangs there, even after clicking on Cancel.

The menus are greyed out, and I'm stuck on the current tab. I have to kill firefox.

When I lanch firefox again, the behaviour is erratic. I can't reach bugzilla for example. The page sits there loading.

To get a functional browsing, I need to reboot the machine.

I tested the website on a fresh FF 3.5.3 install on Win7, and I noticed that the first dialog doesn't show up. I go directly to the "uncertified connexion" page, and I can really add an exception.

4. Here is the bug. The certificate is never retrieved.
Actual Results:
