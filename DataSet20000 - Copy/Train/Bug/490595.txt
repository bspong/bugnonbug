Spinning wheel of death on all clicking - tabs, links, everything

I am (soon to be 'was' rather than 'am') a user of Firefox v3.0.10 for Mac, running on a MacBook 13" on OS X v10.5.6; in the last few days, whenever I click on anything in Firefox - a tab, a link, a picture, anything - the 'spinning wheel of death' is invoked, and goes on and on. 

I've tried the usual fixes - deleting add-ons from the User/Library folder or from toolbars (the latest of which was the Read Later link to save web pages for InstaPaper on iPhone); quitting all programs and running MacJanitor and Cocktail. Nothing works. 

This is just losing me too much time; I hate Safari's interface but am moving to it perforce. 

By the way, one major support problem - I can't find a separate support forum for Macs, which makes use of Mozilla's support site problematic. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on anything whatsoever
2. Wait 30 or 40 seconds, cursing and weeping
3. Bang head repeatedly on table, open window to throw computer out
Actual Results:  
Problem repeats ad lib

Expected Results:  
Bloody thing should work

Not produced the accursed spinning wheel of death, but obediently opened links, tabs, etc, with a normal microsecond wait. Apparently this is a common problem; I've come across a bunch of Mac users who have abandoned Firefox because of it. 

I suppose I'll have to do the same, which is a pity because I like Firefox's interface, and particularly like features like using the address bar as a search, being able to search in the edit section of Wiki pages, considerate keeping of text size settings, etc.
