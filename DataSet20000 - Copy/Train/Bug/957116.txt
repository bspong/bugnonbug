Memory Leak - The memory usage keeps growing every time i re-open my extension
Created attachment 8356556
Extension to reproduce

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/31.0.1650.63 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

I have an extension that i develop, and every time i close and re-open the extension, the memory usage of the browser keeps going up.
I've created an almost empty, example extension, that using it generated the same result - can be downloaded here: http://speedy.sh/gnNfd/exampleApp.xpi

(It is harmless, you can unzip the XPI first to check the code).

After installing, you will have a new "Example" button that will open an empty side bar (can also be opened by pressing ctrl+M). Open the side bar, and then close it by Clicking X on the sidebar. 

Doing it over and over again, every time i closed the sidebar, firefox gained around 12MB extra RAM.
Note that for some reason, the major memory increase happened on CLOSING the extension and not while opening it.

I used a brand new profile. The memory issue didn't reproduce EVERY time, but i did managed to reproduce it many times.


Actual results:

Firefox RAM usage kept growing.


Expected results:

Every time the extension was closed, the RAM it used should have been released.
