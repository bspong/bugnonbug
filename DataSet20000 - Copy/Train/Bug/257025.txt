document/file name not refreshed after 1st printing or 1st save as pdf
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3

When printing from Firefox 0.9.3 (and Mozilla 1.7.2) the name of the first
document selected for printing (or saving as pdf) "sticks" and becomes the name
of all subsequent print jobs until application is quit.

Except for first print job, unable to identify individual print jobs in a queue
(or accept the default pdf filename).

This may seem trivial, but is not when used in a public computing facility that
relies on print job queuing and document identification.  We badly want to
implement Firefox for public use, it fits our needs in every other way, but need
to resolve this issue in order to do so.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any webpage
2. Select Print from File menu or icon
3. Check printer's job queue for name (matches page title reasonably well)
4. Go to any other URL (preferably something noticeably different)
5. Select PRint from File menu or icon
6. Check printer's job queue for name (which will not match current job, but
will be the same as the first job printed)

This same sequence can be seen by chosing Print/Save as PDF.  Filename offered
will always be first job printed.

The print job name is not be refreshed for each print job.

Actual Results:  
Print job name is from first print job request.  Subsequent print jobs retain
the name of the first.

Expected Results:  
Print job names should be refreshed at each request to print in order to create
individual identities for print queues.
