Favicon of FF-error-page doesn't get replaced when a new page with favicon is loaded.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b3) Gecko/20100805 Firefox/4.0b3

When having network problems (real life example) FF shows an errorpage (not able to connect to server and this kind of comments) and the errorpage has an exclamation mark as favicon.

This favicon is not replaced when the error is resolved (eg: networkproblems solved; webaddress corrected; ...) or when you have loaded an absolutely new page in this tab. Even if this (new) page has it's own favicon.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Disconnect your router or disable networkcard
2. Surf to a website which has a favicon (in my case it was www.zimmo.be)
3. You will receive a message explaining FF not able to connect (and a FF-favicon with exclamation mark)
4. Connect your router or enable networkcard
5. When you are up and running, surf again to your chosen website (in my case it was www.zimmo.be). You will notice the exclamation mark stays.
6. Open new tab and surf to your chosen website again. You will see the "real" favicon of your chosen website.
