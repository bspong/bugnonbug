What happens is click listener on the content of the iframe does not get called. This looks like a race condition where listeners get cleared. The exact sequence of events is this:

 - While page is loading the user click BlueMark (bookmark button)

 - An iframe window is poped up by the BlueOrganizer code. We take a template, run it through XLST
   and then write content into the iframe inside of the poped window.

 - We have a load listener that gets called back when the content of iframe is loaded.
   This always works.

 - Inside the callback we find a button in the window and add click listener to it. This click listener
   is what does not always work. It seems to be that it gets cleared for some reason. And it is
   not deterministic.

Our emergency fix is to do timeout with 2 seconds before trying to add the click listener.
This is clearly a hack, but it does appear to work for us.
