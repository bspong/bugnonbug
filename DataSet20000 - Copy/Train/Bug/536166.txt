After automatic update, open pages and tabs are not restored from session before the update

However, I get no warning box when doing automatic nor manual shutdown of Firefox to permit updates. And the behaviour is the same, regardless of whether I shut down manually or automatically - all previous session tabs are lost. Instead I get a default set of 4 tabs, my home page tabs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Receive an auto update
2. Ensure multiple tabs are open and not just your defined home page tabs
3. Shutdown either manually or automatically when prompted by Firefox.
4. Restart Firefox and check which tabs are opened
Actual Results:  
Only home page tabs are open after restart, none of the other tabs that were active in the previous session prior to the restart. 

Expected Results:  
The problem creates a strong disincentive for people to install updates. In user psychology, keeping my session tabs is "my problem", doing updates is "Firefox's problem". This problem forces users to choose between the two alternatives. If forced to choose, they will choose not to update. 

The software should remember, and restore, all tabs from the previous session, even after a Firefox update.
