When I log into my Yahoo Mail account, I am unable to read my messages or do anything because it almost instantly switches to a blank page every time.  A few days ago it was switching to an advert for an on-line Casino, but that problem seemed to correct itself.  This current problem only manifested itself after Firefox updated itself earlier today and yet I have no problem viewing my Yahoo Mail account via other browsers like Internet Explorer or Safari.  So please can you correct this problem?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enter The Yahoo URL Address Into My Browser, i.e. www.yahoo.com
2.Click On The Mail Option
3.Enter My Yahoo ID And Password To Access My Yahoo Mail Account
Actual Results:  
First of all my Yahoo Mail account loads, but then it almost immediately switches to a blank screen.

Expected Results:  
I should have been able to access my Yahoo Mail account and read all my messages etc, without it continually switching to a blank screen.
