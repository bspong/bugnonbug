Firefox reports insecure connection sometimes, but Chrome always reports as insecure
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:46.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/46.0
Build ID: 20160425115534

Steps to reproduce:

1) go to http://www.eaglecreek.com/
2) scroll down the page and select an item to buy (e.g., cargo hauler duffel)
3) click ADD TO CART
4) click CHECKOUT
5) click CHECKOUT



Actual results:

Sometimes the green lock icon shows (i.e., everything is secure), but sometimes the lock icon is greyed out and has a yellow yield sign that says "Connection is Not Secure". (If the icon originally shows green, try hitting refresh a couple times to see if it changes to "insecure.")


Expected results:

I'm reporting this to Mozilla because the lock icon in Firefox sometimes shows secure and sometimes shows insecure. But on Google Chrome it ALWAYS shows as insecure (i.e., a green lock icon never shows). My relative (using Firefox) purchased an item here and there was fraud on the card as a result. I found this inconsistency in Firefox when investigating the site. So I thought I'd report it in case it's anything you guys want to look into.

I tested this with a "reset" Firefox with default settings.
