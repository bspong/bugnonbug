BrowserNewTabPreloader.jsm and SafeBrowsing.jsm are referenced using the wrong URI
I'm using Fx from mozilla-inbound and after Bug 753448 (exactly -r102295:a5b58ae99ac9) fixed 'New Tab' button opens new tab, but doesn't switch to it.

I should mention that I'm using firefox from objdir without actually installing it, so I have 'mk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=/home/ojab/opt' in mozconfig and running Fx with `~/opt/browser/dist/bin/firefox`.

I've found that there is two errors in 'Error Console':

which are "resource://gre/modules/BrowserNewTabPreloader.jsm" and "resource://gre/modules/SafeBrowsing.jsm", which are resides only in /home/ojab/opt/browser/dist/bin/modules/.

I've looked on PluralForm.jsm as an other example of file in resource://gre/modules/ and it resides in /home/ojab/opt/xulrunner/dist/bin/modules/PluralForm.jsm and /home/ojab/opt/browser/dist/bin/xulrunner/modules/PluralForm.jsm, so I've copied BrowserNewTabPreloader.jsm and SafeBrowsing.jsm to /home/ojab/opt/browser/dist/bin/xulrunner/modules and 'New Tab' button works as expected even after I've deleting this files again (looks like it's cached somewhere in profile or something like that).

As a side note: I've had an issue with session restore (Bug 779107) related to SafeBrowsing.jsm not found, but it as fixed somehow (most likely when I've run official Nightly build for the test) and I haven't found the source.

So I think that BrowserNewTabPreloader.jsm and SafeBrowsing.jsm should actually be built in xulrunner, not in browser.
