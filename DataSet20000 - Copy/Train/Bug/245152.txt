Operation timed out. Cannot open google.com
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows 98)
Build Identifier: 

FireFox 0.8 will resolve the host, then be 'connecting to' whatever the site 
is, and it will time out as if the servers are down, but I know they are not 
since Internet Explorer will connect to them. I really do like firefox and want 
to use it, but may have to uninstall it and wait till it becomes less 
breakable. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up the browser, try going to any site. Once in a while it will work, 
untill at some point it gets to where it will start timing out opening pages.
2.Repeate 1
3.Repeat 2

Actual Results:  
Operation timed out opening *sitename*.org/com/gov/whatever

Expected Results:  
Opened and displayed the page, instead of timing out. :)

Was using the Red Orbit theme I believe. I did a -p switch after installing a 
new copy of FireFox 0.8 from the download new FireFox link in bug guide pages, 
then restarted FireFox, it didn't work. Even on the texturizer page to download 
new links (clicked on in the download new themes link in THEMES) did not open, 
it Operation timed out....

My system is:
Win 98 Se With all the latest critical updates and such from windowsupdate 
site.
