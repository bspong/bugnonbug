Beginning with the 2008-03-21 nightly, I can no longer open mail in my Google Apps version 2 gmail account.  The error console has a handful of warnings about "Error in parsing value for property 'display'.  Declaration dropped." but there are no additional warnings or errors when I click on the message.

Other things work, like keyboard navigation, making messages as read, and archiving them.  It only appears to be opening messages that doesn't work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
From the main mail view, click on any message.  Doesn't matter if it's the recipient or the subject.
Actual Results:  
It displays the yellow banner "Loading..." at the top of the page, but instead of ultimately (and usually quickly) displaying the message, it just sits there forever.

Expected Results:  
After briefly displaying "Loading...", display the message.

Using the proto 0.14.1 theme.  I had the "Better Gmail" extension enabled, but the behavior persists with it off.
