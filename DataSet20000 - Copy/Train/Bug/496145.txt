It seems Firefox only holds 3 passwords per web page.  I have two GMail accounts and one of the 'saved' passwords was for my old Email account.  I deleted it, assuming that then the 'counter' for the page would be reset and I would be asked if I wished to save the new password.  It did not.

If you are going to allow three passwords per page, the counter logic should reflect a delete password (it should decrement the count).  However, it does not.

It seems to me to be a simple fix, but it is not happening.  Could this be fixed and rolled out sometime in the future?

Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Save three user id/passwords combinations for a particular web page.
2. Go into the Password manager and delete one of them.
3. Go back to the same page and enter a third one -- it will not ask you if you want to save it.
Actual Results:  
No dialog asked for saving of password.

Expected Results:  
Dialog SHOULD ask for saving of password.
