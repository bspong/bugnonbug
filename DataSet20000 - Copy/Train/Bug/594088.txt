We are a credit union using Harland/UltraData's internet banking platform (Ultra Access).  They supplied code (.vm format) for a login page which works in all browsers, and a login "box" (small iframe embedded in our home page), which works in everything but Firefox.

When a user enters their member number and a security code on our home page (coastccu.org), they are asked a security question, then taken to a virtual keyboard.  These steps are fine in all browsers, but the Firefox problem comes in when the user tries to "type" on the virtual keyboard.  When holding their mouse over the keys, they do highlight, but do not register when clicked.  This prevents Firefox users from using the login box on the home page.  UltraData/Harland has not been able to help us.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Please call or email me for the login information - we have a sample account you can use but need to keep it as confidential as possible.  There's a member number, security image, and a set of security questions (hard to tell which one you will get) before the PIN step.
Actual Results:  
PIN does not register in the box above the virtual keyboard.  If submitted, the login process fails.

Expected Results:  
PIN should register (each digit as a bullet or asterisk) in the box above the virtual keyboard, and when submitted, user will be logged in to online banking.

Every member we have with Firefox has this same problem.  Process works in all versions we've tried of Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and Safari.
