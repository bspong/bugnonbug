i am using a toshiba notebook and this thing has happened to me twice in the past 2 weeks ( once with v 2.0.0.3 and yesterday with v 2.0.0.4).
i have set firefox to remember history for the last 120 days. but twice the Firefox just crashed (dont know the reason why) and when i restarted Firefox it didn't gave me the option of "restore new session or start new session". i was puzzled. i kept going. next thing i found out was that my entire history had been deleted, but most cookies and passwords were intact(i didn't clear all my private data nor have enabled that option), on further checking i found that only some sites cookies and passwords were deleted and most were there( i checked using cookie manager, a program to see firefox cookies). 
this happened first to me 2 weeks back & i thought it was on off problem with firefox, and few days back i upgraded to v 2.0.0.4, thinking that the problem had been fixed. but it was not the case so, the same thing happened to me yesterday also(same each and every step). now i am seriously thinking of shifting to another browser if the problem isnt solved.
i think i have explained to the last detail as possible, if u need more info u can contact me on my mail id, i would help as much as possible.
