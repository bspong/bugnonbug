On BEAs main site (URL above) there are 8 mouse-over menus above the red bar at the top of the screen. On Windows (Firefox and IE) these display sub-menus on moesuover; this is missing on Linux, makes the site hard to navigate.
Other sites have similar problems but sorry I can't remember which.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.bea.com
2. Mouse-over the top-level menus (above the red bar at the top of the page) - should see drop-down sub menus.
3. Try on Windows XP and Linux, you'll see the difference

Actual Results:  
No drop-down menus on mouse-over with Linux.
Drop downs appear on Windows Firefox or IE.

Expected Results:  
The behaviour should obviously be the same regardless of platform.

Theme is "Abstract PC 1.0" but default theme and others display the same problem.
Currently unable to test on 32bit Linux.
I'd classify this as normal level problem as it makes some sites hard to navigate.
