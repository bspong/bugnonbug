Window hangs and fails to close as "X" button flashes nonstop

Sometimes when trying to close the browser window (such as with the "X" button) or do other window operations such as resize, move, etc., the window will get "stuck", behave very erratically, and fail to perform the operation as the "X" button flashes nonstop (upper right of the window).  When this happens there is often no way to close the window other than with Ctrl-Alt-Del.  Sometimes when a popup window opens, the "X" button will immediately start flashing nonstop without any provocation, and the window will exhibit the same erratic behavior.  Sometimes when it happens with multiple tabs open, closing the current tab makes the "X" button stop flashing, but then when re-attempting to close the entire window, it will start flashing again and get stuck.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse Websites that use popups such as encyclopediadramatica.com, and try opening multiple tabs
2. Try to close the popup window
3.
Actual Results:  
The red "X" button in the upper-right corner of the screen will flash constantly in an infinite loop as though it were being clicked over and over again, but the window will hang and be mostly frozen.

Expected Results:  
The software should allow the user to close, resize, and move the browser window at any time without going into an infinite loop and requiring a force-quit or reload.

The Website provided is just one example.  It does not seem as though a malicious script causes the window to behave this way as it happens on multiple occasions, but most often with the popups on that one site.
