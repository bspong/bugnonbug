Have searched an found many Back/Forward bug report, but non seem to report the following:

I use firefox with tabbed browsing enabled, but i dont believe it is related to tabbed browsing. Occasionally firefox appears to be working correctly, links are followed, pages automatically refresh content, but the navigation toolbar fails to respond. the only way to navigate is through a menu (context or pull-down) until fire fox is restarted. This effects all sites, not some specific urls. It appears to be a focus related bug, though how focus is lost and unable to be regained on an application toolbar i dont know.

It would appear that regardless of a users actions focus is sometimes lost on the applications navigation toolbar. It doesnt require the user to switch away from firefox, wake the machine from sleep, etc. It can occur whilst just browsing a single page/site.

Non of the navigation toolbars functions respond, but unlike some reported bugs, the address bar changes for each tab, though i am unsure if the details of the address bar are correct as i have never paid attention to it when it happens. You cant even use the search box. nothing responds to mouse or keyboard actions.

This is certainly a recurring issue; i have seen it on several occasions, but i cannot reproduce as its trigger is elusive.

Reproducible: Sometimes
