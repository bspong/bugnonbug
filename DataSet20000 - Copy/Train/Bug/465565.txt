Firefox will not play voice mails from Comcast Digital Voice service

(this works with IE)

This site thinks a Quicktime plugin is missing when using Firefox.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have a Comcast Digital Voice account
2.Leave yourself a voice mail
3.Login to Comcast Digital Voice
4.Go to voice mails and attempt to play one
Actual Results:  
Get a pop up message bar at the top of the screen that says:
"Additional plugins are required to display all the media on this page" then on the right you get button "Install Missing Plugins".
The plugin finder service suggests to install "Apple QuickTime" (even though other quicktime meda plays OK for me). I select next and it says "no Plugins were installed" Then there is a "manual install" button and a "finish" button. Finish just quits, Manual Install brings you to the Quicktime download page (where I have tried reinstalling Quicktime) - but nothing changes.

Expected Results:  
Play the voice mail (like it does with IE)
