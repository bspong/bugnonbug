A page that uses a cache manifest file to define offline caching behavior is never being refreshed from the server, even if the original file and the cache manifest file are updated.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a simple page that includes a reference to a cache manifest file in the manifest attribute of the html element.
2. Create the manifest file with the above page as the only listed resource.
3. Load the page in the browser.  The browser will ask if you would like to store the offline resources.  Click "Allow" to permit this.
4. Modify the original file AND the manifest file (adding a comment to the manifest should be enough)
5.Click refresh in the browser.
6.Click refresh in the browser again.
Actual Results:  
The original version of the file is displayed in steps 5 and 6.  Extra debugging added to the html file shows that in step 5, the updated manifest file is detected and the cached resources are apparently reloaded, but the reloaded resources never show up in the browser.

Expected Results:  
The updated version of the file should be displayed in step 6. 

From my reading of the HTML5 offline cache spec, I'm not sure what to expect in step 5.  I would think that seeing the updated version would be preferred because it keeps the document in sync with the version of the other cached resources, but the spec doesn't clarify this, so seeing the original version might be acceptable.
