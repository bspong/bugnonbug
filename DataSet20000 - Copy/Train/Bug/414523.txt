we stream a wmv.asx to different websites. Therefor we have one encoded signal that comes in 164x123Pixel. Other websites embed the stream using iframes. We resize the wmv e.g. with 150 Pixel width or smaller. The resized stream is shown like constructed under Windows using Internet Explorer (with Windows Media Player), but also under Mac (Flip4Mac) using Safari and Firefox. 

But under Windows using Firefox it shows the original encoded signal, not the resized one. Seams like it doesn't resize at all.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. check http://magazine.onvista.de ; livestream (164 Px width) in the left navigation bar, looks like supposed to
2. check http://aktiencheck.de; livestream (original stream, resized in 150 Pixel width) in the left navigation bar 
3.
Actual Results:  
Step 1 shows how the stream is supposed to look, step 2 should look the same, but a little smaller. Instead it shows the stream like in step 1 and the right und down side are being cropped.

Expected Results:  
Show the Stream in the size we've installed it (150 Pixel x 112 Pixel)
