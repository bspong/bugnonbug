Cant' print to remote CUPS printer by IPP

I have the print problems for a long time and finally I found that it is a bug of firefox.

Here is my enviroment:

LBP1210
   Description: LBP1210
        Location: server
        Printer Driver: Canon LBP1210 CAPT ver.1.5 on 192.168.1.100
        Printer State: idle, accepting jobs, not published.
        Device URI: ipp://192.168.1.100:631/printers/LBP1210


And :

(1) print from opera ------ OK
(2) print from openoffice ---------- OK
(3) print from epdfview -----------OK
(4) print from firefox --------- Doesn't work

Btw,
firefox print works well on local printer. I think, this should be a Bug of firefox 3


I also have another virtual printer cups-pdf, and firefox works on the remote printer.

PDFprinter
   Description: cups-pdf
        Location: server
        Printer Driver: Generic postscript color printer rev4 on 192.168.1.100
        Printer State: idle, accepting jobs, not published.
        Device URI: ipp://192.168.1.100:631/printers/PDFprinter

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install cups on a linux system
2. Configure a printer

My printer is Canon LBP1210, and the driver is not directly from cups but from Canon. You can download from Canon official website.
