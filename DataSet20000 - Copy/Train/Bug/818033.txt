[toolbox] Implement Shorlander's visual design
Live mockup is located here: http://people.mozilla.com/~shorlander/files/devTools-toolbox-i02/devTools-toolbox-i02.html (enable the new flexbox model to see this mockup: layout.css.flexbox.enabled -> true)

We can divide this mockup in 3 sections:
1) toolbox toolbar/tabs
2) inspector
3) developer toolbar

The scope of this bug is only about the toolbars. Not the content of the tool (markup view and rule view in this mockup)

About 1),

The toolbox toolbar should not use common.css and have its own style. common.css is a stylesheet shared by all the tools to ensure they have a shared look (button, toolbars, search fields, …). The toolbox doesn't need it. Not using common.css will make our work easier (we can start working on 1), then work on 2)).

For 2),

This mockup uses a "flat design". We need mockups for the other tools as well, because most of the work will happen on common.css and will affect all the tools. 

For example: in the inspector, we see that the tool toolbar doesn't have any padding anymore. That means that the buttons in the other tools (web console and debugger) won't have room around them. This won't be possible as they have borders in the current implementation.

We need mockups for the other tools, or a design for all the in-tools controls (textbox, searchbox, toolbarbutton, toolbarbutton with no text but only icon, dropdown menu, button + dropdown menu).

This also covers the sidebar.

For 3),

this can be done in parallel. It might have some impact on the Gcli (position of the panel).
