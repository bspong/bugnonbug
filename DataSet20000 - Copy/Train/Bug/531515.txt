Where is my favorite font, "Abby Medium"? Since I installed to the newest version of Firefox yesterday, I cant find it, plus, I see no way to make any fonts bold! 
How do I get Abby back for Firefox 3.5.5? Its the only font I like!! 
Please speak in laymans terms, Im no big techie!!

Thanks,

Actual Results:  
Abby Font is Gone...


Im running Windows 7 Premium.  Im also using the same Firefox add-ons and extensions I used with 3.5.3. as Im
using with 3.5.5.
I noticed with 3.5.3, when I loaded Abby into my
Windows Font Folder, with Windows Vista, and Windows XP Pro, the font also became available in Firefox. 
I also loaded Abby into Windows 7, but Abby doesnt show in Firefox, 3.5.5 ( In case there's a relationship )

Note:
On my Windows XP Pro PC, when I updated to 3.5.5 I lost Abby font,  so I re-loaded version 3.5.3
and Abby font returned.
I havnt updated Firefox on my Vista pc, staying at 3.5.3 in order to retain the Abby font.
