As it says. It is not made clear that a restart is necessary.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new profile & start it
2. You are taken to the 'firstrun' page which has some panels of colourful themes
3. run the mouse over them; the themes are applied into the widget areas of FX (toolbar, bookmars bar etc.)
4. go to Tools|Options|Content and untick Enable Javascript option.
5. wave mouse around, themes are still copied to panel.
6. restart fx, wave mouse over them theme panels and they're not applied.
