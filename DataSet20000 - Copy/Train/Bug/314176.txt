Web Page with CSS and DIV is not being rendered correctly.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7

The styles of the navigation on the side page is not being rendered correctly. When you to http://www.register.com/retail/index.rcmx. Initially, the page appears correctly. However, when you click the reload button, the page is refreshed but the navigation on the side appears different and it look bad. Then, if you click the home link of the page, it refresh and the navigation looks fine again.

The same scenario also happen on the other section of the pages. 

Also, I did try to test it using the latest nightly build of Mozilla Suite(Mozilla 1.8b2) and its working correctly there.

Other browsers that I have tested: IE6, Netscape v804

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close all your Mozilla Firefox browser first.
2. Start a new Mozilla Firefox browser.
3. Go to www.register.com(page will be displayed correctly).
4. Click the reload icon on the browser(page is refreshed but the navigation's style on the side looks different and bad. Style is not rendered correctly).


Actual Results:  
The style of the navigation on the side screwed up(look bad).

Expected Results:  
The style should have been rendered as on how you see it in IE, Netscape and Mozilla. Please go to www.register.com using these browsers and see the difference.
