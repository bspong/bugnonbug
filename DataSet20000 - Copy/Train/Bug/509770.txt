The & is replaced by &amp; when copied from Firefox into Dreamweaver
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.13) Gecko/2009073022 Firefox/3.0.13 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I noticed this happened after the latest build of Firefox was released during the week of August 3, 2009.  The basic link of: http://www.fusicology.com/new/index/events/detail.cfm?id=24587&rid=2 would appear to be http://www.fusicology.com/new/index/events/detail.cfm?id=24587&amp;rid=2 if copied from the browser address bar to a basic HTML program like Dreamweaver. The only way this does not convert the actual link is if it is pasted directly into the code itself.

This proves to be a problem because the link provided tells the database to find event id # 24587 in the region of 2 or id=24857&rid=2 instead it sees id=24857&amp;rid=2.  This generates a page error.  This has been tested on  Mac OSX & Vista Business & XP Pro machines.  Is there a setting on Firefox I should be sharing with my development team to work around this?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Copy the link: http://www.fusicology.com/new/index/events/detail.cfm?id=24587&rid=2
2.Type general text into an html document and paste the link using basic <a href></a> tags. 
3.View the code source in Dreamweaver or any html editor and notice http://www.fusicology.com/new/index/events/detail.cfm?id=24587&amp;rid=2 instead of http://www.fusicology.com/new/index/events/detail.cfm?id=24587&rid=2.
4. Notice how it appears perfect within the browser.  This causes problems for our web mailer which reads the code as it is placed in Dreamweaver or any general html editor.
Actual Results:  
http://www.fusicology.com/new/index/events/detail.cfm?id=24587&mp;rid=2 this a page appears.  The error code reproduced reads as follows:

Sorry, there was an error proccessing your request for page: /new/index/events/detail.cfm?id=24587&mp;rid=2
Element RID is undefined in URL.
The error occurred on line 140. 

Which translates into the last portion of the link &rid=2 does not appear because of the replacement of the & to the &amp;

Expected Results:  
http://www.fusicology.com/new/index/events/detail.cfm?id=24587&rid=2 the page should appear instead of the error page.
