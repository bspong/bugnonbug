If you go to http://aaguide.co.nz/main/index.shtml, you see a site icon
(favicon) in the URL bar. But if you reload the page, it vanishes. No matter how
many times you reload (or ctrl-reload or cmd-reload) the page, it's still gone.
If you clear the cache, it comes back. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Navigate to http://aaguide.co.nz/main/index.shtml
2.Observe that the black and yellow "AA" favicon is present in the URL bar
3.Reload the page and observe that the URL bar now displays a generic icon.

Actual Results:  
Site icon (favicon) was missing from the URL bar. It had a generic page icon
instead.

Expected Results:  
Displayed the correct favicon.

This seems to be the same type of problem as bug 109959, however that bug dealt
with a problem in the Seamonkey browser. This bug seems to be specific to
Firebird, as the web page in question seems to be handled correctly with the
standard Mozilla browser. For that reason, I'm assuming this warrants a separate
bug.

The problem exists in the latest nightly builds of Firebird on both Windows and
OS X.

The problem page uses <link REL="SHORTCUT ICON" HREF="../images/favicon.ico"> to
define the page icon. It doesn't have a corresponding REL="icon" line.

If I save the entire page locally and load it from my computer, the problem goes
away. I can keep reloading the page and the icon remains in the URL bar. Could
this be because it's not using the cache?

As a side note, the icon continues to be shown on the tab and the bookmarks
sidebar. However, it refuses to appear in the bookmarks menu of the Windows
browser at any stage (Mac version doesn't show favicons in that menu anyway),
but maybe that's a separate bug (?).
