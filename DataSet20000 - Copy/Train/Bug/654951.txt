When you set firefox to reopen windows and tabs from last time it does not work if you have multiple windows open.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start firefox and browse to a site, do view source on that site so that 2 windows are open, (have reopen windows and tabs from last time set in preferences)
2. quit firefox
3. restart firefox, it shows a single window with the default start page

Actual Results:  
I did not get my last open tab from the previous session (nor the view source window)

Expected Results:  
I expect the open tabs from the previous session or firefox to advise me to shut all but one window before quitting.

In the actual case I had two windows each with a set of tabs in them and also a view source window. It looks like the last closed window is restored and that this is the view source window. 

This is IMHO the least useful thing to do, either restore all open tabs or close windows in a correct sequence or refuse to quit and get the user to decide which single window should be restored.

I did lose a lot of work hence the critical rating.
