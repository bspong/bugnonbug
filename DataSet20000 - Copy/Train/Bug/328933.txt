Unable to permanently accept self-signed SSL cert

I am trying to connect to mail.violentbees.com using IMAP and SSL (Port 993).  However I am running into problems because the cert is self-signed and is also for a different host (mail.dreamhost.com).  This is something my host provides to offer SSL connections without having to create a cert for each web address.  I am able to accept the cert on a temporary basis, however when I try to accept the warning by selecting the "Permanently Accept" option, it just brings me back to the same dialog box.  If this is a security "feature", then there needs to be a verbose message explaining why the cert shouldn't be accepted, but I still think the option should be available for people to choose.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Connect to an e-mail host using SSL that has a self signed cert that also shows a different signed address (this bug may apply to all self signed certs but I don't have the means to test that at the moment).
Actual Results:  
Was unable to permanently accept cert.

Expected Results:  
Permanently accept the cert.

I can provide an e-mail address on my server/account to help fix this bug if needed.
