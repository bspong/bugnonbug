"CTRL+any key" won't work for me under any circumstances since I updated to 3.6.8

I'm using Windows XP Prof.+SP3. Two days ago I have updated from an older version of Firefox to the latest one 3.6.8. Ever since then none of the ctrl+key combination works for me. No ctrl+c, no ctrl+v, no ctrl+t, no ctrl+n and so on, NONE of them. It acts just like my CTRL is broken right from the keyboard, it simply ignores the fact that I have pressed "Control" (i.e. If I try to paste some text using CTRL+V I only get a "v" instead; on the other hand I noticed that SHIFT+INSERT would paste me that text, also the right click on the mouse then "Paste" it works fine). If I try to open a new tab it won't work with the CTRL+T cobination. 
I noticed this issue is present on any type of Webpage I'm visiting. Basically I can't get to work the CTRL+key combination anywhere in Firefox. I can't even paste a link in the address bar of a new Firefox window.

Reproducible: Always




I'm using the default theme on Firefox.
And of course my CTRL key is not broken :) It works in any other application/different browsers.
