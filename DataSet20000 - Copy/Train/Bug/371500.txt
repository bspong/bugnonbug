I believe this started with auto upgrade.
These irritating mini boxes and the annoying cascading mini box feature and  extra unnecessary keystrokes has to go.  I want to down grade.  I need to get rid of these !*@ Features.  I don't ever want to see them again.  I don't know what these annoyances are called. I want my program back. Can someone please help me. 
These Beasts from hell come when there is a restore session. Aside from being an extremely visual nightmare they provide extra keystrokes. There is nothing I hate more than unnecessary keystrokes. How do I get rid of this BUG?
