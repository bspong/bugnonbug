When viewing Two or more tabs in Firefox (which does rox0r to the Nth) i have
noticed, that when trying to close a ff window which has 2 or more tabs in it
from the XP (trying to get a viable version of linux) toolbar, it brings up
"close multiple tabs" warning in both/all of the tabbed windows rather than just
one error message. 
     I realize this is probably of very little importance, and indeed doesnt
bother me much, especially considering the happy times I have with Thunderbird
and Firefox compared to Mcrosft prgs! Just thot i wud mention it, as i couldnt
find any prev ref's to it..

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open two or more tabs in one window
2.try to close the FF window from XP toolbar
3.Witness the two/several close tabs warnings

Actual Results:  
It was simply a case of clicking cancel on each "close multi tab" warning, no
big deal

Expected Results:  
Opened one "close multi-tab" warning and accepted result of first imput.
