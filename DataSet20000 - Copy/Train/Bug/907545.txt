dragging timed out ssl window from one screen to another causes the whole browser to freeze with only option of FC'n firefox
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:23.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/23.0 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:

i logged into to https ssl papjohns.com on screen 1, with one other tab open. i was on screen 2 watching a youtube video and once it finished i decided to move the tab of papajohns to my second screen so i could use the remaining tab for something else.


Actual results:

once i moved the logged out tab from window 1 on screen 1, to window 2 on screen 2 it froze, on screen one there was a ghost image of a popup menu reporting that i was logged out due to 10 min timeout and needed to log back in with an ok button. however, this window was inaccessible along with anything else running the executable file. i had to FC the application after waiting over 5 min. i also purposely replicated the same situation to the exact same result. with saved password it might be possible to exploit this even though it is extremely rare. either way, its a fukn pain in the ass:P


Expected results:

the tab should of linked up with the second window on the second screen like it always does.
