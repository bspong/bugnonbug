Addressbar suggests adaptive results regardless of requested behavior

In Options > Privacy you can configure addressbar suggestions, choosing beetween

- history and bookmarks
- history
- bookmarks
- no suggestion

Addressbar still suggests history and bookmarks also if I've set "history" only, they have the same behaviour while "history" shouldn't suggest any bookmark.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 3.5.x
2. Go to a website.
3. Add this site to bookmarks.
4. Clean history, cache etc. (so history is empty)
5. Options > Privacy, change setting from "history and bookmarks" to "history" only
6. Begin to type the website address into the addressbar...
Actual Results:  
Addressbar does show the suggestion for the site! But it isn't in history anymore (we did clean history, cache etc.), it is in bookmarks but we configured "history" only suggestions.

Expected Results:  
It shouldn't suggest bookmarks if we configured "history" only suggestions. "History" only option is broken.

I find this bug on 5 different systems (XP, Vista, 7), clean Firefox 3.5.x installations, ITalian language.
