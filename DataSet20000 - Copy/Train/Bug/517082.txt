Upgraded from version 3.52 and I could not get online with any other browser and the CD-RW drive acted strangely. Also, email programs were blocked from receiving or sending.
User-Agent:       Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 5.1; U; en) Presto/2.2.15 Version/10.00
Build Identifier: Version 3.53

Yesterday I upgraded Firefox 3.5.2 to 3.5.3.  That upgrade proved to be problematic.

1. The drawer to the CD-RW drive started opening and closing randomly and you could hear the drive trying to read a CD even though the drive was empty.
2. After the upgrade to 3.5.3, I was unable to get online with Firefox and I had difficulty getting online with the other browsers I use namely IE8 (default browser), Opera, and occasionally Google Chrome.  Also, the mail client, Outlook Express 6 was blocked from receiving mail as was the email client found in Opera.
3. I removed Firefox from the PC and ran Norton WinDoctor several times.  I also ran CC Cleaner and rebooted the PC at least three times.  The weird behavior of the CD-RW stopped and I was able to get online readily with the aforementioned browsers.  Also, email is now working correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Since I have removed Firefox 3.53, I cannot reproduce the problem and I am frankly too uncomfortable to re-install it to see if the same issues reappear.
2.I have one other PC and I will try the upgrade on it.  If I have issues with that one, I will enter another error report
3.
