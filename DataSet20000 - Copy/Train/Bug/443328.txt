History menu is slow to update

I visit several pages in a row, say A -> B -> C -> D. While viewing D, I use the History menu to return to B. After B loads, I realize it's not the page I wanted, so I immediately pull down the History menu again. It has not yet been updated (D is still at the top of the list). If I want for a second, the menu updates (the list of pages is re-ordered properly).

It seems to take about several seconds for the menu to update properly, whether I open up the menu immediately, or just that amount of time to open up the menu. The time between loading page B and the menu finally updating is ~3 seconds on a dual-core Xeon 3.4GHz.

This is obviously not that common of a use case, but the behaviour seems pretty weird when you do encounter it. For me, it had the effect of changing underneath my mouse, which is pretty disconcerting. It took me a few minutes to realize that it seems to just take some time to update, whether you bring up the menu or not.

I guess this is probably related to bug 385397, but not sure if it's the same problem or not, as that bug was apparently fixed.

Reproducible: Always
