<iframe name="tfram" id="Fram" style="background-color:#ddddff" frameborder="1"  src="PDF/tarpmessage.pdf">

Loads tarpmessage.pdf in inline frame when page loads for the first time. Other PDF files load into the inline frame when selected from the menu. 

Worked fine in Firefox, SeaMonkey & IE8. Still works in SeaMonkey & IE8. After Firefox updated to 3.6 the trouble shows up as file shown to transfer but menu links stop working and the new file is not displayed in the iframe. If I change to a different Tab and then return the page is blank.

I've found that by changing the iframe src="filename" to src="" all works fine.

Maybe my code is all wrong but it use to work in Firefox, still works in SeaMonkey and IE8.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.load http://nw.tsgear.com/Bindex.html
2.select any PDF from  menu
3.
Actual Results:  
status bar shows file transfers but iframe does not update
menu links stop working

Expected Results:  
expected PDF in iframe to change to one called for by the menu

when working with this off-line using local files the results can be achieved by hitting the reload button but that method does not work using files on the server.

I'm getting the same kind of problem on my Windows 7 desktop as I am on my Windows Vista laptop.

I am not a developer or beta tester.
