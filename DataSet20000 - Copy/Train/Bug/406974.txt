FUEL: no easy history listeners
I'd like to add easy history event listeners to fuel however I'd like to solicit some comments before I start writting code.

To fit in with the FUEL api, here's how I imagine it should work:

browserTabInst.events.addEventListener('historyEventName', aListener);

To accomplish this here's my plan:
* browsertab will now have a sessionshistorylistener which listens to the browsertab's browser object for the history events (probably lazy loaded)
* when a history of event listener fires, the listener will get it's owning browsertab's events list and dispatch the appropriate event (Events takes it from there)

My main questions are:
* Is this plan good (or is there something more obvious which I'm missing)?
* Is there a naming scheme for events?
* These events can get more than one attribute and often not a string (see http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/docshell/shistory/public/nsISHistoryListener.idl) but EventItem requires a string in the MDC documentation. What's a good solution here? serialize the objects using JSON? Or can I pass a hash/Object instead of a string (not really cause then I break the IDL http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/fuel/public/fuelIApplication.idl#36).

Here's a list of the new events and my proposed names/ids
HistoryNewEntry
HistoryGoBack
HistoryGoForward
HistoryReload
HistoryGoToIndex
History Purge
