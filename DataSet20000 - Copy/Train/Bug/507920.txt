Hello,

I really don't know how to say to this. I don't know if you think this is a normal behavior of this.

When you open a location within javascript, and this location is a 'other software' location (for example ed2k: or irc:) that is not reconaised by firefox, it fires an alert and a exeption.

Please, take a look to the website attached where I'm tracking the versions of the firefox tests (through my blog: http://www.nbsp.es/2009/08/02/anomalia-en-esquemas-en-firefox/).

Please, tell me if this is a bug or a normal behavior.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Execute a javascript with a try inside, opening a external scheme

example: try{ window.location="irc:"; alert('IRC available');}catch(e){alert('IRC not available');}

For fast execution, copy this to your navigation bar: 

javascript:try{ window.location="irc:"; alert('IRC available');}catch(e){alert('IRC not available');}
Actual Results:  
I can access to a list of software installed on the client machine.

Expected Results:  
I think returning the same as a normal URL, none a exeption!

I'm working on a stats about the Firefox versions affected by this behavior.
