Site often doesn't load in FF

Often when browsing that particular web site, Firefox will sometimes not load the page completely. I checked and it only loads (displays) the background png image though the HTML is completely loaded (I checked), but not displayed. So you are left with the background image and nothing else. This seems to happen completely randomly. Sometimes you can open 10 links without any problems, and sometimes you have to refresh the page some 20 times to get FF to display it.

I though this was a server specific problem (or my own), but other users report that it also happens to them BUT only in Firefox 3.x. Other browsers (IE, Chrome, Opera) are not affected. Also, since I found out it's Firefox's problem I've been using IE to browse that site (for a couple of days now) and I didn't get that problem not once.

Also, users reported that this started happening with Firefox 3.x. Indeed FF 2.x never did that for me also.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just browse that site. Visit the forum or something and open some 10 or 15 tabs.
2. ???
3. Profit.


Expected Results:  
The page should load/display/render completely as it does in Firefox 2.x or in every other browser.
