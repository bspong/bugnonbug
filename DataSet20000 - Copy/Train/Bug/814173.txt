Firefox causes excessive page faults (appears to be memory compaction)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:10.0.11) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0.11
Build ID: 20121115102332

Steps to reproduce:

I was using a different program, fairly memory hungry (Java game; "minecraft") while firefox was sitting in the background, doing nothing.


Actual results:

As reported by Activity Monitor (think GUI interface to "top"), when I quit Minecraft, firefox's memory usage went from about 200MB back up to over 800MB, without any interaction with it from me.


Expected results:

If a program is sitting around, not doing anything, then it should sit around and not do anything. Programs that actually must keep their memory in use are just badly behaved.

In the case of firefox, since it seems to have some form of internal garbage collection, it seems that it wants to walk all of the data pages to collect garbage, and force everything into memory. Now, granted, that's kind of hard to avoid in a GC system.

But it can be smarter. 

NB: This is a 10 ESR version. I've got two machines running TenFourFox, and this one, all syncing profiles. TenFourFox just released a 17ESR version, so I'll be switching to that real soon now; if this has been solved by 17, then just close this, and I apologize.
