Can't log on to Yahoo Mail after first log on
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

After starting browser, I usually can log on to one account with Yahoo with no
problems but when I try to log on another account I get the error msg 999 -
unable to process request at this time. I have cleared history, cookies, cache
and still have the problem. I am able to log on using IE. Even if I close the
browser I still can't log on after reopening. I must turn the computer off to
get back to being able to log on to Yahoo email account. I removed browser and
reinstalled and still experience problem. I've seen numerous bugs reported for
Yahoo similiar to mine but can't find any fixes. I had no problems when I used
1.03 and below but started experiencing this problem with the upgrades. 
Appreciate in help as I prefer not to use IE.
Thanks in advance
