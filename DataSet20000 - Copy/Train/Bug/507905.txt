Laptop screens are generally getting more pixels while remaining 13 - 15 inches. Additionally, we are seeing 10 - 12 inch screen sizes in netbooks, with increasing pixel counts. Also - more and more, laptops are becoming most of the computer market.

Firefox icons are raster images, so they look smaller as screen resolutions increase. In fact, the 24-pixel "large" icons can be inscrutable for some users.

I would like to request that Firefox enable additional icon sizes. IIRC, the capacity was built in a few years ago. Having this capacity would allow the default and third-party themes to provide small, medium and large icons to allow for greater flexibility in user experience. At the least, three sizes.

Reproducible: Always




As an example of a theme that use 24-pixel icons for "small" and 32-pixel icons for "large," see the Aeon theme. To see a theme that uses 32-pixel and 48-pixel icons for "small" and "large," see Aeon Big. Of course, there is also Aeon Jumbo, with its 48px and 64px icons.

I would recommend the following labels for icon sizes:

16px - x-small
24px - small
32px - medium
48px - large
64px - x-large

Even if the default theme does not make use of the additional icon sizes, third-party themers could do so. 

Of course, svg icons would obviate the need for this, but I believe what I propose could be done now, where any svg icon capacity would lie sometime in the indefinite future.
