Communication using gzip failed. There is no easy way to temporarily disable compression.

The result of a http GET-request failed, because the gzip header was invalid. The only proposed solution is to inform the website owner. However a quickfix is to not use compression. It would be nice to have some option on the error page that temporarily disables the use of compression.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit the URL.
Actual Results:  
A page load error: 
Content Encoding Error        
The page you are trying to view cannot be shown because it uses an invalid or unsupported form of compression.


Expected Results:  
Inform the user of the problem and ask to allow a new GET request with compression disabled. 

A different (and bad) solution would be to silently send the new request, however this would hide this type of problem to website developers. Second, many website do not respect that GET should not change the server's status. Since the first request is already sent when the error is detected, this would result in unexpected behavior.
