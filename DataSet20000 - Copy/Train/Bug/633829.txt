HTTP 302 redirection URLs may cause javascript executed by using Data URI Scheme
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.3 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/6.0.472.59 Safari/534.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:2.0b12pre) Gecko/20110213 Firefox/4.0b12pre  


first of all, please forgive my poor English.

When directing(type url to the url-bar or use <a> tag in html files) to a URL like "http://www.renren.com/autoLogin?r=" which is using HTTP 302 to redirect to another site, some malicious users may use the url below to fish or other evil actions:

I)  http://www.renren.com/autoLogin?r=javascript:alert(1)

obviously, this can't be worked because of the security policy in all the browers such IE, Chrome, and Firefox of course. And the NoScript Plugin blocked this access as well.

But here, I found this security policy can be bypassed by using the Data URI Scheme in all the firefox version(worked both with or without the NoScript Plugin):

II) http://www.renren.com/autoLogin?r=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgxKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg==

It means we can force the browser to execute any javascript codes.

I've try this malicious usage in other browers such as IE and Chrome, they block these access.

Mozilla block the I) URL is reasonable. But in my eyes however, blocking URLs like II) is also necessary.
