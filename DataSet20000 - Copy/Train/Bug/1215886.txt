Styling `select > option` with many options may hang or crash browser
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/47.0.2526.16 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

Applied CSS to `select > option` like say a background-color and a border.
Created a select element with many options in a form like say, a list of all countries on Earth.
Opened the page in Firefox and clicked on the drop down element.


Actual results:

The browser would freeze and hang indefinitely and needs to be forcibly quit or crashes depending on available per process host memory. Small menus with 3-4 elements appear to be fine and the styles are applied to correctly. No testing has been done, if this is exploitable to run arbitrary code not exposed via the JavaScript VM or retrieve information from the browser process that would otherwise be inaccessible. The issue presents on all major platforms the desktop browser will run on. No testing on mobile browsers has been done. If multiple tabs are open, they will become inaccessible or terminated with the main browser process. It is possible for a man-in-the-middle device to inject code into a browser which causes this behavior, say via unsecured Wi-Fi, or direct people to a webpage with such code on it.


Expected results:

The drop down menu should have opened in under one second and the options show with a scroll bar, if they are too plentiful to fit on screen.
