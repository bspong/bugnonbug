params added nsISearchEngine::addParam() are sometimes forgotten after a restart (especially for engines added without icons)

When a search engine is created using addEngineWithDetails and no or an invalid icon URI is specified, the parameters added later using nsISearchEngine::addEngine for this engine are not serialized to the file. This means, that the created engines only work until Firefox is restarted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. execute this javascript code with privileges (from js console or something):
var iconURL = "";
/* var iconURL = "http://www.google.com/favicon.ico"; */
var ss = Cc["@mozilla.org/browser/search-service;1"]
           .getService(Ci.nsIBrowserSearchService);
var name = "Google 2";
ss.addEngineWithDetails(name, iconURL, "", "", "GET", "http://www.google.com/search");
var addedEngine = ss.getEngineByName(name);
addedEngine.addParam("q", "{searchTerms}", null);

2. try the newly created engine, see that it works
2. restart Firefox
3. notice that the engine does not work anymore

(check that this has something to do with the icon:)
4. delete the engine
5. execute the above code again but with the first instead of the second line commented out
6. see that the engine works even after restarting a hundred times
