When disconnecting from the network and reconnecting and then trying to load a script with dynamic script tag the script is being loaded but not executed.

The script is in the form of a callback and an argument: 
callback('some argument'); with a corresponding callback function that has been defined previously. I can see the request and response in firebug and can call the callback function manually. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a callback function that alert a message for debugging.
2. Create a dynamic script tag with src="Yahoo services for example".
3. Check that you get the alert.
4. disconnect from the network and reconnect.
5. repeat steps 1-3 and see that you don`t get the alert.
Actual Results:  
On firebug you can see the request and response from the remote server but the script is not being executed and doesn't call the callback function.

Expected Results:  
The script should be executed.
