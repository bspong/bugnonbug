Debugger can't prettify a script with specific comment (invalid sourcemap)
>>>   My Info:   Win7_64, Nightly 48, 32bit, ID 20160416030220
STR_1:
1. Open the following "data:" url or click URL in the form above
>   data:text/html,<script src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ofr77pmtgpz5sga/2016.04.17 20-41-26 pretty-print bug widget.js?dl=0"></script>
2. Open debugger, click button to prettify the script 

AR:  Nothing
ER:  Script should be pretty-printed


STR_2 ("real-life", because I noticed some hostility to minimized testcases):
1. Open http://www.gazeta.ru/
2. Open debugger, prettify script "widget.js"   [F.A.I.L.]

STR_3 ("real-life"):
1. Open https://news.rambler.ru/
2. Open debugger, prettify script "underscore-min.js"   [FAIL]

STR_4 ("real-life"):
1. Open http://sledcom.ru/
2. Open debugger, prettify script "jquery-1.10.2.min.js"   [FAIL]

This is regression from bug 905700. Slightly fixed in bug 1111058 (but not enough). Pushlogs:
[1] - script could be prettified in a normal way -> script became invisible      (2014-11-27)
[2] - script was invisible -> script became visible, but prettify doesn't work   (2015-01-09)
