No error message for stalled/failed opening of startup link upon restart after offline mode

If the browser was closed in offline mode, clicking on some dynamicly updated
link in e-mail doesn't open that page, as far as I could test it (there is small
possibility that this happens because of my unrelaible link).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Switch Firefox to offline mode
2. Exit Firefox
3. find some dynamicly updated link in some e-mail and click on it (tested on
Thunderbird 7.0, mail from bugzilla about bug change)


Actual Results:  
It seems that site is loading (indicator is rotating), but actually nothing
happens. If I switch online manually enter the address, everything works fine.

Expected Results:  
Site is loaded (better) or I am asked to switch online, or at least I get
message that page cannot be opened because I am offline

I've recently reported bug 251756, probalbly the best way to solve this bug is
by solving that bug. Still, it is not necessary to solve that bug to solve this
bug. I guess that that means they're not dependent. If I am wrong someone will
correct me.
