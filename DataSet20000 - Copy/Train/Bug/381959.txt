Firefox never goes through proxy to access external websites in Vista. No proxy prompt, no proxy authentication
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Media Center PC 5.0; .NET CLR 3.0.04506)
Build Identifier: 3.0a5pre

Scanrio: Running firefox on windows vista, with proxy setup in proxy settings.
Trying to access external website will not work, there is no HTTP proxy details sent in the HTTP headers when trying to request a URL as a result all requests are coming back with "The connection has timed out".


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Up firefox and setup proxy settings

2. Setup your proxy and the connection settings for it. This happens for all possible settings:
a. Auto-detect
b. Manual Proxy Configuration
c. Automatic proxy configuration URL

3. Close settings and restart firefox.
4. Try to access an internal URL - works fine
5. Try to access external URL - get "The connection has timed out". 


Actual Results:  
"The connection has timed out" firefox page


Expected Results:  
A prompt for the Proxy authentication

It appears there is a problem with sending the HTTP headers. 
I have tested this out with the same version of firefox on Windows XP SP1 and The http headers look like this when making the request and responce:

Responce:
Nothing (firefox The connection has timed out The server at www.gmail.com is taking too long to respond." page received.

As you can see in the VISTA version the Line "Proxy-Authorization=Basic U2hlcmlmLk1hbnNvdXI6RGUxMWNvbQ==" Is missing in the REQUEST header.

So it appears that Windows Vista Home premium with the same version of firefox is not allowing me to go throgh a proxy.


I have also tried  Turning of all firewalls and virus scanners - no luck. It NOT a firewall issue because I can still use firefox to access all internal sites within the proxy, but when I go external - Im not getting a proxy prompt.
