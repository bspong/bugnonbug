Page loads fail until cookies are cleared

After upgrading Firefox 2 to Firefox 3, I found no *.yahoo.com pages would load.  The URL of the page would display, but the content would be blank. No error message was shown.  Affected pages included search.yahoo.com (toolbar search would not work), my.yahoo.com, and mail.yahoo.com.

After disabling my Foxmarks plugin and clearing all *.yahoo.com and *.yahoo.net cookies, yahoo pages worked nicely...for some time.  Worst case, I must clear my yahoo cookies by hand every 5 minutes.  Best case, I must clear them daily.  Otherwise, these pages will consistently fail to load.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.launch Firefox 3
2.navigate to mail.yahoo.com
Actual Results:  
blank page is shown


Expected Results:  
yahoo mail page should be shown

I can reproduce this issue with FF3 running on Windows XP SP2 64-bit (IE loads these pages fine in this environment).  I can also reproduce this problem with FF3 running on Mac OS-X 10.4.11 (Safari loads these pages fine in this environment).

I am not using a proxy; I have a direct high-speed connection in both environments.

I honestly searched for 15 minutes in disbelief that I could not find a bug already tracking this problem, which internet searches reveal many users are encountering.  I am happy to help debug this issue.  I am setting "Normal" severity: although there is a workaround, I would not classify clearing cookies several times per day as "easy".
