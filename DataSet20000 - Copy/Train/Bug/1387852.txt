The New Tab doesn't load (probably upon a session restore) unless you reload the tab
Environment:
Windows 10 x86
Latest Nightly (57.0a1 2017-08-06), with about ~260 tabs, most of them are in the background (some about:config entries [1] are enabled)

It started to happen in the last 2-3 days.
Upon closing Nightly I always get the "Do you want to save your session?" dialog (see [1]). After saving the session and rebooting Nightly, opening the New Tab will result in a (completely) blank page.
Right clicking everywhere > Inspect Element will give me the following:
ReferenceError: addMessageListener is not defined

And after expanding it:
activity-stream.bundle.js:736:3
initStore
resource://activity-stream/data/content/activity-stream.bundle.js:736:3
<anonymous>
resource://activity-stream/data/content/activity-stream.bundle.js:2724:15
__webpack_require__
resource://activity-stream/data/content/activity-stream.bundle.js:20:12
<anonymous>
resource://activity-stream/data/content/activity-stream.bundle.js:66:18
<anonymous>
resource://activity-stream/data/content/activity-stream.bundle.js:1:11

Reloading the New Tab page fixes it.

For some reason if the last opened tab before I save the session and reboot Nightly is the New Tab, the issue will not reproduce.

I've tried reproducing it on a new profile but it looks fine (also after applying the about:config entires).
Can't try to pinpoint the regression range as Mozregression doesn't work with the latest Nightly builds for some reason.
