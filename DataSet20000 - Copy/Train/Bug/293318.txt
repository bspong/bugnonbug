When trying to view FutureShop's online flyer (steps: http://www.futureshop.ca
-- click on Weekly Store Flyer then enter Postal Code (e.g., M2N 5X9) then click
on Go), a new window should pop up containing this week's flyer. It always did
in the past. Instead, the popped-up window contains this message:

"The Future Shop Online Flyer requires Javascript in your browser to be enabled
and working. Our site has detected that Javascript in your browser is either
disabled or not working correctly. Please take the necessary corrective actions
and return to our flyer site. Thank you for being a customer of Future Shop."

I _definitely_ have javascript enabled. Of course, it could be a problem at
their end. Note that the same problem exists at http://www.bestbuy.ca.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.futureshop.ca 
2. Click on Weekly Store Flyer link
3. Enter Postal Code (example M2N 5X9) and click Go


Actual Results:  
A window pops up with the message:

"The Future Shop Online Flyer requires Javascript in your browser to be enabled
and working. Our site has detected that Javascript in your browser is either
disabled or not working correctly. Please take the necessary corrective actions
and return to our flyer site. Thank you for being a customer of Future Shop."


Expected Results:  
The window that popped up should have displayed the front page of this week's flyer.
