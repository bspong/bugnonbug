When I had too many bookmarks in the Bookmarks menu causing the arrows to
appear, I clicked on "Manage Bookmarks..." with the "Bookmark This Page" not
showing the menu.  Basically, I scrolled up until I saw "Manage Bookmarks" at
the top.  Then when I cleaned up my bookmarks, such that the menu was short
enough that the arrows disappeared, "Bookmark This Page" did not reappear! 
Furthermore, the arrows were gone, and there was still room for the arrows.

I fixed the problem by creating enough bookmarks to make the arrows re-appear,
then making certain that "Bookmark This Page" was at the top, then deleted the
extra bookmarks.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Overload the Bookmark menu until the point where the arrows appear
2. Scroll up until only the "Manage Bookmarks" shows, and "Bookmark This Page"
doesn't show
3. Delete or clean up bookmarks leaving only a few (5 or so) such that the
arrows disappear

Actual Results:  
"Bookmark This Page" disappeared, the arrows disappeared

Expected Results:  
Displayed "Bookmark This Page" or redrawn the menu.
