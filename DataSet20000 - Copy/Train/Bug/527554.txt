Connection error in many pages, stopping the loading.

When I try to load a page or click in a button the error message appears:
A conexão para o servidor foi reiniciada durante o carregamento da página. (Portuguese)(The connection to the server was restarted during the loading of the page.)
And then I have to refresh the page or re-click the button for it to work (sometimes I need to click several times for it to work)
It happens with many pages like www.orkut.com, www.tpmrpg.net, eu2.pt.looki.com/index.php, www.blog.drpepper.com.br, www.tolicesdoorkut.com.br.
I tried opeing the pages in Google Chrome and they worked without problems there.

1.Open a page
2.Try to click in any button
Actual Results:  
I get the error "A conexão para o servidor foi reiniciada durante o carregamento da página." (Portuguese)(The connection to the server was restarted during the loading of the page.)

Expected Results:  
It should have opened the page or the button that i clicked.
