I noticed graphics weren't loading. I updated firefox-reinstalled all plugin ran spyware and virus scans and even defragged my drive.

 They load fine in IE--but I love your product!- Every time I open Firefox I get a  n error message "plugin has performed an illegal operation" restart Firefox.

 I hate to admit this but, specifically neopets.com graphics (I play to bond with daughters)

Help!!! I down want to go back to IE snail browsing. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start browser
2.Error message
3.Flash related graphics (neopets.com)
Actual Results:  
 I visited the site and some graphics do not load. I know it is a flash enabled site.

Expected Results:  
I could not properly utilize the site

 It should've enabled the plugins--It has worked beautifully since my first FireFox install. Now it just doesn't show the graphics -but Adblock plus asks me if I want to block them ???? It sees them, but I can't. 

 This seems to be the same problem encountered with the MAC OS--but, I run XP Pro-My computer is also used as a server for a home based wireless LAN.
