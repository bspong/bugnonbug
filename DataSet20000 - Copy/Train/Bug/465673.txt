tabs opened from links should appear next to the current tab (instead of at the end of the tabstrip)

This bug is based on Beltzner's comment in Bug #262459:

"Adding options is not something we should be doing lightly to Firefox. If we
believe that the default behaviour should be that new tabs should open adjacent
to the current tab, then let's change that default behaviour. My point in
comment 52 is that the WONTFIX is about adding an option, not changing the
default behaviour. I think there are reasonable arguments to re-evaluate our
"always at the end of the tabstrip" behaviour in a world where more users are
browsing with many tabs.

Right now that's being tracked in bug 161836, which is a Seamonkey bug, but we
could do with a Firefox one, as well."

In summary, what we intend to achieve with this bug is to change the default 'Tab Opening' position for Firefox.

My take on the expected new behavior is:
- Links from current tab -> Open next to Current Tab
- Links from external applications -> Open at the end of the Tab Bar
- Loaded Tabs (Alt+Enter in URL Bar) -> Open next to Current Tab
- Unloaded (New Tabs) -> Open at the end of the Tab Bar

In addition, when the links from current tab open next to the Current Tab, they should follow the order [1][A][B][C] instead of [1][C][B][A].

We can ofcourse look at other combinations of this behavior besides the one described above.
