Registry entry not updated for StartMenuInternet / properties when multiple Firefox versions installed
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060508 Firefox/1.5.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060508 Firefox/1.5.0.4

There are several similar bugs regarding this, including 339663, but this is distinctly different.

If you install Firefox 2 Beta 1 without uninstalling an older version (Firefox 1.x), the Firefox installer changes the StartMenuInternet entry in Windows XP, so that your Mozilla Firefox entry will launch the Firefox 2 executable. HOWEVER, the Properties option (if you right-click on it) still points to the old version, creating a mismatch.

More specifically, these registry entries ARE changed after installing Firefox 2:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Clients\StartMenuInternet\firefox.exe\DefaultIcon
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Clients\StartMenuInternet\firefox.exe\InstallInfo
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Clients\StartMenuInternet\firefox.exe\shell\open\command

but this one is NOT:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Clients\StartMenuInternet\firefox.exe\shell\properties\command


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 1.5 (on clean machine)
2. Install FF2 Beta 1 to separate directory [do NOT uninstall 1.5 first]
3. Look in Windows registry
