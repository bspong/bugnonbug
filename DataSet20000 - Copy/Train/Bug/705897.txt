Releasing left mouse button on button/menus in Firefox button doesn't activate them

Steps to reproduce:

Recently (for some reason), I have become used to opening the items of menus by clicking on a menu, holding down the mouse button and releasing the mouse button on the item in the menu that I want.

I tried to open items in the menus in the menu bar and the preferences (and 'help' etc.) button/menu combo (I do not know the correct terminology) by using this method.  (These are the buttons in the 'Firefox' menu button (the one that appears when the menu bar is hidden) that act as both a button (by clicking) and a menu (by hovering))


Actual results:

In all the menus in the menu bar, this method of opening items seems to work on all the menus' items, as it should in menus everywhere.  Upon releasing the left mouse button on the preferences button/menu combo, nothing happened.  The same thing happened on the combos 'New tab', 'Print', 'Bookmarks', 'History' and 'Help'.  It also happened on the 'Cut', 'Copy' and 'Paste' buttons. Releasing the left mouse button on the items in the submenus that are produced upon hovering over the combos worked as they should.


Expected results:

Releasing the mouse button on the combos should activate the appropriate response, for consistency with all items in menus that aren't only submenus.  It should not have to be press-and-release.
