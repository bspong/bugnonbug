Note - I don't know if this is a duplicate of reports like 372590 or 247116, since they seem to be reporting the same or a similar problem, and their status is "RESOLVED FIXED", and are from long ago, yet I'm still having the problem.

When "Bookmarks Toolbar Items" shows nothing, webpages including the scrollbars bounce up and down. The row of tabs does not move; the toolbars do not move; the status bar does not move. I don't know if it happens when I have no bookmarks, only when I have bookmarks and none are shown. The page moves up or down rapidly, about 5 pixels from and to its normal position, and it can become hard to click or read something on it.

It doesn't shake only when the window has been resized small enough to show no bookmarks, it's only small in the screenshot for a small image and since it was the quickest way for me to reproduce it. If "Bookmarks Toolbar Items" is spaced out from other toolbar items enough, or there are many other toolbar items on the same row, or the first bookmark or folder in "Bookmarks Toolbar Items" has a long enough name, all bookmark items can become hidden making the page shake. Because any of this can be common, I've set the severity rating "normal" instead of "minor".

Reproducible: Always
