With preferences set to "accept cookies" / "always ask", certain sites produce an infinite loop of cookie permission dialogs, despite having "remember this decision" checked (note: i'm running firefox in german, so the exact text / gadget labels might be different in english firefox).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Flush cookies (Delete private data)
2. Set prefs to "accept cookies" / "always ask"
3. Clear the list of cookie exceptions in the preferences (remove all sites)
4. Quit and restart firefox
5. Go straight to http://www.nabble.com/SuperCollider-f2891.html
Actual Results:  
The cookie permission requester dialog pops up (see first attached screenshot). Independant of the choices, even when "remember decision" is checked, the dialog pops up again and again. After some dozen repetitions, a distorted dialog pops up (see second attached screenshot) that doesn't respond at all. Need to force-quit firefox, but problem reoccurs upon next start, sometimes disappears when accessing the site differently (e.g. as a link from google results).

Expected Results:  
Firefox should store my cookie preferences for that site and the dialog should not pop up again if "remember decision" is checked.
