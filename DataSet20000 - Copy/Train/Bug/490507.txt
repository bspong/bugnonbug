Switch order of "Recently Closed Tabs" and "Recently Closed Windows"
This is a very low-risk change. 

In the File menu, the first two options, from the top going down, are "New Window" and "New Tab." The "window" option is located above the "tab" option. It has been this way for years.

In Firefox 3.5 beta 4, we have a new feature to restore "Recently Closed Windows." The feature is located in the History menu. It is placed below the menu item to restore "Recently Closed Tabs." The "tabs" option is located above the "windows" option. Compared to the File menu, it is in the opposite order. 

We should maintain a high degree of UI consistency. It is necessary for the usability of Firefox. The order has been established for years. We should not let our UI consistency deteriorate. 

"Window" menu options should go above "tab" menu options. Tabs are located within windows. Windows are not located within tabs.  

The "Recently closed windows" feature will be new for FF 3.5. We should change the order of the last items in the history menu to "recently closed windows" and then, below that, "recently closed tabs." We should do it before users become familiar with the opposite, non-intuitive placement. 

Expected behavior: "Recently Closed Windows" menu option placed above "Recently Closed Tabs."

Actual behavior: They are placed in the opposite of the expected order. 

Requesting "wanted" status for 3.5 final.
