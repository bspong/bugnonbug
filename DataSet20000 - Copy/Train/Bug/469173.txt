Loses newly added bookmarks when closing browser.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4

When I add new bookmarks, they no longer appear after closing down and reopening firefox. Also, something ate up about 2/3 of my icons on my toolbar, and they are no longer listed in my bookmarks folder either. 


I did a search of the problem, and have disabled colorful tabs, although that was not listed as a problem, but I did not have any of the other things listed. 
I want to go back to Firefox 2, but I see that you won't be doing any security updates for that.... alas, woe is me.... Can anybody help?

Thanks!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a website
2. Drag icon to the toolbar
3. Look in Bookmarks Toolbar folder to see if the link is listed there... it is.
4. Close down Firefox.
5. Reopen Firefox.
6. None of the icons/bookmarks I've added :(


Expected Results:  
My icons/bookmarks should still be present.

I had a theme, and all was well. I changed themes, and had a problem. I changed themes again, and same problem. I changed themes back again, and still a problem.
