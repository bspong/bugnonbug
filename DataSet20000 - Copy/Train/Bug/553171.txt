Where's my history, Dude?
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.8) Gecko/20100214 Ubuntu/9.10 (karmic) Firefox/3.5.8

My history keeps vanishing randomly. Sometimes, if I start to enter the first characters of a URL I've visited, instead of Firefox recognising it, there is no history shown. The entire drop-down list will be blank.

If I call the URL via a bookmark its fine. I can then type in the start of the URL again and everything's there as normal.

It is completely random and very frustrating. Sometimes my history is there, sometimes its not.

This is the 64-bit version of Firefox under Ubuntu. I'm running AIO sidebar, British Dictionery and NoScript as the only add-ons.  

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Type in first part of previously used URL
3.Check drop-down History in address entry box
Actual Results:  
25% of the time, no URL is found. No history shown in drop-down.

Expected Results:  
The URL should be shown, as it is 75% of the time.

When i try to bookmark a URL and start to browse my bookmarks to put it into a specific folder, Firefox will immediately crash out and close for no reason. Happens every time.
