Mouse jumps up 50 or so pixels when held stationary over one LI tag, then moved 1 pixel

When you mouse over any LI inside a UL tag, leave the mouse for a second, then move the mouse 1 pixel, the browser acts as if the mouse had been pointing at a space directly above the current location of the pointer, about 50 pixels up. Visually the pointer does not move -- however, the tooltip and any other mouseover events (javascript etc) will fire as if the pointer was 50 pixels above its current location. This only happens if you move the mouse 1 pixel after it has come to rest on an LI element. If you move more than one pixel, the second pixel's movement will return focus to the correct location.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use the following test HTML:
<ul>			
<li><a title="test 1" href="#">Test text test text 1</a></li>
<li><a title="test 2" href="#">Test text test text 1</a></li>
<li><a title="test 3" href="#">Test text test text 1</a></li>
<li><a title="test 4" href="#">Test text test text 1</a></li>
<li><a title="test 5" href="#">Test text test text 1</a></li>
<li><a title="test 6" href="#">Test text test text 1</a></li>
</ul>

2. Mouse over the last item in the list. Allow the mouse to come to rest. A tooltip should appear saying "Test 6"
3. Move the mouse one pixel only, in any direction; after a few seconds the tooltip for "Test 2" will appear, as if you'd held the mouse over the second item in the list.
Actual Results:  
As above

Expected Results:  
The expected behaviour would be that when you move the mouse 1 pixel, the normal tooltip would disappear and appear again with the same text as before, as you're still mousing over the same element.
