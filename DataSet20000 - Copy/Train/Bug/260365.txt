Minor usability issue with Tools/Options/Web Features

In 0.10PR, the dialog in Tools/Options/Web Features, there are two tick boxes
at the top of the dialog:

Block Popup Windows
Allow web sites to install software

The defaults for these are great, as are the whitelisting of allowed sites
for both. However, logically, I think the description (and therefore value)
of one of these should be inverted. Currently ticking one implies a blocking
action (don't display popup windows unless in whitelist) whereas ticking the
other implies a positive action (allow web sites to install software as long
as in whitelist). If one were inverted, these would end up as:

Block Popup Windows (if not in whitelist)
Block Websites from Installing Software (if not in whitelist)

or

Allow Popup Windows (if in whitelist)
Allow Websites to Install Software (if in whitelist)

I think this would allow the same configurations as currently available,
but would be less confusing as it is more consistent. This doesn't mean the
effective default setup has to change, of course (nor should it) - as long as
the correct boxes are ticked or unticked by default that should be OK.

This is only based on my own usage of the software, not on any in-depth study,
obviously.
