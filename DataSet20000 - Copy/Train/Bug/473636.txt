Allow & Block buttons on the Permissions dialog not localized
This is *really* strange.

On fa at least, the Allow and Block buttons text on the Permissions dialog (not their access keys) are not correctly localized, and appear as "Enable" and "Disable" instead!

Here is the code:

<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/40ba2eac8f4b/browser/components/preferences/permissions.xul#l76> (Block button)
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/40ba2eac8f4b/browser/components/preferences/permissions.xul#l80> (Allow button)

These are using the block.label and allow.label entities, respectively, which are defined in:

<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/40ba2eac8f4b/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/preferences/permissions.dtd#l12> (block.label)
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/40ba2eac8f4b/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/preferences/permissions.dtd#l16> (allow.label)

And are correctly localized at:

<http://hg.mozilla.org/l10n-central/fa/file/4c4ce8ab9349/browser/chrome/browser/preferences/permissions.dtd#l12> (block.label)
<http://hg.mozilla.org/l10n-central/fa/file/4c4ce8ab9349/browser/chrome/browser/preferences/permissions.dtd#l16> (allow.label)

I have no idea where do "Enable" and "Disable" even come from.  I've grepped the entire fa repository and have not found a single mention of them as a translation.

I'm not sure if this is reproducible on other localizations or not, but I can't see anything wrong in the code itself.  I have even verified that the correct strings are included in the permissions.dtd file which is included in fa.jar in obj-dir/dist/bin/chrome.
