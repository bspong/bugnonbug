Firefox 1.0.4 and 1.0.6 both close after opening and attempting to use
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.2) Gecko/20040804 Netscape/7.2 (ax)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.2) Gecko/20040804 Netscape/7.2 (ax)

Both editions of Firefox (1.0.4 & 1.0.6) will open normally. However, shortly
after attempting to use for anything, I get a popup window stating, "Firefox.exe
has encountered a problem and must close." When I click on the enclosed link for
more information, I get:
Error Sig:
AppName: firefox.exe                 1.0.6.0 (or 1.0.4.0)
ModName: xpcom.dll                    ModVer: 1.7.20050.6069
Offset: 0003d20f

I have tried reinstalling both editions. The exact same problem still occurs.
I am using a Gateway MidTower computer running Windows XP Home Edition with a
Pentium 4 processor and a 40gig hard drive (256meg RAM).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open Firefox normally using desktop icon
2. when opening page completes loading, start an application using Bookmarks or
by typing in URL to the address bar
3. 

Actual Results:  
application will hesitate for maybe 10-15 seconds, then a popup Warning window
will appear stating "Firefox.exe has encountered a problem and must close."
