firefox can't open any URL after suspend to RAM
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:14.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/14.0.1 Iceweasel/14.0.1

Steps to reproduce:

I'm experiencing someting similar to bug 470274 but I'm using 14.0.1 packaged for debian stable (Actually I see this issue since at least FF13). I have gmail and zimbra opened all the time as well other web sites (I usually have around 10 active tabs). When I resume after suspend to ram, almost always firefox can't open anything. UI is responsive but no page opens as if there is no Internet connection. But there is because other browsers can open pages at the same time. Also if I restart firefox, it starts working. 

Restarting firefox means killing the firefox process, because File->quit closes the FF windows but do not terminate firefox completely.

Looking at  bug 470274 I tried to play with offline mode. When I got FF in this bad state I enabled offline mode, one page immediately opened but any further attempts to open any page yielded an error that page can't be opened in offline mode. Trying to disable offline mode didn't help and nothing I tried made FF leave offline mode.

So to me it seems offline mode has something to do with the issue.
