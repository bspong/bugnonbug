JavaScript not working correctly in Firefox; Does work correctly in Internet Explorer
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3

This is what happens when I click on the printer-friendly button about halfway down the page: "Firefox doesn't know how to open this address, because the Protocol (JavaScript) isn't associated with any program." It also fails to log in to some sites using Roboform shareware password program. I thought for a while it was Zonealarm Pro & their tech support showed me how to set Firefox as "most trusted", but that didn't help. Also tried shutting down Zonealarm while testing the above URL, but that didn't help either. When I found that it was working OK in Internet Explorer, I knew for sure where the problem is.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.See Details above.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
See quoted message in Details, above

Expected Results:  
A printer-friendly page, usually in a 2nd occurrence of Firefox (not a tab). Or, in the case of Roboform, a successful login to a secure site.

BTW, did I tell you on other Windows XP machines with the same setup, it's not occurring? 
I have used & preferred Firefox for years, & do not want to use Internet Explorer or make it the default browser.

I also tried using Firefox in Safe Mode with the same results.
