Minefield 4.0b2pre Nightly Trunk 20100719 is set to "browser.tabs.closeButtons" to "3" but after the new Close Tab button mockups took effect the Close Tab button on Tab bar is no longer red until you click it so you can't see it on some Persona Themes.

Persona's Examples:Black and Blue, Blue Swirl Fox, Matrix Fox, Metallica custom Persona

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.set "browser.tabs.closeButtons" to "3" in about:config
2.Download/install one of these Persona Themes: Black and Blue, Blue Swirl Fox, Matrix Fox, Metallica custom Persona
3.Pick one and enable it.
Actual Results:  
Since the new Close Tab button mockups took effect the Close Tab button on Tab bar is no longer red until you click it so you can't see it on some Persona Themes.

Expected Results:  
Should be able to see the Close Tab button on Tab bar before clicking it when using any Persona Theme.

The URL that demonstrates the problem that I'm seeing shows Minefield 4.0b2pre 20100719 using Persona Theme - Blue Swirl Fox.

Suggestion: When the Close Tab button is placed on Tab bar, change button text (x)color from charcoal gray and make the (x) red.
