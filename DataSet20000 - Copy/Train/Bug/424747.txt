Problems with font rendering (sometimes bold, sometimes regular font style)

When I visit some certain websites (I recognized the problem p.ex. at slashdot.org or http://sourceforge.net/projects/jabbin), I see that some text passages (like headlines) are displayed sometimes in bold, sometimes in regular font styles.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
at slashdot.org:
1. visit slashdot.org
2. without scrolling the page (page-up/down key or scroll wheel) the headlines are displayed using a regular font style

3. now scroll down one page by pressing page-down key once: the "newly displayed" articles have a "bolder" headline
4. now scroll back one page by pressing page-up key once: the "oldly displayed" articles have the less bold headline
5. press page-down once again (again resulting in bolder headlines)
6. scroll up with the scroll wheel of your mouse and the articles previous having a less bold headline now have also a bolder headline

at sourceforge.net:
1. visit http://sourceforge.net/projects/jabbin
2. notice the font style of the menu (project, tracker, mailing lists, forums, ...)
2a. see http://img401.imageshack.us/img401/2762/sourceforge1gd9.jpg for an example screenshot
3. move mouse cursor over one of these menus (p.ex. tracker), so that the javascript(?) menu opens
4. notice the lighter font style that now appears at the surrounding text
4a. see http://img401.imageshack.us/img401/8648/sourceforge2mh1.jpg for an example screenshot
Actual Results:  
the font styles (bold, regular, bolder) differ

Expected Results:  
the font styles remain the same
