Toggle of "Warn me when web sites try to redirect or reload the page" Option Generates an Error

When I toggle the option "Warn me when web sites try to redirect or reload the page" at Tools|Options|Advanced|General|Accessibility, it immediately generates the following error in the console:

Error: Component returned failure code: 0x80570016 (NS_ERROR_XPC_GS_RETURNED_FAILURE) [nsIJSCID.getService]
Source file: chrome://browser/content/preferences/advanced.js
Line: 222

and if you repeat the process it will continue to generate the same error, such as this when I toggle it again:

Error: Component returned failure code: 0x80570016 (NS_ERROR_XPC_GS_RETURNED_FAILURE) [nsIJSCID.getService]
Source file: chrome://browser/content/preferences/advanced.js
Line: 222

I am not quite sure what is causing this error and the search for this error results in nothing that is relevant to how I am getting the error, so not sure what is going on. Any help would be appreciate to find out what this bug is and how to fix it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Browser
2. Open Error Console (I use Console2 and you can open after the fact too)
3. Toggle: Tools|Options|Advanced|General|Accessibility|"Warn me when web sites try to redirect or reload the page"
4. Error Occurs!
5. Repeat the process toggle again, watch error show up again.
Actual Results:  
Error is generated and the redirect warning does not occur.

Expected Results:  
There is no error and the redirect is stopped, notified to the user.

I have no additional information other than what I have presented and there is no crash report as the browser doesn't crash, just generates an error in the console and the function is not available, nothing else.
