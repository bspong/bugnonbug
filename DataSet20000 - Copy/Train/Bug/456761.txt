After the patch for Bug 448939 landed, the URL bar has lost the "level" attribute. This "level" attribute is very important because:

1. Firefox 3.0 has removed the "yellow" URL bar indication for secure URLs, but many users are using customization CSS code to bring back this colors indicators following the tendencies from Google Chrome and Internet Explorer. Without this attribute no CSS codes are possible to do this.

2. Firefox 3.0 has implemented the Security UI based on two things: A colored button inside the urlbar and "Larry". I'm sure most of FF users has never meet "Larry", and the only visible indicator for a secure URL is indeed the button. With the level attribute it's possible to third party themes to indicate the secure level for a location in many other ways. How the indication looks should be a skin choice.



Reproducible: Always




The level attribute doesn't hurt if maintained and is very useful, so please let it be...
