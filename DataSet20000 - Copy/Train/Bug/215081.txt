Bookmarks and preferences disappear after installing Flash plugin; address bar stops working as well.

Bookmarks, personal bookmark toolbar, and preferences disappear after installing
the Flash plugin on Firebird.  The theme appears to revert to one without a
"search" box in the upper-right corner, and typing addresses into the address
bar no longer works.  When attempting to click links from other programs, a new
Mozilla window is spawned if one was not open and focus changes to the open
Mozilla window if there was one open (as expected) but nothing appears in the
address bar and no page is loaded.  When starting Firebird from a shortcut it
does not bring up the homepage; the preference for the homepage is stored
though, and this page can be accessed by using the home button.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download Mozilla Firebird 1.6
2. Drop entire MozillaFirebird folder (in zip) into C:\Program Files
3. Make sure previous preferences are not being used--delete C:\Documents and
Settings\Owner\Application Data\Phoenix folder
4. Start Firebird (double click on executable)
5. Import bookmarks (saved to an html file previously)
6. Go to the Macromedia site and download a new exe for the flash installer
(Netscape or Netscape compatible)
7. Close Mozilla Firebird
8. Run flashplayer6installer.exe -- accept setting to install into Mozilla Firebird
9. Open Mozilla Firebird

Actual Results:  
Bookmarks, theme, preferences (except for homepage) and address bar disappeared
or exhibited abnormal behavior described above.

Expected Results:  
Retained all settings and previous functionality, with the added ability to view
Flash content.
