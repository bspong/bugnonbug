Nested <object> tags seem to break the IcedTea plugin

I'm not entirely sure if this is a FireFox bug or an IcedTea bug.  However, I don't see why IcedTea should ever get to see the actual DOM tree, so I'm going to assume it is a FireFox bug for now:

If a web page has a Java applet which has been embedded with the <object> tag, nesting another <object> tag within it seems to prevent the IcedTea plugin from running the applet.  The following is reported on stderr:

-----
ICEDTEAPLUGIN_DEBUG = (null)
Initializing JVM...
NOT IMPLEMENTED: virtual nsresult IcedTeaPluginInstance::Start()
Warning: <object> tag requires code attribute.
-----

(Note: The W3C do not specify the existence of a "code" attribute for the <object> tag).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.nexusuk.org/~steve/panotest4.xhtml with the IcedTea plugin installed

Actual Results:  
Java applet remains a grey box and stderr reports "Warning: <object> tag requires code attribute."

Expected Results:  
Java applet should run.

The following URI is an identical page, but with the nested <object> tag replaced with an <img> tag - this page works correctly and does not produce the "Warning: <object> tag requires code attribute." message:
