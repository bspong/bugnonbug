No additional options for new windows when browser starts up windows and tabs from last time

When FF is set to start up with windows and tabs from the last session, new subsequent windows are not properly dealt with.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
One of two things could happen:

1.If the Home Page URL setting is blank, then it will default to Google/FF search page and write that URL into the field. Writing data in that field without user knowledge is not acceptable.

2.If the Home Page URL is populated then it uses that. But FF was told not to start with Home Page URL, it was told to start with windows and tabs of last time.

Expected Results:  
An option of what URLs to use when a new window (crtl-n) is activated after start up

The way around it is to use "about:blank" in the Homepage. But then the Homepage button is now rendered useless.

Startup URL and new window URL should have different behaviours. I do not need 3 of the same pages for three new windows opened, some might.
