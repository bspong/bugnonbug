with additional description:

(...) Clicking Delete from that drop down list doesn't delete that entry but it still deletes entry which can be seen from bookmarks sidebar. So effectively folder in bookmarks toolbar shows a bookmark but list in bookmarks sidebar->bookmarks toolbar->"folder"->"list" doesn't. Works fine in Firefox 12.

Open up bookmarks sidebar and make that folder visible under Bookmarks Toolbar (so that it lists every bookmark in it). Then try to delete one of those from the dropdown panel seen in attachement picture.

Result: Entry is removed from sidebar, but stays in dropdown panel.

In-fact I am not anymore able to delete entries from that dropdown panel by deleting them from library or sidebar.
