"Fresh"(30 minutes or less) windows 7 x64 OS installation, after downloading drivers and installing Firefox using integrated IE8, i tried downloading some programs from source forge, download.com and data.bg (u-torrent, 7zip, bitspirit, winamp, gom player etc.). Problem is with the *.exe files. Firefox asked me: "save file" or "cancel" and when confirming, nothing happens. Before installing win7, i was running vista x64. Back then (a day ago), when downloading *.exe, firefox opened a download files list window (Ctrl+j). When i try downloading other files with association on it - firefox added them to download list, and the file is downloaded and/or opened. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
example: 
1.ask google for winamp
2.go to the first link
3.use "free download"
4.again "free download" button
5.when the window jump at your face, click "Save File"
another example:
1.in the adress bar write 'gom player"
2.redirects you to google, then go to the first link
3.click on the "free download" link under "gom player" picture
4.click on the "download now" picture
5. redirects me to "download.cnet.com"
6.when the window jump at your face, click "Save File"


Actual Results:  
on the first and second example: 
nothing

Expected Results:  
when clicked to firefox's "Save File" button, i expected the (annoying)
 list of downloaded files to be opened and then to start downloading my setups (winamp and gom). 

The programs are just for example. firefox refuses to open or safe any kind of *.exe file.
