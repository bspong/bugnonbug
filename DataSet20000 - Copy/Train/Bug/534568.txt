I will have three or four tabs open on one window, and then all of a sudden the entire window will close on its own.

I had a few issues like this with explorer a few months ago, and took my computer to be looked at by tech support at my school and they said to clean it frequently with malware software and to use Firefox.  
Since then I have not had any issues until a few months ago when I would have about three or four tabs open on one window, but sponanitously the whole thing will close on me.  It will start a report to Moxilla, but there would always be an issue with the report, so it never got sent in.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open pages like facebook, my livejournal, playlist, or my school email
2.wait and do stuff on each one
3.wait until it happens...
Actual Results:  
It happens after few days, not as frequently as before, but it still happens.  I think it is the Facebook site since that is the only site open every time that it has happened

Expected Results:  
Just was trying something out...
Was hoping it was a one time thing
