Websites I can normally load perfectly are loading with strange sizes and dimensions, sometimes too small to read, sometimes too large to fit the screen

When I visit hulu.com the web page components are all too large, overlapping the page, and I can't use the site. On the other side, if I visit Netflix, everything is too small to even read. I am a supporter, advocate and long time use of firefox and mozilla, and want to stay with this browser, any assistance would be greatly appreciated. I have also experienced more random crashes than usual, and the browser is usually unable to reload the closed tabs.

Thank You

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
I open the browser, enter the url (examples: hulu.com and netflix.com) and the screen shows up disproportionately.

Expected Results:  
The same

Displayed the websites in regular sizes and proportions to the screens, as it has always done up until a few weeks ago. I may have automatically updated my browser to the latest version right before, I can't be certain as it happens automatically.
