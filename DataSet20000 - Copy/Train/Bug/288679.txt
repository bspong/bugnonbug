In the past, this has been an intermittent bug, although it is currently
occuring constantly.  If I move my mouse cursor into the area of the pulldown
menus or the tabs area of the Firefox window, the mouse cursor switches from the
default pointer icon to an hour glass icon for no apparent reason.  As soon as I
move it back into any other location on the Firefox window or for that matter,
anywhere else on the desktop, the mouse cursor changes back to the pointer icon.

I am using a Logitech mouse and Mouseware driver ver. 9.791, but the same
problem occurs with previous versions of the driver as well as the standard
Windows mouse driver.

The problem does NOT occur within Internet Explorer.

I have tried to isolate the problem, but have not been succesful at doing so.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox
2.Move mouse cursor over described areas
3.

Actual Results:  
Action as described above

Expected Results:  
Not changed the mouse cursor icon

I am using an nVidia-based video card running the latest nVidia drivers and
their desktop management software.

I am also using a Logitech wireless iTouch keyboard and mouse using their latest
software and drivers for both.
