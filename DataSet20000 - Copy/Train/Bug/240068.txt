Clicking on some real audio links causes browser to send realplayer an empty temp file

At the website above, clicking on "Listen Live" causes the RealPlayer (or the
trplayer program if that is used) to start up and immediately give an "Invaild
Metafile" error.

Another user at this <a
href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?s=&forumid=2&threadid=165143">page</a>
described the exact same problem.

Apparently this is caused by the browser downloading a file (e.g.
/tmp/g3ntzb74.ra) from the linked url and handing it to the realplayer program.

However, when either realplayer or trplayer are started and manually given the
<a href="http://play.rbn.com/?url=airam/airam/live/live.rm&proto=rtsp">linked
url</a>, they can play the stream with no problems.

This does not happen with all realaudio links.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on the "Listen Live" link at airamericaradio.com
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Got a dialog box that said "Invalid Metafile" and no audio.

Expected Results:  
I think that firefox should have hand the full url to realplayer instead of
downloading an empty file to the /tmp directory and handing it that.
