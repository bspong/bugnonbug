Imported Bookmarks are only updated if you click on them individually

In FF: Bookmarks | Organize Bookmarks
In the Bookmark Manager: File | Import from File
Import an old bookmark file.
The the favicon is empty

In FF: Bookmarks
There too, the new bookmarks have an empty favicon
In FF: Bookmarks | Open all in Tabs
All bookmarks get opened, the tabs show the favicon, the bookmarks still have an empty favicon.
Instead of opening all bookmarks at once, open one after the other by clicking on each of them individually.
Now the bookmark list shows the favicon. I think sometimes the description is read from the Web Site too, as you can observe in the bookmark manager, but I cannot reproduce it. At least the description is fetched from the Web page for new bookmarks.

I suppose this is an unintended behavior. If the bookmarks get enhanced by the favicon when you open the page one after the other, it should also get updated if you open multiple pages simultaneously.

I would also appreciate if the description would be determined from the web page too. I would not mind whether only empty descriptions would be filled or if even existing descriptions would be overwritten.
