<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=243078">Bug 243078</a> is
the "right" way to fix this bug, but it's not going to be fixed in time for Deer
Park, which means another six months or so of Firefox looking like a
seven-year-old Windows 95 app on modern Windows systems:

1. Icon spacing doesn't match Internet Explorer, and appears to have been
designed to maximise viewable space. This is fine assuming that the toolbar
buttons aren't going to be used that much, but having a 16px Back button isn't
great for people with less than 20/20 vision. It also looks ugly.
2. Menu bars have a 3D look which doesn't fully match Windown 95 anyway, but
looks awful on XP Luna. Menu highlights should follow the Windows Luna scheme
for now until the above bug is fixed, because it looks nicer on the most popular
Windows distro at the moment and doesn't look terrible on older versions (most
modern apps, such as recent Office versions, use the Windows XP look regardless).
3. Menu spacing is likewise miniscule, making it harder to hit individual items
as well as being less attractive and readable.

Patch coming up.

Reproducible: Always
