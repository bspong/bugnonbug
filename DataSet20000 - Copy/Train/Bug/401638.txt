firefox becomes uncontrollable after accessing website

After accessing a website such as that posted in the "URL" field of this form, content that is not wanted and/or is innapropiate may be displayed and no action can be taken from the user's side to close the firefox window or tab in which the content is displayed other that that of ending the proces from windows's task manager. The firefox window gets resized and starts moving from one corner of the screen to another, making the user unable close it. Although this may be considered as a "feature", I believe that when such a site is loaded, the user must be presented with a warning and must be given a choice wether to display the site or not. Also, if the user is mislead to ignore any eventual warnings that the firefox application may issue, he must have the option to close the misbehaving site. I know that this most likely files under "Broken Websites" but i was unable to access the "Help" menu, or any other menu for that matter, while the site was being displayed. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.access the website presented in the "URL" field.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Firefox became unresponsive and inapropriate content was displayed.

Expected Results:  
I expected the ability to disable such a misbehaivng site instead of having to close the firefox process from the task manager.

I am running firefox with it's default theme and my system does not have a special configuration. My operating system is windows 2000 professional with all patches to date.
