I have two styles within a stylesheet that has been put in use on a page via a
<link> attribute.  The only different between the two styles are border-style:
none; and border-style: solid.  I have style .homedim assigned via HTML class
attribute to an <img> element.  This is the style with border-style: none.  In
an onmouseover event handler attribute, I call a JavaScript function that sets
the className property of the image object to the .homelite style, which has the
border-style: solid.  The solid border does not appear onmouseover.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open page with stylesheet in effect and class assignments as described in
Details.
2. Roll mouse over image with assigned class and event handlers as described in
Details.
3. Notice that style change does not occur.
Actual Results:  
The border defined as solid by the border-style property of the assigned class
does not become visible on mouseover.

Expected Results:  
That the border-style defined in the assigned class make the border visible
around the image on mouseover.
