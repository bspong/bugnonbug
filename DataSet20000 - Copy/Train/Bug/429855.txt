Opening Firefox multiple times causes some broken windows

When clicking the Firefox icon on the QuickLaunch bar multiple times quickly, the first few windows are 'broken' (i.e., not completely functional) while the second set are completely normal.  For example, the homepage is not loaded on startup, the back, forward, reload, and stop options in the context menu always remain gray and the same options on the navigation bar remain non-functional.   

Also, if add-ons are installed that can optionally add to the context menu, all options that could be added are added despite contrary preferences.

If you do the same process but with at least one Firefox window already open,
the windows all open correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ensure that Firefox is not open
2. Quickly, try opening Firefox multiple times
3. Try using some of the first windows opened
Actual Results:  
Some of the first windows opened are 'broken'. Add-on preferences are ignored for adding to the context menu.

Expected Results:  
All windows opened should be completely functional. Add-on preferences should be loaded correctly for each window.
