Using the New version of Yahoo Mail, I was not able to Adjust the Size of the "Viewing Pane" using Firefox browser.

I reported that problem to Yahoo Customer Service and they recommended for me to Uninstall and Remove the "Skype Extension" in firefox's Add-ons. According to them, "Certain add-ons or plug-ins can actually cease certain
web sites from working correctly." 

I removed the Skype Extension, And the Problem was Fixed. 

The Problem then is I had to remove the Skype Extension for my yahoo Mail for it to work properly.  

Would you be able to Fix the "Skype Extension" so it does not cause a problem when adjusting the viewing pane of the new Yahoo Mail. 

Thank you.
