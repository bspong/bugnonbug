Browser reports "stopped" in lower left after several hours dormant on nightly build from 7/21
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; Alexa Toolbar)
Build Identifier: 

This may be hard to reproduce as it may be time dependent, but Firebird 
indicated "stopped" in the lower left and further browsing would not occur. 
The interface remained active and the tab did display "loading". I had two 
Firebird windows running at the time, one with two tabs, one with only one. 
All tabs in both windows were equally unresponsive. I brought up IE just to 
rule out a connection issue and browsing was fine. I then closed both Firebird 
windows, but a Mozilla task still remained open according to Window task 
manager, under processes. I installed the build from 7/23 and I'm running 
fine, but I won't know if this problem exists unless I leave Firebird idle for 
several hours or overnight.

One other factor could be that one window was running an intro animation which 
may or may not have influenced the "stopped" state. That site 
was "www.denon.com" and the animation was still running despite the "stopped" 
indication.

Expected Results:

would not expect a permanent Stop state to occur
