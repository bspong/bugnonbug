Bug 514796 discusses adding relative tab parenting closing behavior to Firefox and its complications with user expectations.  This is just to discuss enforcing closing tabs 'always right' or switching it to 'always left' regardless of preferences or features. 

I think i'm seeing some newly created odd close behavior when I'm trying all
the code paths we've created factored in the same session otherwise the behavior hasn't really changed so much. 

So, maybe we should just have someone cleanup or double check the current code
paths of the current tab closing behavior and we should answer the following:

Do all code paths close 'always right'?

Do we let 'switch to tab immediate' keep its 'always left', or change it to match 'always right'?  Why is this a special case?

Do we enforce 'always right' behavior, or can we change it to 'always left'?

Reproducible: Sometimes

Actual Results:  
Turning on and off features doesn't have consistent closing behavior.
Ie Relative Tabs, Switch to Immediate tabs, Target Links and New Windows, and Default behavior.

Expected Results:  
Behavior is consistent.
