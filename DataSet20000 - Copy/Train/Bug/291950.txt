The browser keeps scrolling past the bottom of the page when viewing Yahoo mail,
when using the mouse wheel to scroll down.  The scrollbar will push up and it
will keep scrolling past the page until the whole page is blank.  Then when I
scroll up, the scrollbar and the page come back, but sometimes a blank area is
left at the bottom.  This works just like scrolling with the mouse wheel would,
except that at the bottom of the page, then the scrollbar and the page scrolls
up, and you see a blank page as you use the mouse wheel to scroll down. 
Scrolling up will brink the scrollbar/page back, but sometimes leaves an inch to
a half page blank area that you can't see the page with.  Refreshing fixes the
page, but doesn't solve the problem.  I noticed this with yahoo mail, when
viewing a long email where the scrollbar appears.  In addition, I had a few
other sites do this, but I can't remember them.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Yahoo Mail.
2. View a message (hadn't had it happen for the list of messages page) that is long
3. Scroll down with the mouse wheel

Actual Results:  
With the mouse wheel, sometimes it stops at the bottom, sometimes it keeps going.

Expected Results:  
Stop at the bottom.

Do have extensions installed (many), I do have a theme (Phoenity).
