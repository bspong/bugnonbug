FireFox crashes
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0

Every since FF4.0, then 4.01 and now FF5.0, the frequency of crashing has increased. All but 2 of the session restore has bee successful. But this is taking too much time and data loss is critical. Mozilla may be moving too fast with updates. Some site accessing is also slower. The files created in about:crashes show the same results which state that the cause is unknown. Are tere settings in about:config that have to be changed, reset, etc.?...
I have also seen cases where FF freezes, screen fades and FF is unresponsive. Sometimes after a few minutes it goes through okay and sometimes I have to go into task manager and shut it down. When go back in, all sites are lost

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just accessing a website. There is no consistent cause.
2. Happening at least twice weekly and increasing since FF3.6.XX
3. Accessing URLs for shutdown and freezing.

Actual Results:  
FF attempts to restart and recover loaded tabs. Fortunately, most of the time it works.

Expected Results:  
I expect normal operation as in 3.6.XX. I never had any problems with freezing/non-responsive or crashing prior to FF4.0. (Use sine FF1.0)
