Special Characters in QueryString causes corrupt cookie -- corrupt cookie Locks out entire domain with "Bad Request"
User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Media Center PC 6.0; MDDC; .NET4.0C; Tablet PC 2.0; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; .NET4.0E)

Steps to reproduce:

Attempted to navigate to www.cbancnetwork.com -- however, a corrupted cookie had been stored on my computer.
Here is the corrupted cookie string (note the <exclamation><exclamation> in the 4th line

47219957.1348253421.10.1.utmcsr=
Act-On%20Software|utmccn=\
cbanc%20WebEd:%20The%20essentials%20of%20Exception%20Item%20Processing|
utmcmd=email|utmctr=Session%202%20%20Exception%20Processing|utmcct=email

HERE is the URL, as corrupted:
http://www.cbancnetwork.com/default.aspx?
v=8b8fb556-b269-462b-8eb4-3e509af53c5b&t=webinar&utm_medium=email&
utm_source=Act-On+Software&utm_content=email&utm_campaign=
cbanc%20WebEd%3A%20The%20essentials%20of%20Exception%20Item%20Processing&
utm_term=Session%203%20%E2%80%93%20Exception%20
Processing%3A%20Going%20Beyond%20the%20Two-Day%20Return
&cm_mmc=Act-On%20Software-_-email-_-cbanc%20WebEd%3A%20
The%20essentials%20of%20Exception%20Item%20Processing-_-Session
%203%20%E2%80%93%20Exception%20Processing%3A%20Going%20Beyond%20the%20Two-Day%20Return

The corrupted portion is:
%E2%80%93  (which equates to)  `“â


Actual results:

Once this cookie was on my computer, every request to visit www.cbancnetwork.com was refused and "Bad Request" was displayed by the Browser.


Expected results:

Anything, except the completely uninformative "Bad Request".
Perhaps show a link to delete all the domain cookies? (instead of showing "Bad Request"?)
Maybe check the cookie-reading code?
But when a client computer sees "Bad Request", and
no one can get to your site (Through Firefox ONLY), that is really BAD.

NOTE:  The cookies don't get corrupted using other Browsers.
