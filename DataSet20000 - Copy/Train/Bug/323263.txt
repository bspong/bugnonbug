Firefox is unable to load the specified stylesheet
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

Starting from approx. 01/11/06, Firefox 1.5 on Windows XP (see Details) is unable to render www.archlinux.org correctly: the background of the page is black instead of white. The problem occurs because Firefox fails to load http://www.archlinux.org/css/containers.css stylesheet. The problem looks starnge: I'm using a proxy (thus 404 and other HTTP errors are presented by proxy erro pages, not Firefox error pages), but when I'm trying to load http://www.archlinux.org/css/containers.css manually (i.e. copy this URL to the Adress Bar and press enter), I see Firefox "Problem loading page" error, which states: "File not found: Firefox can't find the file at /css/containers.css." The name "containers.css" is significant: if I change it to "container.css" or something other, I recieve standard 404 error page from proxy. The file actually exists on that server (I've checked with wget) and has Content-type: text/css.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://www.archlinux.org/css/containers.css in the browser


Actual Results:  
You recieve Firefox erro page, stating "file /css/containers.css not found". 

Expected Results:  
You should see containers.css contents.

I'm using default theme
