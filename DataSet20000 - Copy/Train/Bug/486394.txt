When saving an image using the right click "save image as" option Firefox 3.5b4pre freezes before saving image.

I've noticed this start to occur over the course of the last 1 to 2 weeks in the nightly builds of 3.5b4pre. At first I thought it was the drive I was saving the files to, so I swapped it out with another one, but that didn't fix the problem. Anyways, when I load up a page that has a bunch of images on it and I right click on one and select save image as, Firefox 3.5b4pre freezes before it saves the file. Subsequent saves on the same page do not cause the freeze.  However if I move on to another page minutes or hours later, I encounter the same issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a page with a bunch of large images on it.
2. Right click on image. 
3. Select save image as.
4. Firefox 3.5b4pre freezes before saving image.
Actual Results:  
Firefox 3.5b4pre freezes before saving image.

Expected Results:  
Firefox 3.5b4pre should not freeze while saving an image.

Windows Vista Ultimate 32bit, Intel 975XBX2 Mobo, Intel Q9450 CPU (3.0ghz per core), 4GB DDR2, 500GB C:, 320GB X: (where I'm saving the images).

Also, I have not seen any errors in the Error Console and disabling jit.chrome has no effect. (Not that I thought it would, but I tried it anyways.)
