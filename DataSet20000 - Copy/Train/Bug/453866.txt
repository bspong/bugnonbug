warning for: "I submit information that's not encrypted"

1. In firefox 3.0.1, after acknowledging the warning gmail encounters a transmission problem.  You have to turn the warning off in gmail instead of just acknowledging the warning.

2. This warning turns off from time to time for no apparent reason.  Most recently, it went away when firefox 3.0.1 downloaded.

3. I deserve a medal for omitting the obscenities in this one.  In light of 1 and 2, I just sent a password to "The Netscape Unofficial FAQ" with no encryption.  Those idiots promptly sent it back to me in email.  I'm done with that page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set the warning.  Upgrade from whatever I was running before to 3.0.1.
2. Sorry, I don't usually notice right away and I am not usually sure what got me.  I Don't know how to reproduce this one.  I guess just set the option and check it more often.  Is it possible for a script to clear this without me receiving a warning message?
3. Go to The Netscape Unofficial FAQ (http://www.ufaq.org/) and create a new account.  Then remove them from the links on your web page.  Then forward this report to them after inserting swear words.
Actual Results:  
1. gmail keeps coming back with:
   Oops... the system encountered a problem (#103) - retrying in XXs
2. I end up signing up for a new website which doesn't encrypt the message as you establish the new password which makes me angry.


This is a security problem so long as there are web pages as incompetent as the one for Unitrin insurance and the one for the Netscape Unofficial FAQ
