Microsoft Exchange mails can be accessed via web client. When user tried to access mail, all content in 'Inbox' is working fine or accessible. But all other contents such as sent mail, folders, etc can not be access. Also, it has false error saying that content is corrupted. 

Using IE, everything works fine, it has issue with Firefox.

It is understood that all the options and features may not be available in Firefox, but basic functions like folder should be available and it should not have any misleading or false error.  

Reproducible: Always
