i have several sites whitelisted for cookies, and each time i visit i check the
"remember my <info>" box.  but if i quit firefox and return to the site, it
doesn't remember my login/userid/password/whatever-it-promised-to-save.

i've checked my stored cookies, and i do have several long-term cookies from the
sites in question - but apparently they aren't the right cookies.  or something.
mail.yahoo.com
tdwaterhousebank.com
mysurvey.com
fool.com

all of those have promised to remember my userid or password at one time or
another, and all have failed to do so.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to mail.yahoo.com
2. log in, checking the "remember my user name" box
3. do some stuff
4. exit firefox
5. restart firefox and go back to mail.yahoo.com


Actual Results:  
username and password text entry boxes both blank.

Expected Results:  
having stored a cookie with my username (since it's a whitelisted site in my
cookies manager), it should fill in my username and only ask for my password...

i'd normally think this was a problem with the sites, but all of them are having
trouble.  so i don't know if it's a problem with the cookie manager or what. 
it's either minor, since the workaround is for me to remember all my userids and
passwords, or it's a (major) broken feature in that whitelisting a site and
checking the "remember me" box while logging on to it should result in not
having to type some of the login info again...
