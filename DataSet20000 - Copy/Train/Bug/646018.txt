In some rare occasions the mouse clicks stops working in firefox 4.0 rc on mac osx. I could not reproduce nor have any idea what could trigger it. It happened twice in the 3 days since I installed firefox

The symptoms: 
- muse click stops working in firefox. I mean the whole firefox not just the webpages, clicking on the tabs dont change tabs, clicking on the menu do not open the menu,  etc... nothing at all.
- the keyboard shortcuts are still working properly, ctrl+tab switches tab, etc... so the firefox is not  frozen
- the mouse works on the other running programs or in the desktop at the same time, switching between programs, firefox no clicks, others fine
- only clicks affected, the movement of the mouse pointer is fine.

First time happened directly after the 4.0 RC install, when I updated the extensions to 4.0 and restarted the firefox with the restart link on the extension manager, after the restart no mouse clicks. Quit firefox and start again solved it.

Second time happened when I opened the lid of the laptop waking it up (ff was running when it went sleep) and started checking my emails in google apps, few clicks was fine and then suddenly from one click to another the clicks stopped working.
