The user defined text that loads in the panel underneath the image Control Panel on this page appears to be the same colour as the background of the box (white) so it's completely invisible using the Firefox browser.  The same page viewed with Explorer reveals the text correctly as black.  There's also some visible 'distortion' of the black title bars at the top of each panel when the page is viewed with Firefox that isn't evident with Explorer, which seems to be able to display the page properly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open the page
2.wait for images to finish loading
3.no text is visible in the white area of the box directly under the Control Panel but if it highlighted it can bee seen

Actual Results:  
I couldn't see the text in the Comments box

Expected Results:  
The Comments box text should appear as black on the white background

Displayed the Comments box text in the correct colour (black) so it's visible
