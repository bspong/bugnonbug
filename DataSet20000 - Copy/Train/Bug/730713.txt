Google Earth plugin freezes when panning camera fast or opening photo. [temporary fix: set dom.ipc.plugins.enabled to false]
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:10.0.2) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0.2
Build ID: 20120215223356

Steps to reproduce:

I have Firefox 10.0.2 installed. I go to http://maps.google.nl/ . I switch to the Earth view, essentially opening the Google Earth plugin version 6.1.0.5001 which is installed.


Actual results:

I pan the camera quite fast and the Google Earth plugin freezes. Switching to Full Screen View (through the Firefox menu in the upper left corner) unfreezes the Google Earth plugin. The Google Earth plugin also freezes upon attempting to open a photo, a Wikipedia-link or a youtube-video. Repeatedly going into Fullscreen mode and leaving Fullscreen mode unfreezes Google Earth and the photo or youtube video will appear.


Expected results:

The Google Earth plugin should be stable and shouldn't freeze. I have found a temporary fix for this problem: type about:config in the address bar and type dom.ipc.plugins.enabled in the filter box. Setting dom.ipc.plugins.enabled to false fixes all my issues with Google Earth. I can use Google Earth for hours, panning the camera and viewing photos, youtube-videos etc. and it never freezes.

The above bug report has apparently been resolved in firefox 8, but in firefox 10.0.2 I have a similar problem, as I've explained above.
