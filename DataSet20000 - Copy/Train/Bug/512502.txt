With the cursor on a jpg and you right click the option "save image as" the file size that is saved is 1k.  It saves a placeholder jpg icon but the not the image.  If you save from the thumbnail it saves correctly and includes the full size of the file. This sometimes happens on imbedded jpgs on web pages as well.
Everything looks normal as it gives you the option to "save image as" but when you go back and check it has saved a place holder "jpg" icon but the file size is only 1k.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.click on thumbnail and load image
2.right click image and save as
3.image saved 
Actual Results:  
actual size of the image that is saved is only 1k.  looks like it save til you try to open image.  saves an icon that looks like a jpg but does not open.

Expected Results:  
should saved the image regardless of being a thumbnail or actual image if it gives you the option to save as a jpg. 

i have had this happen both on single images that i have clicked on from thumbnails and actual imbedded images in web pages. These are not protected images because it gives me the option to save them.  It looks as though it did save as the image has a jpg icon but the file size is incorrect. should be 316k and its only 1k.  1k= no image saved.  default theme used.
