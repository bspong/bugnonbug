"clear all" option doesn't clear everything
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

When I go to the menu Tools / Options / Security and click on the "Clear All"
button, I notice that it doesn't work properly : "Saved Form Informations" is
not cleared (the button stays with a black writing and not gray as it should +
it is effectively not clearing those informations.) The same is happening with
"Download Manager History" and "Cookies" and "Cache".
It used to work with Mozilla 1.0.5, I've installed 1.0.6 this morning and it's
the first time it happens to me.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. browse the web as usual (any page, just to fill the cache etc.)
2. go to menu : tools / options / security
3. click on "clear all"
Actual Results:  
A popup warning me this will delete all information (...) comes up and I click
"Clear All Informations" in order to perform the operation anyway. Then a few
buttons turn to gray, but not all as they should.

Expected Results:  
All the buttons should have turn to gray, meaning the deleting has been done on
all these fields.

I can delete information by clicking on the six buttons one by one (except for
"cache" that won't clear by any mean...)
