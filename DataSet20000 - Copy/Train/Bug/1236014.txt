Pocket as a built-in add-on not supported by language packs, manifest problems
bug 1215694 comment 106:

I'm pretty sure this breaks in language packs.

Seems there's nothing hooking up browser/features/firefox@getpocket.com/chrome.manifest.

Fuchsia:locale-fr axelhecht$ find . -name \*manif\*
./browser/chrome/fr.manifest
./browser/chrome.manifest
./browser/features/chrome.manifest
./browser/features/firefox@getpocket.com/chrome.manifest
./browser/features/firefox@getpocket.com/fr.manifest
./chrome/fr.manifest
./chrome.manifest
./webapprt/chrome/fr.manifest
./webapprt/chrome.manifest
Fuchsia:locale-fr axelhecht$ find . -name \*manif\* -exec grep -H getpocket {} \;
./browser/features/chrome.manifest:manifest firefox@getpocket.com/chrome.manifest application={ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384}

I haven't run a localized nightly yet that actually has their locale files moved, but the chrome.manifest in /Applications/FirefoxNightly.app/Contents/Resources/browser/features/firefox@getpocket.com.xpi looks OK to me.

Ah, that's because jarmaker puts the extra manifest in browser/features... and that one is not referenced anywhere. Please file a followup bug. A quick way around is to forcefully add a "manifest features/chrome.manifest" in "browser/chrome.manifest", using buildlist.py, when doing a repack.
