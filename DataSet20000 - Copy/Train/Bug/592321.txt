firefox 4beta5candidate1 creates enormous system (likely gfx (directx?) layer related) load on winxp - huge contrast to beta4 (no such woes there)

maybe some deep internals have changed, but i just upgraded my previously pretty much normally behaving firefox 4 beta4 to the candidate build1 of beta5 (english winxp, x86, multicore cpu, some ati embedded graphics card (portable machine)) and now whenever i even do just as little as enter this text in this edit field while filing this bug, or simpy raise the firefox windows and hover/move the mouse over the firefox areas or scroll the window or surf some pages or do anything at all, firefox creates huge load (100% core load, aka a single thread creates 100% load arriving at 50% cpu load on dualcore machine) apparently in some drawing/display subroutines on this windows xp machine, while beta4 has not behaved like this.

i think i recall some roadmap towards accelerated directx or similar stuff related rendering things the firefox team wanted to do, though im unsure if winxp/directx9 was also affected or being tackled by the roadmap and plans.

but something has a severe impact on the winxp machine and its load, which is very most likely related to the displaying and drawing of things on screen.

process explorer (sysinternals/msft tool) clearly shows firefox generating a very high percentatage of a red graph within its own load, so the green percentage (non-system load) is most of the time very low.

having already followed the amd-code-analyst howto pages on
https://developer.mozilla.org/Profiling_with_AMD_CodeAnalyst

i tried to narrow down the problem with the beta5 build of firefox4, and codeanalyst reports the firefox.exe usage as follows:

a very high hal.dll (55.75% during these 30second sample cycles of codeanalyst) usage (\windows\system32\hal.dll)
second is xul.dll (total of 21.4% cycles) whose internal subroutine load samples dont really look revealing or suspicious to me

and third and fourth place are the ati (graphics driver) components of this machine with 13.17% and 3.41% cpu cycles (ati2cpag.dll and ati2dvag.dll both is \windows\system32\)

fifth position is mozcrt19.dll with 1.96% cpu cycles within the firefox.exe scope......


there has to be some serious changes in the firefox4 codebase which has been added or activated with the beta5 build, which at least makes firefox4 beta5 pretty much unusable on this ati-graphics card based machine.

Reproducible: Always
