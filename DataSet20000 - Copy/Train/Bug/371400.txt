Happens with XHTML 1.0 documents containing iframe that displays an auxiliary file.  In my case, I see it on my machine (running Ubuntu Edgy) when the files are served by Apache, which is configured to serve XHTML files as application/xhtml+xml.

Situation: when served as text/html, the iframe is rendered every time.
When served as application/xhtml+xml, iframe often (but it seems not always) fails to render.  My guess is it's some issue having to do with the timing of the loading of the iframe source and rendering.  But see below for a repeatable phenomenon.

Some pages (served as text/html) that otherwise display this behaviour are at 
http://zipcon.net/~swhite/docs/computers/languages/object_oriented_JS/
To see the problem, you will have to copy the files from that directory to another host which will serve them up as application/xhtml+xml.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.XHTML files with auxiliary files embedded in iframes
2.serve files as application/xhtml+xml
3.
Actual Results:  
Usually iframe isn't rendered.  

Expected Results:  
iframe to be rendered.

I have looked at these files also with: Opera, IE6, Konqueror.  
None of them exhibits this problem.

Another phenomenon:  It looks like the iframe renders *every other time* I re-load the page by hitting Enter in the URL area.  Quite consistently.
