When highlighting text and dragging it to the search bar, Firefox occasionally crashes.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.3) Gecko/20060426 Firefox/1.5.0.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.3) Gecko/20060426 Firefox/1.5.0.3

It doesn't happen all the time, only after I have been running firefox for a little while. And the crashes are random. If I highlight text on a webpage, and click-drag it to the google search bar, firefox hangs, and then crashes. I can just open firefox up again, and everything is fine. Only once has this issue removed all my themes, extensions, and bookmarks.

I seem to get this crash 3-4 times a week. And seeing as I am on the internet in excess of probably 100+ hours a week it happens very rarly. 

I don't think it is an extention problem, because I tried to recreate the crash in the safe-mode version. It took some time, but I was successful.

If you could figure out the cause of this, and fix it, that would be great :D. I try to use my keyboard as little as possible, and having my firefox crash isn't very fun lol.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Highlight text on a webpage.
2. Click and drag it to the search bar.
3. Hope (well, in this case) for a crash.

Actual Results:  
Either I get a successful search, or I get a crash.

Expected Results:  
Returned a successful search.

I am using the latest version of Firefox (1.5.0.3)
