Warning: Unresponsive Script

A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete.

Script: resource:///modules/XPIProvider.jsm -> jar:file:///C:/Users/Chuck88/AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/6ng0ylm4.default/extensions/%7Bd10d0bf8-f5b5-c8b4-a8b2-2b9879e08c5d%7D.xpi!/bootstrap.js -> jar:file:///C:/Users/Chuck88/AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/6ng0ylm4.default/extensions/%7Bd10d0bf8-f5b5-c8b4-a8b2-2b9879e08c5d%7D.xpi!/lib/utils.js:146

Buttons:        Continue    Stop Script

Issue not resolved after clicking on Stop Script. Must use Windows Task Manager to End Process in order to close Firefox.
This issue began a couple of days ago. I did not install new Firefox Addons or any new software.
I uninstalled Firefox and Java RTE software today (23 Nov 12.) Reinstalled up-to-date versions. Same issue in Firefox. Internet Explorer functioning fine on Yahoo Mail. Problem is only in Firefox. I performed a reset on Firefox. Same issue without any addons installed. I have attached a file with Reset Information.


Expected results:

I should have been able to read my Yahoo mail.
