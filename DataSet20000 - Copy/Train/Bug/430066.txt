Network file saving, profile creation, saving user preferences with OES2 Linux NSS filesystem

Environment: 

Server:
-------
- Novell open enterprise server 2 (SLES 10)
- eDirectory 8.7-8.8
- Novell NSS filesystem

Client:
-------
- Windows XP Professional
- Novell client 4.91 SP4
- Firefox 1.5-2-3

We change the Netware operating system to Linux, and from that time we have different problems.

The Firefox user profiles are in the user's home directory (on Linux server). Firefox cannot create profile when it runs for the first time. After the manual 

profile creation the users cannot save any changes in preferences, and we have problems with the download manager too. These two things used to work on 

Netware server. 

Every other program is working fine (IE 6-7,Total commander, Office, etc..) 




File saving problem:
--------------------

Directory tree:

root volume
     |
     |-dir1
         |
         |-dir2
         |   |
         |   |-dir4
         |
         |-dir3     
 
- If we give write rights to the top level directory (dir1) , Firefox can save files, save preferences, create profile into any directory. 
- If we give write rights to any dir below the top level folder, Firefox cannot save or create anything to the directories where we gave rights. (dir2,3,4)
 

Firefox 1.5:
------------

- File saving with the "Save files to" option (Tools/Options/Main) is not working, and with the "Always ask me where to save files" option it is working.  


Firefox 2:
----------

File saving doesn't working in either way

Firefox 3:
----------

File saving doesn't working in either way


Profiles,Preferences:
---------------------
- Saving Preferences, and profiles doesn't work in any version of Firefox.

- The only way to save files to these network drives is when we choose "save as" option where it is available. Firefox 1.5-2-3 can save files with this 

method.  

- If we install Firefox with local profile, file saving doesn't work too. 




When file saving is unsuccessful, the Java debug console show this error with Firefox 1.5-2:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80520012 (NS_ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND) [nsIFile.isDirectory]"  nsresult: "0x80520012

Source file: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox/components/nsHelperAppDlg.js
Sor: 285


Firefox 3:
----------
Error: uncaught exception: unknown (can't convert to string)


We have problem only with Firefox, everything else works good.
