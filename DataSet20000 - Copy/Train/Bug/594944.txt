Can I uninstall ff update to an earlier version. First of all I didn't really authorized the update --the popup box appeared at same time I was clicking for something else AND I put off the install, but on a re-boot it started installing automatically. Since then I have NOT been able to use FF because it's ALWAYS FREEZING my computer shortly after the L-O-O-O-O-O-N-G upstart time (15-30min) --then freezes. I have had to start using another browser if I want on the internet. Please help!! FF USED 2 B MY FAVORITE AND the ONLY 1 I used.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open ff
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
ff hangs/freezes. Other programs work fine --as well as other browsers, having to use another browser now, at this very moment

Expected Results:  
same as ff has always worked for me in the past --like a browser should. allow me to use internet. Actually, I expect ff 2 b FASTER than other browsers (what got me hooked) --now it's useless, just freezes. from beginning to re-start to another browser

no themes used (just default theme). From time to time addons disappear from ff and have to RE-install them
