Firefox attaches keyboard focus to wrong window
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070801 BonEcho/2.0.0.6

Example one:
Several FF windows are open on _several_ workspaces.
I move the mouse inside a previously inactive FF window. I press Ctrl+T. It seems that nothing happens, but in reality, in another FF window on another workspace, a new tab was opened.

Example two:
Same setup, I want to type in a new URL or fill in a web form. Clicking on it doesn't give me a cursor in it. If I start typing, in another FF window "search by type" gets activated and feed by the keyboard input. Clicking inside the other window, clicking inside the "wrong" window, heavily cycling through the windows doesn't solve the problem. Keyboard input is processed by one FF window regardless which one is really focused.

To get rid of this nasty behaviour, you have to do some magic things I didn't find out already. This problem was also present in earlier versions. To much regret, the newer the version, the more often it happened. It happens every day now.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open several FF windows
2. Do some window cycle via mouse or other ways
3. Use shortcuts or try to input into the url textfield, web forms,...
Actual Results:  
Keyboard input is processed in another FF window, which is not active.

Expected Results:  
Spend me some free beer.

WHILE I WROTE THIS BUG REPORT FIRST, FIREFOX CRASHED ON CLOSING A TAB! I HATE THIS BROWSER!

I use fluxbox as window manager. Fluxbox shows the right window is focused with the window decoration. WM independent tools like fbpager also mark the right window as focused. The fluxbox guys told me it is impossible within the WM that a window not on the current workspace gains focus.
