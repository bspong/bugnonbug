firefox crashes when I try to work in it,  since installing firefox 3 for mac

I downloaded firefox 3 early this week, when it came out. Every time I try to work on it now, it crashes. Prior to this weeks announcement,  I was using firefox 3 beta (for mac) with no problem. I try to send it report on the window given after the crash, and each time I get the message that my description of problem did not get through to mozilla/firefox. So I think you may not be hearing about this problem, and for all I know it is common. I have tried downloading firefox again several times, with no resolution of the problem. Please advise me about what to do. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I am working on web page in firefox (often on vitalist, but others as well)
2. I carry out some action (today I was adding/reorganizing some tasks on www.vitalist.com
3. firefox crashes, I get a window to send message to you about the problem, I fill it out, press "send" and get message back that my report did not go through. By this time firefox has shut down. 
Actual Results:  
see above. first crash on firefox, then crash on trying to send you report of problem

Expected Results:  
firefox will not crash

Please let me know what this problem is about. Also let me know how to reinstall the older version of fire fox because now I simply can't use it.
