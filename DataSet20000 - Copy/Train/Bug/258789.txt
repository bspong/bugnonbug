When you move a bookmark in "Manage Bookmarks" to a position that is out of the
reach of the window by dragging and dropping, the window begins to automatically
scroll so that you can place the bookmark where you want without having to drop
the bookmark, scroll up/down, rinse and repeat.  However, if you "let go" of the
bookmark you are moving while the dialog is scrolling, the scroll will continue
in that direction, and the only way I found to stop it was to close the dialog
box and open it back up again.  It only occurs if you let go when the cursor is
in a position to autoscroll up or down.  If you let go when the cursor is past
the threshold for autoscrolling in either direction, the bug does not occur.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Manage Bookmarks dialog box.
2. Make sure you have enough bookmarks that you can scroll 2 or 3 full "screens"
down so that the bug is easier to reproduce (though this has no effect on the
actual bug).
3. Drag a bookmark to the bottom or top of the screen, carefully placing the
cursor so it becomes a circle with a slash through it and the screen begins to
scroll.
4. When that happens, release the mouse button.  The screen will be stuck
scrolling in the direction it was scrolling when you let go.
Actual Results:  
The bug was reproduced as stated above.

Expected Results:  
I think it should not place the bookmark where you let go, but instead return
the bookmark to its original position and allow to you try and grab it again.
