After re-login on windows, main window is repainted wrongly.

I have a WinXp SP2 system with multi users. If I start Firefox, and then e.g.
someone else in the family switches users to use their account, when I switch
back, my Firefox window is not being painted correctly. It's like the top level
container is not painting it's children in the right place. See the attached
screenshot:

You can see there is a blank area above the toolbar. Also, the right hand edge
of the window overlaps the scroll bar and the Close Tab button. If I expand the
window right, the tabs will be stretched to fit, but if I try to make the window
more narrow, the right hand edge overlaps the tabs until none are visible.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start firefox. Open up a bunch of tabs
2. Switch user in WinXp. 
3. After some time, log back in as original user
4. Select Firefox window. You'll see the container is not painted correctly.

Actual Results:  
See screenshot to follow

Expected Results:  
Painted the UI correctly.
