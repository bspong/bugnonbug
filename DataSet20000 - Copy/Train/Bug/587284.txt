FF 3.6.8:  Backing Up Bookmarks JSON File Gives Unresponsive Script Warning
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 Firefox/3.6.8 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

This is a new error I receive in FF 3.6.8.  This did not occur in FF 3.5.2.  While in "Organize Bookmarks", {CTRL-SHIFT-B}, when I save a backup of my bookmarks, I receive this error:
"Warning:  Unresponsive Script
A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding.  You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete.

Script:  file:///D:/Mozilla%20Firefox/modules/utils.js:887"

I did a screen save of the error window and uploaded it.  You may see it here:

When I click "continue", the bookmarks JSON file is saved correctly.  This error MAY also occur when I try to "Export HTML..."  This error does NOT occur every time I use these functions.  Perhaps they only occur the first few times I use them or they are now affected by Norton Anti-Virus 2006.  However, FF 3.5.2 was also installed along with NAV2006 with no problems. NAV Auto-Protect 2006 is NOT enabled.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  "Organize Bookmarks", {CTRL-SHIFT-B}
2.  In "Library" window:  "Import and Backup" > "Backup" on Menu
3.  In "Bookmarks backup filename" window:  Save as "bookmarks-2010-08-13-test.json" {ENTER} or click "Save"

Actual Results:  
I received this error window on the first 2 saves:
http://dlm.50megs.com/FF-3_6_8-Bookmarks-save-script-error.gif

but have not been able to reproduce it since during this FF 3.6.8 session.  I believe I would be able to reproduce this error if I restarted FF or restarted Windows XP SP3.


Expected Results:  
To save JSON or HTML bookmarks file with no warning.

I have most of my bookmarks located in my Bookmarks Toolbar.  I have 6 folders and many bookmarks located there.

I do not use any themes.  FF 3.6.8 and my profile are not located in your default locations.  They are both located on my D: partition:
D:\Mozilla Firefox
D:\Mozilla Firefox Profile

I did make one recent change to my Profile.  I added this folder:
D:\Mozilla Firefox Profile\[my_name_here]\chrome

and copied this file into it:
userChrome.css

This file only has 2 active lines in it:
@namespace url("http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"); /* set default namespace to XUL */

.tabs-newtab-button {display: none;}

Perhaps this is the problem.  I will test later by moving the folder and restarting FF.  I don't know if I can update this error report but will attempt to do so if possible later.

---------------
BTW, you should really rename your "Organize Bookmarks", {CTRL-SHIFT-B}, window to "Organize Bookmarks" and not "Library."
