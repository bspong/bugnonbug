Private Browsing jumplist entry buggy when using permanent PB mode
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:2.0b12pre) Gecko/20110206 Firefox/4.0b12pre
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:2.0b12pre) Gecko/20110206 Firefox/4.0b12pre

I enabled permanent PB mode from the UI.
When Firefox is closed, the "Enter private browsing" entry is always shown. When I start Firefox, it still takes some time until it updates the jumplist, then the entry is gone, but just until I close Firefox.

When Firefox is closed and I select that entry, Firefox will not open.
When Firefox is already open and I select that entry, nothing changes, and I see this exception:

Error: [Exception... "'Abort' when calling method: [nsICommandLineHandler::handle]"  nsresult: "0x80004004 (NS_ERROR_ABORT)"  location: "<unknown>"  data: no]

I guess the exception comes from the patch for bug 601253

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. enable permanent PB mode from the UI
2. close Firefox
3. click "Enter private browsing" entry in jumplist
---
4. start Firefox
5. click "Enter private browsing" entry in jumplist
Actual Results:  
nothing changes

Error: [Exception... "'Abort' when calling method: [nsICommandLineHandler::handle]"  nsresult: "0x80004004 (NS_ERROR_ABORT)"  location: "<unknown>"  data: no]

Expected Results:  
The entry should not be shown in either case / Firefox should just start in PB mode and update the jumplist immediately
