Unable to manually remove cookies, either individually or en masse. Within the 'Cookies' window, neither the <Remove All Cookies> button nor the  <Remove Cookie> button function as expected. (i) Multiple clicks of the buttons in question are needed to produce apparent cookie removal, but (ii) the cookies aren't actually removed: when the 'Cookies' window is opened subsequently, the cookies list is found to have been re-populated.
