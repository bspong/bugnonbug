If two different windows are loaded and system crashes or restarts then session does not restore

If user is using different tabs and sites in 2 different browser windows, ONLY then this issue comes. Otherwise session Restore option is provided always if all the browsing is done in a single window with an "n" number of tabs

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open 2 Firefox windows
2. Open different sites in both of them and tabs in both of them
3. Now the system should be restarted not properly but as it happens if electricity fluctuates or it restarts automatically, so to do this simply power off and power on from the Electricity Switch board button instantly, to create that scenario so that system restarts within the milisecond delay between voltage
Actual Results:  
When the system restarts after scan disk when user logs in and runs FireFox it does not ask for the Session Restore option but in fact simply loads the homepage set.


Expected Results:  
It should always ask for Session Restore and session history should always be maintained irrespective of number of windows opened of browser. And also irrespective of different electricity fluctuation scenario's or abnormal restarts. It should always be the same in every case

My observation is that it happens as most of the temp files are cleaned and removed by the Scandisk that runs during OS initialization
