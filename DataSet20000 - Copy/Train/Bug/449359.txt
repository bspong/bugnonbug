This is very minor, but for thoroughness, I'll file it.
I also provided the (short) code to fix it below.

Points:
1. For the toolbar, this also occurs for any other kind of click that should produce a new tab, depending on how one's prefs are set up: Ctrl-left-click, Shift-left-click, Ctrl-shift-left-click.
2. For the library, only middle-clicks apply since Ctrl/Shift left-clicks are used for selection.
3. This includes folders that contain only other folders.
4. There is already code in the sidebar to prevent this from happening, so the toolbar and library should be consistent.

In fact, here is the self-tested code (in extension form).  I just did what the bookmarks sidebar does and put in a "hasChildURIs()" check before "openContainerNodeInTabs()" is called for each case.  Alternatively, you could put the check in "openContainerNodeInTabs()" itself (utils.js) which would take care of all the cases at once, though I haven't tried this.

1. For the Bookmarks Toolbar, change browser.js:

eval("BookmarksEventHandler.onClick ="+BookmarksEventHandler.onClick.toString().replace(
   /var target = aEvent.originalTarget;/,
   <><![CDATA[
    var target = aEvent.originalTarget;

    //RC Do not open blank new tab if container has nothing to open
    if (PlacesUtils.nodeIsContainer(target.node) && !PlacesUtils.hasChildURIs(target.node))
      return;
   ]]></>
));


2. For the Library, change places.js:

eval("PlacesOrganizer.onTreeClick ="+PlacesOrganizer.onTreeClick.toString().replace(
   /else if \(PlacesUtils.nodeIsContainer\(selectedNode\)\) {/,
   <><![CDATA[
      else if (PlacesUtils.nodeIsContainer(selectedNode)) {

        //RC Do not open blank new tab if container has nothing to open
        if (!PlacesUtils.hasChildURIs(selectedNode))
          return;
   ]]></>
));
