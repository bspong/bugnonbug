I log on to a secure site. I conduct my business. I click on "logout" that the
site page has, a popup box opens, I click on a choice, nothing happens. The box
will not redirect me to the chosen page. It does nothing. I contacted site
manager: since the site works properly with IE 6, then it must be a probelm with
Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log on to the site. A new page appears allowing me to conduct business on the
secure site.
2.I click on the "Logout" and a pop up box appears. I have three choices.
3.I click on the circle "Yes, log me out and send me to the the City web site
page. Nothing happens...I cannot log off this secure site.

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
I should have been redirected to the page choice that I clicked: The City Web
Site http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/.
