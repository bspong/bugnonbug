custom url handler does not work
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/35.0.1916.153 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

I am attempting to register a custom url handler to launch an app.
OS : On ubuntu 12.04 LTS
Firefox Version : 28.0

1) add ccs-tools.desktop file to /usr/share/applications to register my custom ccstools handler

[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Version=1.0
Type=Application
Terminal=false
Path=/home/auser/ccs_tools
Exec=./node ./src/local.js %u
Name=CCS Tools
Comment=CCS Tools
Categories=Application
MimeType=x-scheme-handler/ccstools
NoDisplay=true
3) run sudo update-desktop-database to update the cache
4) enter 'ccstools://' into firefox address bar


Actual results:

I got a "Launch Application" without any applications being listed


Expected results:

I should have get a dialog asking me if it was okay to run the program specified in the 'Exec' parameter of my ccs-tools.desktop file. 

Additional Info:

1) It appears that the registration process did have some effect. Prior to adding the .desktop file, firefox would just navigate to "address wasn't understood" error page.
2) The same process works as expected with 'Chrome'
