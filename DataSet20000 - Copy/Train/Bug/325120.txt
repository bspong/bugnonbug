the bookmark option DOESN'T WORK AT ALL after fiddling with MANAGE BOOKMARKS option :)

what i did was rearranging my bookmarks, using the Manage bookmarks... option.
I created folders, moved folders from one to another, move links to folders.
Then I closed the Manage bookmarks... window, went and opened www.brokensaints.org and then tried to save this as a bookmark, either in a folder or just by simply CTRL+D. It froze on me. If i hit CANCEL it did nothing, if i hit OK, same, if i hit the little X that closes the small window of the bookmarking process, same.
If i hit the X of the page that closes the page it works, closes the whole thing.
THat's very annoying...it means i cannot save any of my future bookmarks and I have a lot..so it means i have to switch back to IExplorer?!?!?!
I think this is a major fix that should be done like A.S.A.P.
I just fiddled with Managing bookmarks, a normal thing with tons of links and folders and now a basic function stopped workng. Please fix it a.s.a.p. it's a major drawback to Firefox...i wish you success
