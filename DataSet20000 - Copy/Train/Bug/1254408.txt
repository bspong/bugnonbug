Expose animation performance information in DevTools
Bug 1196114 adds a new chrome-only API that provides the following information:

1. *Which* animation properties are being run on the compositor (until now there has just been a single flag say if one or more of the properties is running on the compositor)

2. For animations that normally *could* be run on the compositor but aren't, the reason why.

An example of 2 is if the is an element where we're animating the 'left' property at the same time as the 'transform' property, we'll deliberately *not* run the transform animation on the compositor because it will look odd because the different things affecting the element's position won't be synchronized.

(Some background I forgot to add: currently *only* 'transform' and 'opacity' can be animated on the compositor. In future, we'll add 'scale', 'translate', 'rotate' etc.)

Another example of 2, is if we animate 'transform' but the element has an SVG transform attribute or a backface-visibility property then we don't do the animation on the compositor due to limitations in Gecko.

In any case, the idea is that by exposing that information to developers, they can analyze and optimize their content. e.g. Perhaps when we hit one of those type-2 scenarios, the lightning bolt could be outlined and have a tooltip explaining why the property wasn't run on the compositor?

CC'ing Helen since she might have some ideas about how this could look.
