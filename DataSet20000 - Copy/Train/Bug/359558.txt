Strange BOINC and Firefox interaction; Firefox becomes CPU hog

I posted this problem on the BOINC board and they said to post here. Please don't shoot the messenger!

I've got BOINC Manager 5.4.11 running on three Windows XP systems. I only have this problem on my laptop. After booting, I'll open the BOINC manager. It will correctly display the status of running tasks. Then, after a short time (less than a minute?) the tasks will vanish and the window opens saying "BOINC Manager - Connection Error" "The password you have provided is incorrect, please try again."

(Note that I don't have to have the manager open for this problem to occur.)

I close that window and from the BOINC Manager I select Advanced | Select Computer and click OK and the client again displays the tasks. I don't now why it's doing this.

But it's the final issue that bugs me. Sometimes after this sequence of events occurs, I'll notice my laptop slows to a crawl, as though something is eating up the CPU. I'll check. It's Firefox! I'll close all my browser windows but there's still a Firefox process and it's still eating up the CPU cycles. If I end the Firefox process using the Windows Task Manager, everything returns to normal.

Any idea what's going on here?

I'm running the latest version of Firefox (2.0) but this happened in previous versions too. I have the latest Windows XP fixes from Microsoft. I'm running BOINC Manager 5.4.11. I have McAfee software too.
