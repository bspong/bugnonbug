User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091201 Firefox/3.5.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091201 Firefox/3.5.6

Pre-requisites: In preferences the download manager windows is selected to appear as soon as a download starts.

When trying to download the DL manager window appears and FireFox hangs for several seconds. It is unusable while it hangs. Happens with FF 3.5.6 in Win 7 64 Ultimate while this works flawlessly in XP Pro 32.

De-selecting the opening of the download manager window in prefs solves this problem and the FF does not hang at the start of the download. No matter if list is empty or if files are already in the download list.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to download file while the download manager window is set to be automatically opened when downloading in preferences.
Actual Results:  
The system freezes for several seconds / FireFox hangs and is not usable.

Does not happen in XP 32 with 3.5.6 and FireFox does NOT hang if you de-select the download manager windows in preferences.

The list is empty so it is not an error connect to a huge number of files in the download manager list. But it could be connected or similar to this bug: 508875.
