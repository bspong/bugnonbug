Expected results:

Which action for condition is enable?
(a) Focused conditional breakpoint
(b) Right-clicked line number

In case of (a), focused conditional-breakpoint-panel should be opened. And also don't add new breakpoint.
In case of (b), "Edit Conditional Breakpoint" should not be displayed in context menu. ("Add Conditional Breakpoint" is correct)
