What makes Firefox on of the worst web browsers is that this issue has been around for along long long time and nothing has been done to fix it...

If you start watching video on YouTube for example close your tab or window while this video is still streaming...you will notice that Firefox is still consuming bandwidth and keeps streaming video or videos even thought tab or window is closed... if you start watching multiply streaming videos and close any of the tabs or window you will run even in the bigger problem... watching videos will become impossible because Firefox will be still streaming first videos until they are fully loaded... Firefox will not stop video streaming until its fully loaded! Imagine the situation if you have to pay for every megabyte you have downloaded like I do because Im on mobile broadband then this becomes a big problem because you can end up with a ridiculous internet bill because of this streaming video problem that has been around for a long time... Is there any plans of fixing this bug ?
