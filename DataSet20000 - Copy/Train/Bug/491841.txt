Problem displaying Flickr pages on some Windows XP systems

On some Windows systems (XP and Vista, 32- and 64-bit) it has been observed that the following web page:
http://www.jurjevic.org.uk/photography/flickr/fliter/1.htm

does not display properly (not a single thumbnail is displayed) when viewing with Firefox 3.0.8, 3.0.9, 3.0.10 or 3.1 Beta 3 (listed only version which were tested). The systems which suffer from this problem also show problems displaying other Flickr pages, say this one (most of the images are not displayed):
http://www.flickr.com/photos/13816725@N04/

It is likely a bug in Firefox, as say IE 8 does not show the problem. I failed to find out what is the cause (disabling all of my add-ons did not help). Firefox 2.0.0.20 does not show the problem. There are Windows XP systems where this problem does not show (failed to figure out in what way these systems are different from the one where I am having the problem).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. try to load or refresh the http://www.jurjevic.org.uk/photography/flickr/fliter/1.htm in Firefox 3.0.8, 3.0.9, 3.0.10 or 3.1 Beta 3 and if no thumbnail appears you have reproduced the problem

Actual Results:  
no or most images are not displayed on the web pages

Expected Results:  
all of the images are expected top be displayed on the web pages

I marked Severity to be "Major: A major feature is broken" as http://www.flickr.com/ is rather popular and important service on the Internet, and some people (including me) may consider stop using Firefox because of that (switching to some other web browser, say IE 8 does not show the problem)
