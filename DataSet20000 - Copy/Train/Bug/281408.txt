Location bar autocomplete doesn't prefix www when using left/right cursors

When using the location bar autocomplete, the behaviour of the URL suggestion is
not consistent. Normally, if you type foo.com and the search history includes
www.foo.com, Firefox will transparently transform the typed URL to this
including any path information after the main domain, if the user clicks or
presses enter when highlighting the URL. But using the left/right cursor keys
when the URL is highlighted will prevent this replacement from happening.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clear the location bar history
2. Visit www.google.com/firefox
3. Delete the contents of the location bar and type "google.com". Firefox will
pop up one autocomplete suggestion.
4. Press the down cursor key to highlight the previous visit to
www.google.com/firefox
5. Press the left or right cursor

Actual Results:  
The URL in the location bar now reads google.com/firefox

Expected Results:  
The software should amend the URL to www.google.com/firefox, as it would if the
user pressed the enter key instead of the right cursor.

-- OR --

Autocomplete should not add the extra path information, instead simply leaving
what the user has typed so far.

At the moment, Firefox is suggesting a URL which has never necessarily been
visited before. This is not a desirable behaviour, although admittedly it's a
fairly trivial issue!
