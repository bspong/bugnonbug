=============================================================

Firefox uses 50-100% cpu while idle, even when the only loaded page is about:memory. When closing, the window closes, but firefox.exe remains active and with the same cpu usage. After a couple minutes, firefox crashes and the crash report window pops up. This is reproducible, and antivirus scans do not show any malware. This occurs in FF46.0.1, as well as 45.0.1 from before I updated to try to fix the problem. I have also fully updated flash, java, and silverlight.

These are two nearly identical crash reports of this problem

And yes, I know I have add-ons. I also know you people like to ignore problems and use add-ons as a scapegoat. You say "turn off your add-ons" and assume the problem is fixed. If you have no intention of helping, then don't bother responding, because I don't need your automated  "I'm too lazy to decipher the crash log" response of blindly blaming add-ons. Just move on and let someone who will actually try to help respond to this.

And I will tell you right now, disabling add-ons is not an option. You have made every effort to make firefox as ugly and hard to use as possible; hiding menu buttons, mutilating the UI, etc. As well as websites making extremely intrusive as well as dangerous ads and popups. I. Will. Not. Use firefox without classic theme restorer and adblock plus. Because without them, your browser is garbage, and I will stop using firefox despite adamantly hating chrome. Either I use firefox with those add-ons, or I do not use firefox.
