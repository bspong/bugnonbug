Performance regression / application not responding frequently in 20120614 nightly builds on Windows (slow network access, UI rendering, no UI interactivity)
Recent Firefox Nightly builds feature unusably slow performance. It seems to be blocked on network access or on drawing the user interface elements. All interaction with the UI is impossible in this state, and the application is frequently reported by Windows to be "Not Responding" - see the video, below (I'll also try to attach it)

A regression hunt on my local system pinpointed this performance regression to the June 14th build; in the video above I'm using the June 13th build to show Firefox in good working order, then the 14th to show bustage. Same thing happens with a new or existing profile. Here's the regression range:

I initially suspected Azure, as the problem isn't happening on all Windows machines and I know that I have an older graphics driver. However, switching gfx.canvas.azure.enabled to false has no effect.

(cc'ing Rob and Ehsan as there are some Windows updater changes in that range as well, but I can't see how they'd be related ...)
