Absolute paths in build output
Reproduction:
1. Build Thunderbird (trunk)
2. Start it
3. Move the while thing (source and build directory) to a new
   directory, e.g. when you move a part of your files to a new partition.
4. Try the same with Firefox trunk

Actual results:
Cannot find Shredder runtime directory. Exiting.

ls -la (excerpt):
regxpcom -> ../../xpcom/tools/registry/regxpcom
run-mozilla.sh -> /media/foo/tb/source/mozilla/build/unix/run-mozilla.sh
shlibsign -> /media/foo/tb/trunk/opt/mozilla/nss/shlibsign
xpidl -> ../../xpcom/typelib/xpidl/xpidl

So, most of the links are relative (which is correct), but a few are with absolute paths, which breaks the build dir when it's moved.

Firefox works
ls -la for Firefox (excerpt):
regxpcom -> ../../xpcom/tools/registry/regxpcom
run-mozilla.sh -> ../../build/unix/../../../source/build/unix/run-mozilla.sh
shlibsign -> /usr/src/mozilla/firefox/trunk/opt/nss/shlibsign
xpt_dump -> ../../xpcom/typelib/xpt/tools/xpt_dump

So, in the Firefox build, the same files are relative.

Note that this is TB trunk, so it should be mozilla-central, not 1.9.1, so it seems it's not a discrepancy in Mozilla source code version.

Expected results:
- Application starts after move.
- No absolute paths *anywhere* in the build tree.
