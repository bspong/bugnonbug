bookmarks do not work

When I add a bookmark, it seems to work right if I click on it right away. Later when I go to reopen that bookmark (possibly after a few days, and Firefox being closed and re-opened, but not always), the bookmark is of some random page that I may or may not have been to.  Sometimes it's an unrecognizable URL that doesn't load a page.

This makes the bookmark feature totally unreliable. Saving a webpage to my bookmarks so that I can visit it later is now impossible. This is a basic desire in using a web browser, and though I like Firefox and have used it for years, this is enough to make me want to look around for alternative browsers that actually save bookmarks correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. use Firefox on my laptop, store a bookmark.
2. wait a day or so, re-open that bookmark.

Actual Results:  
i noticed the page that loaded was not the page that i originally bookmarked.

Expected Results:  
i noticed the page that loaded was not the page that i originally bookmarked.

it is a satisfying feeling to not have saved what you thought was important and saved.
