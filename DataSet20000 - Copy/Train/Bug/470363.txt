A script attaches and infect website index files, and a few other using FF as the medium

Win XP SP2 FF 3.05


Some kind of script piggybacked on FF and either directly or with the aid of my FTP software infected my sites, ALL OF TEM. I have attached the 2 files for your reffrences, the HTML file is easy to see and the PHP file has the same or similar code at the end. Other files were altered as well, but similar code

The only reason I was able to catch it is because it SCREWED up the CSS on one of my sites and the alignment was off. I restored the PC, , and everything is fine now.

I am amazed that this happened, maybe you can look into it on what and how it could be done.

Also, I checked the registry and noticed many instances with words such as;
shell access
cmd

I am not a programmer but it might mean something, the main problem was CSS. The sites had no problem if I did not use the “www” in front only when the :www” was used that I noticed the problem.
I only use FF so it had to come in as a download when I viewed a site, I did not install anything new.


Thanks,
Mitch
