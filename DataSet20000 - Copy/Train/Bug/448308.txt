Printer interface controls not functioning in Firefox

When printing from Firefox to Canon printer the interface controls in the print dialogue box can not be adjusted from what appears to be a default setting. For example the draft setting in print quality will not move from the center point setting. This is only in Firefox (all other apps work fine). It began for no apparent reason. See also Bug 446041 - it seems similar to my issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. select 'print'
1a. select pre-set profile for 'draft quality output'
2. under Firefox settings scroll/select 'quality and media'
3. under print mode select button for detailed setting
4. print quality adjustment slider in Firefox appears at 'normal quality' setting and not at the 'draft quality setting'
5. the print quality slider will not move from the setting for 'normal quality'
Actual Results:  
Printer will only print at normal quality using up too much ink.

Expected Results:  
Before this bug printer would print a draft setting

Software is able to adjust print quality settings in every application, except Firefox.

Printer is Canon iP4300 Pixma. Drivers have been re-installed. No change to bug problem.

Firefox was also re-installed with no change to this bug.
