After upgrading from 1.04 to 1.06 all web pages time out

I have been running Firefox from the start and most recently was happy with
version 1.0.4. Updates kept insisting that I install version 1.0.6 so I finally
did. After upgrading, any and all pages I try and access give me a time out
message and load nothing.

I am running a 2.66 Intel Pentium 4 system with 512 MB of RAM and 240 gig or so
of hard drive space on 2 seperate drives: an 80 and 180 gig (both Western Digital).

I am running Windows XP Pro with latest Service Pack (2) and the latest patches
and updates applied.

FYI, I tried upgrading from 1.04 to 1.0.6 on my wife's Dell P4 2.8 gig system
running Windows XP Home Edition and got similar results - there the browser just
kept crashing and wouldn't start at all.

I uninstalled version 1.0.6, loaded version 1.0.4 and here I am at a web page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Upgrade to Firefox 1.0.6
2. Start the browser
3. Time Out

Actual Results:  
Timed out going to the following home page:

http://start.mozilla.org/firefox?client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official

Also timed out going straight to Google, to microsoft.com, etc.

Expected Results:  
The browser should have opened the web page(s) I tried to access.
