Full-screen mode is malformed, if Opera has been recently open
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

The bug occurs if Opera has been recently open, before opening Firefox 1.0.
Firefox opens normally, doesn't matter which page, but when you enter into full
screen mode and exit, by pressing F11 a few times, the results of the bug should
be obvious. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Opera browser, then close the browser or leave it open
2. Open Firefox browser, enter full-screen mode (by pressing F11)
3. After pressing F11 a few times, the problem should be obvious

Actual Results:  
In the full screen mode, the browser doesn't update maybe 10% of the screen
(bottom edge). Furthermore, the title bar disappears permanently, even in the
normal (not full-screen mode). Also some updating abnormalities occur in main bar.

Expected Results:  
After returning from full-screen mode, the window title bar should be visible
again. When browsing in the full screen mode, Firefox should update all parts of
the screen. This should be obvious.
