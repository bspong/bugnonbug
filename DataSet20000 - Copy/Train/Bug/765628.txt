User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux i686; rv:13.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/13.0
Build ID: 20120601173958

Steps to reproduce:

Clicking a javascript: url from the new tab page will run the script with full privileges. These javascript: urls are frequently used as 'bookmarklets' to run small javascript snippets. Were a malicious party able to socially engineer a user to bookmark a javscript bookmarklet and add it to the new FF13 "new tab page", when the user clicked the link from the new tab page privileged javascript would run.

The following is an example of privileged javascript which runs gcalctool on ubuntu: 

'javascript:var file = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/file/local;1"].createInstance(Components.interfaces.nsILocalFile);file.initWithPath("/usr/bin/gcalctool");var process = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/process/util;1"].createInstance(Components.interfaces.nsIProcess);process.init(file);var args = [];process.run(false, args, args.length);'

adding that url as a bookmark and launching it from the new tab page will run the native gcalctool executable. (For windows, change the path to a windows executable.)

I've attached a html page which demonstrates the steps a user would have to take.

I've marked the bug as security sensitive as bookmarklets are widely used.

Only tested on 32-bit firefox 13 running on ubuntu.
