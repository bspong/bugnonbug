Browser becomes unresponsive after lots of uploads
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.9.0.12) Gecko/2009070611 Firefox/3.0.12 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.9.0.12) Gecko/2009070611 Firefox/3.0.12 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

As part of my job, I have to upload short video clips (75-100MB each) to about 10-14 websites, about 3-4 times a time.

The websites have various types of upload forms, from the basic html form to html with javascript progress bars to flash upload forms.

So I just have the 10-14 websites opened, each in its own tab, click on "Uploa new video" or whatever, fill the form, select video, click on the Upload button, and then leave the browser untouched until the next time I have to upload a clip.

After about 7-12 days, all of the sudden when I try to click on any tab on any link in the pages, the browser becomes unresponsive: 

The first time a link is clicked the text "Waiting for ..." appears in the status bar and the small rotating circle on the left of the tab starts spinning but nothing happens. 
After this, no matter what I do nothing happens, just that rotating circle animation on the left of the tab starts spinning.
The browser is otherwise not frozen, I can browse menus, access history, whatever, but no pages are loaded even if I use new tab and type manually an address.
If I close Firefox, it closes almost instantly, but it remains active in background and it does not close until I end the process with Task Manager. However, if I do this, next time Firefox starts there's no session restore popup, tabs are not reopened, I don't see the pages saved in history so I have to re-open the pages manually. 



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a basic form that accepts file uploads, upload form on a webserver and make it accessible through several subdomains or domains to simulate the 10-14 websites 
2. open each for in a tab
2. upload large files to each form lots of times (probably at least 4x 7-14 as I usually upload 4 clips a day and Firefox stops responding between 1 and 2 weeks)
3. click on some link on the form to reset the form / upload another file and see Firefox stop responding 
Actual Results:  
Firefox stops responding, is no longer usable, must be closed using Task Manager, session restore is lost, history is lost, tabs are not re-opened 

Expected Results:  
Firefox should work normally and should not freeze.

I realize it's a weird report and maybe hard to test, but it already happened to me two times during the course of the previous month so in my opinion it's definitely an issue. 

I'm reporting it as minor because it's kind of hard to trigger - I don't think there's many people keeping the browser open with the same tabs for 1-2 weeks...
