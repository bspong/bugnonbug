On some websites, with some configuration, the text acts really weird. The letters start moving when you select text. Images which show this will be attached after the bug is filed.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
- Set fonts as I describe in "additional information"
- Go to http://xinehq.de/index.php/releases
- Randomly select text
Actual Results:  
Letters start moving around as they are selected.

Expected Results:  
Letters should stay fixed.

My configuration is:

System font: DejaVu[sans|serif|mono].

Font in Firefox set to nothing specific, by setting it only to "sans", "serif" or "mono". Thefore, it used DejaVu. I don't allow websites to set a font; the minimum font size is 11; proportional and monospace font size is set to 12.

Changing the font can help, but it doesn't always. It can also change the behavior a bit, but I guess this is because of a random convergence of circumstances.

xpdyinfo says resolution 92x92 DPI, 1400x1050 pixels (370x278 millimeters).

The problem has existed for a long time, perhaps even as far back as Firefox 1.0. Thunderbird suffers from it too (when reading RSS feeds of www.tweakers.net), but I don't know if this is because of a shared codebase, or that the bug was copied into Thunderbird.
