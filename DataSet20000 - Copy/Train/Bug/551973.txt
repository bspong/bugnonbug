browser does not take focus when it first opens up. Browser chokes sometimes for no reason at all, I only had like 8 tabs open when it happened.

Hi, I have been using firefox for a long time now, and for like 6 months now, firefox has started being a little buggy. On Microsoft Windows 7 it works properly, very smooth and fast, but when it comes to mac osx, I work on the two platforms everyday and its just such a buggy browser now. When I open up the browser, it does not take focus, it just opens in the back and I never know when is open, unless I do expose or just switch applications back and forth. That is the one main problem that started like 6 months ago and you guys haven't fix it yet. I figured it might have been my operating system, since I upgrade from leopard to snow leopard without doing a clean install, but it isn't because I did a clean install of snow leopard afterwards and it still had the issue. Another thing is when there is a flash element on a website, sometimes it just chokes, either for just like a second or 10 seconds max, and sometimes the actual flash element doesn't detect clicking from the mouse. I hope this is the right email address who I should be sending bug reports.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on the firefox icon on the mac osx dock
2. Don't do anything, just wait for it to open.
3. Once it opens up, the browser does not take focus, the browser opens in the back
Actual Results:  
The browser opens up, but does not take focus

Expected Results:  
The browser opens up, but does not take focus

If you have more applications open when you open up the browser you could notice the problem quicker.
