After Firefox restore, one tab per window is missing.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1
Build Identifier: Firefox 5.0

When I upgraded from FF4 to FF5 and restarted FF, I found the 1st window was OK but all subsequent windows had the LH tab missing. Also, the "open a new tab" tab was on the extreme LHS of the bar instead of the RHS. 

I was able to open the missing tab by using "list all tabs" drop-down menu and clicking on the top item, which was the missing tab. Although the page displayed the tab belonging to it was still missing.

If I opened a new tab by clicking on a hyperlink on the page belonging to the hidden tab, the new tab opened to the left of the "open a new tab" tab. Moving tabs around on one side or the other of that latter tab was possible but it was not possible to move from L to R or R to L of the tab.

All this occurred on openSUSE 11.4 (x64). I then installed 12.1 (x32) on the same machine and FF5 seemed to work on that so I wondered whether it was a 64-bit thing. At first, FF5 seemed OK after a 11.4 (x32) installation but this all proved illusory as FF5 exhibited the same problem on both 32-bit systems after closing and reopening FF - either after a requested or automatic restore of all windows and tabs. I have FF configured to remember the last status on closedown rather than the home-page.

In FF5, I've tried reconfiguring one of the affected windows so that all the tabs are visible and in the correct order - deleting them and reopening them - but when I close FF down, perhaps by logging out and logging on again, the corrected window is in the same mess as before.

When I de-install FF5 and return to FF4, all the tabs are visible and back in the right place.

Reproducible: Always
