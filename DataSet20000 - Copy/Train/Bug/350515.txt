I cannot drag and drop photos from a website using the "gallery" photo album app into a Thunderbird composition window.

The website requires me to log in to gain access to the photos.

It looks like the URL is being handed to Thunderbird, not the image, and Thunderbird does not have the necessary session security information to get to the image.  Firefox should pass the image data to Thunderbird, not the URL.

Or perhaps dump the image to disk and pass a file:// url to Thunderbird.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to web site that requires login to view content.
2.  Drag and drop image to Thunderbird (1.5.0.5) composer.
3.  Image will not be visible in email being composed.


Actual Results:  
I see a box with the image name but no picture content in the box.

Expected Results:  
I should see the image in the email I am composing.

This is pretty basic functionality that I have been trying to get working for a long time -- my wife is unable to mail out her digital pictures under linux.
