Build Identifier: 3.5.9, 3.5.10, 3.6.3, 3.6.4

Lock preferences command via the mozilla.cfg file no longer works since 3.5.9. I tested in depth on firefox 3.6.2. I modified settings and created mozilla.cfg file placing it in Program Files\Mozilla. All.js file was modified to include pref("general.config.filename", "mozilla.cfg");. I have tried both with plain text and byteshift 13 setting the obscure_value appropriately. When Firefox is started you receive the error message Failed to read the configuration file. As I stated I tested this in 3.5.9, 3.5.10, 3.6.3 and 3.6.4. It did not work in any of these versions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.modify all.js appropriately
2.create mozilla.cfg
in the file:
//lockprefs
lockpref("xpinstall.enabled", false);
lockpref("browser.search.update", false);
3.run firefox.exe
Actual Results:  
Error dialog box comes up: Failed to read the configuration file. Please contact your system administrator

Expected Results:  
Expected the browser to open and be able to go to about:config and see the settings I locked

I have tried this in numerous versions both plaintext and byteshift 13 neither works. I have tried other solutions found where as a .js file is placed in default prefs, or greprefs. Nothing currently works.
