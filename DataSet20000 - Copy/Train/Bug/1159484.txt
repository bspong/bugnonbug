for osx crashes

More interesting: These are almost all on 37.0.1 and 37.0.2 but seemed to only show up this weekend and be getting worse so it may not be tied to the Firefox update.

Open questions for Trusteer: 

- Was there an update for Trusteer that was pushed out this weekend or Monday morning? If so, do we know the number of users who have it already and the number who do not but expect to get it soon?

- Is there a known issue with Trusteer and Firefox 37.0.2 that needs to be resolved? What is the fastest way to push out that change.
