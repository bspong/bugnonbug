This happens since i installed Firefox 3.6 RC1. 
I hadn't this issue in all the Firefox 3.6 betas.

Bookmarks dropdown menu appears correctly when typing something in the location bar. It doesn't appear when clicking on the arrow in the location bar

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type something in the location bar -> dropdown menu appears with history or bookmarks (depends on firefox settings - mine is no history, just bookmarks).
2. Click somewhere on the web page -> dropdown disappears
3. Click on the location bar arrow -> nothing happens.

/* Typing of text in location bar isn't necessary. Just wrote it to have an example of what i expect to see.

I tried it launching firefox in safe-mode. Issue still exists.
*/
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens when clicking the location bar arrow.

Expected Results:  
Expected result is a dropdown menu containing all my bookmarks or history. 

I noticed the bug for the first time in firefox 3.5
It was resolved in firefox 3.6 betas but now in 3.6 RC1 the issue is back.
