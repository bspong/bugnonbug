MS Dot net assistant crashing FireFox, re-installing itself.

The Microsoft Dot net assistant extension is causing Firefox to hang after a random amount of time usually a few minutes. The extension isn't present in my extensions tab and the WPF add-on is disabled by default but the files are still causing Firefox to crash.  I can fix the problem by deleting the contents of "C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\Windows Presentation Foundation\DotNetAssistantExtension" and removing its reg key, this stops the crashing.
However the files will reinstall themselves (whenever I boot the computer I believe) and the problem returns until I remove them again.
I've tried reinstalling Firefox and searched for the source of the reinstall with no success so far.
I have another computer that isn't having this problem and does have the files installed but it is running on Win7.

Reproducible: Always




The error in the log I get after a hang.
