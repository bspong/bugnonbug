With many tabs open when the browser has been minimized a number of times and you hover over the icon to preview the content of tabs, the preview does not correctly display (black, or missing completely).  Once this happens and you try and click the browser to re-open the window to its previous state, the browser refuses to open back up.  Once the browser is in this state even completely quitting the browser and then opening it again does not fix the problem, it immediately minimizes and no browser window is opened.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a FF window and many tabs.
2. Minimize the window, hover over the icon in the tray to peek at the tab contents.
3. Select a tab from the preview.
4. Open the tab and then minimize the FF window again.
5. Rinse and repeat a bunch of times, hopefully it will result in this problem, has happened to me a bunch of times.

Going to rate this major since when it occurs it renders the browser unusable.
Actual Results:  
Browser window stopped opening, preview of tabs was black or missing completely.  Only way to re-open the browser was to open FF 3.5.5 to clear all tabs and then open 3.6b2 again.  When I opened 3.5.5 the window started as small as possible, even though this wasn't the state it was left in (so small no page contents were visible, it was a tiny box).

Expected Results:  
Tabs display correctly and browser opens correctly when selected from the task bar.
