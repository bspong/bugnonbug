Nearly every extension asks the same question: where it should be installed
(global application directory or profile directory).
I believe this is an overly technical question to most people.
What's worse is that the question is answered inconsistently: "OK" means to
install to the app dir for about half of the extensions, while it means to
install to the profile dir for the other half.

Please provide a simple checkbox for "Install extensions to profile directory"
so that this question can be answered once and for all, simplifying the install
process for most users by removing what is often the only question asked (aside
from the Software Installation prompt.

I have a moderate preference that the checkbox default indicate that extensions
be installed in the app dir, so bad/outdated extensions do not persist across
Firebird re-installs/upgrades.

Reproducible: Always
