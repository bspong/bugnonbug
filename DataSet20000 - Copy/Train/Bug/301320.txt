Can not drag and drop a file from a Linux desktop onto an html page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.9) Gecko/20050711 Firefox/1.0.5

I was looking around for a way to allow the vistors of a webpage to drap and
drop files on it (to help in uploading files).  I found this site
http://straxus.javadevelopersjournal.com/creating_a_mozillafirefox_drag_and_drop_file_upload_script_p.htm
which described how to accomplish this in Firefox/Mozilla.  As it says, this
script should only run as a file or as a signed script.

When I run it as a file (I haven't signed it so you will need to run it as a
file), it will successfully get the file I drag to it when I am using Firefox on
Windows.  But when I do it on Linux (either Gnome or KDE), I get an exception
that says:
Component returned yailure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)
[nsITransferable.getTransferData) ...

My guess is that this component is implemented in Windows, but hasn't been
implemented in Linux.  Could it be that because of the different window managers
(KDE, GNOME, EvilWM, Fluxbox) it is impossible?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Dowload the site onto your computer so that it is a local file
2.  Access the site using file:// (give it the permissions it needs)
3.  Drag a file from the desktop to the page

Actual Results:  
The actual results are that it does nothing.  You can see the debugging messages
on the screen and open up the Javascript console to see the exception

Expected Results:  
It should fill out the text box with the name of the file dragged to it.

I have tried this on Windows XP (works), KDE-3.2.2-6 Red Hat (not works), Gnome
2.6 (not works).
