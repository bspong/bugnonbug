If I have one tab open to a site, create a new tab by double-clicking on the tab bar, (now I have two tabs: One with a site open, the new one blank). I then click on the new tab to transfer focus to it, type in an address in the address bar, then hit enter or click on the arrow in the address bar. Instead of opening in the tab that has focus, the new site opens in the other tab. 
This started happening on Oct. 15. I installed Google Toolbar on the 14th and have no idea if there was an update overnite

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open browser, navigate to a site in default tab.
2.Create a new tab, type address in address bar, hit enter or click on the goto arrow
3.site opens in original tab, new tab remains blank.
Happens no matter how many new tabs you open.
Actual Results:  
Same thing happens.

Expected Results:  
Opened the site in the new tab, leaving the original tab with whatever contents it had.

May be connected with Google Toolbar installation.
