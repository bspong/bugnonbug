My system reboots when I close FireFox 1.0 and the Sun Java Console is still active
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: 

I am using Sun's JVM.  It is release 1.4.2_05.  I am also using FireFox 1.0.  
No prior installation of FireFox is on my system.  No prior version of the Sun 
JVM is on my system.  My OS is Windows XP Service Pack 2.  

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Activate the FireFox browser
2. Go to a website that activates the Sun JVM
3. I close the browser
4. The system reboots immediately

Actual Results:  
The system reboots and FireFox does not remember any of the settings, 
bookmarks, etc. that it imported.  Also, Windows XP reboots as normal (no safe 
mode messages).

Expected Results:  
The browser should have closed gracefully and the Sun JVM should have closed 
gracefully.

FireFox was installed with the default settings.  No plug-ins were being used.  
I did receive the following messages only one of the times the system crashed:
