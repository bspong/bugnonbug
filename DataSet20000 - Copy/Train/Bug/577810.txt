Toolbar bookmarks or open tabs annoyingly turn into open windows accessing those sites - precipitated by mouse hovering

When moving my cursor, via the mouse, towards the tab or toolbar bookmark that I want to access, the computer often seems to decide that I must want to open site pertaining to bookmark/tab in a new window. This is annoying as hell and obviously takes time and so is quite disruptive. 
Not only does this sometimes happen when I am moving my mouse across several tabs (*not* selecting them), but also, if I wanted to open a new browser window with one of these pages, I'd right-click and do it that way. 
I don't know if this is a bug or an intended feature, but I haven't noticed it in earlier Firefox versions, and it is annoying as hell.

[So too is the toolbar's current interpretation of some mouse movements as deciding I want two adjacent toolbar bookmarks to change places. If I wanted that, I'd go to 'organise bookmarks' and do it that way, not invite my mouse to apply its own bizarre interpretations to very usual mouse movements.]

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have several tabs open
2.  Move between tabs
3.  Have them open into separate windows without your permission or instruction and get annoyed
Actual Results:  
Disruption, too many open browser windows and no real idea exactly what caused it to happen.

Expected Results:  
I don't know, as I don't know whether this is a bug or an intended feature.
