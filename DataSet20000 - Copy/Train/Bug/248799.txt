Fonts are sometimes "clipped", which means that their top is cut off and only
the lower part, to some extent, appears. Larger fonts are affected more often
small fonts. The clipping appears most often when scrolling pages by using the
scrollbar; when using the mouse scroll or keys it depends on how many lines they
are set to, too many lines (3+) won't produce clipping.

This is most easily noticed on the home page of The Register. I will attach a
screenshot. Aside from clipped headlines, also note the "Sun slams Red Hat"
headline, where only the hover is affected by the clipping.

Unfocusing the browser window or hiding it (changing window or desktop) will
magically make the fonts recover instantly. Selecting the affected fonts also
recovers them.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://theregister.co.uk/ or browse the CSS2 manual at W3C and scroll
using the scrollbar.
2. If the clipping doesn't occur, increase the zoom somewhat.
3. If the clipping still doesn't occur, try changing the fonts resolution in
Firefox (the natural one for my monitor is 83dpi, clipping kicks in badly at 92dpi).

Actual Results:  
Fonts have their upper half clipped off.

Expected Results:  
Display full lines of fonts.
