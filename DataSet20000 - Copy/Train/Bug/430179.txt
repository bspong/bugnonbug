In Tools/Options/Advanced section - GUI has *4* buttons that are not completely visible.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404 Firefox/2.0.0.14
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404 Firefox/2.0.0.14

The buttons that are not completely visible are:

* 'Choose Language' button in Languages section / General tab
* 'Clear Now' button in Cache section / Network tab
* 'Security Device' button in Certificates section / Encryption tab

All of these buttons are cut off slightly on the right side, but they do still work when you click on them. The problem is that they are not completely visible. I completely deleted Firefox and downloaded a fresh install from scratch, but the problem still persists.

Perhaps it has something to do with my older operating system (Win98SE), 
although my system specs exceed the minimum requirements.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. * 'Choose Language' button in Languages section / General tab
2. * 'Clear Now' button in Cache section / Network tab
3. * 'Security Device' button in Certificates section / Encryption tab
Actual Results:  
The problem still persists, as it is obviously in the GUI.

Expected Results:  
Completely display all of the buttons in the GUI!

Please fix this problem and notify me when I can download the patch to correct it.
