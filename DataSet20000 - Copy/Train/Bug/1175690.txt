Firefox freezes because of 100% CPU usage on single core

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0
Build ID: 20150525141253

Steps to reproduce:

There is no real recreation scenario. Firefox sometimes freezes with FF 38.0.5 + FlashPlayer 18.0.0.160. Occurs also with a few earlier versions of Firefox and FlashPlayer.

Probably high use of the Flash Player causes this issue :-(


Actual results:

Sometimes when opening a WebPage in a new Tab Firefox completely freezes. Examining the system indicates that a single CPU core is fully occupied by Firefox (50% CPU-Load on a DualCore-system).

Attached screenshot shows the high CPU usage of Firefox, where the external process "Adobe Flash Player" is not running (was not killed, but probably unexpectedly stopped while opening and closing pages).

The screenshot indicates that a single CPU core of the DualCore laptop computer is used. Firefox does not respond. Only if a single tab-process is killed from the Windows 8.1 Task-Manager the CPU consumption is reduced and Firefox starts being responding again.

Conclusion: not the whole browser-process(es) need to be killed, but only the ones that are causing the high CPU consumption.


Expected results:

Normal smooth responsiveness instead of freezing all tabs.
