As a meteorologist I need to open a large number of charts at the same time and use the Ctrl+ [page up or page down] to navigate quickly. When I open this list:

FF shows the pages getting loaded but the graphic keeps showing Google (my home page). If I move the mouse over the page some of the expected images bleed through and the text box widget for Google jumps to the top left. When I try to ctrl+page up I can see the tabs change focus to the next tab but the image in the browser continues to be a scramble Google and Weather chart. 

I should also note that this list is a folder within a folder list of bookmarks within the toolbar bookmarks. 

This defect shows up with other large "open all in tabs" selections as well. Smaller multiple tab openings seem ok (sorry, I don't have the "go/no-go" number yet). 



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load the list of URLs into a Bookmarks Toolbar (folder within a folder)
2.Right click on the toolbar bookmark and select "Open all in tabs"
3.
Actual Results:  
Graphics unresponsive and scrambled when moused over. Tab navagation not changing the graphics but IS changing the tab focus on the tab bar 

Expected Results:  
Page should load. I should see the other pages when navigating through the other tabs
