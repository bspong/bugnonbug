The picture above is, with activated colormanagement in FF, shown wrong (Lab picked with Apples Digital Color Meter is: 51|64|58, and shoult be something around 54|81|70). 
Open it again in Photoshop, paint something, save it again with Profile, shows something like that:

Now the unpainted outer areas are shown in correct sRGB red.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open http://www.richard-ebv.de/images/HDS/nur-rot_sRGB.jpg 
2. create Tab and open http://www.richard-ebv.de/images/HDS/sRGB_bemalt.jpg
3. download the two pictures and compare in an colormanaged Application.

Effect is even better to see, as the Monitor Gamma ist greater than sRGB, here is a Screenshot, showing the Difference in PS, Safari and FF: http://www.richard-ebv.de/images/HDS/reines_Rot_im_Vergleich.jpg
Actual Results:  
Allways the same ;-)

Expected Results:  
The Color of 'nur-rot_sRGB.jpg' should be the same as the REd in the outer areas of sRGB_bemalt.jpg

Showing correct sRGB like CIELab 54|81|70

I made tests with different Kompressions, baseline and progressive, opend the Picure from local and from the URLs above... all the same result.
