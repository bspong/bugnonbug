Firefox spontaneously uninstalls itself after working perfectly for 3 days or so. Version 1.0.7 on Mac OS 10.0.3  I wake up the machine, the Fox icon has a question mark over it, will not launch. 24 hours later the icon is gone.
I've thrown it away and downloaded a fresh one three times- exact same problem every time. Big drag.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download Firefox, surf on it, be happy.
2.Wait three days or so.
3.Wake up machine to find question mark over icon in Dock and no Firefox. Spotlight finds empty shells of folders, but the app is just GONE.

Actual Results:  
No Firefox at all- big drag as I really like it

Expected Results:  
It will disapear after a few days unless I get a fix. My brother's Mac still runs OS 10.4.0 and he saya there's no problems so far.

It should be on my hard drive waiting for me to surf it. How can it just uninstall itself? This machine is a whole week old today.
  My brother's machine has 10.2 and has no trouble.
  No themes or gizmos; I hadn't gotten that far. I'm a Mozilla newbie.
