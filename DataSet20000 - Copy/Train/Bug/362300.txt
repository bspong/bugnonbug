irregular context menu behaviour

When I select text on a webpage and then right-click on a link on the same page a context-menu is shown that is relevant to the link in question. The options on said context-menu, however, does not work. Clicking them produces no result at all (except the menu disappering). They are not grayed out and there is no reason for them not to work, they just dont. The context menu will not represent the context of the selected text, but rather the previous thing.






Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any random page with text and links
2. Right-click on any link
3. Select some text
4. Right-click on the text

Actual Results:  
A context menu not relevant to the selected text is shown and it does not work.

Expected Results:  
A context menu relevant to the selected text should have been shown.

I am using the default theme. I am using Adblock and Fasterfox extensions, disabling them does not seem to have any effect on this ug though. I am using firefox in Swedish under Swedish win XP.
