When I enter backslash (\) in a file picker, Firefox should assume I mean slash (/)

When I click a download button in a webpage, FF ask to input the file name. If I type in:
  \home\user\path\myfile.ext
Firefox will happily save the file with name "\home\user\path\myfile.ext". However, the user clearly meant to save it as myfile.ext in path /home/user/path. I know '\' is valid char in file, but considering the Windows's usage of backslash as path separator, we can reasonably assume here \ means / indeed. 

FF can quitely convert \ to /, or give users warnings and an chance to make the change manually.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click a link/button that does a download
2. (With Always ask when download file enabled) type in 
   \home\user\path\myfile.ext in the File Name: 
3. Click OK

Actual Results:  
FF Save the file as "\home\user\path\myfile.ext"

Expected Results:  
It should save it as myfile.ext in /home/user/path instead or give a warning to user for manual change.
