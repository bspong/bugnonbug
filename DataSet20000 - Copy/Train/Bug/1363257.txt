Firefox 54 Beta 5 x64 Slow To Load
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:54.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/54.0
Build ID: 20170504103226

Steps to reproduce:

Merely open Firefox 54.ob5 to open to my google.com home page, and use the browser as normal.


Actual results:

When I first installed Firefox Setup Stub 52.0.2 64 bit and weeded out and replaced extensions with new ones that work with it; it loaded and ran very fast.  I continued to allow updates up until the latest version of 54.0b5.  The Beta 4 (54.ob4) ran great, fast and loaded very fast.  Why, oh why didn't I stay with this one and have to hit that check for updates button?  54.ob5 is much slower just to load my home page which is google.com and my addons.  Why the drastic change between ob4 and ob5?  And why, oh why don't you have dedicated installation files (if they are around, where are they?), that I can reload 54.ob4 and wait awhile?  Even the Stub 52.0.2 just downloads the very latest beta version.  Where is a dedicated 54.0b4 download file?  That would help a lot for now. I even uninstalled Firefox and started over, with the same results. Nothing has changed on my computer nor internet, this happened immediately from ob4 to ob5.  I have a very fast computer and very fast internet. I'll be thrilled for a dedicated 54.ob4 64 bit download file for now.  Where can I find it?  Thanks!


Expected results:

Quicker load up time and response.
