[proto] area around tab borders lacks transparency

screenshot showing problem

In Proto, tab borders get drawn by images like tab-left.png, and these images contain both the tab borders themselves and a little bit of the area around the borders.  But the area around the borders in the images is non-transparent, even though it is the same color as the underlying tab container that surrounds the tabs.

This is not just unnecessary, it makes it hard for extensions (and themes, when Proto becomes the default theme) like Personas to simply change the background of the tab container, since the area around the borders retains the default background color.

See the attached screenshot for an example of the problem.  In it, the Personas extension has changed the background of the tab container, but the area around the tabs retains its default background.

That area should be transparent so that extension and themes can easily modify the tab container background.

(Related but probably different issue: the border at the bottom of the tab container gets drawn by the images as well, so extensions that modify the tab container background remove the border in areas of the container that don't have tabs but don't remove it from areas that do have tabs.  That border should be drawn by CSS so that it can be modified independently.)
