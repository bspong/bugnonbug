I'm calling Google API to load RSS into my website, When i try to load many  RSS feeds by looping one by one, Even after receiving response from AJAX call callback function is not getting invoked. It is perfectly working fine in IE, Chrome and Safari. 
I traced it using firebug, In firebug i can see the response from the AJAX call. but success function is getting called after several seconds / minutes. 

I temporarily fixed it by setting Timeout of .5 seconds between each and every call, but it is not a fool proof solution. 


Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
Callback function should be called immediately after receiving the response from the AJAX call

  
          $(this).find('lc').each(function() {
                i = i + 1;
                time = time + timeDelay;
                //Making AJAX call in loop 
$.jGFeed($(this).text(),
function(feeds){
  if(!feeds){
    return false;
  }
  for(var i=0; i<feeds.entries.length; i++){
    var entry = feeds.entries[i];
    entry.title;
  }
}, 20);
                
            });
