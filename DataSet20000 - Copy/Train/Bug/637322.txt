Session variables are lost when using back buttons while using FireFox on Mac. Other Mac browsers and window browsers including FF are OK. To see this happen join the website using URL above. Intentionally leave one of the required fields blank. On such an error, the website stores the previously input data in session variables (PHP) so the user does not have to renter them, however in FF this is not done. The code previously worked fine. I have checked and rechecked and it seems to be an issue with the browser. The session name is unchanged so it is not creating a new session each time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try joining Socially using the above URL.
2. Intentionally leave a required field blank.
3. On submit the site tells you to go back and enter the missing field(s).
4. On going back, the page should show any data previously entered.
Actual Results:  
The session variables should populate the form fields with any data previously entered but doesn't.

Expected Results:  
The form fields should be populated with the previously input data.

The code was working fine and still does on other Mac browsers and on Windows version of Firefox as well. For some reason FF is dropping the session values although the session variables are still set.
