Yahoo Mail 'apostrophe' key launches 'Quick Find'. Alternate spelling gives no choices.

In the Yahoo mail text box, when I hit the "apostrophe" key it launches the "Quick Find" bar at the bottom of the screen and doesn't type the "apostrophe".  This just started when I installed the latest Firefox 3 update. 
I'm using Windows XP

The other bug is that the spell checker doesn't give me spelling options when I right click on a word it has hi-lighted as wrong.  But it does work in a text box like this. 

I haven't noticed these problems in any other programs or websites and they both work in this field.  

Thanks,
