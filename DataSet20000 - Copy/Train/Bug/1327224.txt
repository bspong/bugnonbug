(e10s-specific) Please allow user to completely wipe out content processes from given tabs
>>>   My Info:   Win7_64, Nightly 49, 32bit, ID 20160526082509
Both described issues involve high RAM consumption. As a user, I want to reduce RAM consumption by FF:
1) I have many tabs (each of them is not important) and want to close the most heavy child processes
2) I have some important tabs and want to kill the most heavy child process w/o closing those tabs

"important tabs" - tabs that have some progress and shouldn't be closed.
"not important tabs" - tabs that don't have any valuable progress, but I want to keep them in session.
"useless tabs" - tabs that don't have any valuable progress, and can be closed.
                 Obviously, I didn't mention them, because they don't produce any issues.

Right now I'm using Nightly 2016-05-26, and everything works ok: in both cases I can select any not important tab, focus urlbar, type keyword "\" for "about:newtab", press Enter.
I guess it also works OK on latest Nightly, but once about:newtab starts loading in content process,
this bug will be more actual than ever. The only other about: page I remember that isn't too heavy 
and loads in parent process is about:checkerboard, but it displays some distracting content.

The reason summary says "completely wipe out" is because otherwize RAM consumption wont reduce as much
If you're Firefox user, you should know that if in non-e10s mode (also in single-e10s mode) you open
many heavy new tabs, then close opened tab, RAM consumption does NOT go back to the old level. It's
higher than before. The same happens if I navigate to a normal web page like http://example.org : RAM
consumption in tab stays at 20-50Mb. But if I navigate to a page in parent process, I have a non-zero
chance of killing content process completely. That's quite useful since I'm using 10 content processes
