Switching between tabs loses partially typed URL

If you enter part of a URL in the location bar, then switch to a different tab,
then switch back to the original tab, the text you typed in the location bar is
gone.

This is annoying, especially when trying to paste together a URL from two lines
of text, e.g.

    http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bu
    g.cgi?product=Firebird

I would like to paste that URL (split across lines) into the location bar
belonging to a different tab, but I can't find any way to do this.  Every time I
switch to a different tab and back again, what I had previously typed in the bar
is lost.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firebird.
2. C-t to open a new tab.  The second tab is now displayed.
3. Type 'hello'.  This text appears in the location bar.
4. Click on the header for the first tab to switch to that tab.
5. Click on the header for the second tab to switch back to the second tab.

Actual Results:  
When I switched back to the second tab, the text 'hello' I had typed was gone.

Expected Results:  
The partially typed URL should have been preserved, ready for the user to type
or paste some more.
