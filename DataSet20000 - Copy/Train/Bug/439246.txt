On one page of the ELCA (Evangelical Lutheran Church in America) website, certain buttons do not work.  When I take my cursor over them, they are supposed to drop down a menu.  Also when I click on the "Ecumenical Dialogue" button, it tries to open a page, but it has not content.  IE works fine at this site on this computer.  Firefox works fine on my home computer (with a newer version of windows).  This appears to be remarkably similar to bug #429676 (unconfirmed), and somewhat similar to 426149 and 428426 which were found invalid, and also 422126 which is unconfirmed.  I have not found this problem on other websites, however the problem may exist because the buttons may have drop down menus that I am unaware of.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I go to website http://archive.elca.org/ecumenical/whoweare.html
2.I move my cursor over the buttons (eg. Full Communion, Conciliar Ecumenism etc.  They should all light up.  Only two of them do.  They are supposed to drop down a menu.  None of them do.
3. I click on Ecumenical Dialogue, and it displays a page with no content.
Actual Results:  
1. The buttons do not light up.
2. The menus do not appear.
3. The page displayed after clicking on the one button is void of content.

Expected Results:  
1. The buttons should light up.
2. The menus should appear.
3. The page displayed should have content.

I put normal for the level of severity, but I do not know how severe the problem is.  I do not understand why the problem appears on this computer, and not at home, when IE does not have the same problem on this computer.  If the problem were only with the site, then why does IE work, and why does Firefox work on my home computer.
