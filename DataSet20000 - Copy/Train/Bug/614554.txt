inaccurate url encoding on windows machines

when having special chars in an url parameter like 'größe' in the above exmaple firefox encodes these for iso-8856-x whenether it is an utf-8 encoded site.
This will happen if pressing the enter key (reload works fine) when having focus in navigation toolbar .
This behaviour will tend to false paramater handling in the backends.

The Behaviour is not present in the linux and mac Versions.

Hint: Maybe the Url example will work in a few days - cause i wrote a serverside filter to target this problem. But you will find this on every page dealing with utf-8 coded backends and special chars in get param values.
