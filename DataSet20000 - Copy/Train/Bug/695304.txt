On the latest Nightly - Bookmarks are not imported from IE
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:10.0a1) Gecko/20111017 Firefox/10.0a1

Bookmarks are not imported anymore from IE8 on the latest Nightly through Show All Bookmarks -> Import and Backup -> Import Data from Another Browser. Import can be done on the latest release (Firefox 7.0.1) and on the latest Aurora build:

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:7.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0.1
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:9.0a2) Gecko/20111017 Firefox/9.0a2

This could be related to Bug 591884.
