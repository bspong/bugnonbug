Halfway during yesterday, a right-click on a highlighted phrase took 5-10 seconds to produce the drop-down menu, and it was a very long menu which didn't contain the web-search option (open in new tab). Usually there are only 5 items in the list. When I turned on my computer today, it was working normally and was OK most of the day. I closed all browsers and returned a while later, and the same problem had recurred. Restarting (warm or cold) had no effect. Also lost bookmarks, passwords and browsing history when I turned it on this AM.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Don't know how or why
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
A "promotional message" seems to appear when I start machine in the AM. That was never there before. I think it was also there yesterday.

Expected Results:  
Right-click mouse menu on a highlighted phrase usually appears immediately and only had 5 lines, one of which was the Search web for "   ". Cannon get it to appear no matter what I try.
