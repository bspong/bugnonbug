When i visited www.beeld.com, firefox, for some unknown reason, resized to a
rectangular shape that was had a short length, however covered the width of the
screen.  I managed, by exiting and entering Firefox, to return the browser to
full screen, however all pop-up windows are resized rectangular, and I'm unable
to resize these manually since "resize" in the right-click menu is disabled on
the pop-up windows, and nothing fits in these pop-up windows 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Actual Results:  
Entire browser resizes to width of screen, but very short in length.  Restore
button on top window bar fails to make browser fullscreen again, momentarily
restores the browser window to its previous size, then resizes again.  All
pop-up windows affected as well, however not able to resize at all.

Expected Results:  
Nothing, just opened the website
