I have added onkeydown event to a text area. Now, in my javascript function, i check if the keycode is 13 (which is for enter).  If this is true, i proceed to complete some other business logic specific to my page.

In the code as soon as the line if(keyCode == 13) is executed and execution enters the code block inside if block,  the downloads box is opened.

Iam pasting the sample page (html+js code) to demonstrate this.

Just press Enter in the text area and the downloads box will popup.

Code:

{{{
<html >
<head>
    <title>Untitled Page</title>
    <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
    
    function keydownFunc(e)
    {   
            var keyCodeVal = (document.all) ? window.event.keyCode : e.which;
            if (keyCodeVal  == 13)
            //Using any other code here for comparision WILL NOT throw the downloads box.
            {
                test();
            }
            
     }
     function test()
     {
        alert("ok");
     }
    </script>
</head>
<body >
<textarea onkeydown="keydownFunc(event);">
</textarea>
</body>
</html>

}}}


Please look into this.

Thanks in advance.
