I will not delve into this addon, I see that the problem goes beyond.
I believe that many addons such as these will arise, my suggestion to mitigate the problem at hand is to create a verification tool addons, example:
Firefox addons trust.
1 - Implement the police for developing addons, where developers will have to send upload addon for Mozilla Firefox which will ensure that the addon does not contain codes that endanger the security of Firefox users.
2 - After ensuring the Mozilla Foundation code generates an MD5 or SHA1 rash on the file of the addon, this will be the signature trust Firefox addons.
3 - When a user decides to install a Mozilla Firefox addons, Firefox addon that causes the rash that is being installed and check the online subscription base of Firefox addons trust.
4 - If the rash of this addon is on the basis of trust Firefox addons installation is released indicating that the addon is safe.
5 - If the rash of this addon is not on the basis of trust Firefox addons installation is blocked indicating that the addon is not safe. "If you are sure you want to proceed will endanger their privacy. "

obs. The signature verification is fast and lightweight, it only gives the existence of the rash that has a size of few bytes.

Reproducible: Always
