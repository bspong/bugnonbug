On multiple pages, Firefox will say that the server is not found for the website I'm requesting
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.6) Gecko/20100625 Firefox/3.6.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.6) Gecko/20100625 Firefox/3.6.6

This is driving me crazy! I keep getting server not found messages. It happens on other computers, too. Another Dell desktop running XP SP3, and an HP laptop running XP SP3. Here, let me just paste the most recent one, which said that it couldn't locate the server for MOZILLA!

Server not found
       
Firefox can't find the server at www.mozilla.com.

    *   Check the address for typing errors such as
          ww.example.com instead of
          www.example.com

    *   If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
          connection.

    *   If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure
          that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.
