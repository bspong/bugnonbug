Vertical and horizontal scroll bar not visible. In sites wider than screen there is no way to reach or read overflowing areas.

Areas of the screen are not visible nor can be reached because the scroll bars are not available. 
Find this problem with both my laptop (Compaq nc6000, XP Professional, at 1024x768) and at home on desktop (Emachine XP Home at 1024 x 76). Both machines have latest XP version (updated) and latest version of FireFox 1.5
Same problem in Gmail (https://mail.google.com/mail/) and in www.clarin.com (no way to see the scroll bars). Other pages present the same problem. 
www.cnn.com does not present any of the above problems.
The problem is consistent and not intermitent
 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit this same page (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox)
3. In general the product is great! THANKS for your hard work.

Actual Results:  
See that no scroll bars are visible. It is possible to use the arrows or the mouse wheel, but if the content (text or icons) overflows the screen, then it is impossible to read or click on them.


Expected Results:  
Scrolls visible. Be able to reach and read all the page content.

I tried the Full Screen option (F11). Which makes the scroll visible. When I got back to normal view (F11), scrolls are gone and problem persist.
