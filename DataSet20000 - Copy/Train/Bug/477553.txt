Cookie does not persist after browser restart

A website returns cookie with expiration date of one year. After complete browsers shut down and restart, following requests to the website do not contain the cookie in the HTTP headers.

This problem did not exist in firefox 2.X. I strongly suspect that the cause is FireBug, but have no way to verify that (firebug is enabled for this site but blocked for others).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

1.	Enable live HTTP headers or something else that shows HTTP headers.
2.	Go to URL http://www.sustainlane.com. Click sign up and log in.
3.	Response contains: 
Set-Cookie: ay=qfpewo...; Expires=Tue, 09-Feb-2010 05:58:49 GMT; Path=/
4.	Close ALL browser windows and start firefox again.
5.	Go to the URL http://www.sustainlane.com  again. Cookie does not exist 

Please feel free to ask questions or ask for more tests.
Actual Results:  
"Cookie:" http header does not contain the cookie

Expected Results:  
"Cookie:" http header should include the cookie

Main suspect is firebug.
