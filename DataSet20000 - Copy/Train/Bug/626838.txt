This is a consistent problem with my laptop (Intel T2050, i945 graphics, Win7 32-bit), both in 4.0b9 and in the latest nightly (which I tried hoping that this problem would be fixed). 

I open Firefox, reload my tabs (Facebook/Gmail/LinkedIn app tabs, a few other web sites), and everything works great. Then I go away for a little while, long enough for the screen to dim. (Note that the laptop is set NOT to go on standby when on AC power). When I come back and move the touchpad to unblank the screen, Firefox is locked up, and maxing out one CPU core. Memory usage starts swelling (it was around ~350 megs at the beginning), then when firefox.exe hits about 1.5 gigs, it crashes silently. No crash reporter, no Windows error dialog, etc.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Re-open my usual tabs
2. Use Firefox for a while.
3. Go away from computer for 10-20 minutes.
4. Shake cursor to unblank screen. 
5. Watch crashed Firefox.
Actual Results:  
Firefox.exe maxes out one core. Memory usage as observed in task manager starts swelling at a rate of about 20 megs/second. (Going from about 300 megs to 1.5 gigs) Then Firefox just exits, without bringing up the crash reporter or a standard Windows crash dialog.

Expected Results:  
Worked!
