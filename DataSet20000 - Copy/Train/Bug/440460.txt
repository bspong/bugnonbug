Bookmark menu revision unmature

The following properties of the revised bookmarks menu are bothering me:

Folders in the right pane do not have the "+" handle attached anymore (which is a state-of-the-art feature of a folder icon).
So to open them, you have to double-click (which implies increased 
wrist pain; double clicks should not be enforced in frequent user interaction).

The "Bookmarks Menu" in the left pane is moved one hierarchy level down with no good reason, which means there is less space in this pane which is quite narrow anyway in default and most peoples' setting. It's just a waste of space. Bad UI design.

And finally, when revamping the bookmarks window, the feature of labelled separators (via Properties) was forgotten to be maintained.
See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=381767#c2, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=404983#c9, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=404990
It is absolutely incomprehensible that an established feature which is valuable for many users is discarded and complaints are constantly ignored with the excuse that some developers happen not to be interested in it.

I hope these deficiencies will be revised before final release; especially for the last item I consider this at least major.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
For item 1: look at bookmarks window, right pane, folders.
For item 2: look at bookmarks window, left pane, left blank gap·
For item 3: import a Firefox 2 bookmarks separator with a "Properties" name attached - information is lost!
Actual Results:  
User interface is worse than it was.

Expected Results:  
User interface should improve, not get worse.
