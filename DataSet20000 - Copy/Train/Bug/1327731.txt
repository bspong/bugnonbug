Filtering in netmonitor isn't preserved until I close devtools
>>>   My Info:   Win7_64, Nightly 49, 32bit, ID 20160526082509
STR_1 (good):
0. Open console, dock devtools to the bottom side of the window.
   Set filtering to "CSS" in console, close devtools
1. Open console
2. Set filtering to "JS" instead of "CSS"
3. Open new tab
4. Open console in the tab from Step 3


STR_2 (bad):
0. Open netmonitor, dock devtools to the bottom side of the window.
   Set filtering to "CSS" in netmonitor, close devtools
1. Open netmonitor
2. Set filtering to "JS" instead of "CSS"
3. Open new tab
4. Open netmonitor in the tab from Step 3


AR:
 Console    opened in STR_1 Step 4 has filtering set to "JS"
 Netmonitor opened in STR_2 Step 4 has filtering set to "CSS"

ER:  Either X or Y
 X) Netmonitor opened in STR_2 Step 4 should have filtering set to "JS", i.e. save config immediately.
 Y) Console    opened in STR_2 Step 4 should have filtering set to "CSS", i.e. save config on close.

Note:
 All settings such as height, width, type of filtering should work the same way in devtools.
 If current plan for devtools suggests that user (me) has to {open devtools in a new tab, change configuration, then close devtools in that tab} in order to change config, then it's console bug.
 If current plan is to provide normal UX (save config immediately), then it's bug of all devtools.
