Disabled (greyed out) menu items are still accessible using mnemonics (access letters)

If a menu item is disabled (greyed out), because it is not applicable for instance, it is still can be reached using access letters. This is a bit confusing because:
1) if the same access letter is used more than once, pressing it cycles between all the commands including unavailable ones; if the commands are two (one that is available/applicable and one that is not) it would be expected that pressing the access key will execute the available command, but instead it cycles;
2) if the letter is used once only the menu hides (as if the command was carried out), and it would be better if the menu does not react to this (as if you are pressing non existing access key).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press Ctrl+B to open the bookmarks in the sidebar
2. Rigt-click a Livemark.
3. Press 'R' on the keyboard as may times as you wish.
Actual Results:  
The selection cycles between 'Reload Live Bookmark' and 'Sort By Name' regardless of the fact the 'Sort By Name' is greyed out (may be it is N/A to livemarks, I do not know).

Expected Results:  
'Reload Live Bookmark' should be executed just like 'Properties' does if you press 'I' on the keyboard.
