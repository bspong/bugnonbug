I couldn't purchase minutes from the www.tracfone.com website  I already gave a short summery via the "makes me sad" link.

Build ID: 20120614114901

Steps to reproduce:

I went to tracfone to add airtime.  I clicked the Add Airtime link, (but later did so via the pulldown menu, or the link on the page lower down.)
I cleared the bonus minutes popup.
I selected my choice of airtime cards.
I entered my Tracfone telephone number and phone serial number, (later I tried just the phone number and got the same response.)
I hit "Continue to Checkout"





Actual results:

I landed back at http:www.tracfone.com, rather than checkout.  Repeatedly.
Occasionally I got a message "An error has occurred." with a link back to the main page.


Expected results:

I should have been able to make my purchase.  I should have seen a page asking for credit card information.
I did see this when I used Internet Explorer 9.0.8112.16421 instead.

I have no Add Ons.
