opening of previously closed tabs when popups appear

Whenever I click on a link that opens a new Firefox-window (i.e. when I want to view a larger picture of a product in a webshop), Firefox will open new tabs in the main window or the popup-window. These tabs have the same content as the tabs I had opened in another window before.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any webshop you want.
2. Click on the picture of any product you want to have a larger picture of, so that Firefox will open a popup-window.
Actual Results:  
There are two possible actions:
1. The whole content of the window I closed last is opened in new tabs in the main window. The larger product-picture will still appear in the popup-window.
2. The whole content of the mainwindow at that time ist opened in new tabs in the popup-window, alongside the product-picture. At the same time, the product-picture will appear in the main-window as well.

Expected Results:  
It should have just opened the product-picture in a popup-window, nothing else.

This bug occured right after I updated from Firefox 3.5.4 to Firefox 3.5.5.
