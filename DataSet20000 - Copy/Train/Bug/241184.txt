Volume changed to zero in soundcard software on installation
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; ENGINE)

I recently installed a CMedia sowndcard, (see http://www.cmedia.com.tw/
Home>Download>CMI8738 )
which has software settings for volume,...in a program they call the "Mixer"
shortly after, I installed a trial of Firefox.
The sound disappeared, I opened the Mixer, and reset from 0 to a sensible 
value, without associating the problem with Firefox.
On completing the trial, and deciding to make it the families' primary browser 
I reinstalled it so that all users under XP could access it. 
The sound disappeared again as previously described.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Firefox
2.Run a program with sound (e.g. real audio)
3.Note the lack of sound
Actual Results:  
The sound does not appear. Opening the soundcard software Mixer shows the main 
volume has been set to 0


Expected Results:  
Leave volume level unchanged

The reason I am reporting this - I'm not a developer or techie - is that the 
cause of the sound loss is unexpected, and thus the simple solution may be hard 
to find for "normal users". Usually they wouldn't touch sound settings once 
they are established, and leaves the arcane art of soundcard installation and 
settings to a PC supporter.
