_breakOnEnter should not use setBreakpoint
Created attachment 8548775
patch

Currently setBreakpoint is called with either an original location or a generated location. Not only is this very confusing, its also conceptually wrong in some cases (i.e. breakpoint sliding on generated sources).

I'm trying to move things to where setBreakpoint always takes an original location, but one thing that is blocking me from getting there is the fact that _breakOnEnter uses setBreakpoint to set hidden breakpoints. This is wrong in my opinion.

setBreakpoint doesn't need most of the machinery of setBreakpoint. In particular, breakpoint sliding is not needed, because the very point of breakOnEnter is to set a breakpoint on a script and line that are guaranteed to exist. The attached patch removes _breakOnEnter's dependency on setBreakpoint, and simplifies it in the process.

A couple of notes of interest:
- findEntryPointsForLine and setBreakpointOnEntryPoints shouldn't live on     
  SourceActor, because they don't need any of state of instances of that class.
  Since _breakOnEnter also needs these functions, but lives on the ThreadActor,
  it makes sense to make them global.
- The second argument to BreakPointActor.prototype.setActor is actually not
  required. The thread actor for a breakpoint actor is already set in its
  constructor, and is never supposed to change after that.
