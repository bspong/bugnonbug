New pages loading crashes after I search one time on ddl2.com. Any other page I
start will remain crashed on "loading" with no movement at all.
When I say new pages won't load (or even new links in existing pages), not even
that 'loading' circle (in the top-right and to the left at the current page)
moves anymore.
It will go away if I restart Firefox. (BY THE WAY: I think one firefox.exe
instance still remains- after 10 sec after closing the browser(I had to close it
by Task Manager), after I close the browser, last case tried: it had 01% cpu
usage, 64 MB RAM.

NOTICE: I fast checked this on Firefox 1.5 beta1 latest and the error was gone.
(problem since 1.0.5 as far as I know)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.enter ddl2.com
2.search for something
Actual Results:  
In the first window(search opens another one, I mean the one I used to search),
any pages that are to be loaded just 'crash', literally they don't load they
just stay this way, but they can be closed

Expected Results:  
This shouldn't happen, period. (I'm sorry if this looks like 'BAD' but I would
just say,naturally, that the browser should continue loading pages normally)

Program still running, but if I don't restart it, it won't do anything
