firefox crashes - both on main pc and now on laptop. in fact no having to retype this bug as the original has frozen within firefox! having to use the laptop as frequent firefox crashes have corrupted user profile on main pc. does not seem to be affected by the number of tabs or length of time browser has been open. this problem seems to have developed recently (since the New Year). 

after opening at least one tab, when trying to open another - especially if it is a pop up from a previously open tab - then firefox struggles to do this quickly, eventually freezes and either crashes or fails to unfreeze therefore requiring closure via task manager.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open firefox
2. try to open multiple tabs
3. firefox freezes requiring close down


Expected Results:  
opened the tab without freezing

usually when a number of tabs have been opened and therefore information is being accessed or input - freezing is therefore occurring at critical and annoying points in use
