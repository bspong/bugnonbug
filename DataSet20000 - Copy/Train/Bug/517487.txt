FireFox 3.5 doesn't display pencil icon for Blogger one-click editing. Works fine in Safari and Windows
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3

The following problem occurs with Firefox 3.5 on Mac 10.5 and 10.6 The
problem does not occur with Safari on 10.6 or on Windows version of Firefox.

In my Blogger blogs I've enabled the one-click edit function which is
shown by a pencil icon. One click on the pencil should put me in edit
mode. However, Firefox 3.5.3 does not show the pencil. I have to click
the Sign In button which puts me into my Dashboard where I can select a
New Post. I do not have to actually sign in since I'm already signed in.
The problem is the missing pencil icon. As I mentioned FF 3.5.3  works
fine in Safari on Mac 10.6 and in Windows. Just not in the Mac 10.5 and 10.6
