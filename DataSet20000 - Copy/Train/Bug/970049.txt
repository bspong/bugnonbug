Figure out why bug 963105 didn't fix the bug 944947-caused ts_paint regression

I'm assuming that somewhere between the baseline I used and feb 2/3 when bug 963105 landed, something else regressed and/or stopped the fix from working as well as it was expected to.

I don't see a much better approach than just bisecting the range and figuring out when the fix 'stopped working' as far as ts_paint was concerned.
