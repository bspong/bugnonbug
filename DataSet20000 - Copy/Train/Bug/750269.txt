Places transactions leak windows in CPG
Looks like the recent changes to the leak threshold revealed some leaks in the places tests with compartment-per-global. The landing is on track for sometime in the next 24 hours, and I don't think this should block the landing. So my plan is to bump the threshold by 11 and land CPG, unless someone disagrees. We should definitely figure out what's going on in these tests, though.

The unique leaks (ones that didn't occur before) appear to be as follows:
