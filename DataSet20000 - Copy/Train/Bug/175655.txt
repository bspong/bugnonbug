Dragging url into bookmark subfolder and dropping it just above the separator over 'open in tabs' causes the new bookmark to display as a separator.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.2b) Gecko/20021015 Phoenix/0.3

This also occurs if you drop the url onto the name of the folder.  In both
cases, the url appears as a new separator at the bottom of the list, just above
the separator over 'Open in tabs'.  It cannot be selected.  The bookmark does
display correctly in the bookmark management window.  If the bookmark was
created by dragging it onto the bookmarks toolbar, it will display in the
bookmarks menu and in the bookmarks sidebar.  Similarly, bookmarks created by
dragging them into the bookmarks menu will display correctly in the sidebar and
in the toolbar.  Dragging more urls causes more separators to appear.  These
bookmarks display correctly after Phoenix is restarted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Drag the bookmark symbol in the address bar to a folder either within the
bookmarks menu or on the toolbar.
2.Release it either on the name of the folder, or just above the separator at
the bottom of the expanded folder.
3.Expand the folder after the bookmark has been created.  It displays as a
separator.

Actual Results:  
The new bookmark was displayed as a non-selectable separator.

Expected Results:  
Displayed it as a bookmark.
