Steps to reproduce:

Typed in the Search-Bar/Search-Interface.




Actual results:

Typing in the search-bar causes automatic opening of a dropdown-window filled with search engine icons.


Expected results:

A setting should exist to prevent a dropdown-window from automatically opening when someone types into the search-bar.

I often need to type bits and pieces of information from the webpage I'm viewing into the search-bar. The dropdown often covers up webpage information that I am trying to input into the search-bar, and it is also distracting to have this dropdown-window opening every time I start typing. The end result is that I am constantly having to keep hitting the Esc key to make the search-bar hide itself and/or readjust the position of the webpage (if possible) to aid my copying activity.

I understand the rationale of the dropdown window for novice users, but it really is useless for users who make use of keywords. Further, one of the great things about the search-bar is that it aids note taking, information transcription, and can serve as a static reference for holding onto information across pages as one browses. The redesign of the search-bar that has resulted in automatic opening of a dropdown window has destroyed some of the efficiency and usefulness of the search-bar.

I kindly ask that a setting be added that will prevent the dropdown window from automatically opening when a user types into the search-bar.
