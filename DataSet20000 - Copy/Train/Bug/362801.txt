Will not attach Word and sometimes Excel Documents - if it does, only I can see them and then when it sends, it disappears when reviewing the 'sent' box.

I am using my Rogers server for e-mails.  I have spoken with Rogers Technical Support who successfully attached Word documents from their end.  I have tried from my work computer (a PC), and it attaches fine.  Word and Excel documents will attach for me sometimes, but not always - it just waits and waits to attach and then times out.  When it does attach, I can see it before it sends, but then in checking the 'sent' box, it isn't there anymore.  I have no problems with PDF documents, so have to convert EVERYTHING to pdf before sending.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create an e-mail
2.Attach a Word or Excel
3.Check that it has been attached, then send.  Check sent box to see if it was attached.

Actual Results:  
Documents do not get send to recipient.

Expected Results:  
Should have had everything attach and sent to recipient
