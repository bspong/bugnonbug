foxyproxy no longer working in Nightly since 2016-01-07-03-02-35-mozilla-central
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64; rv:46.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/46.0
Build ID: 20160106030225

Steps to reproduce:

Upgrade to 2016-01-07-03-02-35-mozilla-central and beyond.
Clicked on the Firefox icon (near the URL bar).
Attempted to navigate to the Tools -> FoxyProxy Standard sub menu.
Attempted to open a URL that would be proxied to the correct web server.


Actual results:

Clicking the button results in no action at all.
Navigating to the Tools -L FoxyProxy Standard sub menu activates no submenu.
Connection error on attempt to open URL.


Expected results:

Clicking on the button should have opened the FoxyProxy Standard controls window.
Hovering over the sub menu should have opened up the FoxyProxy Standard submenu. Instead a very small square graphic displays in the top right corner of the menu graphic.
Opening the URL should have opened up the correct web page, with no connection errors.

I bisected the nightly builds so that the first known bad seems to be 2016-01-07-03-02-35-mozilla-central:
