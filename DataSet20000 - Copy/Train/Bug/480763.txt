Website displays WIDE (elongated website), unlike all other browsers

The CSS and website programming meets WC3 standards.
The web site is stretched horizontally to a point where the main content of the page is not visible unless you scroll completly to the right. Even when you scroll over, the images and layout is formatted abnormally. I can supply you with all source code so that you may take a look at the details and direct programming to format the website. 

This only occurs in the newest version of FireFox. My website displays properly in all other browsers such as: Opera, FireFox (2.0.0.20+/-), Internet Explorer, Google Chrome.

This poses a great threat to my website, considering alot of consumers find firefox to be the most reliable and flexible web browser. 

ONLY the shop has this type of problem. Not my other pages, just my shop.
