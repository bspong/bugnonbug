["Opening" dialog] Ambiguous "Browse" button : the "browse" button tells the user no application has been selected whereas when the user clicks on "OK", the file is opened with a default application

For some file types (for instance, .7z), the "Opening" dialog appears with a "Browse" button (see screen-shot 1). This button makes the user think "If I click on OK, it will crash as I haven't selected an application". Actually, if the user clicks on OK, the file will be opened with a default application.

I think it would be better to replace the browse button by a combo-box with the items "Default application" and "Other" inside (see screen-shot 2).

There is nothing more to code as the behavior is the same :
- Selecting "Default application" do nothing
- Selecting "Other" do the same thing as the "Browse" button do. After this action, the dialog behaves as it behaves currently.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the given URL
Actual Results:  
The "Opening" dialog appears and its written "Open with :" following by the "Browse" button.

Expected Results:  
The "Opening" dialog appears and its written "Open with :" following by a combo-box in which it is written "Default application" and "Other".

When I see the "Opening" dialog for the first time, I didn't understand. Recently, I have seen another person making the same mistake. I think lots of people don't understand what the "Opening" dialog tells them.
