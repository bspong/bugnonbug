When launching behind a firewall that uses an automatic proxy, the initial authentication dialog box is hidden

When launching Firefox in an environment that uses an automatic proxy, the authenticate dialog box is hidden and the application appears to be unresponsive since it's waiting for you to fill in the dialog box and click OK.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox when configured to use an automatic proxy and the user name and password are saved.
Actual Results:  
Application will appear to be hung since the dialog box for proxy authentication is hidden while waiting for user interaction.

Expected Results:  
Proxy authentication dialog box should appear.

I discovered this while using Expose on Mac OS X. To get around the bug I invoke Expose and I can see the dialog box in the Expose view. I then click on the dialog box; it's still hidden at that point although it is now the front-most window. I then hit the "Enter" (my fields are auto populated since I filled it out when using the RC) and the application is now responsive.
