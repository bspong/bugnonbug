I am seeing clicked links open in a new window in the latest builds (within the last week), even though I have always had my Firefox settings configured to force it to open ALL links in new tabs. These links would normally open in a new window when clicked, but I have had Firefox configured to open even those links in a new tab, using, if I remember correctly, browser.link.open_newwindow set to 3 and browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction set to 0.

What is now occurring is that the links will initially try opening in a blank new tab and THEN this blank tab will be left blank and the link will pop up in a new window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set browser.link.open_newwindow to 3 and browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction to 0
2. Go to a page where clicked URLs open a new window
3. Click one of these links
Actual Results:  
A blank tab is opened and the link then opens in a new window.

Expected Results:  
The link should have just opened in the new tab.
