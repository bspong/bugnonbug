When streaming audio from xmradio.com, the memory usage listed in the task manager creeps up at a linear rate with no apparent upper limit. I must close all firefox windows to remedy the problem. I've tested a few other random streaming audio sites and the problem only seems to happen when the audio is played inside a firefox plugin, rather than when firefox opens Windows Media Player seperately. I've tried manually adjusting browser cache settings in "about:config" (such as browser.cache.memory capacity and browser.cache.disk.capacity) but none of the setting changes made a noticable difference. I have Firefox 1.5 (not beta). I have also tested with Internet Explorer and this problem doesn't happen. Memory usage remains relatively constant. I also have Fasterfox 0.7.9 and NoScript 1.1.3.4 installed. I have not tested the newer versions of those yet or tried uninstalling them. Also, I have Windows XP Professional SP2.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Browse to http://xmro.xmradio.com/xstream/index.jsp
3. Login using an xmradio account (must be an xm subscriber for this site)
4. Click "Listen Now"
5. Select a station in the new window
Actual Results:  
Memory usage in the Task Manager creeps up slowly with no apparent upper limit.

Expected Results:  
Memory usage should remain relatively constant if no additional content is opened.
