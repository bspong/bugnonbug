my pc uses the h: drive for xp etc. the c: drive is a dos drive only. firefox uses the c: drive for its pagefile which after a while gets full and crashes my pc. getting rid of the pagefile created on the c: drive is a real pain. the pagefile should go to the h: drive where firfox is load and executed from in my case NOT the c: drive. till this is fixed i won't be using firefox as i can NOT loose any of my data.
