I just installed updates for a couple of my extensions and after installing them the addon manager said "2 new extensions have been installed".  This should say that 2 existing extensions have been updated.  It made me a little paranoid and I had to go through my extensions to make sure nothing had been installed without my permission.

It occurred to me that maybe these were extensions that had been disabled due to computability, in which case I can understand how they could be considered to have been newly installed, although really a different message should be used in that circumstance.

Unfortunately, I can't test to verify whether it does only happen with previously disabled extensions, since I have no control over when updates for my extensions are released.  I see it a lot though, and I think I'd have noticed if most of my extensions were disabled, so I think this probably happens every time an extension is updated.  Again, I can't test it again as all my extensions are up to date.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install updates for your add-ons (not sure if this only affects extensions)
