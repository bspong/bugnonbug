Firefox sometimes doesn't work when coming back online (i.e. after "Work Offline" was checked)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:15.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/15.0.1
Build ID: 20120905151427

Steps to reproduce:

There are times when I have a lot of pages already fully loaded in tabs, and when I plan to read them later I click "Work Offline" and refresh tabs (at least some of them) so that at least some of annoying Flash and GIF ads/banners disappear. This always worked in previous versions.


Actual results:

When I come back online, meaning that I un-check "Work Offline", or if some page failed to refresh properly (i.e. it was not properly cached) press "Try Again" on that in-build page titled "Problem loading page", that particular Firefox profile doesn't work anymore. To be more specific (about what I mean with "doesn't work anymore"), for every new (or already loaded from before going offline) page I try to open the "Connecting..." is shown forever in the respective tab.

Maybe I should note (because I wrote "that particular Firefox profile") that I run Firefox with 3 distinct profiles (so that each profile/instance runs in its own dedicated process); I am able to do that by adding "MOZ_NO_REMOTE" user environment variable set to 1, while another (and newer) way to do this is to add the "-no-remote" switch at the end of command-line in .lnk file's properties. But I prefer the old way.


Expected results:

Firefox should continue to work normally or in other words, the user should be able to switch between online/offline modes (I do not know if refreshing those loaded pages have anything to do with this bug/problem), and to be precise as possible, in my case I should be able to normally load new pages when coming back online (instead of Firefox somehow losing ability to connect).
