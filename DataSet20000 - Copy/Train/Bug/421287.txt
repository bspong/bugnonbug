Firefox crashes and closes when opening a very specific starcraft 2 webpage
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Media Center PC 5.0; .NET CLR 3.0.04506; InfoPath.2)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; es-ES; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080201 Firefox/2.0.0.12

Although it is quite similar to bug 386503, it is not the same. The page involved this time is http://eu.starcraft2.com/community.xml, and it happened to me every time I tried to access to the webpage. The bug is country independent (the website of starcraft lets you select the country you come from). It happens even when flash animations are togled off from the site. As far as I can see, there are no extremely special features in that webpage, so I have no idea what's wrong with firefox

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Copy the given URL in the browser and try to open it. You can also try www.starcraft2.com and then select "COMMUNITY". It doesn't matter the language you choose, or whether flash animations are turned on or not
3. Firefox will crash

4. Want to do it again? Re-open firefox and tell it to restore session
5. It will crash again

Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes and closes. Next time it is executed, it offers te option to restore session (which, by the way, is one of the best firefox features). If you try to restore it, firefox will crash again in and endless loop until you start a completely new and clean session.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have loaded the page flawlessly. Any other browser do, I mean, there's something fishy in there
