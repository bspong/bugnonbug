To see this leak you must install an extension whose <maxversion> is set to 1.5
Since the trunk is 1.6a you have to do an extra few steps to get the extension installed.
Steps 4 & 5 are to force compatibility. (Alternatively, download the SessionSaver xpi and manually update the install.rdf to allow installation on 1.6a)
Nightly Tester Tools extension does not contribute to the leakage (You can uninstall it after Session Saver has been installed if you really want to)
