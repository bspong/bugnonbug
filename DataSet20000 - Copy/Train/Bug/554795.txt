When logging on www.gmx.net - usually only the first time in a sesion, gmx tricks Firefox and opens a pop-up. The pop-up is opened by various actions, randomly between click in one of the login fields, typing the first or second letter in the login fields, or moving between the login fields. It is not very predictable, and happens usually only the first time during a surfing session.

However, since I installed Firebug, whenever I browse on gmx.net, Firebug will pop-up. After login, Firebug will disappear. Interestingly, since I have Firebug, NO pop-up manages to break through - which is very nice.

Although Firebug pops-up, not error message is shown either, so it is a mystery to me how the gmx pop-ups go through.

At last login, I encountered this exception. I am posting here in case it is related to the mechanism the pop-up blocking in Firefox is circumvented. My hope is that Firefox receives more potent pop-up blocking capabilites, in order to block also pop-ups on gmx.
