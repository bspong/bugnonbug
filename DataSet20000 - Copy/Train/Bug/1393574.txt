Flexible Space cannot be removed on some profiles
I've run into a bug where I sometimes cannot remove flexible spaces while in customization view. It seems to be triggered by dragging them around and play with the restore defaults button but I am not able to reproduce in a consistent way.

Here is an example of browser.uiCustomization.state when my browser gets stuck:
> {"placements":{"widget-overflow-fixed-list":[],"PersonalToolbar":["personal-bookmarks"],"nav-bar":["back-button","forward-button","stop-reload-button","home-button","customizableui-special-spring3","urlbar-container","search-container","library-button","sidebar-button","_testpilot-containers-browser-action","geckoprofiler_mozilla_com-browser-action","screenshots_mozilla_org-browser-action","_testpilot-addon-browser-action"],"TabsToolbar":["tabbrowser-tabs","new-tab-button","alltabs-button"],"toolbar-menubar":["menubar-items"]},"seen":["_testpilot-containers-browser-action","geckoprofiler_mozilla_com-browser-action","developer-button","screenshots_mozilla_org-browser-action","_testpilot-addon-browser-action"],"dirtyAreaCache":["PersonalToolbar","nav-bar","TabsToolbar","toolbar-menubar"],"currentVersion":11,"newElementCount":2}

I see that there is a *-spring3 element, but the newElementCount is only 2. Perhaps you have an idea of what could lead to this.

I also notice that when I restore to defaults there are no add-ons buttons, but they get added during restart.

If I restore defaults and restart browser a few times, my toolbars can be customized normally again.
