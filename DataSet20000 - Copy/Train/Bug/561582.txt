Firefox leaks memory intermittently

for some time now (and a few versions actually), firefox on my computer is presenting a weird behavior, if I close the program, I to open it again I have to open on safe-mode, then after closing the safe-mode window and trying the normal mode, it works, but if I close it only open again on safe-mode and so on... I compiled it (I'm using gentoo) with debug on and notice the following messages when I try to open and is unsuccessful:

so it appears to be leaking memory, but only if I try to open the program after closing it in normal mode, not if it has been closed in safe-mode

I guess it is some add-on fault, but I can pinpoint which.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.close the program in normal mode
2.try to open in normal mode (it doesn't open)
3.open the program in safe-mode and close the program
4.try to open in normal mode, this time it works!
5.rinse and repeat.
