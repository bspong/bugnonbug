PDF attchments uploaded using Firefox download as source data.  It does not
matter what browser the attachments are downloaded with; if the PDF attachments
were uploaded with Firefox then the download will be trash.  Once downloaded, it
will not open at all.  You can use your browser to try and "view" the
attachment, but it just looks like source data.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into your email account using firefox.
2. Send yourself an email, attach a PDF to it.
3. Send.
4. Congratulations! You now have one more unusable document in your inbox. 

Actual Results:  
The downloaded PDF is completely unusable.  It will not open at all.  You can
use your browser to try and "view" the attachment, but it just looks like source
data.  It looks like what would be the code used to write the PDF.

Expected Results:  
The downloaded PDF should have openned in Adobe Acrobat, and looked exactly like
the one you originally attached.

This happens only in firefox.  I tested the latest build of mozilla and it
worked fine.
