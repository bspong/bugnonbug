Browser hangs after clicking on a specific record in Waterfall
>>>   My Info:   Win7_64, Nightly 46, 32bit, ID 20160207030402
STR:
1. Open   data:text/html,<body></body>   in a new tab
2. Open devtools -> Performance
3. Import attached profile [1]
4. Select the area just like on the screenshot [2]
  (! Make sure that exactly the same records in Waterfall are visible !)
5. Click on the last record (not on the dropmarker)
6. Click on the penultimate item (not on the dropmarker)

AR: Firefox DE 45 [not clean profile] hangs w/o any prompt.
    Nightly [clean profile] allows to stop the script (apparently something improved this part)
ER: No hang

Note:
 I recorded that profile using Firefox DE 45 on https://gaming.youtube.com/ , and managed to create
 similar profile at least 10 times. Now I somehow can't create a profile exposing this issue anymore
 
 I think the goal of this bug is to determine wether profile [1] is valid and if it is,
 then to fix the hang. If the profile is not valid, then, I guess, I'll try
 to find the circumstances under which Profiler can create an invalid profile.
