Add On "Keyword Search 1.1.6" Not working
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:40.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/40.0
Build ID: 20150826023504

Steps to reproduce:

This popular add on used to restore the now removed Keyword.URL config tweak does not work. After going through their technical support they have confirmed that it is not an issue with their code, but with Firefox 40.0.3


Actual results:

Upon typing a word into URL bar, it either takes me to some pre-determined URL similar to googles "I'm feeling lucky" feature, or it simply comes up with "The address isn't valid"

When I go into the browser console I get this error message....

TypeError: fixupInfo.consumer is null
A promise chain failed to handle a rejection. Did you forget to '.catch', or did you forget to 'return'?

Expected results:

Well, what should have happened as per the add-on is that it should have just Google Searched whatever I typed in!!!!
