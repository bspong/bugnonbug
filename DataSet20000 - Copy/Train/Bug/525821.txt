Downloading anything causes the browser to run REALLY slow and potentially crash.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.3a1pre) Gecko/20091101 Minefield/3.7a1pre

Every time I download anything Minefield almost stop working altogether. The first five words of the title there took about 30 seconds to appear. Also, when actually pulling the save/open dialog box up, it likes to stop responding altogether and force me to kill it through the task manager (I left it on all night to see if it would fix itself, it didn't.) I had to pause my downloads just to get this report out.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Try to start a download(maybe succeed)
2.Observe
3.Sigh heavily
Actual Results:  
The browser runs so slow it might as well be stopped.

Expected Results:  
Normal operation.

Nothing else on my machine is touched, I can play games in the background while firefox tries to pull stuff down, but while things are downloading, it's like poking a dead animal. I mean no disrespect, just describing the problem in a colorful way. I'm a very loyal user, and I have the utmost respect for what you guys do.
