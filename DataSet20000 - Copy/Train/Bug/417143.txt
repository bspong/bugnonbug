Duplicate entries to add same search engine

After viewing the source, it appears that adding two entries for the same search engine on a page (for 'discovering the engine') using <link rel="search" type="application/opensearchdescription+xml"> will cause duplicate entries to appear in the add search engine drop-down menu.
Firefox should detect that they are the same, and only show one entry. (Confusing otherwise.)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Make sure Mozilla Links search is not installed
2.Visit http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2008/02/a-deep-look-to-firefox-3-beta-3/
3.Click search drop-down to see search engines available
Actual Results:  
Notice two entries for same url. (Same title, and hover text shows same url)

Expected Results:  
One engine (if really the same) or some indicator that they are actually different.

The referenced site has:
<link rel="search" type="application/opensearchdescription+xml" title="Mozilla Links" href="http://www.mozillalinks.org/download/mozillalinks.xml">


<link rel="search" type="application/opensearchdescription+xml" title="Mozilla Links" href="http://www.mozillalinks.org/download/mozillalinks.xml">

As the code that produces teh duplicate entries. Note that both entries are exactly the same.
