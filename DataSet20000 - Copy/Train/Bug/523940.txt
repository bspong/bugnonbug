Browser hangs when "auto load images" disabled and user hits Ctrl+S while visiting url:
http://www.pornbb.org/tunn-r-com-2009-full-sets-collection-t2136507-30.html

A single CPU core hits 100% and the modal file save dialog cannot be interacted with, thereby preventing interaction with the browser.

Also, when frozen, the memory use fluctuated between 200MB and 270MB at very regular intervals (~10 sec). looked like a cardiogram on the memory meter.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Disable all browser extensions and restart. (ensures extension not at fault)
2. Disable "Auto load images" in the Options... dialog "Tools-> Options... -> Content tab"
3. Visit the URL listed above.
4. Press Ctrl+S as if to save the HTML page to a local file.


Actual Results:  
Browser becomes unresponsive (hangs) with a single CPU core at 100%

Expected Results:  
Browser becomes unresponsive (hangs) with a single CPU core at 100%
