Firefox 17 built with old XUL
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:17.0) Gecko/17.0 Firefox/17.0
Build ID: 20121113065533

Steps to reproduce:

I have a native extension (C++) for Firefox.
I built it today against the latest XUL SDK (17) and it worked flawlessly in FF17 ESR but it didn't work good in FF17 Release.


Actual results:

Query Interface didn't work good for various web elements like nsIDOMHTMLInputElement .

After downloading source code of both Release and ESR builds I noticed that the guids of nsIDOMHTMLInputElement.idl are different:
- ESR: e59a4df5-0904-414d-9203-9af2790698ea
- RELEASE: 83984fd0-b0b2-11e1-afa6-0800200c9a66

The difference is due to a change which fixed Bug 809865 ( https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=809865 ).

It seems that the XUL code that the release version of Firefox 17 was built with is different (and older) than the code that the ESR version was built with (and after a little bit of checking it seems to be older than what Beta6 has been built with as well).


Expected results:

My native extension should have worked in Release version as well.

The release version should be built with the new XUL code and a new build should be released as soon as possible.
