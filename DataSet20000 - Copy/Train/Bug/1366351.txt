selected portion for screenshot is not working

Build ID   : 20170518175637
User Agent : Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:54.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/54.0

Steps to reproduce :

1. Enable Firefox Screenshots from about:config by changing 
   extensions.screenshots.system-disabled value to false
2. Go to another tab and Select a small portion of the current window by mouse to 
   take screenshot
3. Now go to about:config again and change the extensions.screenshots.system-
   disabled value to true.
4. Now go to that page where you selected the portion for screen-shot
5. You will see that the portion selected is totally unresponsive.
6. Now go to about:config again and make the Boolean value false again(which 
   enables screenshot)

Actual Result   : Still the selected portion for screenshot is not working

Expected Result : Either after step 3, the selected portion should vanish as the 
                  extension is disabled or after step 6, the selected portion 
                  should start working again.But the selected portion stays there 
                  without responding
