The WEBRTC application is currently in development, and will be assigned one of  the sub-domain URL's when it is ready to go into production.
Please ask our lead developer (Mark Mongeau mmongeau@gzero.ca) any questions you have about the URL's

>> Does the application provide users with notice and control?
NMBLive is developing a webRTC application to be used as an online Classroom to allow members to facilitate workshops of up to 25 persons. We would like to have the Facilitator be able to share their screen as a webRTC stream, as a part of this experience. 
The facilitator would be informed that they are able to share their screen, and that only the logged in and participating members at the workshop will be able to see what they share.
In addition the Facilitator will be able record their stream, and they will be advised that any screen shared while recording their workshop will be recorded.

The Terms of Service currently in use are listed here:
http://www.numubu.com/terms-of-use.html

Are there specific issues you would like to see addressed in the policy?
