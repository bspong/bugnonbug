I use Topmost clock, available from http://www.softdemon.com/download.html as a clock I can use to time various things. When viewed under normal situations it will refresh when dragged from one part of the desktop to another, and may take up to 10 seconds to refresh. When viewed with Firefox in the background it "smears" when dragged. Even when not dragged, the seconds hand will often not refresh, leaving two or sometimes three hands visible. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open topmost clock
2. Drag it to another part of the screen
3. wait for it to refresh
Actual Results:  
It mat take several seconds for the clock to refresh, and become the normal clock able to be viewed.

Expected Results:  
Using Firefox 2.0.0.x, or older, it would act normally, i.e. as it does when viewed against the desktop or another program. It should do this with Firefox 4

Nothing else. Still no themes or add-ons available.
