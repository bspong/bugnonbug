I have a page containing a <div> with style set to either 'position: fixed;' or 'position: absolute;'.  When I increase the font-size on the <body> using javascript, the text increases in size but the containing <div> does not.  If I change the the <div> to 'position: relative;', then everything resizes the way I would expect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the attached html test case.

2. Click the "Increase" button which increases the font-size on the <body> element.

Actual Results:  
The section at the bottom of the html test case which is using 'position: fixed' does not resize correctly.  All of the text starts to overlap and extend outside the boundaries of the <div>.

Expected Results:  
If you look at the top section of the html test case which is not using positioning you will see the results I expect.  The text should have increased in size as well as the <div> containing the text.
