I've tried to track this down but it is very inconsistent. I'm hoping someone else will notice this behavior too.  I use the bookmarks tool bar drop down menu more than the regular Bookmarks menu. Occasionally, when I go to select it via the '>>' symbol, it closes Firefox immediately.  No prompts or warnings.  This happens about four or five times per week.  I open and close three to say about five tabs in a session repeatedly.  In the bookmark toolbar, I have about 100 links with another three folders and one of those folders has about another 100 links. I'm not sure if that matters b/c it closes when I try to open the menu with all the links beyond the six or seven that are already showing.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open/close several tabs while surfing the web
2. Use the '>>' to open the drop menu to select your links/bookmarks
3. Occasionally it will close - no prompts or warnings.



Since I'm going from bookmarks, I'm not sure if Firefox remembers where I was or not.  I think it does and I just restart the session from where it left off and continue.
