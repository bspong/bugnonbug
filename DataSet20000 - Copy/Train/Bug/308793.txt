   More and more users use  high security sites to handle bank accounts and
eCommerce. Since most of users tend to use the same sites regularly I believe
the feature described below would contribute to prevent phishing and other
problems by giving a clear visual feedback of the secure state.

It works as follows:

- first allow users to list their secure sites somewhere in Options/Preferences
or on a special bookmark folder.
- second when a user browses to one of those sites an icon would appear
indicating  the 'quality’ of the connection according to the list below list:


1 - dangerous case – something is pretending to be a site on my list (show
something RED)
2 - non listed http site  (no icon / or neutral icon)
3 - non listed https site but certificate not ok (yellow icon)
4 - non listed https site (usual golden secure icon)
5 - https site is on my list and certificate is ok (green icon or better)

The icon would be placed on the address line like the RSS icon on FireFox 1.5
Beta. If possible on the left side.
