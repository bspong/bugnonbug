My bookmarks toolbar has several bookmarks (not folders) with long names, and
using the customize toolbar sheet I have moved the bookmaks toolbar to be shown
in the space between the Help menu and the Throbber on the right. Possibly due
to the number of links, and each with lengthy titles (that are being truncated),
the throbber is being pushed off of the screen, sometimes just by a little bit
and sometimes (when I open the app fresh) - completely off of the screen! (I
shall attach a screenshot of this)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Fill your bookmarks toolbar with five or six bookmarks (not folders) each
with lengthy titles that will get truncated. 
2. Go to Customize toolbars and drag your bookmarks toolbae from it's current
position to the blank space in the menu bar so that the bookmarks bar is
situated inbetween the Help menu and the Throbber.
3. Remove any flexispaces or spaces from the menu bar area entirely.
4. Close and restart app, your throbber should be nudged right a couple of
pixels or knocked entirely off screen - consult screenshot for additional setup.

Actual Results:  
Throbber is nudged across so it is partially off screen, or on some occassions
(usually upon starting firefox for first time on reboot) entirely off the screen.

Expected Results:  
Throbber should stay in place and the bookmarks toolbar should be shrunk instead.

Please see screenshot.
