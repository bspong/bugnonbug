Plugin-container.exe keeps consuming memory and finally crashes causing Flash-player components in a web-page to get disabled with the crash error message

Firefox process plugin-container.exe is taking much ammount of memory and keeps on growing. The memory expansion is observer to 500MB and above also. After some time then, the Page gives error "Flash player plugin has crashed".



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a page with flash objects(specifically containing an swf file which we use in our product).
2.Observe plugin container process memory usages.
3.Keep page open for some time and play around on the page.
Actual Results:  
Plugin-container.exe has exceptionally huge memory usages (500MB or more).
plugin-container.exe suddenly stops, disappears from process list of task manager and page shown error "Flash player plugin has been crashed"

Expected Results:  
Plugin-container.exe should not consume that much memory and flash player plugin should not crash.

I am not debugging the SWF file. SWF file is light-weight (4kb). Have analyzed the code of the SWF file, and don't think that it has memory leaks. I have tried the plugin load timeout to set to 500 as well as -1. Still the same behavior is observed.

Problem is intermittent and  is affecting the customers from using our product as we are heavily using flash object.
