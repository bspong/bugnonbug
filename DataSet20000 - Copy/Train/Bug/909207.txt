download does not complete, reported size incorrect
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130825030201

Steps to reproduce:

navigate to file host, repository etc..
in browser, click on a file to download (rar, tar, zip)
choose to save > pick directory

preferences set to:
MetaLink Download = Save
browser.download.useJSTransfer = true (this 'new' async method sucks)
browser.download.useToolkitUI = false

system in question: openSuSE 12.3, KDE 4.10.5, dual 2.6 GHz Dell Latitude w/ 4 GB RAM, 500 GB HDD w/ over half free space.


Actual results:

the downloads are VERY SLOW and half the time do Not complete.
Many Times the downloads report complete at 198 KB (file size, but actual is xx MB)
After 1 to 4 hours, eg, a 120MB file may be reported complete in 'library' with size displayed as the expected 120MB, but the file in download directory is 20 to 38MB and unusable.
the Maximum download speed seems to be between 10 and 38 Kbs when internet connections is 30 Mbps


Expected results:

Original Download Manager should open (i know my prefs are set to not open, but I think that WE should go back to the separate DLM as the 'library' version sucks in Every Way).
Speed should be in the 100 to 500 Kbs area.
Downloads should complete, For Real, not what FF thinks.
