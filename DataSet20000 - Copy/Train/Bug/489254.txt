[MSFT-12109] Standard User installation misreports whether Firefox is the default browser when run
Description of the Problem: When Firefox is installed as a Standard user and set as the default browser then Firefox erroneously says it's not the default browser every time it's launched.

Detailed Steps to Reproduce the Problem:  
1.	Install Windows 7
2.	Add a standard user account
3.	Log in as the standard user.
4.	Install Firefox as the Standard user (don't elevate the installer).  You'll have to choose a location other than C:\Program Files\ to install to.
5.	Open Firefox.
6.	Click "Yes" on the dialog that asks you if you want to make it your default browser.
7.	Close Firefox.
8.	Open Windows Explorer.  Enter www.cnn.com in the address bar and hit Enter.
9.	Actual Result - Firefox will open, but it will present the message again that "Firefox is not currently set as your default browser ..."

Tester/Developer Notes: 

Firefox was installed by a Standard User and set as the default browser.  Entering "www.cnn.com" in Windows Explorer opens www.cnn.com in Firefox (indicating it was successfully set as the default browser), but a dialog appears that says, "Firefox is not currently set as your default browser ..."
"Control Panel\Programs\Default Programs\Set Default Programs  --> Internet Explorer --> Choose defaults for this program" shows Firefox as the default for .htm, .html, ftp, http, and https, but it shows Internet Explorer as the default for .mht, .mhtml, and .url.

One theory from the testers: the problem could be that the application is un-elevated, the keys needed to be default aren't written.  The registration requires elevation. Firefox should always ask for elevation on install in order to ensure these keys are written.
