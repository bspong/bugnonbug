Actual Results:  
FF/Camino: doesn't recognize this font: \#PilGi;, it shows Korean text in default English font.

Expected Results:  
It should be shown correctly. Firefox should recognize this font, which is appeared in Mac FontBook.



1. If I check Firefox preferences for Korean default font, i can't find such font from list. But this font is appeared in the Mac  Font Book.(English locale)
2. If I change Mac system locale to Korea, I can see four Korean fonts in Korean language(sorry I can't read). So I guess #PilGi is English name for one of Korean font.
