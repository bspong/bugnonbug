When I left-click on an item on the main bar menu, the first item of this menu is selected and activated. These happens only the first time after Firefox is launched.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Quit Firefox.
2. Open Firefox.
3. Open some web page. On the same tab, open some others web pages from some sites to have a not empty history.
4. Click on History menu.
5. The previous web page is displayed as I click on the first item of this menu.
6. Display another web page or click on history menu.
7. Click on history menu. Now this menu is displayed.

I guess that all menus can have this behaviour.
Actual Results:  
The user get actions that he does not wish.

Expected Results:  
On the edit menu, this bug can have bad effects on the user actions and could make lost of data with the cancel item or unwanted change of page. So this is a critic bug.
