In JavaScript call of navigator.geolocation causes location is undefined error

BTW, this wasn't a bug 2 months, everything worked fine then.  Also, 2 months ago was when I last tested it.  Whatever version of Firefox was out then, it worked perfectly...  a geo location was returned and no errors.

Using FireBug, the following information was given:  

location is undefined
file:///C:/Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox/components/NetworkGeolocationProvider.js Line 91

Which equates to:
function WifiGeoPositionObject(location, address) {

    this.coords = new WifiGeoCoordsObject(location.latitude,
                                          location.longitude,
                                          location.accuracy || 12450, // .5 * circumference of earth.
                                          location.altitude || 0,
                                          location.altitude_accuracy || 0);


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. On an HTML page, have it call navigator.geolocation
Actual Results:  
Nothing, screen is blank.  I'm using jQuery 1.3.2 as well, but it's not throwing any errors.

Expected Results:  
A nice null check on the location handles things nicely so that my object can handle the error.
