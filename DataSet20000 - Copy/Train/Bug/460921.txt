fast scrolling through list of folders to file email using mouse closes window - only arrow keys available to scroll, annoying if list longer than screen view

In my hotmail account if I want to file an email into one of my folders I would normally click on the 'move to' drop down list and quick scroll to the folder required using the mouse.  Since recent version of Firefox downloaded unable to use mouse as it closes the list down automatically, so I have to use page up and down keys to scroll which is painfully slow.  I have experienced this on both PC and Mac.  Previous versions of Firefox did not have this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to inbox of hotmail account
2. Highlight email to be filed
3. Click on 'move to' drop down list (list needs to extend beyond screen view)
4. Quick scroll using mouse to folder lower down on the list
Actual Results:  
The 'move to' folder closed

Expected Results:  
It should have allowed me to scroll to the required folder
