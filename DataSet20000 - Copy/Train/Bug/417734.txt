Since I uninstalled your most recent stable/public Firefox and installed Firefox 3, Beta 3 -- when you click anything in Yahoo! Messenger 8.1.0.415 which would otherwise open your default browser and/or another tab in your already open Firefox -- this doesn't happen.  I've set Firefox 3 as the default browser in Firefox and I don't see any options in Yahoo! Messenger that I could adjust to change this behavior.  This is on Windows XP, SP 2 w/ all available updates and the most recent Yahoo! Messenger.  This happens whether I have the Adblock Plus addon or not.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Make Yahoo! ask 'Do you want to be signed in automatically when you click a link to a Yahoo! web site?  Say yes.
2.  Nothing happens..
Actual Results:  
Firefox does not open at all.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should open and go to the Yahoo! page requested and/or should open another tab if it's already open.

No themes / happens whether I have Adblock + installed or not.
