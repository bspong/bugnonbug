JavaScript timers behave erratically on Linux

I have noticed the following multiple times in Firefox 2 and Firefox 3 when developing JavaScript applications on Linux (64-bit Ubuntu 8.04):

Timers in JavaScript behave erratically on Linux. Sometimes the timer fires at a completely wrong time; much too early or much too late.

For example, I'm trying to develop a slideshow application. After displaying an image, I set a timer with setTimeout(...), to display the next slide after a certain time. Sometimes the timer fires a few times very quickly, and sometimes it takes twice as long as the timeout value that I passed to setTimeout(...).

It's also noticeable when using JavaScript libraries that provide animation support, for example MooTools or YUI: animations are sometimes not smooth; they suddenly jump.

On Windows XP and Vista with either FF2 or FF3 it works without any problems; I've only noticed this on Ubuntu.

Maybe this has to do with bug #291386 ?

It's very annoying, JavaScript timers are nearly unusable in Firefox on Linux.

Reproducible: Always
