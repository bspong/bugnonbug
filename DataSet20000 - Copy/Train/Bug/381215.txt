the message reads this

"an error has occured in your program to keep working away click ignore and save in a new file to quit this program click close you will lose information entered since your last save" 

but it won't let me click on "ignore" i have tried
and after i click "close" i get another message that says

"firefox has caused an erro in GDI.EXE.
firefox will now close

if you continue to experience problems,
try restarting your computer."

i have restarted my computer sevrel times
uninstalled and re-installed firefox sevrel times
scanned my computer for viruses and spyware and malwares
nothing has changed
i thought maybe it was my computer, but i don't get the error message when using I.E. six
