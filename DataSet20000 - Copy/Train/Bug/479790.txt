Expected Results:  
I would expect the security software to protect the browsing experience regardless of which browser I use. 

This is the first time I have experienced IE 7 providing better security / integration than Firefox.  I prefer Firefox and use it exclusively with exceptions only where required.  XP Anti Virus 2009 and it variants have caused others at my company considerable down time and I am surprised that Firefox is vulnerable.  If this is a McAfee problem then I apologize for this post.
