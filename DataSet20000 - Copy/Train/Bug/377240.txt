Installer gets "Error opening file for writing..." error .. installs under microsoft 'safe mode' , but runs incorrectly in normal.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506; InfoPath.2; Tablet PC 2.0)

I'm using Vista Enterprise and Firefox v2.0.0.3. Firefox has been working for the last 4 months, but yesterday Firefox refused to open. The process was running, but the Firefox window would not open. I uninstalled and attempted a reinstall when I got the "Error opening file for writing..." error. I'm an administrator and I also tried to run the setup using "Run As" and the default administrator account with the same results. 

I finally got Firefox to reinstall while in WINDOWS safe mode. Firefox opens fine in WINDOWS safe mode. However, when I boot into Vista normally, the Firefox window opens (also with 'Run As') with no buttons or menus and inside where webpages are supposed to be rendered is the text: 

"<window id="main-window" 
^ <menuitem id="menu_HelpPopup_reportertoolmenu" 
----^ <menuitem id="menu_HelpPopup_reportPhishingtoolmenu" 
----^ <menu id="helpMenu" 
----^" 

When I open Firefox using Firefox (safe mode), the same occurs as above, but the text reads: 

"<dialog id="safeModeDialog" 
^" 

I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times trying to get past this. I don't want to switch to IE 7. HELP!

Also, firefox.exe -P returns this:

(When I open firefox in normal vista, the text shows up in a textbox similar to the picture above)



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Vista
2. Install Firefox in safe mode
3. Error on open



Opened normally.
