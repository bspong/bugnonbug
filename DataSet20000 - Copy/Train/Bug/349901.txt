First of all : Thanks to all you developers for making the best Browser in the world !
I'm using (and promoting) it at home and work
So thank you guys (and girls ?) for all the good work !

Yesterday I had to clean up my temp directory (Windows XP) so I typed in %TEMP%
as an adress. I know that Internet Explorer sends you to your temp dir (whereever that is)
I whas surprised that Firefox send me to an Danish open source site !
(By the way : I love open source :)

Is there any solution to this ?
In Windows it might be easy, but what about Linux, Sun Solaris or other Os'es

Love you all !

Vincent :)
