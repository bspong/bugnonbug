When restarting Firefox, I get the "Well, this is embarrassing" message every time I have blank tabs.
User-Agent:       Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 6.0; U; en) Presto/2.7.62 Version/11.01
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13

I've set Firefox to remember my tabs on close. If I only have a blank tab open, I receive the "Well, this is embarrassing" message every time I start the browser. If I have more than one blank tab or a blank tab and a non-blank time, I receive this message most of the time, but occasionally not.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In Tools > Options > General tab, set Firefox to "Show my windows and tabs from last time"
2. Open up a new tab.
3. Close all tabs but the blank tab.
4. Restart Firefox.
Actual Results:  
I receive the "Well, this is embarrassing." message.

Expected Results:  
I should just see a blank tab.

This issue seems to be independent of theme, since the problem persists with themes enabled or disabled. My only extensions are Adblock Plus, Web Developer, and Firebug, fairly popular plugins. I've noticed the bug in both Windows Vista and Windows 7.

As soon as I hit Restore, I am back to a blank tab, or I could also enter a URL in the address bar, so it's a minor inconvenience. It's still a bug, though.
