User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:28.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/28.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140120004001

Steps to reproduce:

1: Quit session with > 2 windows open (multiple tabs each)
2: Start FF (restore last) (Start page no longer appears, asking to restore last, just starts last)



Actual results:

1: windows open and load front page (using 3 windows as an example)
2: first (primary) window loads, second window loads, third window loads behind 2nd
3: menus, AppMenu-button (Firefox button), bookmarks toolbar (personal-toolbar) can be activated on 1st and 3rd window, but 2nd window No menus, buttons, tabs can be clicked on and activated.
4: This can be reproduced repeatedly, for the last 5-10 nightly updates.
5: I've closed the affected window, restarted, open new '3rd' window and the problem will be reproduced.


Expected results:

All windows, 2, 3, 6, should have usable menus, App-button, bookmarks toolbar.
