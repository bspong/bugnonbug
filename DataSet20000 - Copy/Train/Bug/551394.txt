Forced Crash Test with tabs open/close, tab rendering, in forced fast and overlapping sequence...

In a fit of my own doing, believing that there is some timing conflict that makes fox crash if you do one thing, when another going on [i.e., a mouse click or scroll while something is rendering]...  That occurs on the rare chance that there is a collision...

I set out to prove that I could cause such a crash.

The experiment....

I have a local HTML page with just links.  I opened a NYTimes.Com page, and then HIT FOX WITH A HAMMER.  FORGIVE ME, DRAGON.  I middle clicked and double clicked with abandon, on the tab bar, opening and then closing tabs [only my home page, and a copy of the NYTimes page.  I kept it up for a 10 seconds, and caused a crash.

Delighted, I opened FOX in safe mode, and repeated the experiment, and succeeded, though slightly more difficult, since I didn't have TabMixPlus enabled, and had to reopen the tabs in history, and consequently had extra copies of the times coming and going.

With the success, I reopened fox, to file a bug, and ...
Fox crashed when I started to type in the address in the address field...
Revenge is sweet, even for computers.

But I persist, and file this bug.
I still thing there is something going on, with timing
 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I know, in fairness to this wonderful software, I overdid it with my test regimen, but I think that, there, in the process, there lurks an answer.
