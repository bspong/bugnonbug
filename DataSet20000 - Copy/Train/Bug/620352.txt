Firefox 4 crashes while trying to restore Firefox 3 session.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13
Build Identifier: Firefox 4 beta 7 (4.0b7)

I'm just installed Firefox 4.0b7 together with (working) Firefox 3.6 installation. Firefox 4.0b7 seems to use profile of Firefox 3.6. 

1. Install itself is ok.
2. Firefox 4.0b7 starts. 
3. Firefox 4.0b7 attempts to resume session saved by Firefox 3.6 (approxmately 350 tabs in total - quite large session, good stress test).
4. Firefox restores session for a while.
5. Firefox crashes, all times on http://habrahabr.ru/* URLs. At least 2 of them:  http://habrahabr.ru/qa/2534/#comment_12368 and  http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/sysadm/108691/
6. As an extra "bonus", crash reporter fails to submit report - at least 2 reports failed to submit. Could it be configure to use proxy? Could it give more details what exactly has failed? 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See in Details section as steps are approximate and/or specific to my configuration. I suspect that you should try to extensively browse http://habrahabr.ru and/or try to resume session with it.
Actual Results:  
1. Firefox crashes while trying to restore session. 
2. Reporter appears. It fails to submit report. 
3. If I choose to restart Firefox, it restarts and attempts to restore session again. 
4. Then it crashes. 
5. You can repeat steps 1 to 4 several times if you like crashes. 

So, problem is: I'm unable to use browser at all, since it crashes soon after startup while restoring session from previous version. Then reporter fails to submit report. Then I can restart browser and it will crash again. Where is "Well, this is embarrassing" page, at least?

Expected Results:  
First of all, browser should not crash. 
Then, even it does, reporter should be able to report the problem. Using proxy if needed, etc. Just failing to submit report without giving adequate error message is a bad thing. Since I can't even correct problem easily. 
And no matter what, if session fails to resume, shouldn't failsafe recovery apply? 

At very least, Firefox 3.6 would recover from this condition by skipping session restore. When firefox 3.6 fails to restore session due to crash or so, it will output the page:
=====
Well, this is embarrassing.

Firefox is having trouble recovering your windows and tabs. This is usually caused by a recently opened web page.
=====

For some reason, FF 4.0b7 does not does the same. Granted that it crashes when restoring my session it's quite fatal. 

Triple fault. 

Copy of 2 crash reports from reporter follows. Reporter has failed to submit these reports.
