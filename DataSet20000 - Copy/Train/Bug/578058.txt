An empty DIV block will become draggable like an image, if you attempt to drag it twice.

Also, the mouse-up event will only be fired during the first drag. In subsequent drags, the mouse-up event will not be fired, but the mouse-down event will still be fired.

The above behavior does not occur if the DIV is not empty. It also does not occur in FireFox 3.5 or below.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Creates a web page with just one empty <DIV> block, with a mouse-up event handler, like:

<html><body>
<div style="width:600px; height:600px; background-color:#c0c0c0" onmouseup="alert('mouse up');"></div>
</body></html>

2. Drag on the empty DIV block. The mouse-up event occurs.

3. Drag again. The DIV block will drag with a "Stop" icon as if it is an image. When the mouse is released, the mouse-up event will not occur.

Actual Results:  
The mouse-up event occurs in the first drag. In subsequent drags, the DIV block will drag with a "Stop" icon as if it is an image. When the mouse is released, the mouse-up event will not occur.

Expected Results:  
The DIV should not drag like an image. The mouse-up event should occur.
