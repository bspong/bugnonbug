HP Speechbot when put in an embedded IFRAME tag, can redirect browser to page (shooting the use of the embedded frame tag)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Don't know if you can help here, but this is a bit bothersome, I've 
been generating IFRAME's in my page to get people to look at sites I've found..
I tried this with the HP Speechbot site, and the site redirected my browser to 
their site.. Somwhow it recognized that I was placing them in an IFRAME, or in
some kind of frame.. Would be neat if I could somehow disable their access 
to the javascript features that my page has access to.. Like to give sites in
frames limited Javascriupt access over the parent including the IFRAME. 
 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.put HP Speechbot search in a frame in HTML
2.View site
3.

Actual Results:  
Will now be looking at HP Speechbot site and your site or webpage 
is history.. 

Expected Results:  
HP Speechbot site in a frame on my web page, viewable as a 
sub frame from my blog. 



BTW, if you like the best 100 top hits from 1976 to 1984, and have rhapsody
(which kicks Napster's butt), there are rhapsody playlists for 100 top hits of
every year..
