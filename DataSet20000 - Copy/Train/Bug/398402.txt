I am filling a duplicate bug to number 335567. I apologize for doing this but I cannot see any other way to get attention to this bug. Bug number 335567 has nobody assigned to it. Bug number 335567 is actually a re-filling of bug number 286914 filed on 2005-03-19. So we have been waiting for more than 2 years to see this bug fixed. 

We are a software vendor that makes a popular browser plug-in and this feature is very important to us. Anything that can be done to prioritize bug number 335567 would be very much appreciated.

---------------
Alternate content such as form controls should not participate in the HTTP POST
if the <object> can be rendered. In this example, if logo.gif can be rendered,
then data from <textarea> should not be send to the server:

<object data="logo.gif" type="image/gif" width="180" height="60">
        <textarea id="abc" name="abc" rows="5" cols="70">Hello
World!</textarea>
</object>

Here is a test case for the above example:
http://misc.xstandard.com/mozilla/alternate-content1.asp

This bug is causing serious problems for us. We produce a Firefox plug-in that
uses the following construct:

<object name="abc" type="application/x-xstandard">
        <param name="Value" value="some text" />
        <textarea name="abc">more text</textarea>
</object>

In the above example, data is sent to the server from both our plug-in
(correct) and the alternate content (incorrect).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an object element that can be rendered by the browser
2. Add a form element as alternate content to the object element
3. Submit the form

Actual Results:  
Data is sent from the alternate content to the server.

Expected Results:  
No data should be sent to the server from alternate content if the object can
be rendered.
