I went to preferences and attempted to associate the potential incoming file types with the appropraite 
applications I have onboard.  I went to Downloads and tried "change action" and with AVI, MOOV, WMV, 
ASF, MPE, WMA the new small window would accept the correct application, yet when I clicked OK, and 
it went back to File Types, the AVI, MOOV, etc., would have blanks to the right - if clicked "change 
action", it would show the correct app. for the file type, but hitting OK would lead me back to File Types 
and a blank next to the file type.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Preferences
2.File Types
3.Change Action
4.File Types does not record correct application associated with the file type
Actual Results:  
http://www.masters.org/ ...I land on home page and click to see live action, and I am taken to a page 
which says I need to download Windows Medial Player 9.  I had it already, but did it again and 
reinstalled it.  I restarted, booted Firefox, and same thing.

Expected Results:  
booted Windows Media Player so I could see the action
