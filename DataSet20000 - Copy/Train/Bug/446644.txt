When I save a webpage on the bookmarks toolbar, it is not there the next time I open Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1

I just got a new computer.  Upon first downloading Firefox to it, I put 8 of my favorite websites on the Bookmarks  Toolbar.  Now,  no matter how many times I try to save new websites to the  Bookmarks Toolbar, they are not there after I close and then reopen Firefox.  Only the original 8 remain each time. 

I never had this problem on my old computer, where I also used the Bookmarks Toolbar.  

What's up with this?  It is very frustrating, since I use the Toolbar all the time.

Actual Results:  
I have done steps 1, 2, 3 above over and over and I cannot get the website I save to be there the next time I open Firefox

Expected Results:  
Well, until this new computer, any time I dragged a website there, it was there the next time I launched Firefox
