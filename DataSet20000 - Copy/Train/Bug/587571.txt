Changing scroll style in a text area during key handling causes unexpected behaviour
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100723 Ubuntu/10.04 (lucid) Firefox/3.6.8

The linked page has a simple textarea with some content.
When the key 's' is pressed, the style.overflowY is toggled between hidden and scroll, which visually adds a scrollbar.

However, it also moves the cursor to the end of the text, and swallows the default action of adding an s to the text.

IE (8) and Chrome/Safari do not have this behaviour.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type in text area
2. Change the area's style.overflowY to add/remove a scrollbar during typing
Actual Results:  
* Cursor is moved to the end of the text area
* Scroll visibility is toggled
* Key is swallowed 

Not part of this bug, but note that the last part doesn't happen if a key has been processed which doesn't change the overflowY style.

Expected Results:  
* Cursor maintains position
* Scrollbar visibility is toggled (this part is working)
* Key is processed.
