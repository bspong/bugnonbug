Youtube flash video pauses periodically in Firefox 36.

Steps to reproduce:

While watching embedded flash youtube videos, the video keeps pausing, frezzing or lagging every few seconds while the audio continues normally. It happens less while in full screen mode. It is worse in an embedded video window, which makes no sense. 

I usually have a lot of tabs open. I set the browser.sessionstore.interval to -1 in the hopes that this would prevent the SessionManager add-on from doing too many session saves. This did not fix the problem. I have tried different settings for this value, none of which have fixed the issue. This has been a long-standing issue going back many versions of FF. It is not new to FF 36.


Actual results:

Expected results:

The video should play smoothly in sync with the audio with no visible pauses or freezes. Instead, it keeps freezing and then continuing.
