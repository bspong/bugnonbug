Location bar autocomplete is case-sensitive on domain names
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b5) Gecko/20051006 Firefox/1.4.1

The location bar autocomplete functionality should take into account that noninternationalized domain names are not case sensitive. For example, if I have recently visited:

http://www.booneweather.com

I should be able to type:

BOONEW

in the address bar and have it offer up http://www.booneweather.com in the drop down. The browser should be case insensitive doing the autocomplete for all characters before the / after the domain name for all http:, ftp:, etc. requests.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://anyregistereddomain.com
2. type ANYREGIS in the address bar


Actual Results:  
no autocomplete is offered

Expected Results:  
the browser should offer autocomplete to http://anyregistereddomain.com

This is low priority, but it is annoying, and should be easy to fix. Competing browsers (IE5, 6) do this right. I would expect that Firefox has some very robust code for handling URIs, so this shouldn't be hard to do.
