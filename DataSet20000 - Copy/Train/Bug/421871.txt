I am the extension developer and I got a report in the forums of some people with some Vista version seems to have some crash at startup when they used:

- OS: Vista 32 or 64 ultimate
- Firefox version 3 beta 3
- Extension HTML Validator 0.844
  (see here : http://users.skynet.be/mgueury/mozilla/download.html)

The same works on Win 2000, Win XP, Win 2003
It works too if Firefox is downgraded to 2.0.
I had the impression but need confirmation that it was working too with
Firefox version 3 beta 2.

I do not have any vista ultimate to see or test this.

The extension used a C library and XPCOM.
I guess that something is wrong with XPCOM on this platform.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use vista 32/64 ultimate
2. Install Firefox 3 beta 3
3. Install Extension HTML Validator 0.844
  (see here : http://users.skynet.be/mgueury/mozilla/download.html)
