I had some JavaScript paging functions. One of the function name is "previous()". It was suppose to be called on the onclick event of a link. When the user clicks the link in Firefox, nothing happens, no errors, no warnings...nothing. This link works perfectly in IE and Google chrome. After a couple of hours of investigation I found that i had to rename my function "previous()" to something else. I think this is a bug on the side of Mozilla because this is a local function in my JavaScript library, it should fire first or at least throw an error if there is a conflict in function name. Please fix to throw error at least.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I had to rename my function to some other name.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
After renaming the problem went away.

Expected Results:  
Please fix to throw error at least to say there is a conflict in function name.
