Java/javascript stops working only in Firefox some time after updating Java 6 version

Please see https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/forum/1/628699 (my contributions are on second page). The three URLs I have mentioned stopped working some time after I updated from Java 6 version 18 to 19; I have got functionality back using my own solution and another contributor (MH) suggests another which involves going back to Firefox 3.5.9 and then updating Firefox after updating Java. This apparently intermittent problem seems to have started with Firefox 3.6.0 although this is the first time I have experienced it. However, even when functional the three URLs in question throw up large numbers of errors on error console and I am making this contribution using Chrome because Firefox gave a "script busy" error on https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=javascript. Apologies for lack of specificity: I'm just a user.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Now that I've "fixed" it I don't want to waste any more time. I've already spent  over 6 hours on it.
2.

I am calling this a major bug because in Googling to try to find a solution it seems to be quite common and is causing a lot of frustration.
I'm running Windows Vista Ultimate SP2 64 bit. Latest updated was Windows Defender definitions on April 2nd. The problem occurred on April 4th and I used Firefox in between times. Java is Java 6 version 19 32-bit (I have no 64-bit apps which need the 64-bit version). Chrome was unaffected by the problem and from what I have read while trying to find a solution, the problem definitely seems to be Firefox-specific, started occurring with 3.6.0 and therefore cannot be specific to Java 6 version 19 either. I put on Firefox B theme recently but there is no immediate causal connection that I could see. about:buildconfig gives the following:
