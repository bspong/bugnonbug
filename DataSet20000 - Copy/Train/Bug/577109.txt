2 Problems.  FIRST.  Cannot open a separate Firefox, when one is in use (no problem, i just minimize the 1st)

SECOND - 2nd.  After the last Mozilla update, it doesnt work with GAMES, it jumps, it freezes momentarily (like when planting crops in FarmTown - clicking the plots, nothing happens, then all of a sudden, it comes back online, all that have clicked are now planted) - freeze lasts between 1 sec & 10 sec.  I had ALL my games on Firefox, cuz it worked great, NOW, it works like shit.  I have TRANSFERRED ALL my GAMES to INTERNET EXPLORER. Jumpy, when trying to click a plot (in farm games) mouse moves/plot moves.

Expected Results:  
It/Firefox should be like it USE to be, when i first downloaded firefox months ago.  Seems like every time you update, a NEW problem develops.  Your program is getting so HUGE, it is also sucking more memory.  WHAT happened to the old days when you use to be FAST, efficient.  QUIT adding crap, it only makes firefox slower and less efficient. Ease of use.  LESS Sometimes IS BETTER. 
Looks like i am going to have to look for better program, as yours is getting to be a pile of shit.
AM REALLY disappointed in you trying to Please everyone, putting everything on.  LESS IS BETTER. 

IT SHOULD WORK.
