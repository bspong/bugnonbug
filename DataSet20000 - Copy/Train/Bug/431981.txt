Using setTimeout() to move an image with img.style.top in javascript consume near the 90% of cpu.

In my website I have a menu that hides and shows with a javascript function that uses setTimeout to create an animation of the image. When my page was empty and only the menu was present, all ran ok in Safari, Camino and Firefox but while I was writing text in the page, the menu got slower and slower and I discover that if I use text-align: justify in that block of text it get really slow... consuming almost the 90% of the CPU. If the quantity of text increases and its aligned with "align: justify" it gets slower and slower. I dont know why. My script is quite simple.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox and Safari
1. Go to http://www.charlos.net on both browsers
2. Click in the link that says "menu" at the top of the page.
Actual Results:  
You will see that in Firefox the menu shows and hides very slowly but in Safari it does it at normal speed.

Expected Results:  
Normal speed in both browsers.

I have tested in Firefox 3 beta and this bug has gone. I dont really know what was it.
