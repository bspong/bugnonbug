allow a method of treebrowsing in the address bar

currently the address bar is used to enter the FQDN of the website that you visit. Example: www.cnn.com

When you click in that bar, you are able to enter your own URL/FQDN or change or add something to it.

What I would like to propose is a new feature in browsing through the address bar.
Allow me to explain.
If you have a site with a substructure like www.cnn.com/larryking/something/ allow mozilla to partition that URL so that the user is able to selectively walkback/trackback to the root.
The address www.cnn.com/larryking/something/ is partitioned into a "something" , "larryking" and "www.cnn.com". The mouse pointer would then change to the arrow or hand icon which is also used for browsing. Optional allow for keyboard keypress, like CTRL to access this feature.
Thus, CTRL-click on the partition "larryking" would bring you to www.cnn.com/larryking" one level higher.

The tree structure can also be graphical in the smart browsing
example:
www.cnn.com
  |--------/larryking
             |-------/something

It can utilize mozilla's prefetch technology to logically build a browser tree in the address bar.
I do realize that not all sites are partitioned logically, however most are and this would be a welcome new feature for the next release.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
partition the address into logical parts for full select browsing
