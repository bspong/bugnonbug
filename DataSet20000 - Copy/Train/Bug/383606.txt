Location bar exhibits broken behavior with non-OpenDNS DNS systems
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20061201 Firefox/2.0.0.4 (Ubuntu-feisty)

Mozilla Firefox relies on certain behavior which is unspecified in the DNS system in order to attempt to automatically find things like missing "www." prefixes and TLD suffixes on URLs.  It is the user’s responsibility to know what site they are visiting, not the user agent’s responsibility to attempt to find out for them.

This behavior does not work under the OpenDNS system.  I switched my home network to using OpenDNS because of its reliability, and now I have (note: a single user) complaining that they can no longer use the Firefox address bar to automatically resolve certain keywords into proper URLs when entering them.  For example, this user believes that she should be able to simply type “juploadr” when she intends to go to “juploadr.org”.  Not only is this broken behavior (what happens if there is a .com instead?  I suppose she would get annoyed but that is beside the point.)

This functionality breaks the Internet experience by providing a false idea of how things on the Internet work.  This is similar to America Online and their subscriber-only enhancements that their users *think* is the Internet or the World Wide Web but is not.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use non-OpenDNS servers and type random keywords.  Get to a site.
2. Switch to OpenDNS.  Use same said keywords.  Get a keyword search, like you should.
