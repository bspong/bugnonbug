When website requires proxy approval sign-in, the address in the address bar becomes duplicated and thus invalid.

Our company filters certain websites by requiring us to sign-in to a WebSense server.  If I attempt to access a webpage and I am not signed in to Websense, I will get a pop-up requesting my username and password.  Once I hit ok, the address bar will now contain a duplicate copy of the original web address.

For example, if I were to go to www.google.com but the proxy required me to sign in, once I signed in and pressed ok, the address bar would now read www.google.comwww.google.com

This error does not happen in Internet Explorer nor did it happen in Firefox 2.0.
