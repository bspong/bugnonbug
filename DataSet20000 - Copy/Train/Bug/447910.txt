Firefox processes takes 100% CPU (on one core) after closing all browser windows
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1

After using Firefox 3.0.1 (issue also exists in Firefox 3.0) on Windows Vista Home Premium (32-bit), and closing the browser (all frames), the firefox.exe processes will remain and use 100% of one CPU core. (Definitely affects dual-core systems, may affect solo-core)


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox 3.0.1 on Windows Vista Home Premium
2. Browse web sites (prolonged period of time with various sites seems to increase this)
3. Close Firefox
4. Attempt to open Firefox again, and see a dialog indicating that Firefox is already running
5. Open Task Manager and find firefox.exe using 100% of one core.
Actual Results:  
Firefox processes (firefox.exe) keeps running, (stuck in an infinite loop?) and requires a force quit (end process) to be able to use Firefox again.

Expected Results:  
Firefox closes and opens properly every time.
