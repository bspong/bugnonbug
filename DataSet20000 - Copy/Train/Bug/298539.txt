Memory dump of Firefox reveals sensitive information, including authentication credentials
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

Mozilla Firefox stores sensitive data, such as usernames and passwords, in clear
text in memory. By performing a memory dump of firefox.exe, it is possible to
gather the sensitive information.

This vulnerability would be most likely exploited in the following situations:

1. An environment in which multiple people share a Windows XP computer with
"Fast User Switching" enabled.

Example:
User "A" logs into Windows, and starts firefox. He then logs into a website.
Later, leaving Firefox running, he clicks on "Start", "Log Off", then "Switch User".

User "B" logs into Windows, and opens Task Manager. He locates the Process ID
(PID) associated with users "A" firefox.exe. By running PMDump(1), user "B" can
dump the memory of users "A" firefox.exe to a file. He can then open the file in
a text editor (such as WordPad), and would be able to locate the authentication
credentials that user A used to sign into the website.

2. An environment in which multiple people connect to a PC running Terminal
Services/Remote Desktop Connection, in which Mozilla Firefox is installed. The
process of gathering the sensitive data would be the same way used in the above
Example 1; by using PMDump(1).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
The steps to reproduce are described in the "Details" section of this bug report.

Actual Results:  
I was able to retrieve authentication credentials from the memory dump of Firefox.

Expected Results:  
The software should encode/encrypt/disguise sensitive data (such as usernames
and passwords used in HTTP authentication).
