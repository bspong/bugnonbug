Showing version 2.x.x passwords when upgrading from v3.0.12 to v3.5.1

Using linux, decided to test out the latest official version of firefox 3.5.1, as downloadable from the firefox homepage. First impressions was positive, but quickly found out that the passwords been used appear to be very old ones from I believe (purely from memory) the firefox 2.x.x days. Also any new passwords created in firefox 3.0.x do not appear at all under version 3.5.1. I have reverted back to my firefox 3.0.12 version, and all my passwords are back there, upto date and correct again. So it seems to me that firefox 3.5.1 latest official release is I guess obtaining passwords from some file which was used in the firefox 2.x.x days but is ignored or superceeded in firefox 3.5.1. 

This is quite critical, because it means that version 3.5.1 in my opinion isn't an upgrade option.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Upgrade from 3.0.12 to latest version 3.5.1
2.Go into properties and look at saved passwords
3.
Actual Results:  
Saved passwords out of date - from old Firefox system, or any passwords created in 3.0.x do not appear at all.

Expected Results:  
Should have shown the same passwords as in version 3.0.12
