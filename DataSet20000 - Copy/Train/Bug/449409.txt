i find that 1 or 2 bookmark folders rename themselves after i have exported the bookmarks to html. I do this frequently and happens each time and i only observe the bookmarks toolbar folders.

It is then hard to rename the changed folders as there is not a contextual menu to do so. You end up having to create a new folder copy the bookmarks into that folder and place that folder in the correct place.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. have alot of bookmark folders in the bookmarks toolbar
2. export the bookmarks to html using "organize bookmarks"
3. observe
Actual Results:  
i refuse to isolate this bug, hopefully it's just my computer since it is such a long problem to rectify.

Expected Results:  
usually 1 bookmark in the bookmarks toolbar will have been renamed

need to check bookmarks and folders of bookmarks stay unchanged after a given operation.

n.b. my screen is almost exclusively folders in the bookmarks toolbar.
