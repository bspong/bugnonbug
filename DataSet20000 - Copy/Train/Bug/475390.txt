On any search within a folder in bookmarks, the "Selected Folder" option is highlighted by default, but the search results in all bookmarks saved on the profile, associated with the search term, to be shown in the contents pane. There's no point in having the default "Selected Folder" option be highlighted if that's the case. Also, if the "Selected Folder" option is clicked on again, the content pane is emptied out.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Bookmarks Library
2. Select the Bookmarks Toolbar and create two new bookmarks named "New Bookmark".
3. Type in "new" into the search bar on the top right side of the library.
Actual Results:  
The "Selected Folder" Option is highlighted, but the search results show all bookmarks with the term "new" the contents pane. Also, clicking on the "Selected Folder" option again results in all results removed from the contents pane.

Expected Results:  
Only the two new created bookmarks should be found in the contents pane anytime the "Selected Folder" option is highlighted or clicked on again.
