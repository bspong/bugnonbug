Firefox 3.6 does not retain my home page settings
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.6) Gecko/20100625 Firefox/3.6.6

After a reboot, the browser always seems to lose my home page settings. I tried the blank page setting as well as the specified home page setting in the Tools->Options, and each time the browser loses the Home Page URL values. And it seems to replace the URL with another one from my bookmarks (a https login).

I did not have this problem in the previous version.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set your Home Page to any website you like
2. Browse away :)
3. Reboot machine
4. Start up browser and gape at a different home page than your own. Then get a little frustrated.
Actual Results:  
I see a different website (from my bookmarks) as my home page :(

Expected Results:  
My original home page value should have been retained.

I did not install any new plugins or extensions in a while; I have always used the default theme. So I know it isn't this that is causing the problem. 

Again, I did not see the problem in the previous versions. I let Firefox update to 3.6.6 and that is when I noticed the above problem.
