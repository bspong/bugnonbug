~100 users using Firefox 3.5.5 where there home folder is located on a remote server accessed over AFP are experiencing low disk space errors and system instability.  It appears something in the Firefox profile was temporarily expanding causing the entire remote server where user's homedirs were stored to fill HD to capacity.  The file then quickly gave space back to the filesystem.  This process takes only seconds.  It happens on different users profiles randomly several times an hour as long as Firefox is open and the users are working.  If the application is left idle, we did not see problems occur, only during browsing and usage.

Reproducible: Always

1.Users use Firefox, issue occurs.
2.Users are moved to different Server, issue occurs.
3.Firefox is closed, issue does not occur.
Actual Results:  
When the application is closed the issue does not occur on our network.
