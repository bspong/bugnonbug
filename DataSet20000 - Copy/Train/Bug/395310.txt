Mozilla should have debug builds, symbol server, and easy way to sync source code to a release
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0
Build Identifier: 

Maybe some of this infrastructure already exists, but I couldn't find any info on it. 

The scenario is somebody that is developing a javascript application sometimes needs to drop into the debugger to understand why Firefox is doing something a certain way. A typical DHTML engineer that has some C++ debugging skills probably doesn't have the time to build a full debug release of Mozilla (the build has gotten better but it still takes a while to figure out and a long time to build). An engineer might also be debugging problems that are different in different versions of the browser. Ironically, in some ways it can be easier for an application developer to debug Internet Explorer since Microsoft provides a public symbol server (SRV**http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols). 

Mozilla can do a lot better by providing a public symbol server, debug build versions of all released builds, and an easy way to sync to the source code of a particular build (may already exist). In my ideal world, there would be a page "Debugging Firefox without building it yourself" that would provide links to all debug builds that can be installed, a symbol server with public symbols that works with ntsd/windbg/VS (and I am guessing this can be made to work with other platforms too but I don't know if the tools are that advanced), and a label or branch or whatever the CVS equivalent is to sync a client to the source code for that release.

This would have helped me and my fellow engineers numerous times with debugging problems we've hit in Mozilla. It probably would result in higher quality bugs being submitted and possibly bug fixes.
