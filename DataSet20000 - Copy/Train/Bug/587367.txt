This happens repeatedly in Firefox ever since the Plugin Container feature was launched. The browser locks up and won't do anything at all on various websites. This happens frequently and the only way to unfreeze it is to ctrl alt delete and manually close the browser containment feature then the browser works fine. I have a fully updated firefox of the latsest official build and I have fully updated plugins and only the run of the mill ones.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Playing videos seem to do it more than other times. It always happens but timing as to how long it takes varies. I have used Fox videos but also youtube and others will too especially if videos are in separate tabs.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
I would say play a video in fox and then open a few tabs and do a few other such processes and it will eventually happen even if no video is playing or is paused it will eventually lock up.

Expected Results:  
the browser will freeze You won't be able to interact with it. I will then close the plugin container feature and it will be ok except have to reload tabs so plugins can reload. I THINK the plugin container needs to increase the time or memory allowed so that it doesn't lock up.
