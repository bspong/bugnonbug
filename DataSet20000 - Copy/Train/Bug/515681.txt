Issues with Blackboard Learning System

If you log into UMassOnline, and select "Remember passwords for this site" when you go to edit a users profile, your username, the one that you logged in with, is reflected in the Name Suffix field of the users (the one that you are editing) profile.

From Blackboard: FF doesn’t care what the left says it will put the login on "columnValue[10]" so w/e column lines up with that.

To me this has to be a Browser bug because there aren’t 10 forms fields to warrant an index on the login page that would make this make sense.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.log into blackboard for UMassOnline
2.Select Admin Tab and select User Manager
3.Search for a user, and select edit
4. Your username will be propagated in the Name Suffix field of the Blackboard Vista User Manager
Actual Results:  
This is only true if you select Remember passwords on your initial log-in of our site.  There is no reason why the Name Suffix field within Blackboard is filled in with your username. 

Expected Results:  
The name suffix field should be left blank.
