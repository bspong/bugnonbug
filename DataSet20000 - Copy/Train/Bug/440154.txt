about:config filter not applied after Firefox restarts.

If you filter for a word in about:config, then close Firefox (saving the open tabs) and then you open Firefox, then Firefox will reopen the about:config tab and remember the word you used to filter, but will show all the preferences ignoring the filter.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a new tab and type "about:config" in the URL bar and hit enter.
2.Type something in the filter text box (for example "gfx").
3.Firefox correctly filters the preferences (in our example, you get 3 results).
4.Close Firefox (select to save tabs and quit in the menu that will appear).
5.Open Firefox again.

Actual Results:  
Firefox will open the tabs correctly, including the about:config tab, and will remember what you had typed in the filter text box ("gfx" in our example), but the filter will NOT be applied and ALL entries will be shown.

Expected Results:  
The filter should be applied, and only the preferences matching the filter should be shown.

Has the easy and obvious workaround: Change the text in the filter box and the filter will now be applied as it should.
