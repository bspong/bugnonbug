Currently, any new users attempting to try FireFox (who wish to change their fonts) will need to set the fonts in the Advanced section of Tools -> Options -> Content.  Simply changing the font there does not apply because by default, FireFox has the Advanced option of "Allow pages to choose their own font instead of the ones I listed above.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
* Change your font setting to Comic Sans MS
* Click "OK"
Actual Results:  
The font setting is not applied until the Advanced option is unticked.

Expected Results:  
The end-user should be able to change the font straight from the userprefs menu for Content.

I am not even sure if this is intended behavior because I've never actually attempted to do this before.  I just feel the userprefs dialog for Content is a bit deceptive because it cannot actually change the font settings until the option through "Advanced" is unticked.  Having this option under content or negating it somehow would make it easier for people to customize the font the browser uses.
