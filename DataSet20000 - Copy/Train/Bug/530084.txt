Microsoft Windows Login.Live will not remember me
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Each time I go to open my mymsn.com home page after the browser has closed or the PC restarted, I have to log in again to the Microsoft .net framework. Prior to Firefox 3.5.4 I had no problem with being remembered. Consequently, whenever I start my browser anew I am constantly having to type in my user name and password or the mymsn homepage says that it is not available at this time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Close Firefox or restart PC.
2.it starts with mymsn as the selectected homepage, but requires me to log in to login.live.con.
3.After I enter the user name and password, even checking the remember me on this PC buttons, it logs me in and gives a button to Continue to the MyMsn page.
4. If I close the browser, then reopen the browser, it says that the MyMsn page is not currently available.
5. Then I have to go to Tools/Options/Privacy/Settings and make sure that all the History circles are checked.
6. Then I restart the browser, enter user name and password, even checking the remember me on this PC buttons, then click and go through the Continue to get to mymsn homepage - which works so long as I don't close the browser.
Actual Results:  
Same thing.

Expected Results:  
Clicking on the url in bookmarks or icon for the MyMsn homepage should automatically log me into the Windows/Microsoft .net network (login.live) and automatically bring up my MyMsn page - this is how it works in IE6.
