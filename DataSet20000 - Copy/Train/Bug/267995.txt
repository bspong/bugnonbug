saving default applications for file types doesnt work
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040914 Firefox/0.10.1

I can never get firefox to open PDFs with 'acroread' or other files with other
default applications automatically. When i check the box for 'Do this
automatically for files like this from now on.', it has no effect. I can open
the preferences and see that it is recorded (that it should open with acroread).
However, when i restart firefox, all of these settings are lost. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open click on a link to a PDF file
2. Choose 'other' for application to open file with
3. Select appropriate application
4. Check the 'Do this automatically from now on.' check box
5. Open and browse file with correct application
6. Shut down firefox
7. Restart firefox and try to open a link to a PDF file

Actual Results:  
When i do all this, it re-opens the dialog to choose application to open the
file with, the default NOT being the program that I had saved. I then have to go
through and find the file that has a pointer to the application i would like to
open the file with. 

Expected Results:  
Just open the PDF with 'acroread'
