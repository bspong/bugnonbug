User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/36.0.1985.125 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open App Manager
2. Connect device to computer.
3. Click "Connect <DeviceID>"
4. Allow connection on device
5. Add Packaged App to App Manager (I used http://github.com/someoneweird/bouncyscreen)
6. Select the app, then click "Update"
7. Click "Debug"


Actual results:

1. App is updated (and/or installed) on target device
2. Debug button is greyed out when clicked
3. App is successfully launched on target device.
4. DevTools tab is not opened.
5. App does not show up in the "Devices" -> "Installed Apps" list


Expected results:

DevTools tab should open and start debugging application on device.
App should show up in "Installed Apps" list.

Not sure where else to put this extra info, so it shall go here:

Device: Flame
Device Build: Boot2Gecko 2.1.0.0-prerelease (compiled ~1d ago, default branch)
ADB Version: 1.0.31
FF ADB Bridge: 0.4.0
Host OS: OSX 10.9.4

These same steps replicated with the 2.1 Simulator image yield the expected results.
Dev Console on "App Manager" page shows no errors, neither does stdout when running firefox via cli.
