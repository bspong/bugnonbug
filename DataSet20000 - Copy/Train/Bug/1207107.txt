Modernize the UI of aboutCertError.xhtml
aboutCertError.xhtml still contains Larry and is in dire need of a fresh coat of paint. Bram has an updated UI spec that can be found here:

Slight alterations for different error types can be found here:

This bug is about applying the common set of changes to the markup and stylesheets of aboutCertError.xhtml. Followup bugs will take care of the particular details of each error. This bug needs to implement the following:

- Display the broken lock icon instead of Larry
- Use the headline: “Your connection is not secure”
- Use the following copy for the main message: “The owner of expired.badssl.com has configured their website improperly. To protect your information from being stolen, Firefox has not connected to this website.”
- Add a “Learn more…” link that takes the user to the SUMO page: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/tls-error-reports
- Add a “Return to Previous Page” button that does "history.back()" or goes to "about:home"
- Add an “Advanced” button that reveals technical details about the error that are currently under the "Technical Details" section.
