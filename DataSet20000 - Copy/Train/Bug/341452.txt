Cannot download files when a link is clicked

When clicking a link that points to a downloadable file, I recieve an error stating:

" C:\DOCUME~1\DR\LOCALS~1\Temp\banana.jpg could not be saved, because the source file could not be read. Try again later, or contact the server administrator. "

I have reformatted my machine, installed NOTHING but FF and still get the same error. The ONLY way I can download is to either "right-click > save as"  or "open in IE"

This was also an issue for me with the previous build released for download. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on a link that points to a download.
2. Get an error...
3. Can't dowload the file unless you choose "save as" from the context menu or open the link in Internet Explorer.

Actual Results:  
Pop-up stating:

"C:\DOCUME~1\DR\LOCALS~1\Temp\banana.jpg could not be saved, because the source file could not be read. Try again later, or contact the server administrator."

Expected Results:  
Download manager opens to download the file.

Fresh install of operating system (latest updates only) and fresh install of Firefox. No themes or extensions installed.
