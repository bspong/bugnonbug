firefox became unresponsive, failing to exit, despite apparently responding to controls. All but the last window closed using apple+shift+w, last window refused to close. All tabs closed (every last one!), tab bar was however still visible for some unknown reason. window continued to display one of the previously closed tabs (which seemed odd as this was not the last tab). checking in the window menu, found an extensive menu filled with nothing but blank menu items. the final tab title was displayed as the single (top most), and only menu item which was not blank. Title did not match the window displayed.

summary of features:
(1) closed tab still displayed in window
(2) emply tab bar remained visible
(3) menu item in windows menu displays incorrect title
(4) window menu displays large number of blenk/empty entries.
(5) firefox failed to close final window
(6) firefox failed to exit

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
Couldnt reproduce as had no way of knowing how this occured, firefox had been running fine, with no obvious signs of trouble, hence no reason to look in the "windows" menu on macosx.
