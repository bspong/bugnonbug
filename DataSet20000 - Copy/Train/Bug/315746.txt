I've had a problem with Firefox and Camino. In a multi-line text box, when I enter text, the cursor moves faster than the text itself. This is also a problem when selecting text. It's even a problem when selecting text from the page source. (Try it yourself.)

I've noticed that the problem is linked to monospace vs variable space fonts. We currently have the text box displaying variable width font. However, when I enter an accent mark, the line I'm typing turns into monospace (weird enough itself), and the cursor suddnely moves exactly in proportion to the letter spacing.

The problem, then, seems to be that Firefox and Camino don't recognize the sizes of variable width fonts within editable text boxes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit www.zaptix.com on Mac Firefox or Camino
2. View Page Source
3. Try selecting text and see what happens.

(The text boxes are in members-only areas, but the problem is similar.)

Actual Results:  
Text selection is out of whack with the actual text.

Expected Results:  
Text is selected beginning where the mouse begins and ending where it ends.
