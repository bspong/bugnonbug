Steps to reproduce:

Very easy to reproduce.

Step.1: go to www.twitch.tv

Step.2: get in to a stream (no matter which one)

Step.3: get the stream in a popup window by clicking the "Pop out" button. (next to the fullscreen button)

Step.4: open new firefox window.



Actual results:

The new firefox window you just opened is just a transparent window without any content. (as you can see in the attached screenshot)

When you resize it, the middle content of the window turns white.

The chance to open a bugged(transparent) firefox window depends (from my experience) on how many popup windows and how many normal firefox windows are opened. 
So in the case i made the screenshot i had 3 popup windows and i closed the only normal firefox window so i only had left 3 popup windows.
The chance to open a bugged window was 99%, even when i closed 2 of the 3 remaining popup windows i could not open a normal firefox window.


Expected results:

Open a normal firefox window.
