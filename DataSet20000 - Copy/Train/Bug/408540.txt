Internet shortcut (.url) works in XP but fails in Vista; goes to "file:///C:..." instead of website.

Instead of opening http://www.radioparadise.com, we get this in Firefox URL box:
file:///N:/Music/Radio%20Paradise%20-%20eclectic%20online%20rock%20radio.url
But in XP (w/Firefox 2.0.0.11), website is opened as expected.
The internet shortcut we clicked was created in MSEI (by the way, how to do that in Firefox?  Right-click from website doesn't appear to offer "Save Shortcut"!)
Here is contents of .url:
[InternetShortcut]
URL=http://www.radioparadise.com/
IDList=
IconFile=http://www.radioparadise.com/favicon.ico
IconIndex=1
[{000214A0-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}]
Prop3=19,2


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Navigate to favorite website, e.g., www.radioparadise.com, in MSIE
2.Right-click in non-sensitive page area
3.Select and click "Create Shortcut" -- creats .url on desktop
4.Navigate or minimize windows to view desktop
5.Double-click the new shortcut icon on desktop (Firefox IS your default browser, right?
6.Repeat in both XP and Vista (Home Premium here).

Actual Results:  
Firefox has lame string in URL box:
file:///N:/Music/Radio%20Paradise%20-%20eclectic%20online%20rock%20radio.url
... and page view is half-rendered

Expected Results:  
Should open same web page as was viewing when "Create Shortcut" clicked.
