Important: This happens since 2.0.0.15 under MACOS/Leopard (latest version) and on Windows XP SP2, but i decided to open only one bug report. the physical system is not shared, so this happens either on my macbook and my custom build i686 pc.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open some sites in some tabs
2. try scrolling all time
OR
3. enter some data in a textarea or input type=text field
Actual Results:  
experience lags sometimes, lasting 2-5 secs with 100% cpu usage or experience the lags while typing

Expected Results:  
smooth scrolling, as usual or as it was under 2.0.0.14
same with form input

strange enough, that these lags havent happened since filling out the form fields of this bug report. i wish i could switch to firefox3 but ongoing comparison of display results between safari and firefox3 on macos still shows rendering/css problems with firefox3, both browsers are acid proof, however. this one might be hard to reproduce, maybe some flash or javascript must be running in one of the other tabs but since i did not open the same sites under macos and windows, this one seems not to be website related. anyway, a method for downgrading to 2.0.0.14 would be nice too...
