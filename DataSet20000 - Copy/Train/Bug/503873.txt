Firefox 3.5 takes too long to open on first boot
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090624 Firefox/3.0.4, Ant.com Toolbar 1.3

When I start up my computer for the fist time(cold boot) and wait until all applications and drivers have been loaded(cpu is normalized), then I run Firefox 3.5 and it takes about 30 seconds to open(page ready to browse). If I close the browser and open Firefox 3.5 again it only takes about 8  seconds to open.

Note: I have uninstalled and disabled all addons and I have set OPTIONS to Open Blank Page when Firefox starts
  
I have followed the steps described in  Bug 501605 and it did reduce de time for 60 seconds to open to 30 seconds; However 30 seconds to open Firefox is still way too long.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Turn on computer (cold boot)
2.Wait until all applications and drivers are loaded.
3.Make sure CPU Usage is normalized (there are no more applications loading)
4.Launch Firefox 3.5
Actual Results:  
Firefox Takes up to 30 seconds to be open and ready to browse (home page: http://en-US.start3.mozilla.com/firefox?client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official)


I have been able to reproduce the same in two computers, 
Windows XP SP3
Intel dual core 2.6ghz
1GB RAM
