Problem with payment gateway
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When I go to any website wherein payment has to be done, the website redirects me to payment gateway (citi bank gateway - india). At the first screen, I enter all the credit card details and click the submit button. The gateway directs me to error page saying the transaction failed as the user pressed back/forward button, or browser cookies are disabled/not supported or session has expired.

If I navigate the same gateway & website using the mozilla's "ie tab plugin" in browser the payment works out properly. This has happened with my transactions for 2-3 times due to which I am not able to use firefox for payment websites. (The total time from logging in to reaching payment gateway with error is approximately 1-2 min). I have checked for cookies and they are enabled & working properly (for email accounts).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to any payment related website
2.Go to payment gateway
3.After entering all the credit card details when submit button is clicked an error page is raised saying that transaction failed as back/forward button pressed or cookies are disabled or session expired.
Actual Results:  
Transactions fails due to session expiration/ cookies not supported/ navigation error.

Expected Results:  
The transaction should end as successful.
