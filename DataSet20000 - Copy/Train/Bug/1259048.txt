"Show my windows and tabs from last time" reverts to "Show my home page"
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0

Steps to reproduce:

Last few Firefox versions will not stay with "Show my windows and tabs from last time".  It reverts to "Show my home page".  This happens on ALL of my firefox installations (4x), including my wife's.  Mine has lots of add ons, hers has none.  Mine might have 50 tabs open, hers less than 5.  

I can't tell what triggers it, but I've actually left the options page open and watched it switch from "Show my windows and tabs from last time" to "Show my home page", all by itself, so there is code SOMEWHERE doing this.  The time between events is inconsistent.  If you wait long enough, it will happen.  I would say that 1 day is typically sufficient to check that it has reset itself to "Show my home page", but it can last longer than that.  It can be as short as 5 minutes.  I've gotten into the habit of checking before I restart, and I would say 90% of the time it has switched after a day or two.


Actual results:

Reverts to "Show my home page".  I didn't do anything.  Suggest looking through all code for the variable that changes that setting, and find an instance that is changing it that is not from user input.  The code is there somewhere.  Very annoying.


Expected results:

Nothing should have happened.  It should stay set to the user preference.  It should be set so that ONLY the user may change this setting.
