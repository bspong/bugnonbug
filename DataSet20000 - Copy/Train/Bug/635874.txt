I use sync on TWO machines.  On both of them, after each sync, the spellchecker.dictionary user preference is reset to es_GT. I have never set it to that myself. I attempted several solutions:
* manually selecting English-US from the right-click menu
* manually setting the pref value to en_US in about:config
* manually clearing the pref value in about:config
I've done this on both machines, but the problem persists. After each sync, the pref is set to es_GT.  Thinking it might be related to the sync bug that sets the display language to a "chrome:" URL, I manually set that preference to English as well.  No effect.
I don't know if it's relevant, but Spanish/Guatemala is the first language listed in the right-click menu.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit about:config and set spellchecker.dictionary pref to en_US or reset it.
2. Sync.
3. Visit about:config and look.
Actual Results:  
4. spellchecker.dictionary pref now says es_GT.

Expected Results:  
5. The software should have retained my actual setting.
