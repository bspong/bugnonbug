Yesterday I created about 5 video examples for a talk I'm giving on Thursday about Firefox 3.5, today none of the examples work, and my code has not changed. I also tried this on XP and have the same results.

Here's the error:
[Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x804b0002 (NS_BINDING_ABORTED) [nsIStreamListener.onStartRequest]"  nsresult: "0x804b0002 (NS_BINDING_ABORTED)"  location: "JS frame :: file:///C:/Users/F1LT3R/AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/jvtax4gw.FireFox2/extensions/firebug@software.joehewitt.com/components/firebug-channel-listener.js :: anonymous :: line 126"  data: no]
file:///C:/Users/F1LT3R/AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/jvtax4gw.FireFox2/extensions/firebug@software.joehewitt.com/components/firebug-channel-listener.js
Line 126

At first this looks like a FireBug error, but even if I turn Firebug off it does not work. Audio seems to work no problem.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add tag to HTML, <video "whatever.ogv" autoplay...
2. Load HTML
3. Watch nothing happen
Actual Results:  
Results, none, or a Firebug error. Minefield Windows also not closing properly, can't tell if that is related or not.

Expected Results:  
It should see video. I saw it yesterday. Now nothing!

Wonder if this will be fixed by Thursday?
