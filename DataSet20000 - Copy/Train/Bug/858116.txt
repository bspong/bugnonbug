Make each window opened in "Private Browsing Mode" a separate process
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:20.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/20.0
Build ID: 20130329030832

Steps to reproduce:

Installed v20 Firefox expecting to be able to open more than one Private Browsing window such that each window's "privateness" is independent from the other.


Actual results:

Users cannot open a new Private Browsing window that is separate/disconnected from an already open private browsing window. All private browsing windows that I open share the same cookies--this should not be!




Expected results:

if I open private-browsing-window-1 and login to a site, I should be able to open a second private-browsing-window (private-browsing-window-2) and go to the same site but not be logged in. That is, the cookies are not shared between the two private browsing windows. Each Private Browsing window is "private/independent" of any other private browsing windows. 

this capability has many useful features besides privacy. For example, one use is that a user can login to Hotmail-account-1 in private-browsing-window-1 and then open a second window (private-browsing-window-2) and login to Hotmail-account-2 in that window, which is impossible if window-2 is using the same cookies from window-1.

This is the feature that Firefox v20 should have added to the browser: user enables "Always use private browsing mode" and then he/she can simply tap Ctrl+N to open a new firefox-window as a separate process (that is, the new window will not share cookies, history, etc with any of the other open windows).
