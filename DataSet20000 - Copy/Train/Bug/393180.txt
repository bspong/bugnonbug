Web pages do not print or preview properly
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070725 Firefox/2.0.0.6

I have found several pages that do not print properly from Firefox.  The Print Preview functions presents an accurate representation of what will be printed.  The same pages print properly using IE 6.0 or Firefox using the IE tab add-on (version 1.3.3.20070528).

It appears Firefox does not detect that the physical output page is full and start a new page.

This can be seen printing either of the following pages:

http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/HA102362291033.aspx?mode=print

I have seen this behavior on sites other than Microsoft, but do not have the URLs at this time.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open page at specified URL
2. Select File > Print Preview (or Print)

Actual Results:  
File will preview or print with incorrect formatting (compare to results using IE or Firefox IE Tab).  Only the first page of output and the final footer are printed; the remainder runs off the bottom of the first page.

Expected Results:  
Printed the entire web page.
