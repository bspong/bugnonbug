When I am in a tab, say, www.yahoo.com,   and key in new url in address bar,
say, www.espn.com.   then a new tab is created in foreground with this address.
  But when I switch to the original tab which is yahoo.com,  the address bar
shows a selected address (i mean blue backgraound and white character) of the
new address espn.com.  
I am using Tabbrowser Preferences 1.1.1.  




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. make sure the extension Tabbrowser Preferences 1.1.1 is installed.  and check
 the selection "URLs in address bar" under the item " Load the following in new
tab" in menu Tools->option

2. enter a new address www.yahoo.com in address bar.  
3. switch to the new created.
4. switch back to the first tab.  look at the address bar

Actual Results:  
address bar reads "www.yahoo.com" in selected mode.  

Expected Results:  
The address bar should display the original address of the current tab

How and when will I know if this bug is resolved?  thanks!
