Multiple passwords in HTTP basic authentication will not be transmitted correctly
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.3

In the HTTP basic authentication dialog, Firefox will send the correct password
only at first time. If the first challenge fails, the HTTP server will prompt
for athetnication again. When entering different credentials, they are messed
up. The second password given is padded by the first, parts of the password of
the first try will be send to the server again. The user will not notice the
problem. Thie bug is evident if the second password is shorter than the first.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select a HTTP server with HTTP basic authentication, and enable debugging of
username and password credentials coming from clients
2. Open Firefox and visit the server. Enter invalid credentials with a long
password. The server will challenge again.
3. Enter (maybe correct) credentials with a shorter password than before. The
authentication fails.

Actual Results:  
Authentication is not possible without restarting Firefox if the first challenge
failed.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should always send the entered credentials to the server.

Here is a log of Firefox connecting to Tomcat 5.5.4. 
The client sends username "a" and password "1234567890", which fails, followed
by a second try, username "b" and passwort "c". The second password "c" is
padded by "234567890".
