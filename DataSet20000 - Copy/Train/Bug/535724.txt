Pop up ad windows(watch streams or video popups), when clicking on minimize maximize or close buttons stall firefox, the buttons flicker and makes everything unstable. Right click wont come up with options, or right click on window to close, close button never highlights. When i end firefox in tast manager, says it is still running. Doesnt happend in IE 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. www.channelsurfing.net
2. click on one of the links to watch a stream
3. Overtime minimize maximize and close buttons wont work, makes everything unstable
Actual Results:  
Firefox can give in at anytime, causing instablitily with the software

Expected Results:  
Able to close any window with out being unstable, rather it be popup, popup video or anything, only stalls when pop windows with ads or video, such at streamed video popups

 Seems like popup videos from private servers websites run by only a few people, not any big name websites cause issues.
