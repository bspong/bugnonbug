Web pages that display WMP embedded streamed video initially open to what appears to be a 640 x 480 or otherwise enlarged display but then "squash" the video to a smaller rectangle about 1/2 to 1/8 the initial size.  A large black background is left where the window originally started with the streaming video vertically justified to the top-most position.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Start with FF 3.6.6 and Windows Media Player DLL plug-in 3.0.2.629, "npdsplay.dll", then launch FF.
2.  Navigate to a website like the one listed in this report showing streaming video and using MS's Media Player as the device.
3.  Open the page or click on the link to enable MS streaming video.
Actual Results:  
The page opens and does display streaming video but the image is compressed vertically and cannot be resized, sometimes becoming so distorted that the video cannot be seen clearly.

Expected Results:  
Either the image would have resized proportionally (height and width) and the black background resized with it, or the image would have expanded proportionally to fill the placeholder background.
