Gmail full-screen & print compose rendering goes to outer space

I clicked on the full screen compost button on gmail ...


The rendering was weird

A second problem is that he Print view is that the print is no way 'authentic' to the on-screen display.  

It seemed to go away when I created a new tab from teh existing compose tab.  BUT there were stil some funny '<div> like structures showing.

The print page is diabolical -- See attachment.





Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
 1.  Gmail compose / reply / forward.
 2.  Click on full-screen pop-out on google's compose frame.
 3.  Wait for the new screen to be built .. Observe the weird stuff on left and right and bottom of the email mesage, text box. 

Actual Results:  
Teh leyout is all confused and placment is garbled  See attached PDF file.

Expected Results:  
Same as firefox2 or internet explorer7

I have a PDF version of the screen -  Apparently the print engine in firefox3 is completely unfinished, it looks nothing like what's on the screen.
