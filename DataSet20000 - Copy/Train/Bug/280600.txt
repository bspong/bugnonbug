Link to local WMV file with path containing spaces won't open in Windows Media Player (space passed to helper app as %20)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1

Links to local wmv files are passed url-encoded to Windows Media Player, so a
file  on the desktop for example will cause Windows Media Player to complain
about not finding "C:\Document%20and%20Settings\user\Desktop\file.wmv"  FWIW, I
checked it in Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b)
Gecko/20050131 and it works fine there.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a directory c:\foo bar\
2.put a file with the extension .wmv in there.
3.create an html file with a line like:
<a href="file:///c:/bar%20foo/test.wmv">Link</a>
4. Open the file, click on the link
5. When Windows Media Player opens, you'll see a fairly useless error message,
don't click more information.  You get more information, but it has little to no
relevance.
6. After all that nonsense is dismissed, Windows Media Player will busy itself
with opening its online store, trying in vain to get you to purchase a copy of
your test WMV file from it's mothership.  While it's doing this, you can click
on the entry in the 'Now Playing List' corresponding to your file.  It will have
an exclamation point in front of it.  Note: This does not mean WMP is playing
the negation of your file.  It means there is a problem.  When you click on it,
you'll see the path Windows Media Player was looking for:
'c:\foo%20bar'
If you replace the %20 with a space and hit enter, everything'll work.
Actual Results:  
My windows media file failed to play.

Expected Results:  
I think it probably should have reversed the URL encoding process.  It's clearly
already doing something, because the forward slashes have been returned to
backwards ones, the leading slash has been removed, and the 'file://' is gone. 
This makes me think it's the browser's responsibility to translate URLs into
system filenames, not the media player's.  Perhaps I'm wrong, but this does work
in MSIE and Mozilla.

I'm using a fresh user account created for this purpose with fresh nightlies of
Moz and FF.  I would check to see if the bug is broader (e.g. if it affects any
more helper apps) but I don't have any other helper apps on my system.
