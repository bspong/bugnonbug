It's working on older mozilla 1,8 beta, but not for newer versions of firefox
and mozilla. Tested on os/2 and linux, on newest mozilla and firefox (but also
reproduced on this ff 1.0.1), not occur on mozilla 1.8b for os/2.  

The problem is with handling event onmouseout with dynamically created elements
(by JS/DOM). Staticaly written code is ok. Look at example page, go by mouse
pointer to "pozycja 1" and some menu will be visible, there is onmouseout event,
that should hide menu when mouse pointer is out of it, but it's working only
sometimes, but everytime when mouse is on "pozycja 1" (there's onmouseout event
too, wchich is working correctly). 

Disabling in styles absolute positioning makes it work good, but then page is
dplayed in other way. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to page
2. go by mouse pointer to layer with "pozycja 1" 
3. there should be visible now new layer with something, there is event onmouse
out for "pozycja 1" and new menu with should always hide new menu 
4. onmouseout works correctly only for "pozycja 1" layer. 

Actual Results:  
There is new layer diplayed with onmouseout event, which not working correctly
for new menu (wroks only sometimes). 

Expected Results:  
Layer should be hidden each time You leave it by mouse pointer. Simple
onmouseout event, which hides layer. 

tested on linux (new mozilla and firefox 1.0.4) and os/2 firefox 1.0.1
not occuring on os/2 in mozilla 1.8b so seems to be some fresh bug for all
platforms.
