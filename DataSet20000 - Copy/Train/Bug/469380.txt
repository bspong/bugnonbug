Dynamically written Shockwave Director element displays in the wrong position when the page is scrolled.

The sample page uses a javascript setTimeout to write an object tag into the innerHTML of a placeholder DIV.  The object tag loads and runs the Shockwave version tester from www.adobe.com.  

If the page is scrolled before the plug-in loads, the plug-in will appear in the spot where it should have been if the page had NOT been scrolled.  Oddly enough, mousing-over the link - which has a hover style applied - pops the plug-ing back to the correct screen location.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to http://grid.sh3lls.net/~cscibri/shockwave.htm
2. Scroll the page to the bottom to before the plug-in loads
3. Wait for 3 seconds.
4. (Optional) Mouse-over the "fix me" link, and the plug-in will move to the correct spot.
Actual Results:  
The plug-in was drawn in the incorrect screen location

Expected Results:  
The plug-in should have replaced the placeholder.

I tried this on Firefox 3.0.4 as well as a recent nightly build.  I have shockwave version 10.4r25 installed; this bug also occurs with the latest plug-in version.  I am cross-posting this bug to adobe.  

I have not been able to find a work-around that preserves the behavior of delaying the load of the shockwave plug-in until after the timeout has expired.
