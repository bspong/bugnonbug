Add API keys support for Google Location Service API.
+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #835890 +++

Folks at Google have asked us to investigate using specific API keys for making requests to Google APIs from Firefox release builds. The goal is to allow them to put further restrictions on non-Firefox uses of those APIs.

Some preliminary information about how this works in Chrome:
> This is the link for contributors outside of Google:
> http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/api-keys
> 
> The key implementation files in the Chromium source tree are:
> 
> a) A central point for retrieving the API key and OAuth2 tokens that
> are set on the build. This picks up the key and tokens that are baked
> in via preprocessor defines or in an internal-only header file, and
> bakes them into the binary. It also allows overriding values at
> runtime via environment variables and command-line switches. See
> http://code.google.com/p/chromium/source/search?q=google_api_keys.h
> and its associated .cc file.
> 
> b) A build configuration that detects whether the
> google_chrome_api_keys.h file is available and uses it automatically
> if it is, depending on configuration. See
> http://code.google.com/p/chromium/source/search?q=common%5C.gypi+google_api
> (top result) and a Python script it depends on,
> http://code.google.com/p/chromium/source/search?q=build/check_internal%5C.py



This is a requirement of the current GLS contract -- without sending keys, we can not do Geolocation.
