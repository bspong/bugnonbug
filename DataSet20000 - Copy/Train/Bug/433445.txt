Handling of No Disk Space

When using Portable Firefox (v2.0.0.14) on a 4Gb USB Thumbdrive, I found that FireBug was reporting a large number of errors such as:

"[Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80520010 (NS_ERROR_FILE_NO_DEVICE_SPACE) [nsIFileOutputStream.write]" nsresult: "0x80520010 (NS_ERROR_FILE_NO_DEVICE_SPACE)" location: "JS frame :: file:///F:/System/Apps/_Firefox/App/firefox/components/nsSessionStore.js :: sss_writeFile :: line 2073" data: no]
[Break on this error] // write and close stream"

Investigation showed I had exhausted the disk space on the USB Drive, which was causing Session Manager and Google Browser Sync to generate errors when trying to save data to the drive.

Whilst this may not be an issue with Full Installs, where the disk quota is handled by the OS, having Firefox generate a once-per-session error if it finds that the space available for it to save data is nearly exhausted would be a valuable addition to the system.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox Portable on USB Thumbdrive
2. Use up all USB Thumbdrive's available storage capacity
3. Run Firefox Portable and monitor Firebug Console
Actual Results:  
Console reporting numerous errors such as:
"[Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80520010 (NS_ERROR_FILE_NO_DEVICE_SPACE) [nsIFileOutputStream.write]" nsresult: "0x80520010 (NS_ERROR_FILE_NO_DEVICE_SPACE)" location: "JS frame :: file:///F:/System/Apps/_Firefox/App/firefox/components/nsSessionStore.js :: sss_writeFile :: line 2073" data: no]
[Break on this error] // write and close stream"

Expected Results:  
Generated a Pop-Up Error Message stating that the drive I am running Firefox on has exhausted it's capacity, and that Firefox and any Add-Ons may behave unexpectedly. Have message recommend that User free up some space and restart Firefox.
