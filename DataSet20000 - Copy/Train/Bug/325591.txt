Renaming firefox.exe causes 1.5.0.1 partial patch to fail
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

Due to "policy restrictions," any executable on my system named "firefox.exe" is blocked. Moving firefox.exe to another filename allows proper execution. Because the partial patch procedure searches explicitly for "firefox.exe" and not the name of the executable that is currently running, it fails on my system. See output of updates/last-update.log below.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have Mozilla 1.5 installed.
2. Rename firefox.exe to something else (eg: firefoxx.exe)
3. Run partial patch procedure.

Actual Results:  
The partial patch fails and suggests a full-download upgrade.

Expected Results:  
The software should have checked the name of the currently-running executable and should have patched that, rather than blindly trying to patch "firefox.exe"
