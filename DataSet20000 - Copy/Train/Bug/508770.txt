Firefox 3.5 hangs on for a few seconds from time to time, especially when doing some action, but not always - only once per few minutes.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; pl; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; pl; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

It started when I upgraded from 3.2 to 3.5.1.
From time to time there is a few seconds hang and nothing works for those few seconds, Windows puts "no response" info on the window.
It's nearly always when I do some action (clicking options, creating new tab, clicking some button, when I focus something for example text input in form, writing text etc.). It's sometimes more often (for example now, 4 hangs while writing all this summary) and sometimes less.
Sometimes hang doesn't stop till I click something in the browser - when I do that there "busy" icon appears, "no response" info appears and after 3-4 seconds browser get back to life.
When there is a hang there is 100% usage on one of the processors on my computer.
Clearing cache, history etc. didn't work.

Everything worked fine on Firefox 3.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Unknown. It just happens for me from time to time.
Don't know how to check what is the cause.
Actual Results:  
Browser hangs from time to time

Expected Results:  
Shouldnt hang or should do that much less often

Now I have pretty many addons and plugins installed but things started to appear before I installed any new stuff (so when I had only those that I have had before update: Firebug, Flashblock, Google gears, Google toolbar for firefox, Greasemonkey, Ling toolbar (turned off becouse of incompatibility), Microsoft .NET Framework Assistant, Torbutton).
