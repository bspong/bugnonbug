Hiding the window (Command-H) while a tooltip is onscreen (created by hovering over anything with a title, such as a tab or an image on a web page) will cause it to leave a ghost (empty) tooltip when the window is brought back to the front. While the tooltip will sometimes disappear when the window is brought back into focus, simply trying again will be enough to cause the bug to occur. (Creating another tooltip will usually get the ghost tooltip to go away.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Hover over anything that generates a tooltip, whether it be a tab that is open or an image with a title attribute.
2. When the tooltip appears, hide the window using Command-H.
3. When you bring the window back up, the a ghost tooltip will be present, which may even carry over to be on top of other programs.
4. If these steps do not immediately work, try them again. You may need to bring another window to focus in between Steps 2 and 3 in order for it to work.
Actual Results:  
Ghost tooltip remains.

Expected Results:  
No evidence of the tooltip should remain.
