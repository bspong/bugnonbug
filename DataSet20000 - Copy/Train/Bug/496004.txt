Incompatible with 3M Post-it Software, Professional Edition (maybe other editions too)

If you drag a 3M-Post-it Note (Professional Edition) under a Mozilla window (Firefox or Thunderbird) the note is erased. With other software's open window, the note will not drag under it; a barrier prevents the note from moving all the way under the open window. Conversely, a Mozilla window drug over a Post-it Note has no effect on the note, other than to cover it.  3M Tech support thinks it has something to do with MS routines you use or don't use. 

It's annoying because Firefox is always open on my desktop and I forget and drag a note under it... and it's gone forever. You probably don't consider this a bug... but I do.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Grab yellow Post-it Note on the desktop
2. Drag it under a Firefox or Thunderbird window
3. The note is gone forever (i.e. not even in Post-it Trash)
Actual Results:  
Post-it Note erased

Expected Results:  
Boundary of Mozilla window should not allow the Post-it Note to
be dragged behind it. No other software I've encountered allows it.
