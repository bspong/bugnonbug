About:firefox should display build date or build number if on Beta channel
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:6.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0
Build ID: 20110721152715

Steps to reproduce:

I'm am using the beta channel (currently Firefox 6)

Firefox -> Help -> About Firefox


Actual results:

Firefox
6.0
Firefox is up to date
You are currently on beta update channel


Expected results:

Like Aurora and nightly, it should have told me some information on which beta build I am using

Example:

6.0 (2011-07-21)
Firefox is up to date
You are currently on beta update channel

or even better

6.0b3
Firefox is up to date
You are currently on beta update channel

I know the beta build number isn't being checked into the repository, so it may be midly tricky to get this information

But it should be possible with a slight change to the build scripts as the system is obviously picking up the mercurial changeset number which seems to be the only way to figure out the build number from the UI.

Firefox -> Help -> Troubleshooting Information -> about:config -> click on the Built from http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/7864cfd02969 link.

Obviously, if the app.update.channel preference says the user is on the release channel then this new about:firefox information wouldn't display.
