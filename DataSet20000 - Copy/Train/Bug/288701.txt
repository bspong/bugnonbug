Uninstall deleted everything in my program files directory save a few open binaries.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows 98)
Build Identifier: Firefox (1.0) ?

I downloaded FireFox a while ago and finding that the integrated 'plugin 
installer' didn't work ignored it and downloaded and installed the necessary 
components manualy.

All components except for 'Nippon-Browse', a japanese to english dictionary,  
have worked correctly.

A recent update notice promted me to upgrade. The inataller again didn't work 
(no outgoing connection...) so I decided to download the latest version and 
uninstall.

I also uninstalled that unstable Adobe 6 nonsense first.

The uninstall went off without a hitch except that now I could not access the 
internet nor any other browser I had.

A quick restart and behold a desktop of broken icons, applications 
crashing/failing to start correctly and windows installer telling me that I 
could not install microsoft office (it was installed two years ago and was 
still not a minute ago...) as it was now missing critical components...

A quick file-browse and I discover that the FireFox installer has *deleted 
every file* not a-running-binary from my *program files* directory up.

This not only includes every application I had installed, common components, 
but more inportantly the custom conficurations, scripts and plugins I'd 
developed/accumilated.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install FireFox(1.0)
2. use FireFox plugin-installer (w/no success)
3. download and install Adobe 6, Java, Macromedia Flash, Quick Time
4. use FireFox update-installer (w/no success)
5. uninstall FireFox
6. discover FireFox'Fuck'
7. repair install windows.
8. cry.

or
Only deleted FireFox related files leaving my Program Files directory intact.
