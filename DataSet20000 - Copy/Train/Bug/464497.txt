the creators of the Website http://speed.po.wavecable.com/
gave me a test page http://demo.ookla.com/test.php which reports results their webpage sees on my pc:

The test page results in straight Firefox:

FLASH_VERSION = 0.0.0
HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR =
HTTP_CLIENT_IP =
REMOTE_ADDR = 24.113.92.30
USER_AGENT = Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3

The test page results in an IE tab of Firefox:

FLASH_VERSION = 9.0.115
HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR =
HTTP_CLIENT_IP =
REMOTE_ADDR = 24.113.92.30
USER_AGENT = Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648)

The test page results in straight IE

FLASH_VERSION = 9.0.115
HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR =
HTTP_CLIENT_IP =
REMOTE_ADDR = 24.113.92.30
USER_AGENT = Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648)

I am surprised that the last one mentions Mozilla.  Is it because my default browser is Mozilla Firefox?

The bug appears to be that FF3 is reporting the flash version incorrectly as 0.0.0 instead of 9.0.115.0
