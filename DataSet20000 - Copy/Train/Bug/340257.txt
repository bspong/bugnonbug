When I log onto http://www.chesslab.com/ and then click on “Two Million Interactive Chess Games Online”, ending up at http://www.chesslab.com/PositionSearch.html
I go there in order to download what are called PGN files—that is, chess games in standard notation. These are text files—you can make and edit them in any word processor—but have the ending *pgn, which triggers chess playing/replaying programs.

So on this site when I find a game I want to download they provide for copying and pasting it to a text editor—except that in Firefox I can’t copy the text. I either get an *.htm file showing the page I started from, or—if I change the ending of the file to be downloaded to .*txt I get what appears to be source code. In any case I simply cannot copy the text right in front of my face.

So, much to my sorrow, to perform this task I have to switch to IE, which does the job without fuss or bother.
