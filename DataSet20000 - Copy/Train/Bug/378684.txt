Firefox and Minefield shred page formatting.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a4pre) Gecko/20070424 Minefield/3.0a4pre
Build Identifier: Starts with Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.3 and continues into Minefield 3.0a4pre

In many websites I visit, pages will lose all their formatting and default to Times New Roman. All tables, frames, etc, will disappear and only text will appear with the graphics in random places. I have to press CTRL+F5 to make it load right. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox/Minefield at one of the example pages (www.wikipedia.org, www.gaiaonline.com, or www.deviantart.com. It happens to far more sites though.) 
2. Navigate the page for a while. 
3. Soon the pages will garble in the ways displayed in example shots. 
Actual Results:  
Please see the attached images. 

Note that these are not the only  sites it happens to; However, they are the most common cases. 



Expected Results:  
Displayed the page correctly. 

I use Windows XP with Service Pack 2.

Here are screen shots of the pages in question.

I have looked at the pages' source code and noticed a proliferation of the use of <div> tags in pages that do not display correctly. 

I chose not to use a Broken Web Site Report due to the fact that it happens on so many sites.

I have been having this problem since Firefox 1.5.0.7.
