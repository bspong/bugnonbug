I am using AutoIt v3 and Password Exporter v1.0.6 to export my passwords. I wrote the following script to automate it. When I run the script, it runs successfully every alternate attempt and crash with a coredump on alternate attempts. 

I have attached a copy of the script and the dump file. The plugin and AutoIt3 need to be installed to simulate this crash.

If I go through these steps manually ( without using the script), then Firefox does not crash.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run the script the first time. Note that the passwords are saved successfully.
2.Run the script the second time. This time the password file is saved successfully but the browser crashes and generates a coredump.
3.Run the script the third time. Note that the passwords are saved successfully!!
Actual Results:  
The browser crashes on all even attempts to run the script

Expected Results:  
The browser never crashes :)

Not crash.
