Update Screenshots to version 19.0.0
Version 18.0.0 exported in Bug 1396060 didn't stick, so here's another try with version 19.0.0.

Changes in 19.0.0:

Changelog: https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-1900

* Remove Photon-related conditionals in tests (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/0b31d58)
* remove browserAction. This changes the add-on to require the Photon page action, with no fallback to a browserAction
  - Removes test for Photon (assumes it is present)
  - Removes bootstrap.js code that deletes the browserAction button
  - Removes webextension code references to browserAction
  - Removes Photon conditionals (i.e., assume it's always Photon)
  - Make 57a1 the minimum version for the webextension/install.rdf. Fixes https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3468 (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/d4c56ae)
* Add setting to control binary or base64 upload. This adds `$SCREENSHOTS_UPLOAD_BINARY=true` to turn the feature on. Fixes https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3481 (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/92b0d53)
* Convert to semantic locale strings for the slides. The numeric locale ids have made reordering complicated (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/3d590fb)
* Avoid form uploads from being truncated. `FormData` was not creating correct request bodies for large images. This changes the code to manually construct the form upload. Fixes https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3472 (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/671b003)
* Put a guard around the exception stack rewriting (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/dbc4750)
* Revert "Remove the full page and save visible buttons from onboarding". This reverts commit 1887c38903ce91199f389a345095d6a0546004ac. (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/33bb5ff)
* Add a new slide to the tour. This slide includes the pageAction interface instead of the old toolbar button. Fixes https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3442 (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/9f072c0) (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/2550449)
* Change slide image to match Photon-style in browser image. Fixes https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3443 (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/dbad266)


Changes from 18.0.0:


* Run all add-on svg files through svgo (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/40b9fe0)
* Fix icon appearance for Photon page action.  See Bug 1395284]. Right now, the icon is too dark, so it doesn't match the appearance of the other Photon page actions. The problem is that the URI passed as the action's iconURL is a `file://` URI.  The Photon theme uses context-fill and context-fill-opacity in SVG in order to style SVG icons correctly, and SVG context painting is not supported for file `bootstrap.js` should pass a `moz-extension://` URI instead, which context painting does support, and which is what the WebExtension browser action toolbar button uses. Additionally, the icon SVG used by the Photon page action needs to be updated with fill-opacity="context-fill-opacity". (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/b246cb9)
* Add logging of unexpected clipboard state (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3430). This logs cases when the passed-in text is empty, or the textarea select doesn't appear to work. Logs are sent to Sentry. Fixes https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3406 (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/10b7c0f)
* Fixed next and prev buttons for rtl (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/5a08464)
* Moved Save/Cancel buttons from right to left for rtl languages (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3412) (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/115d6ed)
* Send image to server in binary (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/9c558ce)
