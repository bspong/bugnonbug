personal toolbar links do not always work, you have to click them several times

I have a few folders in my personal toolbar folder (right above the tabbed
browsing bar), which opens a drop down menu of the links in each folder.  When I
click on a link in that drop down menu, often I am not taken to the desired
site.  The page I am currently on blinks, and the info bar a the bottom says it
is resolving the hostname, but the browser does not go to the site I wanted to
open.  Sometimes it works the first time, sometimes the 2nd time I click on it,
but most of the time, it takes 3 clicks to get the browser to react and go to
the page I want.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.open page in browser
2.click on folder in personal toolbar folder
3.choose a link in the drop down menu that drops from parent folder
4.desired site does not open until 2nd or 3rd click
Actual Results:  
most of the time, nothing until I repeat the steps above several times.

Expected Results:  
it should have taken me to the site the first time I click on the link.
