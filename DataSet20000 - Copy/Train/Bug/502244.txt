Most webpage links result in error messages and require page reload.

Since installing 3.5, clicking on webpage links result in error messages, more often than not.  Sometimes this is corrected by reloading the page with the original links, and sometimes hitting "retry" on the error page will resolve it, but the pages are very slow to react.  In general, all webpages have been very slow to load in the first instance.  Freezing during page loading has been frequent.  The problems were noticeable immediately after upgrading from 3.0 to 3.5.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Click on link within a webpage, or try to load a page from a bookmark or Google search.
2.  If page stalls during loading, wait 30 seconds.  If loading does not improve, reload page.  If link results in error message page, select "retry".  If that does not work, then reload page.  In both cases, these steps were repeated sometimes 4 or 5 times, with or without resolution.
3.  If the actions in #2 do not resolve the problem, then close Firefox 3.5 and restart the browser.
Actual Results:  
Results are stated in the previous steps.

Expected Results:  
Clicking links should result in a webpage loading and showing.
