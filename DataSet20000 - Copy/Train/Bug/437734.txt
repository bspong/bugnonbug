Visit a url that is just an image (images embedded in HTML pages work fine). Drag the image to the desktop. The resulting file is sometimes called "goto.<ext>". It doesn't happen all the time, it does with the URL above, but not <http://www.macupdate.com/images/icons/25230.png>. It's not just JPEGs, <http://www.joelonsoftware.com/i/head.jpg> works fine as well. It's not just the image in the URL above either though, I've seen it a number of times. Saving the image from the Media tab of the Page Info window also always works fine, including for the image above.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a URL that's just an image.
2. Drag the image to the desktop.
3. Observer the name of the resulting file.
Actual Results:  
The file is called "goto.<ext>" (without the quotes).

Expected Results:  
The file has the same name as the image, for example for the URL, the file would be called 384.jp.
