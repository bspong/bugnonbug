Now that JSON bookmark backup has landed, there are two potential bookmark file formats, JSON and HTML. The interface does not correctly handle a user selecting the wrong type of file.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Bookmarks->Organize Bookmarks.
2. Go to Import and Backup->Backup and save a JSON backup somewhere.
3. Modify your bookmarks (e.g. add some new ones or delete some).
4. Go to Import and Backup->Import and choose From File then select the backup saved in step 2.

Actual Results:  
I get a new folder called JavaScript%20Shell%201.4 (I have a bookmark called this that links to a javascript: url) and my changes made in step 3 above are not undone.

Expected Results:  
My bookmarks should be restored to how they were before step 3 above.

A similar effect can be seen in reverse by exporting your bookmarks to HTML then using Restore->Choose File (which expects a JSON file), nothing appears to happen.

I think that "Restore->Choose File" should be removed and Import made to handle either type automatically. You could also combine Export and Backup into one option and allow picking the file type from the standard "Save as type" box in the save dialog.
