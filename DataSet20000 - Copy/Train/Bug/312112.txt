This is not so much a bug as a wish list item. When, for example, changing user
settings or sorting of bookmark siblings, it would greatly enhance the
functionality of Firefox if there were a method to quickly revert to the
previous state. I suppose you could say I should be more careful. I can only
respond that everyone makes mistakes. It would, also, with regard to bookmarks,
be nice to be able to sort the bookmarks within a folder by right clicking on
the folder and sorting by the criterion wanted, and reserve sibling sorting to
right clicking between folders or book marks or both.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I accidently sorted the bookmark bar folders and bookmarks instead of sorting
within the folder over which I right clicked the menu.
2. I have to rectify the mistake by painstakingly moving the bookmarks one by one.
3.

Actual Results:  
The bookmarks sorted properly but couldn't be automatically reverted to the
previous state.

Expected Results:  
Permitted me to revert to the previous state.

It would be nice to be able to step back through some number of changes and
revert them individually or in groups to a previous state.
