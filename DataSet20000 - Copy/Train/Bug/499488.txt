When moving the mouse cursor down a list of bookmarks in a bookmarks toolbar folder, sometimes the highlighted bookmark will jump up the list. After seeing it a couple of times I figured out that if you move the cursor to the space between them, that's when it jumps.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. If you do not have a folder of bookmarks in your bookmark toolbar, do so. Need at least 5 in the list. 6 or more to illustrate it best.
2. Click the folder to open it
3. Move the cursor over the 5th bookmark (or any thereafter)
4. Move the cursor to be vertically dead center between the 5th and 6th bookmark. (Or any bookmarks thereafter, it doesn't have to be 5th and 6th)
Actual Results:  
The highlight will jump up to the bookmark 3 slots above.

Expected Results:  
The highlight is always either the bookmark immediately above or below the cursor position. (No gap in between the bookmarks that causes this jumping around).

Nothing special about the build other than what is revealed in the UA string above. 

Compatible add-ons are Firebug and Tineye.
