Javascript advertisements for "AT&T U-verse TV" are causing my CPU to go to 100% utilization. When I turn off Javascript under OPTIONS/CONTENT, this no longer occurs. The problem is I need Javascript turned on, because some functions on websites I frequent require Javascript. The above advertisement occurs on www.dictionary.com, and other web sites.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.dictionary.com
2. Search for any word.
3. Sometimes the "AT&T U-verse TV" advertisement will show. If not then just refresh the page until it does.
4. When the advertisment shows up, cpu will be at 100%.
Actual Results:  
100% CPU utilization

Expected Results:  
100% CPU ulization

I tried to duplicate this on Internet Explorer, and the same advertisment does not cause the same problem with Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer's CPU usage remains low when the same "AT&T U-verse TV" Javascript advertisment runs.
