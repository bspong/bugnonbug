Cannot configure user profile and copy to default user in Windows XP
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9b5) Gecko/2008032620 Firefox/3.0b5

When I launch Firefox 3 b5 and configure it exactly as we like it and then logoff and copy that profile to the default user profile to ensure that the settings are saved and consistent across our enterprise, the settings don't persist.

Is there an alternative way to do this if it will not be supported in the full release?



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Logoff and log back on as user
2. Customize preferences (and bookmarks)
3. Save settings and copy Windows profile to the default user profile
4. Same result, it launches and asks me the first (default browser) ?


Actual Results:  
See above

Expected Results:  
The same behavior...the profile settings didn't copy with the user's Windows user profile.

I would like to see the settings be non-specific enough to copy successfully with the user's Windows-based profile so that we can ensure that the look and feel and all preferences settings are consistent across our enterprise.
