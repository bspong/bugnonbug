focus lost in URL and search input fields makes browser about unusable
User-Agent:       Opera/9.21 (Windows NT 5.1; U; en)

For a few days now I encounter the following problem:
If I type text in the input field for the URL or the search bar (e.g. about 2 or chars per second) the input field willsoon loose the focus (usually after about 3 to 10 characters) and thus make it impossible to edit any text.
Often enough you end up clicking 5 to 15 times in th field just to enter some more characters before the focus is lost again.

I dont know yet what causes the problem. I have 4 windows with severeal tabs active. Some tabs showing flash or other animations. Don't expect any relation though. I have automatic updates enabled but don't remember if it has updated within the last few days and thus cannot say if the update broke it or not.

But the problem is serious and I consider the browser unusable now.
I checked other applications and browser and only FireFox shows this kind of problem.  


A variant of this is to click once in the URL filed and thus have all the text selected after a few seconds it looses the focus and selection.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. just type a single char about 2-3 times a second usually wihtin the next few seconds it happens.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Can not input/change any text in those fields anymore.
Need to reactivae the control and place the cursor again.

Expected Results:  
Fields should not loose the focus on their own.
