Firefox freezes/becomes non-responsive while browsing. No option to submit error/crash report.

Firefox becomes non-responsive when browsing to common and popular web sites (i.e., Google, Yahoo, Facebook, etc.).  Sometimes the program freezes after the first attempt to browse to a web page (eg, I open the browser, either type a URL into the location box or select one of my bookmarks, and the program freezes).  Other times I can navigate to 2 or 3 pages before the program freezes.  In both, the program needs to be "force quit" via the Task Manager.  Also, the freeze doesn't generate a crash report or an entry in the Error Console.  Oddly, the ONLY web site I can fully access (with out Firefox freezing) is Mozilla.com.  This problem just started today (1/28/09), the program has been working fine up to now.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Navigate to any web site (other than mozilla.com)
3. 
Actual Results:  
Firefox either freezes before it loads the pages, or freezes 2-3 pages later. 

Expected Results:  
Firefox should full browsing to requested web pages.
