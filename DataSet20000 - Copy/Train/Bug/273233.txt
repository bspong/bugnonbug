Inconsistent / hard to access keyboard shortcut for "Save Link As..." in context menus

Load any website.
Right-click on any link.
The context menu that pops up, has the following:

"Save Lin&k As..." (&k meaning the letter 'k' is underlined, signifying a
shortcut key).

This is rather difficult to hit, especially if the mouse is in the right hand,
as this would require either taking right hand off the mouse to press 'k' on
keyboard, or pressing it with the left hand, by moving it off the normal typing
position.

The reason bug report says "inconsistent" is because in majority of
applications, on the "File" menu, the "Save As..." shortcut is triggered by the
'a' hotkey, such as Alt-F-A in order to "File->Save As...". Firefox itself uses
the same hotkey for "Save As..." in the "File" menu.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. open www.mozilla.org
2. right-click any link
3. notice "Save lin&k As..." displayed

Actual Results:  
To save the link, I had to take my right hand off the mouse and press the 'k' key.
This was very difficult and wasted 0.5seconds of my time


Expected Results:  
I wanted to see the context menu like this:

"Save link &As..."
which would require hitting 'a' key in order to "save as".
Since my other hand is already positioned on the left side of the keyboard,
right-clicking a link and pressing 'a' to save it is easy.

I propose changing the default keyboard hotkey for "Save Link As..."

from 'k' (currently)

to 'a'.

The menu would look like this:
"Save Link &As..."
where &A means underlined letter.
