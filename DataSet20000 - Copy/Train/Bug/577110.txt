Local Home Page missing from Location bar

I have a local HTML page which I use as my home page for Fox.

If I add a single home page to the tab list, that first Home page will not have a location [it remains blank].   Subsequent tabs added have the same defect.

However, if I manually select an earlier tab, or if I delete one of the tabs, the URL shows up on all the tabs.

This occurs if I delete all pages, too, and bring on the first tab as my home page, adding additional tabs thereafter.

For a brief, split second, it appears as if the the [or some] URL is painted into the Location bar, but then is overwritten as blank.

This behavior does not occur with non-local URLs.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0.   at some point, back in time, set home page to a local HTML page
1.   Open a new tab [which is defaulting to my local HTML home page].  The location bar is blank to that appended tab
2.   Open additional tabs, which default to the local home page.  These, too, have blanks in the location bar
3.   Move to any tab, other than the one displayed, or delete one, and the location bars show the proper URL for the local home page
Actual Results:  
A blank in the URL/location bar

Expected Results:  
A non blank, with the URL showing such as this:
   file:///C:/.../.../_local_home.htm
