User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:13.0) Gecko/20120419 Firefox/13.0a2
Build ID: 20120419042011

Steps to reproduce:

Converts characters typed in an outlook email to incorrect characters when email is sent out.
Example phrase:   Wasn't sent OK     is sent as Wasnâ€™t sentÂ  OKÂ Â Â    (where Â was a space bar key).  This happens on newly created emails and forwarded from others.  In previous updates, it was intermittent. NOW IT IS SOLID FAILURE


Actual results:

Types ok on screen.  In the sent file has wrong characters, the receiver gets wrong characters, view the same sent email in an online mailbox - characters are wring BUT different than what outlook shows they as (the single quote is now a question mark, where in outlook is is French a, euro symbol and a trademark symbol.  Had this problem months ago, many updates to Aurora, has come back in last 2 updates. Now running 13.0a2 (2012-04-19), Windows 7, Outlook 2010. Seems ok using 13.0a2 (2012-03-19)


Expected results:

Correct encoding of characters. - seems to be isolated to the punctuation.  SOLID BUG
