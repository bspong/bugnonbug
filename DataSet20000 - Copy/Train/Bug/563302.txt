Failing to DNS prefetch Search engine results when using a proxy server i.e. Squid.

Using the dig command in windows, i can see what results get cached. When searching for an item in google, the search results websites domain names doesn't get sent through the proxy/DNS server, Therefore the results don't get prefetched. It works however when you deselect No proxy. It can't be the proxy since google chrome has no issues doing this with a proxy enabled. I've tested this in google and Yahoo7, the problem both persists.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Search an item in google with a proxy server selected.
2.Check DNS server/cache log for search result queries.
Actual Results:  
Fails to DNS prefetch on search engines.

Expected Results:  
Analyzed each search result's domain name, and sent a DNS query of each url to a DNS server, which can there be cached by the OS or the DNS server/cache, WHILE being able to use a proxy server of your choice.

It's not a major problem, it's just google chrome is alot more snappier having the DNS names already preteched. although the problem DOESN'T appear when NO proxy server is selected.
