scripts hang when multiple cursor/page down keys are queued
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:9.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/9.0
Build ID: 20111212185108

Steps to reproduce:

Scripts cause significant slowdown in processing cursor/page down keys
[2-5 seconds delay before the first key is handled, 1+ second for the next keys].
If too many [10+] cursor/page down keys are queued the scripts hang Firefox.
After 30-60 seconds with no cursor/page down key the initial delay is in effect again.

3) select any window and press Page Down or Cursor Down
    [nothing happens for several seconds]

Actual results:

Firefox Hangs


Expected results:

Any script that delays processing of Cursor/Page Down keys by more than 5 seconds should be terminated and an alert should be displayed. If scripts from the same site are terminated 3 times then all scripts from that site should be disabled.
