Yahoo Mail+ - Firefox looses variable associations for javascript:NktLst('x');
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11

In any outgoing mail operation where you are presented with a To: field, clicking the To: correctly brings up the first page of Yahoo Mail's address book.  Sliding the mouse over the horizontal page selection text menu items (i.e. the delimiters for the alpha characters on each page) the status bar shows the correct javascript function call.  If, for example, page 1 of the address book contains names beginning with a-ci, and page 2 contains names from cj-le, and page 3 contains names from li-pi, then rolling over the first 3 menu items yields Javascript:BktLst('1'); ... javascript:BktLst('2');.... javascript:BkLst('3');... respectively in the status bar at the bottom of the address book pop-up window.  Left clicking on the item does nothing.  

This function worked correctly this morning and nothing else has changed.  I rebooted the PC and the probelm was still ther.  I then uninstalled Firefox and reinstalled it and the problem is still here.  Internet Explorer works correctly.

So, mu conclusion is that somehow the pointer association of the bariable in the javascript call function is lost.  Once lost, it is never recovered.

The only thing that I did in Yahoo mail today between when Firefos was handling the javascript correctly and when it wasn't was to add members from my email ist to a group.  The new group was never created, and the next time I entered Yahoo mail, I noticed the problem I am reporting.
