File API does not read in appended data
Created attachment 8440091
filechunk.htm

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:30.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/30.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140605174243

Steps to reproduce:

I first spotted this issue on Firefox 30.0 on Windows but just reproduced it using Nightly 33.0a1 (2014-06-13) on Linux 64-bit.

I was looking to use the File API (http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/FileAPI/) to ultimately implement something like UNIX "tail" in Javascript to keep reading in portions of a file as data is appended to it. The attachment is simple code that illustrates the base issue I experienced.

To reproduce:

1) Outside the browser, first create a text file "short.txt" that contains just the word "hello".
2) Open the attachment "filechunk.htm" in Firefox.
3) Click the Browse button and select the file "short.txt" file and click Open.
4) Click the "Read bytes: 1-5" button and confirm you see the "hello" text.
5) Outside the browser, append the word "goodbye" to the file (on Linux: "echo goodbye >> short.txt")
6) Click the "Read bytes: 6-15" button.


Actual results:

The appended text "goodbye" is NOT visible in the browser.


Expected results:

I would have expected the "goodbye" text to appear. This *is* what happens when I repeat the same steps in Google Chrome 35.0.1916.153m, for instance.
