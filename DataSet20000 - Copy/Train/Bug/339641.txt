I use a wireless connection to connect to the internet. Unfortuneatly I am further away than I would like and the connection will drop out some times (far to often for my liking).  If I have page loading when this happen (like about 30 times today) and it drops out and the page has not finisheding loaded yet.  There is normaly enough text to start reading the page but then the connection drops out and the "problem Loading Page" comes up and I can't get back to what I was reading! Often it is only the images that have no loaded.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Be stupid and install a wireless card
2.Be even stupider and move you computer too far from the router
3.Load pages till the connection drops out
4.Be annoyed about the "problem loading page" comeing up on a page that had enough to read.

Actual Results:  
I was very annoyed

Expected Results:  
The partly loaded page should stay loaded so I can read it.
