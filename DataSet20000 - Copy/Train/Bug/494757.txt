At work I have a dual-headed monitor setup where the screens are at diffent heights. In my case the left monitor is lowered by aprox. one-third of the monitor-height. In windows my monitor properties are adjusted to this situation.

When I have a webpage with a dropdown menu on my left monitor, it will 'pop' upwards beyond my screenborder; there is no way to click on the items that are heighest in the dropdown-list.

I suspect that firefox treats this screen as if the top-border is at the height of my 'heighest' monitor.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create horizontal dual-head monitor setup where the screens are leveled at different heights.
2. Open a webpage with a large dropdown-list on the 'lower' monitor
3. Open dropdown
Actual Results:  
Dropdown pops upwards beyond the screen-border.

Expected Results:  
Dropdown should recognize screen-edge and pop according to this.

I made a screenshot that shows this problem and I will try to supply this.
