[Moz] Make Export / Import specific to the managed folder

In the Bookmark Manager I rearranged the folders to see if an export would keep
the structure of my arrangement.  It did not.  The result was interesting
though.  It keeps my Personal toolbar folder always at the top. The rest of the
format is close to my arranged format.  Also, the more times that you move your
Personal Toolbar folder the more copies it makes to the bookmark.html file.

I say close because the horizonal rule does not appear in the correct places.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Bookmark Manager, Bookmarks -> Manage Bookmarks...
2.Move folders around in any order than what they were origionally.
3.Export bookmarks, File -> Export
4.Save and Open.
5.Now go back to one and repeat this process for more mixed up results. 

Actual Results:  
Since there is no restore default button (why would you?) the results are really
mixed up.  I now have my Personal Toolbar folder showing up 4 times, then the
Mozilla Project folder, a line, my Personal Toolbar folder again, followed my my
Imported IE Favorites.

Expected Results:  
In Bookmark manager, this is the order that I had my folders.  Personal Toolbar
folder, line, Mozilla Project, line,  Imported IE Favorites, line.
