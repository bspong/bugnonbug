Too many different ID's
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050810 Firefox/1.0+

Firefox uses an ungodly number of different ID's in referencing menu and context
menu items. It uses a vast array for essentially the same fuunction. This has to
be inefficient. I suspect it unduly burdens some computers and slows Firefox down.

I came across this issue as I was skinning the various menu items for my
SphereGnome series of themes. See below, for example, the number of different
ID's used for the Copy function. Of course, some really are different, and need
different ID's. However, when you go out across all of them, you see lots of
duplicates. Obvious culprits are separate ID's for bookmarks and DomI, but there
are others (extension window, e.g.).

I know that duplicate ID's are frequently not necessary because when I use a
particular ID, sometimes I will see a number of menuitems appropriately skinned.

This is an issue for FF 2.0, I think. 

Reproducible: Always
