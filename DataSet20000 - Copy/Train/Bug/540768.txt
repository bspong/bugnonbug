When using Google to search for "Naomi van As" (a Dutch field hockey player) the search results was pointing to a web-page (cannot recall which) which would open the a/m URL at "www1.be-safe-withus.in" opening a pop-up message (cannot recall detail) for installation of so-called security software.The result looked like a crash of Mozilla FireFox but executable software was being prepared for installation from the a/m URL through a dialog window.
Restarting FireFox would restart the installation attempt of the malicious software from a/m URL. By examining the sessionstore.js file the a/m URL could be identified as part of the problem. By deleting sessionstore.js FireFox is running normally again.
N.B. POPUP blocking is active and wil block other potential threats.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
If sessionstore.js is not deleted installation attempts will be made from a/m URL  every time.
Actual Results:  
FireFox is starting normally again w/o presence of sessionstore.js file containing the a/m malicious URL.

Expected Results:  
Block POPUPs and don't crash the session.

The current security software on internet gateway with last updates (ClamAV and Kaspersky AV) is not able to identify this potential threat yet.
Still scanning the local system with latest updates in Spyware Terminator and Spybot Search&Destroy.
