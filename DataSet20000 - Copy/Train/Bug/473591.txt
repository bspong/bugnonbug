Search bar does not work.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120121 Firefox/3.0.5 Ubiquity/0.1.4

The search bar simply does not work. If I type something into it, and hit "return" then I get the following error in the error console:
Error: textBox._prefBranch is undefined
Source File: chrome://browser/content/search/search.xml
Line: 435

If I click the magnifying glass, I get this error:
Error: textBox._formHistSvc is undefined
Source File: chrome://browser/content/search/search.xml
Line: 442

I've tried disabling all my add-ons, and even removed Firefox (and the file in ~/Library/Preferences) from my machine and reinstalled it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up Firefox
2. Try to use the search box
3.
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens (not in the browser anyway). I do not get any "thinking" from the browser, and it doesn't go to a new website in accordance with the search. All that changes is the new entries into the error console.

Expected Results:  
It should have brought up a page with search results.

I have a very vanilla version of Firefox installed (at this point only two add-ons are installed, both of which are disabled), and the bug even crops up when running in "safe mode."
