even with proper settings-opening new tab with scroll wheel ALWAYS switches to newly opened tab

Even with my settings 'When I open a link with a new tab, switch to it immediately' UNCHECKED, I am still diverted to the new tab when I use my scroll wheel to open said tab. Only when I right-click menu open 'new tab' will this diversion not happen. In previous versions, I have not had this problem, but I cannot remember exactly when this started to happen; most recently is what I suspect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox.
2.UNCHECK tab settings-"When I open a link with a new tab, switch to it immediately" so that it will not switch to the new tab when opening link.
3.Attempt to open new tab on any link using wheel-scroll-clicker.

Actual Results:  
Tab focus is diverted immediately to newly opened tab EVERY time.

Expected Results:  
I expected to stay on the 'home' or origin page and not be switched to newly opened tab.

When using right click menu option to open new tab, it does give the expected result, but only when using this option.

I'm going to classify this as NORMAL because it is not an 'easy' workaround. I rather rely on this feature quite heavily.
