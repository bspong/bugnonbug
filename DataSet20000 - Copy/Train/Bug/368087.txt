Many links (regardless of .ext) will bring up a "Save As" dialog

Since installing Firefox 2 I've been getting "Save As" dialogs popping up when i click pretty much any link. It's an intermittent problem so it's really hard to debug or be more specific. 

Basically, every once in a while, about twice an hour, I'll click on a link on the web somewhere and instead of the page coming up it brings up a "Save as" dialog. And yes Im sure they aren't all downloadable files or something of the sort. These are just standard links to other pages on pages I've built or just out there on the web (have see this behavior on Oracle.com).

At first I thought it was just a local issue, my machine my websites... since i tend to use .psp exts i figured it was just confused. But I've seen this behavior on other machines and on other sites with pretty much any ext (.htm, .html. shtml etc...)... 

Thanks

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
hard to say cause it's intermittent... just surf around and see if it happens i guess... i know that sucks i'm sorry... just that kinda bug
Actual Results:  
usually when this happens, I just hit cancel on the Save As dialog and click the link again... then it goes, but usually the next link i click (first click on new page) will do the same. Seems to happen is spurts... hitting cancle on the dialog always works, but the next click will do the same and maybe the next... like 3 - 5 in a row, then not for a while again
