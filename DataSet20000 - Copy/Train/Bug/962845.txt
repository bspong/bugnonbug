CPU pegged at 100%, deeply nested imgLoader::SupportImageWithMimeType

Sample of Firefox.txt

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20131205075310

Steps to reproduce:

Start Firefox with my very large saved session (probably a hundred or so open tabs.)

Wait a few minutes.

CPU (one of the cores of my machine) pegs at 100% FOREVER.

Firefox becomes hugely unresponsive.

Memory doesn't seem to be a problem: FF using less than 1gb on a 16gb machine with 6gb free as reported by the OS.

Go back to using Safari, again.  Sigh.

Firefox 26.0, MacOS 10.6.8.



Actual results:

It takes over a second to echo each character I am typing in this text box.
Laptop fan runs continuously.

MacOS "Activity Monitor" application backtrace sample
shows 120+ deep nested calls to imgLoader::SupportImageWithMimeType

mac_plugin_interposing_child_OnShowCursor often might be implicated somehow

Beats me.

Normal complement of unthreatening extensions (Adblock, Cookie Montster, Stylish, DOM Inspector, etc.)

Normal-ish set of MacOS plugins (Flash crapware; Adobe PDF 11.0.6; a couple others.)

Basically, this shouldn't be happening.  But is happening every time for me.


Expected results:

Idle CPU.  Zero Firefox CPU use when idle.
