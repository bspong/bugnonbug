When in private browsing mode, make the Firefox button purple
As an ambient and peripheral cue that the user is in private browsing mode, we should adjust the color of the Firefox button on Windows 7 and Vista from orange to purple.  (purple is used on the masquerade mask in the content area message, and doesn't have any other semantic meaning in the product other than privacy).

Additionally we should alter the text of the button to "Firefox (Private)"

Any other modifications to the theme (like darkening the toolbars) will be done in addition to this change, but this is the minimum change for indicating the state of the browser.

A specific non-goal of this bug is over the shoulder screen privacy.  We are assuming that if you are using private browsing mode, you are probably not in a situation where other people can view your computer monitor (since the contents of content area are being shown just as much as the firefox button).

We are however, very interested in giving users a reminder that Firefox is not storing any information about their activities on the Web, and we are interested in significantly reducing the number of mode errors that users are currently experiencing (staying in Firefox for long periods of time because they forget to exit).

(listing this under content area notifications, which isn't entirely accurate since it persists after we show about:privatebrowsing, but I didn't really have any other place to put it)
