Browser hangs during session restore (in BasicLayerManager code?)
I loaded up Firefox after earlier closing it successfully, with many tabs in the session (about 30).

Instead of loading all my tabs as expected, Firefox shows all the tabs along the top but hangs with 100% CPU usage when trying to load them.

The interface is entirely unresponsive, including min/max/close buttons. It is apparently not handling Windows messages as right-clicking on it in the taskbar and choosing Close immediately brings up the dialog saying that the app is unresponsive.

No data appears to be lost, per-se; if I close Firefox this way and re-open it, I get the "this is embarrassing" session restore prompt with all tabs listed as expected.

This problem appears to be new, only occurring to me in the last few days. Firefox reports itself as being version 8.00.0000.4309, which I received on the 22nd of October. I have just now updated to 8.00.0000.4316 which exhibits the same problem.

Process Explorer suggests that it is just Firefox's main thread that is using all the CPU, and reports variations on the following call-stacks (presumably missing lots of info or even just incorrect due to lack of debugging information):

I expect they are a bit bogus but both seem to be related to layout code so it is probably not a coincidence.
