Steps to reproduce:

I uploaded an rtf and pdf file to my website. I download them with the following encodings:

(
    [0] => Cache-Control: max-age=0
    [1] => Content-Type: application/octet-stream
    [2] => Content-Disposition: attachment; filename*=UTF-8''WebMethod_ICMCoreService_ExecuteSubmitContent.rtf

    [4] => Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary

    [1] => Content-Type: application/octet-stream
    [2] => Content-Disposition: attachment; filename*=UTF-8''test.pdf
    [3] => Content-Location: Document1.pdf
    [4] => Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary

    [7] => Pragma: public
    [8] => Connection: close
)

[14-Feb-2012 21:15:43] test.pdf


Actual results:

While the pdf presents on MacOSX Lion FF version 10.0.1 a dialog to save or cancel, for the rtf I see a dialog with option to open with.


Expected results:

Since I specify attachment I would expect also for the rtf to only support save or cancel but not the open option, on MS Windows FF I see for both files to option to open with, then it would be great to have to open with on all plattforms the same.
