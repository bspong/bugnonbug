Missing Characters when displaying PDF in FireFox (FF) PDF Viewer
Created attachment 777873
This screen shot shows the missing letter "b".

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:22.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/22.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130618035212

Steps to reproduce:

We use a third party tool for our PDF generation (ABCpdf). Our PDFs render correctly (as viewed in the browser) for all browsers, except FF.
We have seen this issue using the following system specs...
System 1:
-Win7 Ultimate, 64Bit
-FF 22.0
-Adobe Acrobat plug-in (10.1.7.27)

System 2:
Win7 Pro, 32Bit
FF 22.0
Funnelcake July 2012
Mosilla14-1.0
Adobe Acrobat plug-in (10.1.1.33)

A fix that was found to work, BUT ONLY FOR SYSTEM 1, was to...
1. Disable Adobe Acrobat plug-in
2. Restart FF
3. Open the PDF in FF, generated correctly
4. Enable the Adobe plug-in
5. Restart FF
6. Open the PDF in FF, generated correctly

Actual results:

All letter "b" were missing from the document when using the FF in-app PDF viewer.  If I click "download", then open the document in Adobe Acrobat, it looks as expected.  In addition, some users have reported that negative signs "-" were displaying as squares.  If the user highlights the text with the missing character(s), and sets focus outside of FF, the missing characters show up in the highlight text.  Then, the characters disappear when focus is set back to FF.  Users are in the habit of using the ptint functionality within the FF PDF viewer.  When they use this (instead of downloading and then printing), the characters are missing in the printed copy.


Expected results:

The viewer should have displayed a PDF containing all expected characters.
