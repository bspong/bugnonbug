Rendering sometimes stops after javascript alert()

We are using javascript alert() to inform users of errors in forms. Pages are created using jsp and the alert function call is dynamically inserted into the page after validation. When such a page is shown to the user the page is rendered up to the alert() call. An error prompt is shown which the user confirms. The rest of the page is then rendered. This works most of the time. But sometimes the part of the page after the alert() is not rendered at all, it becomes blank.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View a page with a javascript alert() call.
2. Confirm alert box.
Actual Results:  
Sometimes the page is incomplete. The part after the alert call is empty.

Expected Results:  
The complete page should always be visible after confirming the alert box.

As stated the problem does not always occur. I have yet to find the pattern. As this is a site with a lot of users using different browsers I can safely say that the problem never occurs with Firefox 2 or Internet Explorer. The problem is only seen with customers using Firefox 3.0 and Firefox 3.5.

Setting the configuration parameter "content.interrupt.parsing" to false fixes the problem. This is not a feasible solution for our customers though.
