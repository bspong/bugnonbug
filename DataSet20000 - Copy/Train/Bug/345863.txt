Add-ons dialog high contrast
Test done on IBM T42 ThinkPad, with Screen Resolution 1024x768 pixels using High Contrast #2 large (green text on black background). Bon Echo Nightly Build 20070724.

Description:  
In Add-ons dialog, the "Options" button is grayed out in normal mode, but there is no visual indication that it is grayed out in high contrast #2 mode.   It is okay in other high contrast modes... the "grayed out" option is displayed with green text, so it is visible in other modes.  High contrast #2 mode uses green text normally, so the green text in the grayed out button looks the same as the green text in the normal buttons.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set High contrast #2 mode (in Windows Control Panel, Accessibility Options, Display page)
2. Open Add-ons dialog in Firefox (Tools, Add-ons)  (make sure at least one extension is installed, with the options button grayed out...for example Dom Inspector, or Talkback.
3. Observe the three buttons (in Talkback, for example).  The Options button should be "grayed out", while the other two buttons (Disable and Uninstall) should be active.  All buttons look the same visually (black background, green text).

Expected Result:
The "grayed out" button should be visually different from the active buttons.  In other high contrast modes, the grayed out button has green text, while the other buttons have another colored text.  In this case, since "high contrast #2" mode uses green text by default, all buttons look the same, so you cannot distinguish between active and inactive buttons.
