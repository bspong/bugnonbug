If i plug the laptop into my lcd tv via VGA, using the tv remote will cause a new firefox window to open,not immediately though. Firefox will then open a new window randomly even if the remote is not being used & the laptop is unplugged from the tv. My laptop does not have an infrared port. I have reinstalled firefox and the problem persists.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.plug laptop into lcd tv via VGA
2.watch film and use tv remote until firefox opens new window
3.unplug laptop from tv and do not use remote
4.watch as firefox opens a new window at random intervals

Actual Results:  
Firefox opens new windows at random intervals

Expected Results:  
Not opened new windows

It happened once before and plagued me for weeks as I tried everything to stop it, I didn't realise how it started. It then randomly stopped happening. I plugged my laptop into my tv to watch a program and it has started all over again....and no I haven't been onto some dodgy websites. I ran anti spyware, malware programs to no avail.
