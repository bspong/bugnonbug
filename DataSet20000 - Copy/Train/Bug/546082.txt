The "Software Update" Pop-up has wrong URL for "Details", need changelog not homepage
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.2pre) Gecko/20100212 Namoroka/3.6.2pre

I'm running 'Nightly' ( http://nightly.mozilla.org/ ) and I get a Pop-up titled "Software Update" more often than a 'Release' version.

The Message that appears in the Pop-up (this time) says:

A security and stability update for Namoroka has been 
downloaded and is ready to be installed:
Update:   Namoroka.3.6.2pre                    _Details_
The update will be installed the next time ...


The word "Detail" is a clickable link but it has the wrong URL.

It takes us to this URL http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/ for the "Details" but there is no "changelog" (or "Details") on that particular page nor is there a direct link to one.

The only "Detail" the "homepage" tells me is what software program (and it's website) that I am running; I could get that info from the [Help][About] Pop-up.

Even this URL tells me more: http://isthetreegreen.com/ .


How can we choose between the "Restart Later" or "Restart Namoroka" Buttons without the "Details" ?


The Fix would be:
The "Details" URL should take us _directly_ to the "Details" - tell us what changed since the last update. 

Use the "changelog" for "Nightly" Builds (or URL http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-1.9.2/ ) and use a "Whats New" Page for "Releases" (perhaps http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.6/releasenotes/ ).

Thanks,
Rob



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Wait for Update.
2. Click on "Details".
3. Now find the correct URL to click on page http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/ (easy huh).
4. Go one third of the way down the page and again click on the correct link.


Expected Results:  
Click on "Details" and get the details on what changed recently.
