This "bug" is not to enable/disable "identity information" checking (separate issue), but to enable/disable the associated pop-up.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on the address bar's URL icon.
2. "identity information" pop-up message appears.
3. The associated "toolbar" message drags along with the URL when dragging the the URL to the Bookmarks Toolbar, interfering with dropping the URL.
Actual Results:  
URL sometimes does not get dropped into a Bookmarks Toolbar folder.

Expected Results:  
Toolbar message should disappear on dragging.

I understand the toolbar message dragging issue may be resolved in FF 3.1, but the "identity information" checking option, new to the recent versions of FF should be just that, "optional". Further, it must be a simple matter of providing the option of being able to enable/disable the pop-up, and/or the check all together.

This "bug" has nothing to do with "identity information" checking functionality or accuracy, which is a separate issue. This only has to do with turning the function on/off and its associated display mechanisms.
