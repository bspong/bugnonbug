Download Manager uses API function CopyFile to replace existing files. Better use ReplaceFile to preserve security settings of the already existing file.

If you download a file you will be warned if the file already exists. If you decide to do so the file will be replaced. It seems that the file is overwritten by calling CopyFile(x ,y , FALSE).

The problem is that the new file does not inherit the security descriptor that is already applied to the existing file. Better use the API function ReplaceFile in this scenario since it will preserve all NTFS settings of the old file.

Example for IIS directories:

There is a file special.htm that is located in the inetpub directory. This file has special NTFS settings applied.

If you overwrite this file with the firefox download manager the special NTFS settings are lost which can lead to security compromise if this is not noticed.

By using the ReplaceFile function these settings would have been preserved.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. apply special NTFS settings to local file
2. download file with same name
3. choose to overwrite existing file

Actual Results:  
NTFS settings have changed to default values that have been inherited from the directory. Old NTFS settings are lost.

Expected Results:  
NTFS settings of the old file should be preserved
