Tools- options-content.  under Load images automatically if you press exceptions and enter a web site it will save it on list of allow or block but will NOT act according to the list. example: If I dont want youtube.com to load images and I put it on block list- images STILL show up when I go to the website. Same for if load images automatically is clicked off and I put in exceptions ALLOW for youtube.com to load images- it doed not load any images from any website.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.options-toold-content
2.put web site on exceptions list of load images automatically-save to block
3.try to go to teh web site that you put on block list
Actual Results:  
The web sites on block list will still load images automatically and if you have load images automatically clicked off and you have on teh exceptions allow list websites listed they will NOT load images

Expected Results:  
I thought that if I blocked yoputube.com from loading images then it will not load the images but it did

teh sofware should have NOT laoded images for the web sites on the block list
