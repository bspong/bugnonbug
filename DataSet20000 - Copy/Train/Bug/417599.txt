Seems that from within the igoogle portal, if I mess with the zoom function it causes the page to constantly refresh guestimated rate seems to be about 2-3 times a second. setting zoom back to normal (Ctrl + 0) doesn't change this.
Refreshing (f5) the page manually seems to stop the endless refresh.
CPU Usage jumps up to 38% for firefox.exe until the page is manually refreshed

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a personalized igoogle page http://www.google.com/ig?hl=en
2. Zoom in (Ctrl+Scroll Down) (Ctrl++) or View -> Zoom -> Zoom in.
3. Zoom in (Ctrl+Scroll Up) (Ctrl+-) or View -> Zoom -> Zoom Out.

Actual Results:  
Page zooms but some text on the page seems to jump up and down on the screen. Status bar flashes "Read www.google.com" and "Stopped" over and over again.
CPU usage jumps to 38% until the page is manually refreshed.

Expected Results:  
Should redisplay without polling google and refreshing the page in a loop.

So far has only happened on the igoogle page.
