Browser windows becomes invisible but are still there, at least in Firefox mind

Sometimes, maybe a few times a week, my Firfox windows becomes "invisible".

Typically this happens when Firefox has been in the background. When I then
activate FF just the menu bar appears. Intuitively I reckon I closed all my FF
windows last time FF was activated but when I try to create a new browser window
nothing happens.

I then reach for the window menu and realize that FF lists several windows, with
titles, in the window menu (as wells as one untitled widnow, the window I just
created).

There is no way I can get to these windows. Hiding all other applications just
leveas me with a blank desktop. Using Exposé they don't appear. Only workaround
is to quit FF.

This has happened with FF for several versions version, I believe 0.7, 0.8, 0.9,
and 1.0.

One factor might be that I use a dual monitor setup (most of the time)..
