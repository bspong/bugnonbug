Disappearing bookmarks - possible clues

I notice that some users have reported the symptom of disappearing bookmarks. I have some information that I have not found in earlier reports, that may give a clue as to the cause.

The symptom, as I experienced it, was that some bookmarks in some bookmark folders just disappeared. This seemed to happen around the time that I updated an add-on.

My add-on list is:
Java Console 6.0.15
Java Quick Starter 1.0
McAfee Site Advisor 3.0
StumbleUpon 3.64
MS .NET Framework Assistant 1.2.1

It is the last of these (MS .NET Framework Assistant 1.2.1) which was updated right before bookmarks disappeared.

In addition, I noticed the following behavior, described in "Steps to Reproduce":

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Retrieve backup bookmarks file (because paranoid computing is safe computing!)
2. Click on a link that was deleted. The page loads.
3. Bookmark the page with the menu command, and write the bookmark, NOT to the subfolder where it was, but to the Bookmarks menu.
4. Try to move the bookmark from the Bookmarks menu to the created subfolder by click-and-drag.
Actual Results:  
When the mouse button is released, the bookmark disappears, even though the subfolder is still open, and is still visible!

Expected Results:  
I should see the bookmark drop into the folder I selected.

But, when I mouse to the Bookmarks menu (which drops down the Bookmarks menu, shows the subfolders that I created, but does NOT show the contents of the subfolders themselves), and click on the folder, the bookmark reappears.
