documentation of known issues for firefox 3.5 linux releases fails to mention known critical bug that these versions hang on startup waiting on a futex when libsafe ( and possibly other libraries ) are preloaded.
note that this is a serious documentation flaw, since it took me a lot of effort to figure out why the new version hung on startup, and then to search bug reports to get a hint of what might be causing the problem, and then to test by removing libsafe from my preloads.
note that not only must it be removed from LD_PRELOAD, but also from /etc/ld.so.preload.
a simple statement in the release notes warning users about this would have saved me a bunch of trouble.
as an aside on the actual problem, there appear to have been multiple bugs reporting variations, all of which were marked as duplicates of some other bug, which has lots of comments debating it and how or whether to fix it.
that bug is serious, and appears to be due to a basic design flaw.

Reproducible: Always
