Cannot delete history of about a million entries -- inefficiency causes operation to timeout

I cannot delete my history (accumulated over 6 months) by doing select-all and hitting delete. I tried doing this because recently all my new pageloads have been making 1-2 of my 4 CPUs spike to 100% utilization. There's some inefficient code somewhere which is causing:

1- The operation to take 1-3 minutes and then timeout, resulting in no progress (I think) with a popup window saying a script is taking too long.
2- Maximum disk write speed occur during this entire time, but no reads.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get a really big history (6 months of stuff if you surf the net often)
2. Select-all, hit delete

Actual Results:  
Operation timeout (see description).

Expected Results:  
Successful deletion within 10 seconds, or at least decent visible progress. Total disk writing should not have been on order of many hundreds of megabytes.

I have 2GB of RAM and a 2.66GHz 4-core.
