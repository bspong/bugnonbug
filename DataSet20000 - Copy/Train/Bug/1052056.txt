After Firefox 31 upgrade on Win xp, tabs won't open
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:30.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/30.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140605174243

Steps to reproduce:

Upgrade to Firefox 31.0. Never had any problems upgrading Firefox. I have Windows xp and "AVG do not track" extension. When opening a new tab in Firefox 30 and earlier all I had to do was click the scroll button on a link in the open browser and a new tab would open for that link; very handy when comparing products or details of items. After upgrading to Fx 31 from 30, clicking the scroll button works the same as left click button... opens new link in same tab. I could not open new tabs at all. 
I restored the whole OS to an earlier image using my imaging sw and will not upgrade to Firefox 31 until resolved. Firefox Options does not have settings for browser tabs use as IE.


Actual results:

1. After upgrading to Fx 31 from 30, clicking the scroll button works the same as left click button... opens new link in same tab. I could not open new tabs at all. 
2. And some graphics would not load; like the placeholders were missing.
3. Also, shift+left click on a link would not open a new browser... instead works the same as left click button... opens new link in same tab.


Expected results:

1. When opening a new tab in Firefox 30 and earlier all I had to do was click the scroll button on a link in the open browser and a new tab would open for that link; very handy when comparing products or details of items.
3. Also, shift+left click on a link should have opened a new browser.
