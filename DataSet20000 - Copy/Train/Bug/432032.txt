Navigating to any page does not change address bar or navigation buttons.

When I navigate to a page any page the address bar stays blank or keeps the same URL that I typed into it. While launching Firefox it does not go to the home page and when clicking links or typing a new address nothing gets added to the history as a result the navigation buttons do not work. Also the page says it is constantly loading.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox.
2. Navigate to any page and click links change address.
3.
Actual Results:  
No browsing history, the navigation buttons do not change the text on the address bar does not change.

Expected Results:  
When starting it should go to the homepage. While running after typing a new address new entry should have been added to the browsing history and as such the navigation buttons (back button) should have been activated letting you go back. The URL in the address bar should have of changed as well.

I am using the default theme and have the web developer toolbar. The address and navigation worked before I tried to launch Firefox after playing a game(Falcon 4 : AF) and I got this.
