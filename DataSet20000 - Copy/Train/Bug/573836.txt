Worked fine with my previous version as of yesterday. Uninstalled Firefox 3.6.3 to install new 3.6.4 today. Now buttons on Facebook (LIKE, HIDE, etc) do not work. The animation works so if I click the button it shows it being depressed, but no actions take place. No errors in status bar, just stays reading DONE. I have updated JAVA plugin to the latest version (6.20) today to see if that was the cause. However, it still does not work with 6.20 installed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to Facebook.com account
2. Go to a fan page or anything that has the LIKE button, click it wont work
3. Go to your HOME page and try to hide any content. Click HIDE button and it fades the content but wont complete the HIDE process.


Expected Results:  
After clicking LIKE on a fan page you should have the LIKE button changed to text confirming you like it. If you click HIDE the content should shrink and you will get a message asking if you'd like to hide all of that type, or cancel.
