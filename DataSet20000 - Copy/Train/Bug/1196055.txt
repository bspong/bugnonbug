Delete favicons from places.sqlite and places.sqlite-wal when deleting history and limit site count
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:40.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/40.0
Build ID: 20150807085045

Steps to reproduce:

Places.sqlite and places.sqlite-wal both contain URLs for every site you visit that has a favicon. Deleting history does not delete the favicon entries keyed by the URL of the sites you visit.

Firefox Settings:
Privacy:
    Clear history when Firefox closes [checked]
        Browsing & Download History  [checked]
        Active Logins                          [checked]
        Form & Search History            [checked]
        Offline Website Data               [checked]
        Site Preferences                     [checked]
        Saved Passwords                   [not checked]


Actual results:

After closing Firefox and examining places.sqlite and places.sqlite-wal, URLs remain for sites I have visited on that session and previous sessions.


Expected results:

ALL entries in the places database that contain URLs should be deleted when Firefox is closed.

There should be a checkbox in the "Settings for Clearing History" dialog to delete favicons and any other object that is stored in any Firefox database keyed by the URL of sites you visit.
