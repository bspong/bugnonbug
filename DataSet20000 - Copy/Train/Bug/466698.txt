When you delete a URL from the address bar: it deletes the first one and the second one disappear
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When you select a URL from the address bar, and click DELETE ,it should delete the URL and show you the next URL.
But the bug is: it deletes the first URL and then the second URL desappear so the selection now is on the third URL... and this continue...
but after several tests I realized that this happens only when the URL you are trying to delete is visited on this session (I mean by session when you open firefox until you close it)
So if the URL you are trying to delete wasn't visited recently (in the same session), then there will be no bug, it will delete one by one.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open any website and visit 3 or 4 pages
2.you can close this website and open any other but you should not close firefox (if you close it there will be no bug)
3.start typing the URL of the visited site and press delete on your keyboard...
Actual Results:  
it will delete the first URL and skip the second one (the second URL will disappear)

Expected Results:  
it should delete the URLs one by one without disappearing any URL
