CSS transition slows down rendering
Something in 20130808 Nightly is slowing down my app almost to the point of freezing it when I use a CSS transition.

It was fine in 20130807 and is fine in Aurora too.

I tried extracting a test case of this but I failed: can't reproduce it. It might be that this bug is a complex case that my app triggers, and my test is too simple to cause it.

In any case what triggers this behaviour is adding the class 'faded_out', which contains a transform property, to an element with transition.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to http://people.mozilla.org/~spenades/refapps/rtcamera/20130808/ using Desktop Nightly
2. Click on the camera button to enable webcam access
3. Accept the camera prompt (no images are transmitted without your permission, ever)
4. hold down the camera button on the bottom of the screen, to take a picture
5. the screen will flash and the captured frame will rotate towards the gallery link on top left
6. the app is now SUPER SLUGGISH

Expected outcome:
6. the app keeps being fluid and responsive
