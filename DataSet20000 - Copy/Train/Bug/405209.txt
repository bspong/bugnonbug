I upgraded Firefox to version 2.0.0.9 some days ago. The problem is as follows: after the installation surfing was fine, as usual. When surfing was finished, i closed the browser. Several minutes later I restarted the browser, which instantly told me, that Firefox cant find the page, i use to open first (i.e. Google). I tried another page - same response. I have to completely reinstall Firefox and then it works. The problem: when i close the browser and reopen it again the same procedure as descrivebd above happens/is necessary to get the browser to work. As i told: that did not happen until version 2.0.0.8. Can you help - please?!  P.S. This does not happen with the Internet Explorer from Microsoft.
