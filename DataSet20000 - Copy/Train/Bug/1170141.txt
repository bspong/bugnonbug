We have three different signatures with similar DLL names and stacks that are spiking in 39.0b1, all on browser startup. The reason seems to always be 0xc06d007e / 0x00000000 with a 0x7XXXXXXX address, which might just be common for an uncaught exception (which I guess "RaiseException" at the top of the stack points to).
Even though the library name starts with "np" which usually is plugins, this is loaded in an add-on (I think) via JS-CTypes.

I don't have much more clue as to what's happening there but it sounds like people with this installed are unable to use Firefox at all.

David, do you have any more insight there?
