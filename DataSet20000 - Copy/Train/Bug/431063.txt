After deleting the Smart Bookmarks folder which contains a list of items such as Most visited places, etc, there does not seem to be a way to recreate that folder of lists.

I would suggest that by choosing "New Bookmark" would allow you to choose a type of list that you want to create (i.e., most visited places, etc., and then further define that list with # of items you want it to maintain in that list).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to organize bookmarks
2. Open the bookmarks toolbar folder
3. Delete the folder called Smart Bookmarks that comes with Firefox 3.0b5.
4. Look around for about 3 minutes to find out how to recreate them since you decided you want them back!
Actual Results:  
I couldn't find a way to recreate them after they were deleted.

Expected Results:  
I should have been able to easily find a way to recreate them and customize them within a few minutes of trying.
