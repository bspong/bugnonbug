WindowBlinds skinning program breaks Australis menus
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.2; WOW64; rv:28.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/28.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20131118030203

Steps to reproduce:

As far as I can tell there is some new nightly version 28 tab interface that has been added within the last week that breaks the menus and renders firefox unusable.  It first started happening in the 64 bit version and has now progressed to the 32 bit version.  I can temporarily deal with this in the 32 bit version by reinstalling a earlier version dated 11/18 but nightly soon updates itself and breaks again.  


Actual results:

Starting the newer 32 bit version in safe mode results in a temporarily usable interface with big strange tabs but functional menus but after clicking on tabs and using the browser for a short while it manifests the same behavior.  There seems to be some problem that WindowBlinds skinning makes worse since if I unload WindowBlinds the newer version will work for a short time. 


Expected results:

Nightly did not have problems before.  Also when I reinstall there does not seem to be any way not to install the Mozilla Maintenance Service and I think this is automatically updating me to the broken version.
