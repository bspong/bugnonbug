When launching the above site the "Standard View" basically times out and suggests that I use the Basic html view.

"Loading xxx@gmail.com…
Loading standard view | Load basic HTML (for slow connections)
This seems to be taking longer than usual.

If you are using a slow Internet connection, you can wait a bit longer for this page to finish loading, or just use basic HTML view for now.

If you are using your normal Internet connection and you usually get past this loading step without any problems, please refresh this page in your browser. You can also try signing into Gmail via https, which can help if the problem is caused by a bad proxy server or some types of third-party software. If you continue to have trouble loading your account, please visit the help center for troubleshooting information.
