I've been using Firefox with Vista and I have noticed that while I'm using firefox my hdd drive is doing something all the time (exactly opposite to IE).

This is because of "shadow copies". Every time you visit a website, Firefox saves images etc to cache, and Windows every time file is changed makes copy of it.


IE isn't affected by this because it's temporary internet files folder is added to exceptions list.


So, I've added my Firefox cache directory to exceptions list in to the registry

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\BackupRestore\FilesNotToSnapshot

and now everything is as it should be. But I think that FF installer should do this on his own, not every user will be checking why his computer is slowing down while using FF, they will stop using FF in favor of IE. 

Another thig is that even when you cleen the cache from FF, it can be retrived using shadow copies, it shoud be fixed too.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install vista with shadow copies
2.Install firefox, start using
3.Go to cache directory, see lot's of backup data
Actual Results:  
system and application slowdown

Expected Results:  
smaller performance impact on disk

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\BackupRestore\FilesNotToSnapshot
