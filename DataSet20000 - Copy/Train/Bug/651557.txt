403 Forbidden, it says when I click on a link and others, but this doesn't happen in Internet Explorer 9.

Help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I love (or did) FF until this happened when 403 Forbidden showed up on my screen after installing FF4....  Now I'm using Internet Explorer 9 as my default because FF is not doing what is suppose to be doing and not only that,it blinks as well.  I know it's not my PC and I don't know what to do anymore which I'm at my wits end here and I hate to say this, but this sucks especially I had surgery hopefully that I don't have cancer and FF4 is not helping my mood :((((((((((((((((

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I uninstall it.

2.Reinstall it.


3.To no avail and I'm not a happy camper.
Actual Results:  
NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!  Now I'm using IE9 as my default browser which I hate because of FF4 doing this to me............

Expected Results:  
I was hoping it would work, but didn't and I don't have any viruses or any other bugs in my PC since I gave it a good "bath" just to make sure..

For FF4 to be running like it suppose to be!!!!!!!!!!
