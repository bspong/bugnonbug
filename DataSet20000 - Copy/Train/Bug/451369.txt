When you double click and drag to select any text and you release the mouse button on an input(text) box the selected text does not become un-selected and you can select other text while having the previous text still selected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.View any web page with an input box.

2.Double click and Drag-select some text. (Specifically, while holding down 
the mouse button on the second down click, drag the mouse pointer anywhere from any point in the browser's content region.)

3. Select some text and release the mouse button over an input(text) box.(I have not been able to have the same bug occur when it is released over any other kind of input object such as a textarea,radio button or checkbox).

4. Now select some other text on the page using any method you wish, the previous selected text will not un-select and you can select different text from somewhere else on the page.(I have tried to then copy this text and found that it only copies what you have most recently selected not the text that was selected first with the original double clicking select).

5. Click anywhere else on the page, the text you just selected will become un-selected but the original text you selected is still selected and will not un-select as expected.
Actual Results:  
I had text selected that should not have been.

Expected Results:  
It should have un-selected the first set of selected text and then selected the new text.

I have web-dev tools installed, tamper data, firebug and ad block plus all installed on this version of firefox. I have tried this though on other versions with out these Add-Ons and it does the same thing.
