firefox is not restoring saved tabs upon being launched, and an alert notice comes up
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13

(Long) Alert notice starts with "Could not inialize the application's security component. The most likely cause is problems with files in your application's profile directory.....

Also, could not connect with Symantec for remote diagnostic tools, as when their Connect Me message came up with File Save, the message box disappeared when the icon was clicked, instead of launching the remote connection. This does not happen with the Safari browser, which I tried as a backup, so the Firefox browser is acting in a peculiar fashion. Also, when I tried to run the Norton Power eraser from their website, the download did not work because again the message box disappeared when the File Save icon was clicked, instead of downloadinug the antivirus software. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch the Firefox browser by double clicking on the bottom left hand corner
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Behind the Alert Notice, a Firefox message comes up, stating "This is Embarassing, your tabs were not found" (or something close to that. After clicking OK on the alert notice panel, one can either choose "Start New Session" or "Restore", either of the options do work.

Expected Results:  
When one clicks on "Quit and Save", it is expected that the saved tabs come up when the Firefox browser is launched.

After many hours of testing for viruses, running diagnostics such as CHKDSK, Norton technicians could not find anything wrong, and cocnluded that something is wrong with the browser itself (as the alert notice implies).
