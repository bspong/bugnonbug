Normally in OS X, one can, in a popup menu, or option list, or similar, type in the full name of the options. Not only the first letter. For example, if one goes to Google Translate: http://translate.google.com/translate_t , there are several selects. If I press one of the buttons to select a language, I would expect to be able to type <Jap> to get Japanese. I will get Polish instead, because the last letter I type is a P. This behaviour is completely different from the normal OS behaviour, only after a small pause of not typing it should 'restart'. Furthermore the look is not like the default OS look, but that's more related to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=402625

I don't really know why this Google-dropdown differs from, for example the dropdown on this bug-request page, because these do work. Could this be a different style?
