Hi, I have a ruby on rails app that generates a link with an anchor(http://localhost:3000/photos?thumb_page=3#thumbanchor) in FF when the user clicks on the up or down arrow which generates the above link the page is refreshed and the user is sent to the top of the page instead of the anchor location. In IE 6 it works as expected and actually if I go into the address bar in FF of the url generated and press enter it will bring me to the correct anchored location. For some reason it does not do it when first generated. This has been a frustrated issue and any guidance would be appreciated.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click on up or down arrow which has a dynamically generated link with an anchor
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
click on up or down arrow which has a dynamically generated link with an anchor

Expected Results:  
the expected results is that this would bring the user to the anchored position specified and not to the top of the page.
