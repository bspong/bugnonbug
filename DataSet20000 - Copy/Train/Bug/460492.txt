Revise the "Are you sure you want to show all passwords?" dialog

Currently if I want to view the list of passwords I have stored I have to do the following:

Navigate to Tools > Options > Security > Show Passwords tab.  This then show me a dialogue where I can view a list of "site" and "Username".

To actually see the passwords I then have to click another button called "Show Passwords".

At this point Firefox then puts up a third button which displays a totally useless "Are you sure you want to show your passwords" modal dialogue which I have to click "Yes" to confirm that I want to view my passwords.  Er... isn't the *whole point* of the dialogue that I want to see my stored passwords ?

The "Tools > Options > Security > Show Passwords" button should show me a dialogue which immediately show a list of "Site", "Username" and "Password".  All these other buttons are superfluous and serve no purpose other than to waste my time.  They provide no security and they provide absolutely zero useful functionality.

Sorry but I think the current design is poor and should be replaced.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to "Tools" > "Options" > "Security" 
2. Click "Show Passwords" button
3. Wonder why you have to press two more buttons to see your passwords ?



I'd really like Firefox to focus more on getting out of the way.  Currently there are too many dialogues that require excessive interaction.

It's a web browser not a video game/OS !
