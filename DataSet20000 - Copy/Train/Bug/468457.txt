live bookmarks shouldn't let xml parsing errors end up in the error console periodically
I have two feeds subscribed as live bookmarks, one is:
Error: undefined entity

the other is:

I know they're subscribed as live bookmarks because periodically those two messages appear in my error console, it's very annoying. (the feed.cgi is never going to return a 200, it might return a 403 instead of a 401 depending on whether you're whitelisted, but i promise it will never return rss even though hypothetically it is supposed to [this is based on a real service which expired my login credentials and had 4 rss feeds served by bugzilla behind http auth)
