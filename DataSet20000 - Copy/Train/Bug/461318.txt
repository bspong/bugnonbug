Closing last tab no longer possible.

If I have only a single tab left there's no close button on the tab. (I guess this is a change in the way it works)

However, if I right click the tab I can choose "Close Tab" this surprisingly also closes the browser. (I guess this is another change to the way it works. A surprising one though)

Anyway, the bug I'm reporting is the next time you open firefox, it remembers the last tab that was closed (when the browser also closed) and restores it even when I specifically wanted to get rid of it in the first place...



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a few tabs with websites (make sure theres only one firefox window open)
2. Close all but one with the close buttons on the tabs
3. Right click on the last tab and select "Close Tab" (this also closes the window)
4. Now reopen Firefox, the last tab is restored.

(I have "Always show tab bar" turned on)
Actual Results:  
The last tab I originally wanted to close is restored. Meaning I have to close it again. 

Expected Results:  
Either the "close tab" should not close the window also (leaving a blank tab, or no tab) or the tab should not be restored the next time we open Firefox. (Personally I'd prefer the first one)
