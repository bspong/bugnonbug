Bookmarks menu modified by userchrome.css is corrupted when RSS site is loaded.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Normally, Firefox looks to to the userChrome.css file for instructions on how to display GUI elements. I ordered the the Bookmarks menu in userChrome.css. When I display in a tab a site which contains no RSS element, the Bookmarks menu appears as I have ordered it, without showing "Subscribe to This Page." If I open in a new tab a site which does contain an RSS element, such as addons.mozilla.org, the Bookmarks menu item "Subscribe to This Page" appears correctly ordered, as does the rest of the Bookmarks menu. But when I restart Firefox with the RSS tab still open, Firefox ignores the userChrome.css file, and displays the Bookmarks menu unordered.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Order the Bookmarks menu in userChrome.css.
2. Open Firefox. 
3. The Bookmarks menu will appear as you have ordered it, but will not show the item "Subscribe to This Page."
4. Open a page with RSS content, such as addons.mozilla.org.
5. The Bookmarks menu will appear as you have ordered it, including the item "Subscribe to This Page."
6. Leave the RSS page open, and restart Firefox.
7. The Bookmarks menu will appear unordered. Firefox ignores your instructions in userChrome.css. 
Actual Results:  
Bookmarks menu appears unordered.

Expected Results:  
Bookmarks menu should appear as ordered in userChrome.css.
