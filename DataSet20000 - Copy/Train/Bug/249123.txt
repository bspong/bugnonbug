Office 97,  Excel97, WORD97, Visual Basic 6.0  will not "load" after installing FF0.9.1
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: "FireFox 0.9.1" downloaded and installed 062904

I downloaded and installed FireFox 0.9.1 today (062904).
Installed to FF default directory.
I did not elect to set FF as default.
Both FF and IE5.5 appeared to operate satisfactorily following FF install

Computer:  Dell C800 Latitude
OS:  Windows 2000 SP4
Browser:  Internet Explorer 5.5 SP2; Q832894  (programs had problems with IE6.0)
e-mail:  MS Outlook
Network connection:  SBC DSL
Network software:  RASPPPoE

Later I attempted to open Excel97, then WORD97 and finally Visual Basic6.0
During each of these attempts the "loading" would seem to freeze.  Finally
Task Manager showed "not responding".

I completed the following:  
Norton AV - no virus found
Defrag drive and partitions
Used Task Manager to "clear program"
Rebooted several times after using Task Manager.

I uninstalled FF 0.9.1 completely, restarted computer - Excel97, WORD97 and VB6 
all "load" and "work" as expected.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Reinstall FF 0.9.1
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Normal FF and Net connections

Office 97 programs do not respond and load

Expected Results:  
Office97 programs should have loaded and ready to operate

I would have to conclude Office97 programs crash after FireFox 0.9.1 has been 
installed.  Office97 programs become "reworkable" after FireFox 0.9.1 has been 
UNINSTALLED and the computer rebooted.
