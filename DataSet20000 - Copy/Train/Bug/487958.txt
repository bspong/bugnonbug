FF does not honor the 'selected' attribute when the value of the option changes (dynamically generated by the server). 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a HTML file with the code below:
<html>

<body>

    <select id="s2" multiple="multiple">

         <option>Low</option>

         <option selected="selected">Medium</option>

          <option selected="selected">High</option>

    </select>

</body>

</html>


2. Open the html in FF
3. Open the html file in a text editor and change the option value "High" to "High bug" (without quotes)
4. Save the file and refresh the page. 
Actual Results:  
When the page is refreshed the 'selected' attribute for "High bug" is not being picked up. 

Expected Results:  
For the file in the above example, 'High bug' should be selected

I was able to reproduce this problem on FF 3.08 (64-bit) Ubuntu and FF 3.08 (32-bit) Widows XP. Chrome and IE7 do not have this issue.
