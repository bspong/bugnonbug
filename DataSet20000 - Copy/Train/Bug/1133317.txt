Right click exposes wrong menu -- text boxes

Steps to reproduce:

Using 35.0.1

I right click on a text box, after copying text in another location, and instead of the expected menu, the one that shows up is the basic page menu (with left, right arrows at top, the reload every, and so on, down through the various native Fox items and the add-ons relevant. 



Expected results:

Opened a menu that included text box relevant items including undo and paste and etc.

Note, while the paste item was missing, the ctrl-v paste did work

I'll note that in other places, ie, not necessarily inside the text boxes, the wrong item opens.   At the moment, the URLs and menu expected/shown, are not recalled; but this makes me wonder if there was some meandering in the code, generally, relating to the exposure of drop downs, and the menus and situations aren't coded properly all over.  Might could be a review is necessary?

I discount that some novel use by web operators is obfuscating the page's content under the mouse icon, but this appears now/then on different sites.   I note that the cause for reporting this problem still exists, even though bugzilla's text boxes behave,
