Java script files referenced by script=http:... are loaded with the incorrect font
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3

Many .js files included into the site by reference appear to be rendered in the incorrect font.

Note that this problem is seen in FF 2.0.0.3 on both Windows XP and Linux. I&#8217;m reporting it to &#8220;Minefield&#8221; because it also happens there. (Otherwise Minefield&#8217;s looking good, but that&#8217;s not relevant to this bug.)

I believe that it&#8217;s a rendering problem because, in 2.0.0.3, I used the HTML Validator extension to look at the js code. The code displayed is garbled. That extension has a &#8220;reload&#8221; option, and reloading the js displays it correctly. (I also suspect that McClatchy (or Ming Interactive) is attempting to &#8220;protect&#8221; its Java Script by using a font different from the one used by the page into which its being loaded. But, if the &#8220;HTML Validator&#8221; extension can render it correctly, FF should be capable of doing so as well.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the site referenced above
2.See the garbled site 
3.
Actual Results:  
Garbled page, JS errors

Expected Results:  
Open the site in IE 6 to see it properly. Note, however, that the site fails (for the same reason as FF, I expect, but I&#8217;ve not bothered to verify)

FF hould have converted the font used by the JS file(s) to the font used by page into which the file was being included.
