Firefox only executes when receiving mouse/keyboard input.sd

Resumed from sleep. Firefox started showing the following behaviour:

Pages would not load, animated gifs would not play, flashing typing cursor would not flash, middle mouse-click scrolling would not happen, and basically everything except for flash videos would be totally frozen UNLESS I was moving mouse over the window, typing on the keyboard, using the scroll wheel or pressing a mouse button.

This appeared suddenly and after about 15 min of it, the browser started working "normally" again... Though I am getting odd mini-hangs as I type this message. Have not yet restarted, but I captured a video of the middle mouse-click scrolling problem and linked to it. Basically, when I moved the mouse, it would scroll, when I wasn't moving the mouse, it wouldn't scroll.

I have Firebug and Web Developer addons install, but both were turned off. I had two windows open, one with a three tabs, the other with just one window (that seemed to be taking /forever/ to load until I realized that I needed to move my mouse over the window for it to continue loading).

Hope you can find the source of this, sorry it was so random!
