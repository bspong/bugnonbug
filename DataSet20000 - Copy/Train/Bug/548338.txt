Despite Firefox being touted as the ultimate browser in terms of security, I am unable to rid my system of a firefox browser hijack which randomly loads a site called iamwired.net when I click on a link... in google search results or even on websites i am browsing...

I have used Symantec, Mcafee, Malwarebytes, Superantispyware, spybot, hijackthis, TDSS killer, rootkit revealer, Norman, Smitfraud, Stinger and many more..

Nothing changes the fact that clicks randomly take me to iamwired.net and I am surprised that ther eis SO LITTLE to be found online on Google search that tackles this problem in any sensible and foolproof way...

What the hell?? 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on any link... in google search or any other website I might be browsing
2. Takes me to iamwired.net instead of the link I clicked on
3.
Actual Results:  
I cannot reproduce it, it is absolutely random..About 30% of the links I click on take me to iamwired.net

Expected Results:  
I landed up at this stupid iamwired.net site

Gone to the site I clicked on obviously...
