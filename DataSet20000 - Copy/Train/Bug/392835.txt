On the page https://secure.konsole-h.de/ some text is invisible (unless you select it). (If the server should be unreachable like right now, use my slightly simplified version: http://home.arcor.de/caliga/down/test.html)

To my knowledge, the html and css is pretty much well-formed. Also, this only happens on my Gentoo-Linux-amd64 system (also tried win and gentoo x86-32). I was curious and recompiled it with "moznopango" as this looked like it would affect the rendering to me. Didn't change a thing.

However, I downloaded the page and played a bit with it. So I found out, that the problem dissapears if you
EITHER change font-family to Helvetica (or some others, maybe hinting problem? I don't know enough about that...)
OR remove the letter-spacing from the td formating.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. emerge firefox on gentoo 64bit
2. go to https://secure.konsole-h.de/
3. wonder about missing text
Actual Results:  
messed up text rendering

Expected Results:  
fine art of text rendering

I should note that gentoo also provides a precompiled package (mozilla-firefox-bin), that I have installed parallelly. AFAIK, this package is 32bit (Gentoo64 has some compatiblity libs and stuff to do this).
Now, that package shows the same problem which may be a hint that the actual problem is in an outside library. Could somebody point out to me, what library does that rendering/kerning or whatever stuff? As said, disabling pango didn't help.
