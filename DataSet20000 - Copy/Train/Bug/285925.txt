My connection repeatedly asks if I wish to disconnect while using Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050311 Firefox/1.0+

I use Netscape as my ISP. When I run "FIREFOX" as my browser I am continually
prompted to disconnect from the service. This happens mostly when I click on a
saved bookmark, home page icon on the toolbar, opening the sidebar menu, or my
e-mail link on my home page. This does not happen with Netscape's browser or IE.
It frequently hangs or freezes when I choose not to disconnect, causing me to
force a shutdow and restart.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log on to my ISP
2.Select a bookmark, home page icon on the tool bar, sidebar menu or e-mail link
3.

Actual Results:  
I am prompted to disconnect from my ISP. Frequently it causes my PC to hang up,
I have to force a shutdown and restart. My system reports that the browser is
not responding and all I have found that I can do is to force a shutdown and
restart.

Expected Results:  
There should be a smooth transition to my selection without the repeated
annoying prompt almost every time I try to navigate to to one of the above
mentioned sites or links to them. It should not cause a software freeze.
