firefox stops working and I get untitled tabs instead of websites.  I have to restart my mac to use firefox again
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4

I just got this mac and used a few days with firefox...then I loaded google notebook....which I love....I then started getting symptoms like I'm disconnected from the internet....at first I thought it was my home network system so I bought a new wifi....but that isn't it.  Safari is working great but firefox will continue it's problems...I started to get script windows coming down with different messages.  One message is  [Script]  This page requires AC_RunActiveContent.js  Then there is a blue oblong button with nothing written on it that I click to make the script message disappear

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I'll be surfing on buzzflash.com bringing up multiple tabs
2.I usually have my google notebook open and I'm creating notebooks and/or clipping stuff into existing notebooks
3.Suddenly any new tab/window is not bringing up the website from buzzflash and I no longer appear to have an internet connection 
4--I have to exit firefox AND restart my computer to get the thing working again
Actual Results:  
The incidents keep happening....

BUT I LOVE FIREFOX AND GOOGLE NOTEBOOK AND I'M LOST WITHOUT THESE TOOLS.
