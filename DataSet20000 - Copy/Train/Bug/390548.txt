Firefox hangs and reaches 100% CPU usage when trying to access websites and turns into zombie process in XP Task Manager when attempting to close
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070725 Internet Explorer/2.0.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070725 Internet Explorer/2.0.0.6

Firefox randomly stops responding after attempting to open a link.  Firefox will attempt to access a link, and after about 10 seconds the status bar stops showing any progress and then blanks out and/or says "Stopped".  Afterwards CPU usage skyrockets to 100% and when it gets near impossible to close Firefox.  If I do manage to close it manually, Windows XP will say the process is not responding.  If I click End Task and check the Task Manager, there is a zombie firefox.exe process taking up loads of RAM.  This happened after I updated to 2.0.0.5, AND DOES NOT RESOLVE ITSELF EVEN IF I DOWNGRADE TO 2.0.0.3 or 2.0.0.4.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a webpage.
2. Open a random link, but try to open the link as quickly as possible.
3. Firefox will hang and/or any new attempts at visiting other sites fail until Firefox is restarted.



It doesn't appear to be site specific, and has been happening to a number of my friends with different configurations.  If there is something I can do on my end to assist with the tracking, it would be very much appreciated.
