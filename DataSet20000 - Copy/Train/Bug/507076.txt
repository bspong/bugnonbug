I am having trouble with the way that the Location bar forms a URL after you have entered it. It may also have to do with autocomplete. I am able to duplicate this fairly consistently, although if you botch the test case, you have to clear the autocomplete/location bar history. The problem arises when you manually enter a URL, and mistype one of the characters, so that the case does not match the server (which returns HTTP 500), and then you correct the typo, it reverts to the typo version.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Manually enter the url: http://portagephotography.com/test
(no trailing slash, not sure if it's relevant)
2. You will recieve a HTTP 500 Internal Server Error. The location will be stored in your autocomplete history.
3. Manually enter the url: http://portagephotography.com/Test
Actual Results:  
The URL will revert to the invalid http://portagephotography.com/test

Expected Results:  
The URL should have remained the valid http://portagephotography.com/Test

I had the Old Location Bar installed, but disabled and confirmed that it occurred with and without it.
