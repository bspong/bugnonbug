Scroll mouse fails on some corrupt sites in FF DP alpha2, but works in Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.8b3) Gecko/20050712 Firefox/1.0+

Please refer to the URL. The page may change quickly however. 
The page undoubtedly uses things for only Internet Explorer, and so I guess it
should be considered partly broken. I attached a screenshot, which might help
anyone trying to efficiently reproduce it.

In Deer Park Alpha 2, the scroll mouse cannot be used to scroll this page. 
But in the Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 
the scroll mouse works, and so the whole page can be easily seen.

Despite the site being broken, there is some loss of functionality with this
site with the newest FF browser compared to the slightly older Mozilla browser.
 I think the makers of FF should consider making firefox work with this site in
a way similar to my mozilla browser.  

In Firefox, the scroll button does work for most other pages. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit the URL given
2.A page using javascript will load
3.I cannot use the scroll button on my mouse to scroll down to view the rest of
the page in firefox, despite being able to do so in seamonkey.

Actual Results:  
Scroll button doesn't scroll the page.

Expected Results:  
The scroll button on the mouse should allow one to see the page in its entirety.
