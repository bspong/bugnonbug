[RFE] A way to use a script as a "server" for page source and data posting
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: 

Many configuration/installation utilities could do with nicer interfaces.
If they could call Firefox with a command line option to use a named pipe or 
similar as its "server". e.g. Firefox -activesource pipename
Firefox could receive its first page from the script via standard in and then 
send all posts to the script via the named pipe.
That way a script could build a page as it runs roviding a visual log of 
progress in a pretty way, then offer the user a graphical set of check boxes 
etc. which they could then submit to the script. which could again provide 
output to the user via standard out through Firefox.


Reproducible: Always




I have looked for similar bugs and this, 182811, is the closest I could find. 
This is just an idea for a usefull feature, I dont much care how it is 
implemented so long as I can write scripts in any of a few languages and still 
use HTML and CSS to provide pretty output I am happy.
I suppose it should only be an active system when Firefox is activated from the 
command line, being able to submit to a pipe URL could be a security problem if 
it gets the link form a page on the net.
