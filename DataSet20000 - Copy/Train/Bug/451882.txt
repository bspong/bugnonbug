Resizing Java Applet with Javascript on OSX breaks Applet rendering

Changing the DOM size of an applet does not cause the Java Applet to reflect the new size.
Manually calling the java setSize(x,y) method does not fix the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a page with an Applet
2. Resize Applet with Javascript
3. Watch.
Actual Results:  
Either the applet will still be rendering at its original size or the clipping boundary of the applet will be messed up so that the new size is being rendered but only the previous area of the applet is visible.

Expected Results:  
The Applet should resize correctly to render the entirity of the new size.

This is not just a firefox problem, it lies in the plugin used to support Java applets on OSX, and thus also affects Opera and other browsers (but not Safari).

A termperamental workaround can be achieved by resizing one axis, notifying java, then resizing the other axis.
