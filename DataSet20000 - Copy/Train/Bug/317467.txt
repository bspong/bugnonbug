Save As box in FF 1.5 RC3 won't allow you to chose what file extension you want to save images in when they're JPG or BMP (It does, though, with GIF

When you right-click on an image, the Save Image box that pops up should allow you, in the "Save as type:" numerous choices for saving the image in whatever format you want (ie. saving a JPG file as a BMP or PNG file). For some reason, though, when it comes to JPG or BMP files, the field is left blank.  I've also noticed that the button at the end of that filed produces no response at all whatsoever. The same can be said for the "File Name:" filed as well.

But when it comes to GIF files, though, the total opposite is the case. There's a file choice in the field, the button at the right end of it works.  This bug has been documented more than 20 times by one user. Here's the link to the thread that talks about it:

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to this link: http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/11/21/parents.slain/index.html

2. Right-click on the image of the teenage girl.

3. Chose "Save Image As" from the menu that pops up.

4. Try to, in the Save As box, use the buttons to the right of the "Save as type:" and "File Name:" fields.

5.Go to http://mail.google.com/ right-click on the Gmail logo (in the upper left-hand corner of the screen) and repeat steps 1-4. 
Actual Results:  
At the CNN.com link, both the buttons for the "Save as type:" and "File name:" fields will not work, and the former won't have anything listed in there. At the Gmail.com link, though, the total opposite will be the case.

Expected Results:  
The Save As box should work the way it did with the Gmail.com example every single time.
