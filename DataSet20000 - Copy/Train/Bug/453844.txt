MacBook Pro OS X 10.5.4 Scrolling options severely limited in FF3

After installing Firefox 3 I'm unable to scroll via the mouse wheel on my Apple Mighty Mouse.  I'm also unable to scroll using the up and down buttons.  The two finger scrolling with the track pad is also disabled as well as up and down arrow keys on the keyboard.  Only dragging the scroll bar via the mouse works.  

The problem is isolated to web pages in FF3, i.e. I can scroll in the about:config window and other non-web windows within FF3.

FF 2 and all other programs work perfectly so it clearly can't be a problem with the mouse.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install FF3 from a previous version (2.0.0.9 in my case)
2. Attempt to scroll web pages with the mouse wheel on an Apple Mighty Mouse
3. Attempt to scroll web pages with two fingers on the trackpad as well as using arrow keys or up and down buttons on the scrollbar

2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Scroll bar is unresponsive.  No scrolling

Expected Results:  
Scrolling

I'm using the latest Beta version with the web developer plugin, but the problem occurred exactly the same when using the 3.0.1 version.
