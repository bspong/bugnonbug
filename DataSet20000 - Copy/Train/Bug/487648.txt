Got to be quick it is running slow and I know it will close without warning, I am using the latest version of Mozilla I have uninstalled deleted the version and reinstalled the version.  The problems still exists, I do use AVG, and not sure what ever other add ons that Mozilla needs.  I am sick of it crashing 2 and 3 times a day and freezing, where I have to power down and possible hurt the new computer.  I am also frustrated that no one wants to give me an answer on how to fix this, and Mozilla doesn't have any way to contact them to get an answer. This is a daily problem most days up to 6 or 7 times in a day.  Have no clue why it started to do this or how to fix it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just going to different sites it crashes no matter where I go or what I am doing.
2.
3.



Want an answer to fix the problem.  The sites I generally go to say they are most compatible with Mozilla, they why are they crashing....

If I have to power down without shutting down the computer properly it huts not just my computer but also other things I am working on...
