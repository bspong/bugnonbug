This is a regression from bug 248612. This bug only occurs when a page with an rss feed, or a secure page, is loaded in the background and the icon has not yet been displayed since firefox started. When switching tabs during drag&drop the rss icon, or security icon, will not be displayed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set Firefox to start with http://www.squarefree.com/burningedge/|bugzilla.mozilla.org
2. Restart Firefox
3. Select text from the first tab.
4. Drag text and hover over second tab until it becomes active.

Actual Results:  
Security icon is not displayed

Expected Results:  
It is displayed

After switching to the second tab the urlbar icons are correctly shown during drag&drop events.

Switching the order of the pages and restarting shows the same effect for the rss icon. This is related to bug 358202 but affects both the rss and security urlbar icons and only happens once, so I chose to open a new bug.
