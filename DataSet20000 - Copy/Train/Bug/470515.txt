A part of Firefox appears on the top-left corner of the leftmost Twinview/Xinerama screen after browsing flash embedded web pages
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008121622 Ubuntu/8.10 (intrepid) Firefox/3.0.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008121622 Ubuntu/8.10 (intrepid) Firefox/3.0.5

After viewing a web page with embedded flash content (e.g. Youtube), a one pixel wide invisible (in KDE 4) or white (in KDE 3.5) area with a height of about 18 pixels appears on the leftmost Twinview/Xinerama screen when Firefox is running (even when minimized).

This area
* does nothing when clicked or right-clicked upon
* cannot be moved or resized
* stays on top of all other applications
* casts a shadow in KDE 4
* prevents the activation of certain window manager events of kwin, which are activated by moving the mouse pointer to the leftmost upper corner

I've experienced this problem for ages with different versions of Kubuntu, KDE, Flash player and Firefox, but just recently found out that the culprit is Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a new Firefox process
2. Go to http://www.youtube.com and view or start viewing a video
Actual Results:  
An invisible bar with the width of one pixel and the height of 18 pixels appears on the leftmost Twinview/Xinerama screen.

Expected Results:  
There should be nothing there.

A dump received from the command 'xwininfo' when clicking on the discussed area:
