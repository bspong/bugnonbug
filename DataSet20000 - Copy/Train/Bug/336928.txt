After downloading and installing for first time, the set of backup instructions I had been using each day in Folder Synchronizer 3.5.4 (Softobe) had disappeared.

I use Folder Synchonizer 3.5.4 from Softobe to backup my work files each day to other harddrives. After downloading and trying out Firefox for the first time on May 6, 2006 (today), I found that the usual set of multiple file backup instructions that I had created as part of Folder Synchonizer no longer existed on my system. This was peculiar, and an inconvenience only, so I thought I'd let you know. Folder Synchronizer still ran (and runs) fine, I just had to spend 10 or 15 minutes recreating the set of multiple backups. Hope this helps. The brower seems really nice and very fast.
