When I first perform searches on a text selection dragged to the search bar, the
results (from Google) are displayed in the same browser window. However, after
doing a Find In This Page search, subsequent drag and drop web search results
are returned in new tabs, though I didn't change any preference settings.

Once I exit and restart the browser, the searchbar returns to its default
behavior of returning web search results in the same browser window.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a page in the browser, select a word, drag the selection to the search
bar, and observe that the results are returned in the same browser window.
2. Select the "Find In This Page" option from the search bar drop down menu
list, type or drag some text to the bar, and hit enter to perform the Find In
Page Search.
3. Select "Google" engine from search bar drop down menu list. Then select a
word and drag it to the search bar as in step 1. The results of the google
search are returned in a new tab.

Actual Results:  
Web search results were returned in new tabs.

Expected Results:  
Returned web search results in the same window.
