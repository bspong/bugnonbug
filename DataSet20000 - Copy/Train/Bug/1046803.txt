Markup view: too much whitespace in text node preview
Created attachment 8465483
Reasonable example with too much whitespace

SUMMARY: text node previews (not the corresponding editing <textarea>s) shouldn’t be rendered using <pre>. They should be rendered using white-space:normal, to avoid surprising renderings that make it harder to browse the document tree.

See attachment whitespace-example1.png for an example of the current result and of the desired result.


RATIONALE

The inspector’s text node preview displays the first 50 characters or so of the text node in a <pre> element. When the text has a lot of whitespace, especially line breaks, this can take up a lot of space for little value, and make the value hard to parse visually.

This common markup:

<h2>
  My title
</h2>
<p>
  Published
  <time>two days ago</time>
  by
  <span>Author</span>
</p>

is visually rendered with 5 blank lines in the markup view.
This result:
1. takes up more space than is necessary for a useful result;
2. looks quite different from the source code anyway.

Web pages are full of more extreme cases, such as:
- multiple blank lines between tags and the non-whitespace content;
- deep indenting being displayed in the preview (for instance, 6 tab characters push the text preview more than 300px to the right).

Especially with templating engines, PHP, etc., source code may have a lot of extraneous whitespace that is generally not useful to display.


PROPOSED SOLUTION, with remarks

I suggest moving to just using white-space:normal. This will give a useful rendering that is not jarring most of the time.

-> What about the editing mode?
It probably shouldn’t change. This means that when double-clicking to go from preview to edit mode, the text can move around quite a bit. I think that’s an acceptable trade-off.
Separately from this issue, the editing mode could have a few improvements such as removal of extraneous indentation (then the text wouldn’t jump around much).

-> But seeing whitespace can explain rendering issues!
It’s true that the presence or absence of whitespace at the beginning and end of a text node can alter the layout (when the text node is preceded or followed by a display:inline|inline-block|inline-table element). But as of now the use of <pre> doesn’t show the presence or absence of such whitespace efficiently anyway:
- The final line break (if any) is not displayed.
- Whitespace at the end won't be displayed if the string is longer than 50 characters.
- If the whitespace at the beginning is just one or two spaces, it will be visible but hard to identify.
If it is indeed useful for layout debugging, "Highlight whitespace at the beginning|end of a text node when that text node is preceded|followed by a display:inline[-*] element" should be a separate feature.

-> What about <pre> elements?
No special treatment for <pre> elements or any element with white-space other than normal. There’s probably little value in showing a "faithful" preview of a <pre>’s text content in the text node preview, since it’s just 50 characters long or so.

-> Should this be a devtools option?
No idea. If it is implemented as an option, I suggest making white-space:normal the default for text node previews.
