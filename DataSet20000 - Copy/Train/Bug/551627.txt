This is a spin off of bug 550322 and bug 550784. Jim Mathies asked me to file another Hulu fullscreen hang bug with regards to dual monitors.

If you have a fullscreen video running on one screen and you click on a Firefox window displayed on another screen, then the Flash video will exit Fullscreen mode but result in a hang. Clicking on a window other than Firefox or on the Windows background will not result in a hang upon exiting fullscreen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a Hulu video in one Firefox window and place on first monitor
2. Go to any webpage in another Firefox window and place on second monitor
3. Fullscreen Hulu video on first monitor
4. Click on Firefox window on second monitor
Actual Results:  
Fullscreen video loses focus and closes but causes a flash hang.

Expected Results:  
Fullscreen video loses focus and closes, leaving the normal non-fullscreen video playing fine.

I will attach the debug stacks that I posted in bug 550322 in this bug as well for reference.
