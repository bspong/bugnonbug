Major memory leak - the longer firefox is left open, the more memory it uses
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.2.12) Gecko/20101026 Firefox/3.6.12
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.2.12) Gecko/20101026 Firefox/3.6.12

I've had this problem for some time now with older versions of firefox also, and now still with 3.6.12.  On both windows machines (windows XP) with older firefox versions (haven't tried 3.6.12 on windows yet) and Macintosh's using both older versions of firefox and now 3.6.12 also.  After firefox has been open continuously for some time, it's memory usage climbs until the firefox starts responding very slowly, lots of spinning wheels, and finally I have to close and restart, or it becomes hung up completely.  It is close to that point right now, using 3.76 GIGABITES of memory between real + virtual.  This happens even if only a very few tabs are open.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use firefox continuously for a day or two without shutting it off.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
example, right now I've had firefox open for roughly 12 to 24 hours and it is up to between 3.76 and 3.84 GB of memory being used by a very quick check of activity monitor several times in the last few minutes.  It is responding slowly, and I'm getting a lot of spinning wheels when I try to even scroll down a page - or type in this box a few times too.

Expected Results:  
It shouldn't keep using more and more memory the longer it is open, until it hangs or becomes unusable and has to be quit or even force quit to shut it down and restart.

I'm using the default theme.  While I know these add-ons make firefox use a little more memory than if they aren't being used, I don't believe they are involved in this problem (I've tried disabling them in the past, and still had this problem).  Even so, to be thorough in this bug report - I am using adblock plus  1.3.1, download helper v 4.8, fireFTP v 1.0.9, and session manager v. 0.6.8
