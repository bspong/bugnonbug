Current Firefox 3.0.x versions are non-debugable using gdb!
User-Agent:       Opera/9.63 (X11; Linux i686; U; en) Presto/2.1.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla Firefox 3.0.6

I have a 1.3 GB core dump from an X-system error (see Bug #480179).  I have tried to debug it under both a standard environment -- which should be able to lookup function addresses -- as well as as a Gentoo "splitdebug" environment -- in which the libxul.so.deubg is 117 MB! and in both cases attempting to debug the core dump resulted in:

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up a large number of windows and tabs for a week or more.
2. Exerciese the system -- response with many old windows present should be as good as today's results.
3. At some point you will hit a faulty site which will crash the system.

Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes, produces a core dump which is effectively non-debugable.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should be debugable if the user-so-desires, current architectures seem to prohibit that.  You have yet to publish a rational justifying pushing everything into shared library rather than a static image!  Justify your position (to allow people to respond to it) or be viewed as nothing more than a petty dictatorship.

I don't need to say.  Firefox should be able to be compiled as a single binary distributable binary image.   And yet the developers seem to be running in a different direction.  Either I do not understand something or the developers responsible for Firefox have seriously misdirected goals.
