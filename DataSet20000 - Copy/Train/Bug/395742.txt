This is a daily newspaper. After scrolling to a news item and viewing that item, using the GO BACK ONE PAGE does not return to the last item, but refreshes the entire site and returns the beginning or first news item.  This only happens on this site.

I have been using Firefox for several years.
On or about Thursday 7th Sept. 2007 this problem arose.
While viewing the newspaper The Sydney Morning Herald, www. smh.com.au , as I have done daily for years, I became aware that I could not return to the last item viewed by using the BACK ARROW. The whole site appeared to be refreshed.
This only happens on this specific site.  It does not happen on an identical site the Daily Telegraph, another Sydney newspaper.
I opened the Error Console, deleted the accumulated errors, restarted Firefox and opened smh.com.au,
After use the Back Arrow key etc., I reopened the Error Console and the following error were reported.
"uncaught exception: permission denied to call method location.tostring"

I have un-installed  and re-installed Firefox.
 
Internet Explorer is not affected.
