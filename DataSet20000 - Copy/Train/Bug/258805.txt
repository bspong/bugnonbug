JaveScript cross frame .location.href problem

Cross Frame display problem
The JavaScript statement below only works once. 
top.[frame name].document.location.href = [some URL]
For example, if this statement is used with www.cnn.com and then
www.mlxchange.com, the  target frame changes to www.cnn.com but not to
www.mlxchange.com.  No error traps are set as far as I can tell.  Note that I
can use the same statement with text files repeatedly.  For example, I can use
top.[frame name].document.location.href = [filename].txt repeatedly.  Maybe
something to do with the security changes mentioned in the release notes ?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  write a JavaScript function that includes code like the example in the detail
2.  call the funtion with www.cnn.com, the frame will change
3.  call the same function with www.mlxchange.com, the frame won't change

Actual Results:  
The steps above were part of a program that I had written before.  Note that it
works with IE and Netscape.

Expected Results:  
top.[frame name].document.location.href = [some URL]  should work more than once
