Runtime Error!

Program: D:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe

R6034
An application has made an attempt to load the C runtime library incorrectly.
Please contact the application's support team for more information.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.   Press any radio channel button, window opens, error dialogue appears.
2.   Channel fails to load: "Waiting for video" - audio only.
3.   Dismiss, nothing happens.
4.   Try another, or the same button, the error message is not repeated, but the channel still fails to load.  
5.   Error message only obtained again if FF is closed down and restarted.  New Window, new tab, reload site has no effect. 
Actual Results:  
No music.  However, if an IE tab is used (within the opened window), no problem, the music plays.  Switch back to FF - nothing. Return to IE tab, music ...

Expected Results:  
Show player controls (I have no idea which program provides these), play music.

Seems to be a problem since FF 3.5.

I have no idea how to check if the library is installed correctly; can find no information on this.
