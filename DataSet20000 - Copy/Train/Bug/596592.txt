nsISessionStore::setWindowState resurrects a window that was closed at the time of the getWindowState.

The browser-chrome mochitest  browser/components/privatebrowsing/test/browser/browser_privatebrowsing_popupmode.js
does something like this:

  let stateBackup = ss.getWindowState(window);
  // do a bunch of tests ...
  ss.setWindowState(window, stateBackup, true);

the problem is that when restoring the 'stateBackup' a window that was
closed at the time of the 'getWindowState()' is opened.

This is what bit me in bug 449734.  The tests I add in that bug create
a tab, detaches it using 'replaceTabWithWindow', and finally close
the new window.  My tests work fine when run individually, but when
running the whole browser-chrome suite "browser_privatebrowsing_popupmode.js"
which runs some 40 or 50 tests later, resurrected a window from my test.

I have combined the essence of the two tests into a new test to demonstrate
the problem, see the attached patch.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. apply the attached patch
2. rebuild browser/base/content/test/
3. run "mochitest --browser-chrome --autorun
--test=browser/base/content/test/browser_setWindowState_BUG.js"

WORKAROUND
After you 'close()' the window created by 'replaceTabWithWindow' you can do:
Cc["@mozilla.org/browser/sessionstore;1"].getService(Ci.nsISessionStore).forgetClosedWindow(0);
to avoid it causing a problem with 'get/setWindowState' later.
