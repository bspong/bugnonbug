If you create a page that has a frameset that is resizable with a border, if the user manually resizes the frameset by dragging on the border to its minimum width or height (depends on whether frameset is defined with cols or rows), the frameset cannot be resized programmatically using Javascript (i.e. frame.cols = "10,*").

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Setup:
Create an HTML page that has a resizable frameset with 2 cols.  For the one frame, include a page with a button that changes the cols value in the frameset.

1. Manually resize the frame that does not contain the button to its minimum width.
2. Click on the button.

If the size of the frame without a button is anything but the minimum value, the  Javascript call from the button will work.

Actual Results:  
The frames within the frameset remain the same size (i.e. the frame without the button is its minimum width and the frame with the button takes up the remainder of the screen real estate).

Expected Results:  
The frameset should resize the frame without the button to the specified size from the Javascript call and the frame with the button should take up the remainder of the screen real estate.

The HTML test pages were run from an application server, not from the windows file system.
