Unable connect to https://libproxy.library.unt.edu:2048

Steps to reproduce:

I tried to use my university's library site to access a journal.  It uses the following to take me to the EBSCO host site.

The new release of Firefox makes it impossible for me to use the proxy that the library at my university uses to access the EBSCO site.   I keep getting a message that there is something wrong with the certificate.  Here is the URL https://libproxy.library.unt.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/direct.asp?db=lls&jid=R5A&scope=site


Actual results:

Browser refused to load the page, saying there was something wrong with the certificate.  I tried to create an exception, but the new dialog did not like the URL above.  It tells me that there is nothing wrong with the https://libproxy.library.unt.edu certificate.  So I am kind of stuck.

Here is the message displayed to me:
The connection to libproxy.library.unt.edu:2048 was interrupted while the page was loading.

    The page you are trying to view cannot be shown because the authenticity of the received data could not be verified.
    Please contact the website owners to inform them of this problem.


Expected results:

Browser should have loaded the page and/or given me some option.
