Firefox freezes between virtual screens in Ubuntu
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:40.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/40.0
Build ID: 20150807094952

Steps to reproduce:

I am using Ubuntu 14 LTS and Firefox 40.0 (although this issue has existed with Firefox on Ubuntu 14 LTS for at least six months).  I use a 5x2 (5 horizontal, 2 vertical) set of virtual desktops.  I have multiple tabs open in my Firefox, and generally leave it in the second virtual desktop to the right of the top left, unmaximised and almost the full size of a 32" 4K screen.  When I move to another virtual desktop for a period of at least five minutes (short times don't cause the bug), and then come back to the desktop containing Firefox, it is almost always visibly frozen.  From a technical standpoint, it is clearly listening to both mouse and keyboard X events, but it is not repainting.  A workaround is to double click on the top bar of the Firefox window to maximise it, and then double click on the top of the Ubuntu desktop to unmaximise it, after which it will be unfrozen, and with any changes due to mouse clicks or keyboard events it received prior to the maximise/unmaximise reflected in the window.  For example, if you click on a new tab in the frozen Firefox, it will remain on the currently visible tab, but if you then maximise/unmaximise, it will be switched over to the new tab.  Similarly, if you enter text in a text field on the currently visible web page or in the address bar, it will not visibly enter; however, after a maximise/unmaximise, it will be there.


Actual results:

Firefox freezes when being on a non-visible virtual desktop in Ubuntu 14 LTS for more than a few minutes.


Expected results:

Firefox should be visibly responsive to mouse and keyboard events after the virtual desktop it is on is re-visited after an extended period of time.
