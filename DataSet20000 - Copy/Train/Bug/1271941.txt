Timeline content.mp4

[Affected versions]:
- Firefox 45.0 and up
- Activity Stream 1.0.16

[Affected Platforms]:
- All Windows
- All Mac OS
- All Linux

[Prerequisites]:
- Create a new profile.
- Install Activity Stream through Test Pilot.
- Browse a few links as a new user (50-100 visited websites, 1 bookmarked website).

[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Go to about:preferences->General and select "When Firefox starts: Show my windows and tabs from last time".
2. Click on "Activity Stream" button from browser toolbar.
3. Close all other tabs.
4. Close Firefox.
5. Start Firefox.

[Expected results]:
- Activity Stream Timeline content is automatically displayed with all items in viewport.

[Actual results]:
- For a few seconds the Mozilla start page is displayed and then it is replaced by Activity Stream Timeline. Activity Stream Timeline is empty although there is content in history. Even the Highlight tiles are hidden. Resource link is displayed in the browser address bar.
- If we visit the Bookmarks page from Activity Stream Timeline, we can see that this page is also empty (1 website is bookmarked).
- Content is displayed if the user performs a manual refresh of the page.

[Notes]:
- If we repeat the same scenario for New Tab page, we can observe that the loading spinner is displayed indefinitely with the message "Hang on tight! We are analyzing your history to personalize your experience", until the user refreshes the page.
