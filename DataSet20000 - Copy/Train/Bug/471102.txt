I have been a user of this Firefox web browser since 2003. I first used it on my desktop in 2003, before I bought a new laptop in 2006. I used Window XP on both computers. Firefox has been great for me over the past 6 years. 

I set my default homepage for my browser to be Firefox's Google.com homepage. Last week, in December 2008, I was informed that Firefox is upgradable. When offered, I accepted. Why not accept? This latest version, 3.0.5, has not been treating me well because it has a defect. The defect is that the screen, as soon as I first open up Firefox's Google.com, is jumpy/bouncy/jittery/shaky. It never stops this irritating motion. I visit other sites while it bounces up and down, and it still is a bouncing web page at my site destinations. I open up a new Firefox to have two browsers open, and the second Firefox is not bouncing, though that other first Firefox still is having a bouncing screen effect. 

I have never had this problem before with any other earlier version of Firefox.
