Some RSS feeds have no home page link. When creating a live bookmark from such a feed, the "Site Location" field is left blank. For whatever reason, this prevents you from moving live bookmarks around Firefox, via drag and drop, copy, or cut and paste. None of these actions work with location-less live bookmarks on the bookmarks toolbar, in the bookmarks menu, or in the library.

There's an easy workaround for this. If you specify any "Site Location"--even a dummy one like "about:blank"--then you're able to move the live bookmark as expected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a live bookmark with no site location (on the bookmarks toolbar, in a menu, in the library... it doesn't matter where)
2. Try to drag, copy, or cut it
3.
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens. You can't "pick it up" if you try to drag. If you attempt to copy or cut it, this exception is thrown:

self.livemarks.getSiteURI(bNode.itemId) is null
Line 473 of modules/utils.js

Nothing is put in the clipboard and nothing is available to paste.

Expected Results:  
You should be able to move it as you would a normal bookmark or live bookmark.

Here's a sample RSS feed that has no home page link. You can create a live bookmark from it to see the problem.
