Firefox grabs all available CPU cycles (in essence slows my system to a *crawl*).

There is currently an advertisement (seen at many websites) for a 'Koi fish 3D screensaver thingy'.  Whenever I arrive at site with this advertisement firefox grabs all the CPU cycle.  I have a laptop and this forces the CPU temperature way up and then speed stepping switches in.  If I hit one of these sites by accident I have found that the most reliable way to get out of it is just force an 'end task' on firefox via task manager.  I have now managed to track down that if I turn of 'java script' in firefox then when I return to the webpage that had the advertisement the advertisment doesn't show up - and hence my system doesn't (to all intents and purposes) lock up.  So really this has something to do with the way firefox and javascrip are interacting with that particular advertisement.
