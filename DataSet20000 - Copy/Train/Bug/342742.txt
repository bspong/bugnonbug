When many tabs are open, it takes very long (minutes) for Firefox to die, even after the last window closes
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.5) Gecko/20060626 Firefox/1.5.0.5

see below "Steps to reproduce" and "Actual Results".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close Firefox (yesterday's nightly) by File -> Quit
2. Answer "Close Tabs" to multitab closing menu
3. gunzip -vf firefox-1.5.0.5.en-us.linux-i686.tar.gz
4. tar -xvC /usr/local -f firefox-1.5.0.5.en-us.linux-i686.tar
5. Click Firefox icon on desktop

Actual Results:  
Popup message:

Firefox is already running, but is not responding. 
To open a new window, you must first close the 
existing Firefox process, or restart your system.
                                          [ OK ]


Expected Results:  
Firefox should have started up.

- Workaround: Close and restart X11 window manager session. This includes re-entering login name and password. After that, Firefox can be started with no problem.
- This bug is not new in today's nightly; I've been experiencing it for some time. Maybe since the Linux installer stopped being updated each night.
- Thunderbird does _not_ exhibit this bug AFAICT.
