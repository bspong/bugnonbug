This bug only appears when the navigation toolbar is turned off. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to View->Toolbars and turn the navigation toolbar off.
2. Go to Tools->Options->Privacy click the checkbox next to "Always Clear my private data when I close Firefox".
3. Click the settings button and make sure you have checked all of the boxes (clear everything).
4. press Alt-d to bring up the "Open web location" dialog. Enter any valid url in the dialog and go to the site.
5. Close firefox
6. When the "Clear Private Data" dialog appears make sure that everything is checked and click "clear private data now"
7. open firefox
8. press Alt-d to bring up the "Open web location" dialog.

Actual Results:  
 The "Open web location" dialog contains the url you entered before you closed firefox. The browsing history was not completely cleared.

Expected Results:  
The dialog should not contain the url from the previous session. It should have been cleared when I closed firefox. If you use the navigation toolbar the url will not show up.

Clear private data should have wiped out the information from the previous session. If the data was really cleared then no code path would be able to expose it. Just clearing the history from the navigation toolbar is not the same as clearing the data. Clearly some private data still exists in a cache file somewhere. I expect that all the private data is wiped out.
