In windows live hotmail, you can save a message to a folder. To do this you must be in windows live hotmail and click once on the "Move to" button. A list of destination folders then appears. If your list of destination folders is particularly long, an elevator bar also appears, allowing you to scroll up and down the list. However, if you attempt to scroll by clicking or dragging the elevator bar, the entire list closes instead of scrolling. There is no way to move messages to folders at the bottom of the list. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.load windows live hotmail
2.select a message from your inbox
3.click on "move to"
4.attempt to scroll up or down using the elevator bar (your list of destination folders must be sufficiently long for the elevator bar to appear)
5.the folder selection disappears without allowing you to scroll.
Actual Results:  
The folder selection disappears without allowing you to scroll.

Expected Results:  
Using the elevator bar should scroll up and down a long list of destination folders
