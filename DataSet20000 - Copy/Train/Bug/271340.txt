Control Panel entry for Firefox (might be obsel. due to 1.5 mass install extensions/themes)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0 (ax)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0 (ax)

I had this idea, but I found the comment listed above.  As noted in the comment:

As for a Control Panel item you're meant to create a .cpl file, but it's also
possible to create a CLSID for a Firefox Control Panel (which launches
C:\\PROGRA~1\\MOZILL~1\\FIREFOX.EXE -chrome
\"chrome://browser/content/pref/pref.xul\") and then add it to
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ControlPanel\NameSpace.

I did not want to talk about that specific part of the NameSpace feature,
because it would detract focus, so I made it a new enhancement.

My thoughts on it are:
----------------------
Entry in Control Panel: Firefox Options
----------------------
What it does:
----------------------
Basically a modded version of your usual Firefox options panel, with options for
adding themes or extensions.  You would be able to add many themes and
extensions rather quickly as the browser isn't in memory persay.  If it is,
could we make this some sort of seperate application or something small that
wouldn't need the entire browser to be in memoery?  (I know how you guys are on
overall filesizes).  This would further expedite the Firefox "experience" and
say to Microsoft: "See?  We can put stuff in your Control Panel too!"
---Either:---
*The normal Internet Options icon would be hidden (replaced with "Firefox
Options".  A registry key could hide the original)
-OR-
It could totally replace the Internet Options dialog (including adding the
Firefox icon.  Basically the above idea, but renaming it to "Internet Options")
-OR-
The "Firefox Options" could just be added and not hide the normal Internet
Options (I can't think of a time when, if you don't use IE, that you actually
need this tool).

This enhancemnt could be added in a future "Admin Install" of Firefox as I hear
custom installers are in the works to roll out on networks.  Home users could
have the option too.  ;-)

Thanks for your time.
