After switching to the new Yahoo Mail beta (October, 2006), starting several Firefox windows in succession causes Firefox to quite responding, and it fails to open some of the windows.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Switch a Yahoo Mail account to use the new beta.
2. Run the following commands from a shell:

firefox 'http://www.mapquest.com' &
sleep 1
firefox 'http://www.google.com' &
sleep 1
firefox 'http://mail.yahoo.com' &
sleep 1
firefox 'http://mandrivaclub.com' &
sleep 1
firefox 'http://wwwnew.mandriva.com/security/advisories?dis=2006.0' &
sleep 1
firefox 'http://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=21226' &
sleep 1
firefox 'http://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=21227' &
sleep 1
firefox 'http://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=21228' &
sleep 1
firefox 'http://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=17817' &
sleep 1
firefox 'http://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=24145' &
sleep 1
firefox 'http://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=24633' &
sleep 1
firefox 'http://forum.mandrivaclub.com/viewtopic.php?p=213901' &
sleep 1
firefox 'http://forum.mandrivaclub.com/viewtopic.php?p=238042' &
sleep 1
firefox 'https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=335551' &
sleep 1
firefox 'https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=354241' &

3. Wait for the dialog box to come up stating Firefox failed to open some of the browser windows.

Actual Results:  
At least one, usually about three, dialog boxes pop up:

Firefox is already running, but is not responding.  To open a new window, you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart your system.

For each instance of the dialog box, one of the requested windows has failed to come up.


Expected Results:  
Firefox should open the requested windows without hanging on Yahoo's new animated eye candy.


This is observed on a fairly fast system, Pentium 4 "A" at 2.4GHz, 1GB RAM, ~1.5Mbit DSL internet service.

With the old Yahoo Mail system, the expected result is achieved with great reliability.  With the new Yahoo Mail beta, Yahoo's bloated animated eye candy gunk causes Yahoo to block and fail to open new windows, again with great reliability (at least the several times I tried it).

Switching back to Yahoo's old mail system works around the symptom.
