The sort order of a big list is not complete, it seem to sort with only the few first character of each item (see the screenshot (URL))

the list in the screenshot is a list of product use for my website.

each time I reload the page the order of the item in that list as change and it was not totaly in alphabetical order (as you can see on the screenshot)



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a Big list of Item (many item must start with a least the same 5 character
2.just open the list and note the order of the item
3.close the page and open it again (the order should change)

Actual Results:  
The order change and the items are not completly in alphabetical order (only the aproximatly the 5 first character.)

Expected Results:  
the order should not change and it should be completly in real alphabetical order from the first to the last character of each item of the list

It was realy frustrating when you work with a list like this one every day and you got to use item of that list, even more when you got to use them in order when that order change each time you use one.
