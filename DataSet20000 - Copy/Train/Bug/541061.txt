Disabled add-ons should not be updated

I am really very reluctant to restart Firefox to install an update for an add-on I have disabled. This usually is a dull/problematic/somewhat uncomfortable add-on, and the request to update it makes me rather uninstall it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.disable an add-on to which you often receive updates
2.wait its next version
3.
Actual Results:  
you will be prompted for an update in the tools - addons window as soon as the next version is public; a separate section ("extensions" - "themes" - "plugins" - "UPDATE") will appear and annoy the user

Expected Results:  
Firefox user should have an option of whether to check for updates of disabled add-ons automatically or not.

The "updates" pane in "tools - addons" window is really annoying when I have to restart Firefox in the sake of an add-on which I do not really very much need.

Maybe when a worthy update (of an enabled addon) comes, you could update it together with all disabled add-ons?
