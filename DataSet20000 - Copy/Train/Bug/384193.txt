JAJAH blanks out the phone number on this page.

The back ground on this page is black, the test is in orange. JAHA turns the phone number black and replace it with a purple underscore rendering the phone number invisible until you roll over it with the mouse at which time the underscore disappears and the phone number appears.  The code on this page is correct and this does not happen when the page is viewed in IE. This happens in several places within this site.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter, C.R.Schultheiss Instructional Technology Specialist

The number should remain visible in the color that the code requires.

This is a commercial site for a fledgling company who needs their phone number on their site.  I have no connection with the principals of this site but fair is fair. And IE is not my favorite browser.
