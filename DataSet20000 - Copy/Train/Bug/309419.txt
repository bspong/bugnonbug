Zero height warning dialog after restore following return from hibernation

The main New York Times web page, http://www.nytimes.com, contains the refresh
code <meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="900">. If the network connection fails,
Firefox will pop up a dialog that says something like "Operation timed out,
couldn't www.nytimes.com". So far so good.

But in certain circumstances the dialog is only a few pixels high (not counting
the title bar provided by explorer.exe). A typical scenario is described below
in Step to Reproduce

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open several tabs, including http://www.nytimes.com (typically at work where
I'm docked to a LAN connection and sending video to a 1280 x 1024 monitor)
2. Minimize Firefox
3. Hibernate
4. Return from hibernate (undocked at home, where I'm using a wireless
connection, and viewing video on the 1400 x 1050 laptop screen)
5. Try Restore Firefox

At this point it appears that Firefox is not restoring, but eventually I notice
the very small dialog window, a few pixels high and 100-200 wide near the top
right part of the screen. After I close this dialog, I am able to restore Firefox.


Actual Results:  
I've seen this problem two or three times, but attempting to reproduce it
systematically would be pretty tedious.

Expected Results:  
The dialog should not allow itself to be resized (by Windows?) to a size that is
too small.
