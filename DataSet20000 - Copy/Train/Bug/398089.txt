_Almost_ every time I normally exit Gran Paradisio 3.0a8 from both single-tab and multi-tabs, I get an error message from "Windows Problem Reports And Solutions" that shows that "Firefox"... um.. Gran Paradisio has exited incorrectly and gives me a small button to "end program" - this is NOT the "program is not responding" window/button...

p.s. worked fine w/ FF2 (tho on current installation I closed it like 2 times before installing Gran Paradisio 3.0a8)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open some page
2. Browse it. Have Fun
3. Close Gran Paradisio with the big "X" button
4. There you (or I) have it.
Actual Results:  
"Program has exited incorrectly" or something like that window w/ a button to "end program" or something like that

Expected Results:  
Well..., exited w/out any problems and warning messages... duh.

This happens w/ default theme. I haven't tried any others yet.
