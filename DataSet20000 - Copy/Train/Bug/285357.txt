This is occuring with the saferfox theme. I have not tested with other themes. I
will select severity as Major although I consider it to be a Critical issue when
trying to convince new users about security. Loading a url not specified in the
properties dialog could be serious risk. Therefore I will send a security email
also to reference this bug.
