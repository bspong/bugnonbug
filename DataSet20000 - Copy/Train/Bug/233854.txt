Firefox should override window manager setting that Ctrl+W closes windows

When the window manager is configured to use Ctrl+W to close windows, it is not
possible to close a tab through the Ctrl+W keyboard shortcut, as this closes the
entire window.

I know it's possible to do this, as Gnome Epiphany does the right thing -- close
a tab when Ctrl+W is pressed.  Similar support would also be needed on Mac OS X,
at least to be similar to Apple Safari: the window isn't closed until the last
tab is closed.

Unfortunately this would require having a way to differentiate between the user
pressing Ctrl+W, and the user clicking the window manager's close window button.
 The former should close the tab, the latter should close the window.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Configure your window manager so that Ctrl+W is used to close windows.
    a.  For Gnome 2.2: click Applications -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts
    b.  Change "Window Management/Close a window" to use <Control>w
    c.  Close the Keyboard Shortcuts window.

2.  Start Mozilla Firefox.

3.  Open a new tab with Ctrl+T.  There should be two tabs active.

4.  Press Ctrl+W.


Actual Results:  
The entire window closes, instead of the current tab.

Expected Results:  
The current tab should have closed.
