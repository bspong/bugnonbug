TamperData extension crashed Firefox

I had just installed TamperData 10.1.0 extension and restarted Firefox.
I started playing around with it on my home page which is
http://www.google.com/ by intercepting some of the HTTP request
headers and changing them. Specifically, I remember changing
the Referer [sic] header (setting it to empty) and deleting some
arbitrary characters of one of the google.com cookies. All this on
a simple Google search for 'Tamper Data' and then 'TamperData'. As
I tweaked the Cookie header the 2nd or 3rd time, boom, Firefox crashed.
Some Gnome crash detection / notification process popped up, asked if I
wanted to save a bug report and suggested I send it to the Firefox
team.

I actually first sent it to Adam Judson, the TamperData author, but
he said I should send it to the Firefox team as extensions run in a
sandbox and shouldn't be able to crash Firefox.

Gnome bug report to large to attach. Contact me via email if you want it.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Actual Results:  
Firefox crashed.

Expected Results:  
Possibly TamperData extension should have such down if it was the cause, but I don't think Firefox should have crashed. A more graceful death of the extension was expected.

Am using Crux theme under Gnome.

List of plugins installed at the time:

	NoScript (1.9.0.4) - enabled (google.com site is whitelisted)
	Tamper Data (10.1.0) - enabled (obviously :-)
	Beagle Indexer (1.1.0) - disabled

I was running under a fully patched OpenSuSE 11.0 install of Linux
while using Gnome at the time this happened.

I will see if I can reproduce it at a later date, but no time now. If I can,
I'll let you know.

Gnome bug report w/ stack trace, etc. too long to attach and I have no where to post it to. I can send it to someone if contacted via email or if you have an FTP site to send it to.
