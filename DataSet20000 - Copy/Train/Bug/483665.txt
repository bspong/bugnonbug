Rearranging bookmarks from 'bookmarks' NOT 'Organise Bookmarks' does not work
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-GB; rv:1.9.1b3) Gecko/20090305 Firefox/3.1b3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When trying to rearrange bookmarks from the 'Bookmarks' button, either nothing happens (when a rearrangement should have occured), or the bookmark selected moves to a random location. This happened when I was trying to move a bookmark for an eBay item which was finishing earlier than another eBay item.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Add a couple of bookmarks to firefox
2.Try to rearrange them 
3.Nothing happens or they are rearranged differently to how you selected them to be.
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens or they are rearranged differently to how you selected them to be.

Expected Results:  
It should have rearranged the bookmarks to how I selected them to be, such as a bookmark being moved above another.
