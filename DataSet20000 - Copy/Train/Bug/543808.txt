error message "incorrect details entered" when trying to login into my internet account : Problem occurs in ver 3.6 but does not occur in ver 3.0.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; GTB6; Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1) ; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Latest version 3.6 

After upgrading from firefox 3.0 to firefox 3.6 I was unable to log onto my internet banking account I get error message "details entered incorrectly". This is my main account which I have used for many years so know login details inside out. I tried several times to login in case I had caps lock etc on, but still same message. I then used internet explorer and had no problem logging on.
I then uninstalled firefox 3.6 and reinstalled firefox 3.0. I was able to logon with no problems. I then upgraded again to 3.6 and same error message " details entered incorrectly". I then loaded coral ie tab addon and switched rendering engine to IE, still unable to logon - instead of error message, screen effectively refreshed itself asking me to enter security details again.  I have now downgraded to Firefox v3.0 again so I can use my account. I chose Firefox over Internet explorer for it's security but this kind of bug is testing my patience.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Login to my banking account 
2.Enter security details
3.Submit
Actual Results:  
"details entered incorrectly" error message.

Expected Results:  
Successfully logged into my banking account.
