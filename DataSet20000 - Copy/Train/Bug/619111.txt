When a tab attempts to populate a site that does not exist it correctly indicates 'Cannot find server' in the tab title label, but when the site *does* become available and the site successfully populates the title, it still reads 'Cannot find server'.  A good example is before and after connecting to a VPN.  If i open firefox and go to a site on the private network before connecting to the VPN, then connect to the VPN, and attempt to connect to the same sites using firefox, the sites populate but the tab titles still show 'Cannot find server'.  Not all sites behave this way.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Access site not accessible without VPN connection via firefox tab.
2.Logon on to VPN
3.Click on same tab hit F5.
Actual Results:  
The tab title does not show the name of the site and still reads 'Cannot find server'.  

Expected Results:  
It should show the title of the site in the tab title once the site has been found.

I realize that accessing the same VPN I use will not be possible.  But i believe that if this can be duplicated using any VPN, the results will be the same.
