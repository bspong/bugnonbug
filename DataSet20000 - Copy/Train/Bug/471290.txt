Firefox crashes when loading a specific web page [@ quartz.dll@0x172a3 ]
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008122011 Iceweasel/3.0.5 (Debian-3.0.5-1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008122011 Iceweasel/3.0.5 (Debian-3.0.5-1)

Firefox crashes when loading the web page URL given in this report. I can see the page appearing, but a split second later Firefox crashes. In my Debian build I get no crash report wizard with backtrace.

I have the newest flashplugin installed, but I'm blocking flash by default, so the flash plugin should not be running in this case. Java is also disabled.

When running Firefox from an xterm, I get the following output when it crashes:

The program 'firefox-bin' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)'.
  (Details: serial 124489 error_code 3 request_code 10 minor_code 0)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
