Unresponsive UI & crash in [@ shutdownhang | WaitForSingleObjectEx | WaitForSingleObject | PR_Wait | nsThread::ProcessNextEvent | NS_ProcessNextEvent | mozilla::jsinspector::nsJSInspector::EnterNestedEventLoop ]
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:44.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/44.0

Steps to reproduce:

While FF is idle on my computer with 1 window and 1 tab open, the CPU usage for FF constantly spikes up to 13%. 


Actual results:

When this happens, the User Interface becomes unresponsive. This means that nothing in the viewport works except the scroll wheel, and if I click the reload button it will spin indefinitely and FF will crash. I have submitted hundreds of crash reports due to this issue. Here are some of them:

Expected results:

I have attempted restarting Windows in safe mode, and while in Windows safe mode, starting FF in FF safe mode, and I get the exact same behavior of the CPU spikes and FF lagging/sluggishness/unresponsiveness. I have also tried it with Windows in normal start mode and FF in safe mode, but nothing changes. The constant laggyness and/or complete unresponsiveness is becoming unbearable.

I have tried creating new profiles, reinstalling FF, turning hardware acceleration on/off, and all the troubleshooting steps listed here:

And nothing has worked.
