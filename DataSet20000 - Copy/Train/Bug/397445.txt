When a popup window has the File Upload dialog open, you are unable to click anywhere in the popup window (the dialog is modal).  However, if you go back to your main browser window and click around, these mouseclicks don't do anything at first but seem to "stack up"; when you close the File Upload dialog, all the click events start firing in the main window.  This leads to some very strange behavior; for example, if you click on all the main menu items while the File Upload dialog was open, you end up with all the menus dropped down at the same time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a popup window that has a file-upload field (I tested in GMail by holding down Shift and clicking on Compose Mail).
2. Click the Browse button or its equivalent to open a File Upload dialog from the popup window.
3. Go back to (one of) your main Firefox window(s) and click on various things (tabs, menus, Back button).
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens until you close the File Upload dialog, then all hell breaks loose in your main window as the mouseclicks start having their effect.

Expected Results:  
Either (1) the mouseclicks are ignored, as they are if you click inside the popup window; or (2) the mouseclicks take immediate effect.  I'd prefer (2), but I understand that might be more difficult to implement.

I first noticed this in Firefox 2.0.0.7, but the behavior there is somewhat different: clicks on menus and buttons take immediate effect, but you can't switch tabs by clicking on them (though you still can by selecting them from the tab drop-down menu on the right).
