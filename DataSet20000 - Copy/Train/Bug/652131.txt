Error messages received when clicking an e-mail link and when launching Citrix for a vpn connection

Hi.  Since the latest upgrade, I have consistently received the following errors:
1.  When clicking any e-mail link I get launched to do a file search, the box is titled Locate Link Browser, and defaults to the my documents folder.  The browser does launch and I have to close the locate link browser box, otherwise, it just stays open.

2.  When I double click on Citrix to launch my vpn connection, I get a gray box with the following dialog:  "Windows cannot find 'https://citrix.fnf.com/Citirx/XenApp1/SSL/site/default.aspx?CTX_MessageType=SUCCESS&CTX_MessageKey=UsableClientForced'.  Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again.  To search for a file, click the Start button, and then click Search."  It has an OK button which will close the box. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
For error 1, 1. Click a link in any e-mail.
2. Error file open box launches, but so does the browser.
3. Continue on the browser link.
4. Close the file open box.

For error 2, 1.  Double click citrix link.
2.  Error box appears.
3.  Click OK.
4.  Browser opens for citrix login and continues on OK.
Actual Results:  
The desired functions do take place, but in both instances the error box has to be closed.  Just annoying.

Expected Results:  
Launch the browsers in question without opening a file open activity box and without displaying a citrix error.  Just needs to launch the browser in both instances and not have these extra boxes to deal with.
