will no longer load since the I downloaded the newest updates for mozilla and my extensions
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; {BF1D478C-603A-4210-827D-DA3F411CD3C8}; SV1)
Build Identifier: mozilla 1.0.6

The whole area where mozilla has functionality, like the file menu, the 
location bar, and the big empty space where webpages are supposed to be 
doesn't work at all.  I can't click on it, I can't use keyboard shortcuts, it 
starts and the internet doesn't work.  Foxytunes still works.  Minimize, 
restore, close, still works.  Colorzilla still works, but may be the source of 
the problem.  It has added itself to the menu that appears when you right 
click.  BTW, right clicking anywhere still brings up that menu, though none of 
the buttons do anything anymore.  When I deleted the colorzilla folder and 
tried again, my homepage loaded.  Then I restored colorizilla and it didn't 
work again.  Then I deleted colorzilla again, but it still didn't work.  I 
can't make anything inactive through mozilla because its completely 
unresponsive.
