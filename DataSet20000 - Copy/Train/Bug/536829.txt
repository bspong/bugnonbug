Firefox doesn't always update its version number after doing an update
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091201 Firefox/3.5.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091201 Firefox/3.5.6

I was trying to update FoxVox to the latest version and went to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/51166/ to do so.

It prompted me to download a newer version of Firefox. I had the latest--3.5.6.

In a discussion with the developer of FoxVox, he let me know that Firefox was reporting that I had ver. 3.0.8. Apparently Firefox hadn't updated its version number in my about:config files since ver. 3.0.8.

So I manually went into about:config, searched for 3.0.8, updated it with 3.5.6, and was then able to download FoxVox with no problem.

Looks like you need to ensure that each update updates the ver. no. locally.

Thank you for a great product. I use it almost continually.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Went to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/51166/.
It prompted me to update Firefox (I had 3.5.6, as shown in the About Firefox dialog box).
Actual Results:  
It didn't recognize my version as 3.5.6 but apparently as 3.0.8.

Expected Results:  
recognized my current version

I've seen that problem once before, when my version number was reported as an earlier version. So I went in manually and changed the version number. the situation worked out OK after that.
