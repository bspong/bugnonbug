Whole system becomes unresponsive when switching from 360p (std. resolution) to 480p (DVD resolution) when watching a video in Hulu

This is very annoying for me. Let me start by saying that I have tried to reproduce this in Safari and Opera, and while the video does not play correctly in those browsers either, it does not slow the entire OS to the point where it is unuseable and a restart is required. 

This happens whenever I go to hulu.com, select a show to watch (such as the Colbert Report), the video starts playing, and after a few seconds I decide that want to watch in a higher quality (the 480p button to the lower right). Suddenly, the video becomes jaggy, the spinning beachball appears, and my system grinds to a halt. This has happened every single time. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. point browser to hulu.com
2. select any TV show, such as The Daily Show or Colbert Report 
3. After Ad has finished playing and show begins, attempt to watch it in higher resolution (480p) on the button to the lower right of the video. 
Actual Results:  
Video plays for a second, which is extremely jagged, beachball appears, whole system becomes unusable. 

Expected Results:  
Video plays without any hitch (except maybe longer loading times)

As mentioned before, I have tried this on other browsers for OS X, and none have made the system unusable. They do, however, display jagged video.
