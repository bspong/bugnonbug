Lag time in web pages opening. Get 'loading' message and no page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Since 3.6 betas came out (and even w/3.6), I'll click on a link or favorite and get 'loading...' on the tab and after 5-10 seconds I click refresh or click the link again and the page comes right up. I'd say this happens on 75% of the links I go to. I never had this problem with 3.5.  I know that some sites are busier than others, but I've waited 30 seconds before refreshing and refreshing almost always brings the page right up.  My son reports the same problem w/3.6 on his laptop.  I go to the same links in IE and there is not the delay.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I click on a bookmark or link in a website as www.dpreview.com
2. Get 'loading...' message (I've actually waiting 60 seconds while entering this and no page yet).
3. I went back, clicked on the bookmark to dpreview.com again, no page, click refresh and the page came up.
Actual Results:  
While I was waiting for dpreview.com to come up, I opened IE 8.0 and entered www.dpreview.com and the page came right up.

Expected Results:  
After the page came up in Firefox 3.6, the tab showed the animated dot rotating and the words: Digital Camera Reviews and News, even though the page was up.  This is typical.
