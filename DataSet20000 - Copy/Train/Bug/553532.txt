Description would be similar to the #120809, but a little different.
Shortly, Firefox won't save an image which I see in a tab, but which has been deleted both from the server (no longer available by the URL) and from the cache (e.g. opening that URL in another tab to see the 404 error).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Way to reproduce needs one to have access to a server where one can store files.
1. upload an image to server;
2. open two tabs with the same URL pointing to the image you've uploaded;
3. delete image file from server;
4. in the first tab press ctrl+f5 to reload and clear cache (it will produce a 404-error page);
5. in the second tab right click the image and choose "Save image as".
Actual Results:  
This will produce a file containing the server response (like the one we see in the first tab), instead of the image I actually see in the tab.

Expected Results:  
Obvious: the image I see should've been saved instead of trying to get it from cache/network.

I put severity level to critical, because I could not save the image from the web which was deleted from web and from cache so it caused me to lose data.
