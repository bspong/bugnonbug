Using FF 3.5 on WinXP, fresh install of everything. Reproducible on other installs of XP SP3

In Options->Main, "Show my windows and tabs from last time" is selected.
History is NOT cleared between each session in the History Settings.

Upon closing of FF with *any* number of tabs, FF reloads to the "Home Page" as specified in Options->Main. If no Home Page entered, then to the default FF webpage.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable "Show my windows and tabs from last time" on WinXp SP3 with FF 3.5
2. Open any number of tabs.
3. Close FF.
4. Reopen FF -- no tabs are reopened.
Actual Results:  
Home Page or FF default page opens regardless of number of previous tabs open.

Expected Results:  
FF should open with the tabs that were previously opened. This was the expected behavior from 2.0 and 3.0.
