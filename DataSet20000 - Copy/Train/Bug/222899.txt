Firebird's toolbar scrambles when Internet Explorer is open
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6a) Gecko/20031002 Firebird/0.7+

If you decide to run Internet Explorer before or after Firebird is open  and you
go into the customization screen, the toolbar has a tendancy to scramble.  By
this I mean that the buttons spontaneously move randomly in the main-part of the
toolbar.  An example is the browsing buttons (back, forward, stop, etc.) move to
the opposite side.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Arrange the buttons of the navigation toolbar in this order: Back, Forward,
Stop, Reload, Home, seperator, URL entry, Go, seperator, Print.
2. Open the Customize screen.
3. Open Internet Explorer.
4. Go back to Firebird.
5. Close the customize screen and the buttons should have moved.
(optional fix)
6. Reopen the customize screen and close Firebird from the Close button in the
upper-right corner.
7. Close Internet Explorer.
8. Reopen Firebird and the buttons should now be back to their original positions.

Actual Results:  
The buttons moved and then were put back after reopening Firebird and closing IE.

Expected Results:  
Not affected the buttons at all.
