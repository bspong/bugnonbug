Minefield sometimes behaves as if a program is docked on the right side of the screen, when there is no program there.

I have my screen size set to 1024x768, but usually keep a program docked on the right side. Once in a while, i'll go to start Minefield without that other program open, and Minefield will behave as if the program is open, and leave a hole on the right side.

I'll completely close Minefield, click "ctrl+alt+del" to make sure any last remnants are gone, then i'll re-open Minefield and it still will leave a hole on the right.

Yes, properties->shortcut->run is set to maximized.

Sometimes i'll minimize the docked program to the systray, but Minefield won't fully expand.

It was suggested at that mozillazine.org URL that I open up a Bugzilla entry in order to see what the developers think.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get something docked on the right side of the screen.
2. Close it and Minefield.
3. After a while, you'll notice Minefield "think" the docked program is running, by not loading on the full screen, when there is no docked program there.
Actual Results:  
Minefield loads in a square shape, thinking there is something on the right side of the screen, preventing it from loading over the full screen.

Expected Results:  
Minefield should load over the full screen when there is nothing docked on the right.
