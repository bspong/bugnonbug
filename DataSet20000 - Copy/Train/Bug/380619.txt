I am the Author of the extension called HTML Validator.
My users reported me a problem but the cause is due to a bug in firefox.

When I change an icon of my extension on the status bar during a particular Firefox event, the back button is reset.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install HTML Validator for Firefox 0.839
   This link: http://users.skynet.be/mgueury/mozilla/download.html
Win:             http://htmlvalidator.sourceforge.net/mozilla/tidy_firefox_win_0839.xpi
Linux:
http://htmlvalidator.sourceforge.net/mozilla/tidy_firefox_linux_0839.xpi
   Or this link:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/249

2. restart Firefox, choose the algorithm you want
3. Open a new window
   Go to www.google.com
   Click on any link (ex: images) -> you go to the next page
   -> There is no back button (This is the bug)
   Go to a link futher( back rework )
Actual Results:  
no back button after new window

Expected Results:  
back button available

I know the code causing this in my extension. Just that it is crazy:
- If you look the extension, you will see that there is an icon in the status bar that is green, yellow or red depending of the HTML errors on the page.
- when I do 

this.xulBrowserImg  = document.getElementById("tidy-status-bar-img");
...
img = this.xulBrowserImg;
...
img.setAttribute("src", icon + ".png" );

The back button disappear. 

If I replace the line of code by:

setTimeout('oTidyBrowser.xulBrowserImg.setAttribute("src","'+icon+'.png" )',10)

It works. This behavior is really strange and buggy. It should be fixed.  A lot of extension have numerous work-around for such bugs.

Thanks by advance,
