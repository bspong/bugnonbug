Steps to reproduce:

1. Went to https://www.paypal.com
2. Clicked on the green padlock on the URL bar (next to it, it correctly displays "PayPal, Inc. (US)"), but nothing was displayed.
3. Clicked on Tools -> Page Info -> Security tab, but nothing is displayed (as indicated in the attached screenshot). Clicking on any of the buttons (View Certificate, View Cookies, and View Saved Passwords) does nothing (for this website, works for others).
4. Disabled all extensions and add-ons and tried again, no success.
5. Cleared all cookies for the paypal domain, still nothing.
6. Opened a Private Window from the same profile, still nothing.
7. Used a different profile, information is displayed normally (both next to the padlock, and on the Page Info tab, with website identity, privacy, technical details, etc.).



Actual results:

No information is displayed when clicking on the green padlock for that website, or on the Security tab of the Page Info window.

It only happens for this specific website (from all those I've tried, with https), and only on one specific profile (my main one).

The reason I'm filling the bug is because PayPal is a security-sensitive website, so I'd like to know if my profile could be corrupted or affected by some malware.

If there is a way to clean my profile other than starting from scratch, would gladly like to know. Otherwise, if there is a way to obtain debugging information, that would help.


Expected results:

Security information should be displayed normally in both profiles, or some error message should help explain why it can't be shown.
