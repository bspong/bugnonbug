window.location hijacked with onkeyup
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13

A web page can intentionally hijack user to any URL (location) after typing URL into location bar and hitting enter.

Developer can create such JS code that will force user to visit any page after navigating away from malicious webpage.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://mozilla.kbr.sk page in Firefox
2. Click anywhere on the page
3. Type any non-cached URL (ie. facebook.com) into the URL box
4. Hit enter
5. http://mozilla.kbr.sk opens again (instead of facebook.com)

Actual Results:  
facebook.com should open

Expected Results:  
mozilla.kbr.sk opens

This affects also Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13
FF3.6.13 is affected all the time. Bug can be reproduced easily.

Firefox 4.0b12 seems to partially fix this issue.
In FF4.0b12 user sometimes needs to click on the page in order to replicate the bug or go back (in browsing history) to the malicious page using Backspace on keyboard. In FF4.0b12 it takes several tries to replicate the bug, but once it's replicated, no Backspace or click on the page is required.

The trick might also be in visiting random URLs that have not yet been cached such as abcdef123.com. The domain does not have to exist in order to replicate this bug.
