undo in textarea (ctrl+z) when there is no undo to execute results in mysterious invisible newline
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Pressing ctrl+z once while in an empty textarea (when the context menu item for undo is disabled) results in no visible change in the UI. However, javascript now reports the textarea value as containing a single newline character. It is not possible to delete this "newline" from the textarea using backspace/delete keys - one must do "Select All" and then backspace/delete.

This breaks functionality for any code which reads a textarea's value - when the user believes the textarea is empty, the browser may be reporting a newline.

Here's the test html:


<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
<html><head><title>firefox bug</title>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        window.onload = function () {
            document.getElementById('data').onchange = function () {
                alert(
                    'length: ' + this.value.length +
                    ', charCode: ' + this.value.charCodeAt(0));
            };
        };
    </script></head>
    <body><form action="#"><div>
        <textarea id="data" rows="5" cols="20"></textarea>
    </div></form></body>
</html>

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
FOR EXAMPLE CODE PROVIDED:

1. Load page with the given html.
2. Give focus to textarea. Note that it is empty (no spaces/newlines).
3. Press ctrl+z only once to "undo" (shouldn't be possible, but do it anyway).
4. Take focus away from the textarea.
5. Be amazed as an onchange event executes even though you didn't visibly change the textarea value. The event alerts you with the value/length/charCode of the single character which has mysteriously appeared in a non-visible value.


FROM SCRATCH:

1. Place a textarea on the page, ensuring empty contents (no spaces, newlines).
2. Check the textarea value with javascript. As expected, the value is an empty, 0-character length string.
2. Give focus to the field to begin editing, but do not type any characters.
3. There is no physical undo that should be possible. Indeed, the "Undo" context menu item for the textarea is disabled.
4. Press ctrl+z only once.
5. Using javascript, check the value of the textarea. Surprise! The value is now a 1-character length string: a newline.

BUT:

6. Give focus back to the textarea. Use backspace and delete keys to try and delete the mysterious newline. You can't. There is no newline to delete in the textarea, yet firefox reports a newline to the javascript.
7. Do Select All, either via context menu or via ctrl+a. Note that there is nothing visibly selected. But now press backspace. Voila, javascript now reports the expected empty string.
Actual Results:  
An alert() with the following text:

length: 1
charCodeAt(0): 10
value: |
|

Expected Results:  
An alert() with the following text:

length: 0
charCodeAt(0): NaN
value: ||
