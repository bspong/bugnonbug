Save as file retransmits a long bugzilla list from the buzilla server again.

I often load longer buglists from bugzilla, press the XML button and want to save the XML result to a file. A list of approx. 2400 bug in XML take quite a while (several minutes). If I now want to save the result into a file, firefox obviously asks the bugzilla server again to transfer the XML sheet (takes again several minutes).

From my point of view firefox could just save the content of its (XML) buffer into a file !


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
- Ask firefox bugzilla to search all bugs which contain a "a" character.
- Wait until the list fully appears
- Goto the bottom of the page and press the XML button
- Wait until the XML summary appears
- Select "File->Save as file" and try to save the file to the filesystem.

You may want to watch the network traffic using wireshark to verify.
Actual Results:  
Have to wait again for the data transfer.

Expected Results:  
File should be saved nearly immediately

Write its XML results (buffer) into a file.
