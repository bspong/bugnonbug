Unable to utilize "send" and "compose" buttons, unable to report this bug via Bugzilla
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/312.8.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/312.6
Build Identifier: 2.0.03

Since downloading this new version, I can't:
1) get the 'compose' screen on Comcast web mail (nothing happens when I click on the compose button which should launch a new window)
2) hit 'send' on Facebook to post a reply to the mail in my Facebook inbox
3) cannot fill out this bug report form in Firefox.  'Send' button does not work (is not highlighted).  I am posting this bug using Safari.

This is very annoying.  Firefox has long been my browser of choice and now I am wondering if I should go back to the old vresion.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Comcast mail
2. Hit compose button
3. Page never loads

etc.
Actual Results:  
Page never loads in Comcast mail.  On Facebook, I hit Send and I stay on the compose screen.  In the Firefox Bugzilla site, hit send and nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
Should get compose screen and should be able to post/send email via Facebook.
Should be able to post a bug using Firefox as my browser.

It should work.
