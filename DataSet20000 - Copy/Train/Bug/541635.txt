page scrolling is not smooth, especially when dragging with scrollbar

Soon after installing the new FF 3.6, I noticed problems with scrolling. Scrolling with my trackpad virtual scroll is fairly smooth still (but not as much as before), yet using the scrollbar to navigate pages causes scrolling to have a significantly more jerky motion.

Occasionally Firefox 3.6 enters a mode in which scrolling becomes especially jerky even when using the trackpad, and it does not improve until I restart the browser. Even upon restarting, it often reverts right back to jerkiness within a few minutes.

I am using the smooth scroll feature.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable smooth scrolling.
2. Scroll up and down by dragging the scrollbar on a long page.
3. Also try using mouse scroll feature.
Actual Results:  
Jerky scroll motion. Slowdown of program occurs after extended period in which scrolling motion becomes especially poor.

Expected Results:  
Smooth silky scrolling like in previous FF version.
