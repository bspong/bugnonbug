I cannot enter a URL when creating new tab in fullscreen F11-mode.

But what seems unreported for 3.5 beta 4:
The Adressbar is not working when coming back from fullscreen!
It keeps displaying "Search Bookmarks and History" grayed out and italic, even if you enter the field. Everything you type is then displayed the same way. Enter doesn't do anything.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. hit F11 for fullscreen
2. press Ctrl+T for new Tab
3. hit F11 again
Actual Results:  
adressbar is grayed out, text italic, typing works but enter doesn't start a search

Expected Results:  
(Actually the adressbar should already be focussed If I press F11 and Ctrl+T but..)
It should be usable and focused as like in non-fullscreen mode when I'm back from fullscreen.
