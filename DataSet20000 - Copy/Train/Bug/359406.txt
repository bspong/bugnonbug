DHTML/JavaScript Menus render incorrectly in Vista RC2 (ffx 1.5 and 2.0)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

In Windows Vista RC2, using Firefox 1.5.0.7 and 2.0, menus generated by the popular AllWebMenus package render incorrectly. When viewed in IE7 on Vista, as well as Opera9, they appear correctly. All browsers work properly in WindowsXP, even Firefox 2.0.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Using Windows Vista RC2 with clean Firefox 1.5 or 2.0 profile, visit any site using AllWebMenus DHTML/JavaScript menu system (eg. http://www.likno.com)
2. Hover mouse over main menu options (eg. products)
3. If you are able, hover over submenu options
4. Repeat procedure in IE7 or Opera9 to see expected results

Actual Results:  
Submenus are rendered in the wrong places, and if set to disappear automatically when the mouse is removed from the parent item, are completely unusable.

Expected Results:  
Submenus should be placed next to their parent elements, with tertiary navigation options placed relative to their secondary parent elements.

Note: This bug is present in 1.5 and 2.0 builds, but only on Windows Vista RC2.
