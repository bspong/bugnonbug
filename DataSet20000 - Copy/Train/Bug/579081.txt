I receive "unexpected client hello" error when I try to log in to my gmail account.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.6) Gecko/20100625  Firefoxver:2.00287  976805093803  ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.6) Gecko/20100625  Firefoxver:2.00287  976805093803  ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

The same error occurs sometimes when I try to access hotmail.com and sometimes when trying to use search engines like Google and Yahoo. I have Norton 360 and sometimes I get a message that Firefox was prevented from accessing another web page during a search, but that dialog box gives me the opportunity to override. 
With the client hello error, I get no options. If I try again, the Loading circle goes into a busy loop.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Three examples of how the problem occurs:
1. Type in a search string to Google or Yahoo. It happens.
2. ALSO if I try to access gmail account, it happens.
3. When Firefox loads, my homepage Google will not come up and I get the error.
Actual Results:  
Window with description:  ssl_error_rx_unexpected_client_hello

Expected Results:  
I expected to get my search results or my email, but I did not.

I cleared my cache, history and cookies several times, in case there was a corrupt file. No change in error results.
