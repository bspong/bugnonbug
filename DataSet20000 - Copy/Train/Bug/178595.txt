The webpage loads up refreshing the page in a continuous loop.

The webpage http://www.buy.com/, correctly loads up. It however continues to 
refresh without stopping. As it is looping, the bottom of the page resizes 
sqweezing the formating of the page up then back to the right side. it goes 
back and forth like a see-saw in this motion continuously. It also makes this 
same resizing loop efect when viewing an inside link, i.e. cliking on a 
category. The effect does not stop when the stop button is pushed on the 
toolbar, it only continues to loop.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open phoenix
2.go to http://www.buy.com/
3.the problem starts as the page does not stop, it continuously loops a page 
resize reload.

Actual Results:  
the page continuously loops, after hitting the stop button, it starts back from 
its(phoenix) original static position and begins to loop again. the page will 
also continue to loop in the background and will be looping if you come back to 
it from another program.

Expected Results:  
the end result should be: the webpage should not be allowed by phoenix to 
continuously feed a resize if it is not able to recognize its request.

The problem has not been identified in viewing other webpages, so it may be a 
language specific bug. I am using phoenix with the orbit 3+1 theme. I have not 
replicated the bug with the classic theme.
