I restarted firefox with add-on disabled,  when I was in this mode, FF updated itself to the latest version. when I restarted again, all my add-ons were gone. also all my open tabs.

Steps to reproduce:

I had autoupdate disabled and I had version 28 on Mac OS. I restarted my firefox in the "all add-ons disabled" mode. I was using firefox in this mode when it automatically updated itself to version 29. When I finished my work, I restarted my firefox to start it in the normal mode.


Actual results:

When I opened it up, it was upgraded to v28. All my add-ons were deleted.  
Also all my open tabs were gone but I really don't care about that. I care about why it updated itself and why it deleted all my add-ons. 


Expected results:

First, it shouldn't have updated to v29 because I explicitly disabled that option. Second, Since I was in the "all add-ons disabled" mode, the new version didn't recognized my add-ons and removed them all. This should've never happened regardless of autoupdate being disabled or not. I guess this is a bug that is there and can again happen to some people in the release of every new version.
