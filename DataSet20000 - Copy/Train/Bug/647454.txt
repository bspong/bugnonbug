Firefox stops loading pages

Firefox sometimes refuses to stop loading pages. Means:
Opening a new tab, enter an url -> no page. It feels like, if Firefox is offline. There is no loading icon in the tab, the error message turns on immediately.
Quitting Firefox and restarting solves this problem, but well that takes like 1-2 minutes.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Well, there is no clear "it happens because of", but it happens after I opened a new tab (cmd + t) and started typing the address before I could even see the location bar. I open tabs very frequently and close them. Cannot say it is the nth opening or such. And I often type before the ui shows me the location bar, the UI is behind my action, even though my mental model knows, location bar has focus and I can type ;)
So, when entered the address in the location bar, I see it by then because the UI catched up, hit enter and immediatly see the error message.

It happens when Firefox runs a while, consumes more and more memory and the UI doesn't even feel responsive anymore, it hangs a little and is behind user interaction.



Memory Usage of Firefox is HUGE.
1) When I startet typing this bug, Firefox consumes 600MB RAM (According to Activityapp).
2) It raised to 650MB (firefox was unusable at that moment, rainbow cursor).
3) An hour passed away (firefox was on idle, but the active window).
4) I continue typing now, firefox consumes 777MB RAM at the moment.

Just to give an impression, how firefox increases memory on my system. Maybe that helps and stays in connection with this bug.
