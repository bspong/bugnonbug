Favicons not loaded when "Load Images" "for the originating Web site only" selected
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8a3) Gecko/20040817 Firefox/0.9.1+

When I select both "Load Images" and "for the originating Web site only" from
"Web Features", favicons are not loaded in both location bar and tab.  In this
setting, Favicons should be loaded.  But, favicons are not loaded on Firefox and
Mozilla suite. 


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto Firefox->Preferences...->Advanced.  Uncheck "Hide the tab bar when only
one website is open."
2. Goto Web Features.  Check both "Load Images" and "for the originating Web
site only".  Select OK button.
3. Quit and restart.
4. Visit the URL (http://www.mozilla.org/).
5. Favicons are not loaded in both location bar and tab.

Actual Results:  
When I select both "Load Images" and "for the originating Web site only",
favicons are not loaded.  But, uncheck "for the originating Web site only",
favicons are loaded.


Expected Results:  
When I select both "Load Images" and "for the originating Web site only",
favicons should be loaded.



I confirm this problem on 2004-08-05-09-trunk Firefox build(MacOSX10.2.8). 
Then, 2004-08-17-09-trunk still have this problem.  But, 2004-08-04-09-trunk
didn't have this problem.  And I confirm this problem on 2004-08-05-12-trunk
Firefox build(Linux gtk2+xft).  It seemed that this regression occurred between
20040804 and 20040805.
