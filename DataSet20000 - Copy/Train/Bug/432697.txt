Some utf-8 pages garble up h1 tags into symbols rather than in plain text in Firefox v3b5 that does not happen on v2. It happens every time the problematic pages are visited, although it does not happen with every page that is set as a utf-8 charset. 

If I highlight the h1 and copy the text, then paste into notepad, I get the plain text h1 I expected to see. But in Firefox on the screen, i just see the  h1 text as symbols that I can't read. The symbols look like this:
