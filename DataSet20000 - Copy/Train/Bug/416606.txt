Clicking in any applet text fields shows a cursor but keyboard events do not produce text in the text field. If there are HTML text fields or text areas, keyboard events may or may not be directed to those fields instead.

This bug is similar, but not exactly the same as other bugs I have found.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load any applet that has a text field, or other input field.
2. Immediately click in any applet text field and try to type.
3. If typing works, repeat the above steps. It should take fewer than 8 tries to reproduce the bug.
Actual Results:  
Keyboard events do not go to the applet.

Expected Results:  
After clicking in a text field on an applet, the applet should receive all keyboard events.

The following two workarounds fix the problem and may provide clues as to the cause.

1. If the browser was maximized when the applet was loaded and the bug appears, the browser can be minimized and then restored, and then the applet can get keyboard focus and keyboard events will go to the applet (typing into applet text fields will work).

2. If the browser was not maximized when the applet was loaded and the bug appears, the browser can be resized in any way (even by only one pixel), and then the applet can get keyboard focus and keyboard event will go to the applet.

This bug seems to appear about 25% of the time, apparently randomly. Once it appears, As far as I know, it only happens on Linux. The applet was written with version 1.5.0. The plugin used was 1.6.0, which should work fine.
