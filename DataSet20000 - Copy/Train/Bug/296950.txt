Focus lost when a component is clicked
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; FunWebProducts; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Firefox version 1.4.0.2 - 3

I have Swing applet, loading on Firefox browser running on Red Hat Linux 3.0/ 
4.0 with JRE 1.5.0, I am experiencing a problem. The focus does not get into 
the component which is Clicked, This is found at many scenarios at different 
reproducible Steps, Eg: I have a Jtable and when I click on the row/cell of the 
table the table does not get the focus (Itself and the whole application) does 
not have focus, This happens in JTree also when the program explicitly sets the 
focus on the tree. This Focus problem happens only in Redhat Linux 3.0 and 4.0 
and not in Suse Linux version.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load application on the browser 
2.Run the Application with faster Mouse actions Like right click etc, 
3.Click on a component, where you can visibly feel the Focus is already lost 
4.Use mnemonics/ F5/ enter esc - No visible changes.

Actual Results:  
No Focus , No focus Shifts etc , visible changes.


Expected Results:  
The focus Should be on the component which we selected.

The work around is to click outside the Firefox browser and Click back inside, 
The focus reagined, it works as Normal, But can be reproduced on the same 
browser , same session , By redoing the reproducible steps
