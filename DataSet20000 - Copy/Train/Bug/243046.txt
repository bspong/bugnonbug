Browse a while at slow speeds (dialup) and view fairly big images (few hundred
kilos) on the web. At some point the display will freeze. I can still use the
magical SysRq and kill X Windows and reboot, so I guess the keys still work, but
the display is frozen.

I've noticed it's about the size of the images (as in kilos) not the dimensions
(as in pixels). It has to be images loaded at low speeds, it won't happen with a
local webserver, local intranet or local harddisk which display them instantly.
It also won't happen in a freshly started browser, it takes some time of
constantly viewing such images to produce the freeze.

It doesn't seem to be affected by themes, extensions and so on. It does NOT
happen with the same Firefox version on Windows. It happens with various builds
of Firefox on Linux, from various sources.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. browse for big images (hundred of kilos) at slow network speeds.
2. at some point you get a display freeze.

Actual Results:  
Complete display freeze.

Expected Results:  
Not freeze.
