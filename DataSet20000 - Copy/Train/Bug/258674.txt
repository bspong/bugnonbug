New popup notification bar should give alert similar to IE

In IE, the first time a popup is blocked and the new yellow 'notification bar'
is triggered, there is an alert explaining what has just happened. Firefox used
to have something like this for its popup blocking, but the functionality was
evidently lost when the new popup notication scheme went into effect...
Something similar to IE's method should now be used, as it is VERY easy to not
notice the bar unless you are purposefully looking for it.

Similar individual alerts should probably be implemented for plugins, et cetera
(they are even harder to notice).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to cnn.com
2.you will recieve the new popup notification at the top of the screen
3.were you looking for news? if you were, chances are *quite* likely your eyes
were looking down on the page, and you completely missed subtle chreme-colored
alert at the top.

Actual Results:  
There was no notification

Expected Results:  
There should have been a notification(especially if this was my first time
running firefox), like there used to be for the old popup blocking scheme
