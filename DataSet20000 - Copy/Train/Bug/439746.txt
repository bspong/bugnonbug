I Updated to Firefox 3 and since I had not install the window media player plug in. I saw there was a tester for other file formats like pdf and then I tried to run it. the document didnt load and as a second not while trying to type up this bug my usb keyboard stopped reacting and required me to unplug and replug it in. I did try to reinstall adobe with no luck in fixing this solution. I don't know the reasons for adobe not functioning or my keyboards malfunction but both seemed to start when I installed firefox 3.0 on my windows vista 64bit premium pc.
