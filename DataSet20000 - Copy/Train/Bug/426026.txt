Back/forward buttons disappear when moving from 1.8 to 1.9 if they've been moved
This is a followup bug based on my comment here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=417421#c29

Following on from bug 417421 it doesn't patch the case as follows:

I have all my navigation buttons in my menu toolbar... so I have everything in one line, address bar, search bar, menu.  Moving from .13 to Minefield still makes the back/forward buttons disappear.  Doubly annoying because they don't show up in Toolbars>Customize, they get dumped in the (hidden) navigation toolbar.

Having it set up correctly in Minefield and then moving to 2.0.0.13 still makes the back/forward buttons disappear.

I would expect that Firefox 3 would figure out where the back button is and put the megabutton there even if it's not on the navigation toolbar and that 2.0.0.13 would look for the megabutton and put both the back and forward buttons where it is.

It's a minor issue but I can see people who customize their toolbars being minorly annoyed/confused after upgrading to 3 if it's in the final.

Anyhow by way of providing details, below are excerpts from my localstore.rdf after performing a series of steps.

1. Start with a fresh 2.0.0.13 profile.  Move buttons to menubar, hide navigation toolbar.

<RDF:Description RDF:about="chrome://browser/content/browser.xul#toolbar-menubar"
                   iconsize="small"
                   currentset="back-button,forward-button,stop-button,reload-button,home-button,menubar-items,urlbar-container,spring,search-container,throbber-box" />
<RDF:Description RDF:about="chrome://browser/content/browser.xul#nav-bar"
                   iconsize="small"
                   currentset="__empty"
                   collapsed="true" />

2. Open in Minefield, see that the back/forward buttons are "missing" (they're actually in the navigation toolbar).  Don't make any changes or touch anything, just close.
<RDF:Description RDF:about="chrome://browser/content/browser.xul#toolbar-menubar"
                   iconsize="small"
                   currentset="back-button,forward-button,stop-button,reload-button,home-button,menubar-items,urlbar-container,spring,search-container,throbber-box" />
<RDF:Description RDF:about="chrome://browser/content/browser.xul#nav-bar"
                   iconsize="small"
                   collapsed="true"
                   currentset="unified-back-forward-button,__empty" />

3. Make changes in Minefield to put the buttons where they should be.
<RDF:Description RDF:about="chrome://browser/content/browser.xul#toolbar-menubar"
                   iconsize="small"
                   currentset="unified-back-forward-button,stop-button,reload-button,home-button,menubar-items,urlbar-container,spring,search-container,throbber-box" />
<RDF:Description RDF:about="chrome://browser/content/browser.xul#nav-bar"
                   iconsize="small"
                   currentset="__empty"
                   collapsed="true" />

4. Open in 2.0.0.13 and see that the back/forward buttons are missing.


You can probably see what's going on from there.
