With bookmarks nested three levels deep where levels one and two contain very long bookmarks the third level will sometimes disappear when you try to hover over contents.  I don't believe this is a duplicate of Bug 195031 since that seemed to deal with right clicking and was fixed awhile ago.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open firefox with a new profile
2.Open organize bookmarks and restore attached bookmarks file
3.Open dropdown folder "test" from bookmarks bar. Navigate to "test 2".  Navigate to test3 and try to hover over a bookmark contained in "test 3"
Actual Results:  
Third level dropdown menu immediately disappears

Expected Results:  
While hovering over third level dropdown menu it should remain open

My desktop resolution is set to 1024x768 which may matter since this bug seems to depend on bookmark names being very long.  The bug doesn't occur on my bookmarks folders that are nested three deep without long names nor does it appear on every set of bookmarks with 3 levels with long names.  In my experience I can always reproduce this with the bookmarks set provided but it may not happen with other apparently similar organizations of bookmarks.
