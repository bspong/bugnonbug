Websites that are accessed from a pinned New Tab, are opened in another tab
Created attachment 8763069
Pages visited from a pinned New Tab are openned in a new Tab instead of the pinned tab.mp4

[Affected versions]:
- Firefox 45.0 and up
- Activity Stream 1.1.0-dev

[Affected Platforms]:
- All Windows
- All Mac OS X
- All Linux

[Prerequisites]:
- Latest Activity Stream add-on version (1.1.0-dev) was previously installed on a clean profile.
- Have enough history so that the "Top Sites", "Highlights", "History" areas are populated with visited websites.

[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Open the browser with the profile from prerequisites. 
2. Open Activity Stream New Tab and pin it.
3. Click on a website from Top Sites/Highlights/Recent Activity.

[Expected result]:
- The website is opened in the current(pinned) tab.

[Actual result]:
- The website is opened in another tab.

[Notes]:
- The issue is also reproducible on the Timeline History page, if you pin the tab.
- If a page URL is written in the address bar and accessed, the website is opened in the pinned(current) tab.
- On Firefox builds, without the Activity Stream add-on installed, websites visited from a pinned `about:newtab` page are opened in the same tab.
- Attached a screen recording of the issue.
