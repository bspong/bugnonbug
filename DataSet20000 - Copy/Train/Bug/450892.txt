Firefox  3 shuts itself down spontaneously every few hours. I can't tell if anything in particular triggers this.  It seems to happen more or less randomly, but mostly when I'm clicking on some link (not the same one each time).  It doesn't crash the operating system.  After it happens I get a message that FF has encountered a problem and needs to shut itself down.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  can't figure out what triggers this behavior; sorry!  But it still happens!
2.  ff shuts itself down about every two hours
3.
Actual Results:  
get error message: ff has encountered a problem and needs to shut down; do i want to submit an error report.  I do, and them when I try to re-launch it i'm asked if i want to start a new session or restore the old one.  then it works until the next time it shuts itself down.

Expected Results:  
shouldn't shut itself down.  I never had a problem with the previous version of ff, ver. 2.  does this have something to do with my new ant-virus program, Kaspersky?
