mozilla & firefox seg fault on a Tektronix X Terminal.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20060226 Firefox/1.5

From an X Terminal, I use a terminal window to telnet to another system.  I export my DISPLAY variable.  I can start xclock, dillo, openoffice, and most any other program I choose.  Firefox segfaults.  Session follows:
---
$ export DISPLAY="10.0.0.5:0"
$ firefox
/usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/mozilla-xremote-client: Error: Failed to find a running server.
/usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/mozilla-xremote-client: Error: Failed to find a running server.
No running windows found
/usr/libexec/mozilla-launcher: line 119: 29383 Segmentation fault      "$mozbin" "$@"
firefox-bin exited with non-zero status (139)
---

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. From a Tektronix X term, telnet to an X capable system
2. export DISPLAY
3. start firefox

Actual Results:  
$ export DISPLAY="10.0.0.5:0"
$ firefox
/usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/mozilla-xremote-client: Error: Failed to find a running server.
/usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/mozilla-xremote-client: Error: Failed to find a running server.
No running windows found
/usr/libexec/mozilla-launcher: line 119: 29383 Segmentation fault      "$mozbin" "$@"
firefox-bin exited with non-zero status (139)

Expected Results:  
It should have brought up a window.

It used to work with previous versions.  

A friend of mine mentioned something weird where he was on machine A, ssh'd to B, forwarded his display, used firefox, and while that session was still running, went to machine B, forwarded his display to machine A, and it somehow sniffed out the previous session.  If this were the case, it wouldn't shock me if mozilla tried to do that discovery and it failed because the X Term in question is a rather singular bit of equipment.
