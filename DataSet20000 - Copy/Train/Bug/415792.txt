Firefox periodically returns blank pages in https (webmail, online banking).
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/312.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/312.6

Clicking on links to email in webmail app (https) periodically returns blanks pages eventho the program works fine 98% of the time.  Once a blank page is returned, paging back to the source page and clicking links to new pages returns blank pages even for links that just worked.  In addition, paging back sometimes returns a blank page.  View source shows NORMAL html code for these pages! So, why does firefox return blanks?  Quitting does not help.  Rebooting sometimes helps.  Letting the cookie expire may be important.  At any rate, the next day, the system works fine.  The same web mail (or other https) source works 100% with thunderbird or safari.  Addons include "noscript" - but it is turned off for these pages.  Again, viewsource shows https code that firefox is not rendering, periodically.  Please fix or advise if a known fix exists. Thanks, AL

Reproducible: Sometimes
