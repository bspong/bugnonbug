GTK+ theme is only option for Linux install (why can't linux installs use the same icons as Windows?)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

When comparing Firefox4 installations between Microsoft Windows and Ubuntu Linux, one notices how the icons are different: the back button, forward button, home button, refresh button, etc. appear differently.

Google Chrome allows users the ability to select between a GTK+ theme and the MS-Windows "Classic" theme for Chrome installations. Opera displays the same icons and theme for both Linux and Windows installations.

Why can't Linux Firefox users get the same icons as MS-Windows users get to use?

Firefox needs to offer a setting that will allow users to pick either the GTK+ theme or the Firefox theme that is displayed in MS-Windows.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
A setting should exist like Google Chrome has where users can select for display in Linux the same theme that is default in Windows installations.
