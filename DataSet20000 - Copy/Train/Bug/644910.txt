After clicking in a flash video (i.e. play/pause), I lose the ability to scroll the page.

I was watching videos on several different sites, including Youtube and Huffington Post, where there may be a video that compliments an article. I clicked the video so I could listen to the clip while I read the article, except I couldn't use my mouse wheel to scroll the page any more. I regain the ability if I change tabs, but not if I click the video again. Additionally, when I do regain the ability, scrolling is anything but smooth.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a website with embedded flash videos, like youtube.
2. Check your scrolling ability before clicking in the flash player.
3. If the video autoplays, click the pause button and then restart it.
4. Try to scroll.
5. Try changing tabs and going back.
6. Scroll again. It's pretty erratic.
Actual Results:  
I couldn't scroll the page after clicking in the embedded video, and after changing tabs and going back, I regained the ability, but the scrolling was anything but smooth and difficult to control.

Expected Results:  
I should have been able to scroll after clicking in the embedded video, and it should have been a lot smoother.
