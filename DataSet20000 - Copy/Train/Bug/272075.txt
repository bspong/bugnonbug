etrade's streaming stock quotes java applet (marketcaster) fails to launch
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-GB; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041110 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-GB; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041110 Firefox/1.0

when accessing an etrade account and clicking on the link to
<https://us.etrade.com/e/t/applogic/MarketCasterInfo1> in order to display
streaming stock market quotes, the java applet launches in a seperate window.
The status bar displays <applet etrade.mcaster.Streamer inited>, then it
displays <java.lang.NullPointerException>, at the time JavaEmbeddingPlugin0.8.7
was installed and the window remains blank. Without JavaEmbeddingPlugin0.8.7
installed the behaviour is slightly different, the new window appears, the
status bar states that a connection has been made to us.etrade, the window
resizes and a green line appears forming a sqaure along the inner edges of the
window and the status bar states Done. Java is enabled and the popup window
blocking is disabled

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.login to etrade.com
2.Click of "Quotes & Research" on the website's main tabs
3.Click on "streaming quotes" on in subtab, the java applet should launch in
another window automatically

Actual Results:  
When the new window opens the status bar in the new window displays <applet
etrade.mcaster.Streamer inited>, then it displays
<java.lang.NullPointerException> and the window remains blank, at the time
JavaEmbeddingPlugin0.8.7 was installed and the window remains blank. Without
JavaEmbeddingPlugin0.8.7 installed the behaviour is slightly different, the new
window appears, the status bar states that a connection has been made to
us.etrade, the window resizes and a green line appears forming a sqaure along
the inner edges of the window and the status bar states Done.

Expected Results:  
The market caster java applet should have displayed streaming stock quotes in
real time. The appearence is similar to what can be found at the following
website's demo https://de.etrade.com/flash/mkt_trader_demo/four.html , though
not entirely the same

I spoke to etrade's marketcaster tech support and they stated that they were
aware of the incompatibility of marketcaster with Firefox and said, while there
are incremental updates to marketcaster they had no plans to address the
specific compatibility issue itself. Owing to the encrypted nature of the
website, I've copied the source of the popup window, hope this helps. It should
be noted that market caster works both with IE and Apple's Safari, but not with
camino and, of course, firefox.
