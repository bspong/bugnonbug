If I've been logged into Gmail for a long period of time, my Firefox browser crashes when I try to log out. I'm pretty sure it happens every time my account has been logged in after my computer goes into sleep mode and then brought back into active mode and then logged out of Gmail. The page loads and is responsive as long as I don't log out. The browser doesn't close itself when it crashes, it just becomes unresponsive and the thinking cursor won't go away.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Leave the browser open and logged into Gmail. Allow the computer to go into sleep mode/Energy saver mode.
2. Reactive the computer. Perform tasks within Gmail. 
3. Log out of Gmail.  
Actual Results:  
The open window should turn white and go unresponsive and the "thinking" cursor should be spinning. No matter how long you allow it to process, it will not respond.

Expected Results:  
Logged out of Gmail and loaded the front page.

It's only effected my experience at Gmail.com and only when I take a specific action like trying to log out when I could close the window. I figure this would be a minor inconvenience to me and anyone else experiencing it except that it's on Gmail, which is heavily trafficked by a large population of users.
