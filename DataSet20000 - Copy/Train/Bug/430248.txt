The past 2 Minefield releases have been freezing when opening multiple tabs either via open all in tabs, or by loading a session from session manager extension.

Extensions appear to be involved, and its not just pin pointable to 1 single extension, disabling all extensions fixes the issue.

To attempt to resolve the problem, i disabled all extensions 1 at a time and tested for the lock up, i finally pin pointed the problem to either Flashblock, Flashgot, or an australian english extension, but upon renabling the other extensions the freezes started again.

This leads me to believe that the crash occurs because of the amount of extensions loaded, rather then the extensions themselves. All extensions are up to date, Tabmix plus, session manager and nightly tester tools were the only extensions enabled when the problem was resolved at first, after slowly disabling 1 by one, Adblock, Chromedit+, Console2 and download status bar were still enabled.

Enabling ANY other extension ontop of this causes Minefield to freeze when opening multiple tabs. (25-50 tabs)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install more then 8 firefox extensions (session manager required to load sessions)
2. Surf to a variety of websites, in between 20-45 tabs, and save them to a bookmark folder or as a session
3. Reopen this folder in all tabs, or load a session
Actual Results:  
Minefield will load nearly all of the tabs, and when 3 or 4 are left to load it will completely freeze at 95% cpu usage

Expected Results:  
Minefield should finish loading the tabs without problem as earlier builds and firefox 3 beta 5 does

As i have said though, it can't be tracked back to 1 individual extension, it occurs when a combination exceeding 8 or 9 extensions is used.
