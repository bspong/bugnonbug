Create a DevTools Actor as a backend for the WebExtensions devtools.inspectedWindow API
In Bug 1300584 we are going to implement the WebExtensions `devtools.inspectedWindow.eval` and `devtools.inspectedWindow.reload` API methods.

This two methods provides to a devtools page (an invisible context associated to an opened toolbox) or a devtools panel (a new devtools panel registered from a devtools context, usually the devtools page) two features that are similar to the one already provided by the existent DevTools actors (e.g. the webconsole actor has an evaluateJS API method and the tab actor has a reload API method), but they also provides additional features that doesn't seem to fit in the existent devtools actors:

- inspectedWindow.eval has to return a json serialization of the result, instead of an object grip
- inspectedWindow.eval supports optional frameURL, contextSecurityOrigin and useContentScriptContext parameters, which affect where the javascript will be evaluated (in frame with a specified url or origin, or in the content script context of the caller extension)
- inspectedWindow.reload supports an optional injectedScript parameter, which will be evaluated before any other javascript code in all the sub-frames created during the next reload

The goal of this issue is to provide a new DevTools actor which can be used as the backend of the WebExtensions devtools.inspectedWindow API implementation.
