A menu with absolutely positioned submenus correctly displays the default submenu bar on startup. Clicking on another main menu options triggers a javascript effect that changes the submenu bar without refreshing the page. The CSS style changes for the active main menu item work. The new submenu links are not visible, the submenu bar is visually empty, but the links are there and active, the URLs for them show in the status bar on mousing over their expected position and they function correctly when clicked.  The javascript menu effect is using the Prototype and Scriptaculous libraries.  These menus worked in 1.5 and previously.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on a main menu item.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
The main menu highlight changes to the selected item, but the menu bar underneath appears empty.  The links are available and work, just not visible.

Expected Results:  
The main menu highligh changes to the selected item, and that item's submenu appears in the menu bar underneath.

The menu is in a separate frame, and the menu changes are done with Prototype and Scriptaculous effects.
