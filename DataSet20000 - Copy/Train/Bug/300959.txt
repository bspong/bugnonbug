Only happens at www.msnbc.com and only on some links there, and only since they
recently "improved" their site.  Also happened in Firefox 1.0.4.

Attempt to print some pages, and it just sits there while CPU use goes to 100%
and just sits there.  Have to switch to another program window and then back to
Firefox and the only cure is to close Firefox and restart.

Reproducible: Always

3.

Actual Results:  
Printing window opens and then it just sits there.  Ctrl-Alt-Del and check of
performance shows CPU at 100%

Expected Results:  
Printed page.
