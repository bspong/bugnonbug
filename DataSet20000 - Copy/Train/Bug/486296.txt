Cache problem – The code updates, but not the display
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.8) Gecko/2009032608 Firefox/3.0.8

I have a problem that the cache doesn't update. Most pages work fine, including AJAX pages like GMail or Facebook (I saw there was other bugs for this).

At least on the page http://halogen.no (a bit hard to tell if there are others, as I don't know what I should have seen ...) I have now a recurring problem that the cache doesn't update the display. I've tried to force refresh any way I can think of (any command/alt/ctrl + refresh combination I could think of). 

There is a couple of news items on the bottom of the page, and when I Shift-click the refresh button, it actually breifly shows the new ones, but when the page is finished loading, it shows the old one again.

When I look in the source code, it is updated with the new news items, so it seems it's just the display of the page that somehow insists on showing the rendring of an old version!

Restarting Firefox does not help. Even clearing the cache and offline website data from Tools > Clear Private Data causes no difference.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://halogen.no
2. See the two latest blog/news items bottom left
3. Wait for an update ...
4. Try to refresh the page
Actual Results:  
The code has changed, a forced refresh briefly flashes new content, but ends up showing the old ones.

Expected Results:  
The page should have been refreshed just by visiting it after an update. At the very least it should refresh after being forced to do so, but even that would be a bug.
