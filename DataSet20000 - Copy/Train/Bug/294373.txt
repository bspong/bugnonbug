Firefox does not display correctly when using alternate Windows shells
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Firefox, and any web page, do not draw on the screen correctly under alternate 
Windows shells, such as geoShell.  geoShell is open source and available at 
www.geoshell.com.

Firefox partially draws to the screen at launch.  Some buttons and other UI 
elements will draw correctly and function.  Other elements will not appear 
until the mouse moves over the UI element.  Firefox will retain an image of 
whatever is behind it.  This state remains until the user moves the mouse over 
the UI element.  Firefox will not, however, completely paint its window.

The html display area does not draw correctly either.  It exhibits the same 
problems as the rest of the UI.

If the URL is changed then the display area will show a partial update.  Most 
item at the URL will not display.

Refresh, maximize, minimize, etc. do not cause Firefox to display correctly.

Internet Explorer continues to work correctly under the alternate shell.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install an alternate shell such as www.geoshell.com
2. Run Firefox
3.

Actual Results:  
The problems as described above.

Expected Results:  
Display the Firefoxe UI correctly.  Display any URL correctly.
