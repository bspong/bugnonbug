The table of directions shows correctly on the first page but subsequent pages
appear to move over to the left of the paper and lose information.

Directions stop half way through, in the reproducable example the directions
stop at step 48 out of 83
Then jumps to information that is displayed after the table.

Altering margins has no effect.

Viewing other sites the tables align fine. I've only noticed this problem on
this site.
