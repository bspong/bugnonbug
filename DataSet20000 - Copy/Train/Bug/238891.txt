Firefox's window is resized too big with the following Javascript-code. It does
not believe if GNOME would tell the screen is shorter than it actually is,
because GNOME Panel is taking some space from the screen.

It may be the problem because Firefox is not GNOME-application, but it bothers
still and would like to have some way to prevent it resizing under the GNOME Panel.

This following Javascript in the HEAD-element of the HTML-page does it:

#lt# SCRIPT language="JavaScript" #gt# #lt# !--
if (self != top) {top.location=self.location;}
self.moveTo(0,0)
self.resizeTo(screen.availWidth,screen.availHeight)
self.focus();
//--> #lt#/SCRIPT#gt#


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the URI, which has Javascript which resizes window to its maximum. See
Details for the Javascript-code in the HEAD-element of the HTML-page.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
The window of the Firefox is resized so big the GNOME Panel hides the bottom of
the window.

Expected Results:  
The max-height of the window should be decreased by the height of the GNOME
Panel ,as does Galeon.
