Web access to Domino Lotus notes mail (at my college), frequent alerts and no attachments

At irregular times while using webmail (Lotus notes, Queens College NYC) on Mac 10.4, an alert comes up: "The page at https://mail1.qc.cuny.edu says:
Domino Web Access Warning. Sorry, we were unable to process your request at this time. If you are unable to continue working in your mail file, please dismiss this warning and then select View, Reload from your browser's menu."

Once dismissed, there is no interruption in the functioning of the app (though during composing a new message one has to return to the right window); the only functional problem is not being able to use attachments.

I've contacted the college help desk and all they can suggest is trying a different (earlier) version of Firefox. While this is being done in MINEFIELD, since I just downloaded it to try it, the same thing happens in 3.0.3.

The college help desk is at 718-997-4444.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Write new mail (at irregular times during the writing of message)
