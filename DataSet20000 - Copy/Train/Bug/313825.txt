Access Denied error when I use https going to port 448 with virtual host subdomain of site

I'm on a team that looks after the website at www.adelaide.edu.au.  We have several virtual hosts on our server, such as commerce.adelaide.edu.au.  Our secure certificate is a wildcard one, for *.adelaide.edu.au, so it *should* cover subdomains such as www or commerce or anything really.
However, when I try to view any page on one of the virtual host subdomains in firefox (on linux) over https, it gets an Access Denied error.  I've tried it in IE (on windows and a Mac), Epiphany (on linux) and Firefox (on a Mac) and it worked fine.
So the common themes for it not working seem to be:
1. firefox
2. linux
3. virtual host subdomain
4. https (it does redirect to port 448 when going to https, so that may actually be the issue)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to https://commerce.adelaide.edu.au/ in linux firefox
2.
3.
