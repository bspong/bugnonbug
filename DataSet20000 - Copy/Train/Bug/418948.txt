When scrolling a page that uses a transparent background on some elements with a fixed background on the body of the page, the scrolling is tremendously slow and sluggish, and CPU usage shoots up. I'm not sure what the exact circumstances of the problem are, but these are the circumstances in which I can reproduce it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the URL given.
2. In the very bottom right corner of the page, use the 'Forum theme' drop-down selection box to change the theme to 'Spaced out'.
3. Scroll the page and look at CPU usage as well as what is rendered in the browser window.
Actual Results:  
The screen updates very slowly and Firefox responds very slowly to input, as it is using a lot of CPU resources (up to 90% on my system) to render the screen while it is scrolled.

Expected Results:  
Should render the page much faster, with no noticeable lag. Compare the scroll speed and CPU usage when using other themes on that site, such as the default 'Red'n'Black' skin.

Computer is an AMD Athlon XP 2600 with 1.5 GB RAM. Using default Firefox theme.
