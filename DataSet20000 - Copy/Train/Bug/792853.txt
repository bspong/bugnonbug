Steps to reproduce:

Using mouse scrolling (or scroll bar), navigating the page using PgUp/PgDn/Home/End keys, trying to fill out forms or visiting some pages with scripted content.


Actual results:

The displayed content is not changed; no page movement, no text appears in the forms and scripted portions of pages are not displayed correctly or at all. When switching to different workspace or window (even other firefox window or tab) and back the page changes correctly based on the previous navigation action, typing or page-script actions. 
One nice example of incorrect display of scripted content is http://acid3.acidtests.org/ which sometimes finishes with result 1/100 and no rendered picture, then upon reload on 48/100 or 56/100 and partial rendering. In all cases switching to other window and back produces correct 100/100 with fully rendered picture.
I have tried beta of Firefox 16 with no improvement (this was binary downloaded directly from mozilla.org , version 15.0.1 was from linux distribution Gentoo and compiled on my machine). It is not affected by different settings of smooth scrolling, autoscrolling or hardware acceleration.
Since I haven't seen it reported (only on one ubuntu forum without reply) I suspect it might be graphic card related and so not very common.


Expected results:

The page should be redrawn based on navigation action, typed text should appear and scripted content should change the page immediately without having to use the switching elsewhere and back to the window method.
