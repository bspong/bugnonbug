When viewing certain flash files in Firefox, the tab interface will become unavailable using mouse clicks. Ctrl+Tab still works. Tested on Win XP and Win Vista. If I click another tab nothing will happen until I navigate to a different page. Once I do that, the tab I clicked will gain focus.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View embedded SWF files that meet the above criteria (example: http://peaceoutside.org/dots1.php) with other tabs open
2. Click another tab
Actual Results:  
Other tab will not gain focus until the page with the flash is navigated away from.

On the pages that exhibit this problem, the loading bar in the status bar at the bottom of Firefox usually looks like it's is 99% complete, but never finishes.
