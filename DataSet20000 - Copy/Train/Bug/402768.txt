After crashing, it takes too long to restart Firefox (with hundreds of tabs to restore)

After faulting, even after *three* years of a reported bug, #263160 which is well documented and should have been cleared by now -- Firefox fails to star restore itself in a reasonable fashion.  With 41 windows & 338 tabs it takes over 15 minutes of CPU time on a Pentium IV to restore itself.  I watched the CPU usage during the time frame.  The network usage was busy for a period (perhaps 2/3 of the time), but the CPU usage was busy for a much longer period.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Crash a Firefox session due to excessive CPU use.
2. Attempt to restore that Firefox session.
Actual Results:  
Firefox takes excessively long times when reinvoked to return to a functional state if the load prior to its crashing was "heavy".

Expected Results:  
There is no reason why Firefox should not return to a functional state immediately after its re-invocation.  All restoration of "previous state" information should be conducted in background mode.

Make a stronger effort to break it and stress test it before releasing it.

I am going to do that in the future and I strongly suspect Firefox will bite it someplace around 80 windows or 700+ tabs on a Pentium IV.  (I.e. between Firefox and X you will eat 100% of the CPU).   That should not be the case.  On a reasonable system the program in front of my face gets 100% of my attention.  Everything else gets secondary attention.  If Firefox is not programmed as such it is not programmed properly.

If the last window, or the active window do not have priority than the design is fundamentally flawed.  Even during a 15 minute CPU time suck down during a Firefox restoration the primary active Firefox window should be functional.

And I am talking about Linux here -- I could care less about Windows.
