Minefield crashes when right click is used to try to use new tab
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a5pre) Gecko/20070514 Minefield/3.0a5pre

I install Minefield (latest-trunk from mozilla ftp {latest win32.exe})
I startup Minefield (I run it full-screen with resolution 1920x1200 if that makes any difference) and I get a blank screen (should really by my home page (www.google.com)... but I will post that in another bug) so I type in the address bar: www.digg.com , and so I right click on a hyperlink to an article so that I can read it in another tab, but then Minefield crashes and I get the standard Windows "Firefox.exe has crashed" window and the Firefox quality feedback agent window (which I have used to send in a report)

This works in different ways at different places
Example:
For www.digg.com: whenever you just right click on a hyperlink Minefield will crash
For www.mozilla.com: whenever you right click the menu will come down but when you say open in a new tab  Minefield will crash in the same manner as described above.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Latest Minefield nightly-trunk on Windows XP (I use x86)
2.Go to digg.com 
3.Right click on any article 
4.Minefield will crash
Actual Results:  
Minefield Crashes and 2 windows come up
1. Typical Windows "Firefox.exe has crashed..."
2. Firefox Quality Feedback Agent comes up wanting me to submit the error (I have done so already)

Expected Results:  
The right click menu should come down and I should be able to click "Open in a new tab" and the new tab should come up with no problem

PC config:
O/S: x86 Windows XP
Screen Res.: 1920x1200 WUXGA (running nVidia hardware and latest forceware driver)
