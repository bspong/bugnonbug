I encountered differences between Restore Session Dialog and about:sessionretore.
This issue is always reproducible.
I have to mention that i used a new clean profile everytime I tested it.

Steps to perform:
1.Open a few tab in Firefox
2.Kill the Firefox.exe process from the task manager
3.Open Firefox,and the Restore Session dialog can be seen.Don't click the Restore button,but instead open a new tab and enter in the location bar about:sessionrestore(you will be shown in the dropdown list to switch to the restore session,DON'T CLICK IT,just type about:sessionrestore).

Actual results:
Killing the firefox.exe process quits Firefox and after that openning Firefox again is showing the Restore Session dialog.Openning a new tab and typing about:sessionrestore isn't openning the Restore Session dialog with my tabs and windows, but instead a new session restore dialog.

Expected results.
Typing about:sessionrestore in the second tab should open the Restore session dialog with my tabs and windows that were opened in Firefox before killing it.
