Firefox stops responding to mouse clicks, in a seemingly random manner.  Keyboard input is still accepted.  Other applications respond normally to the mouse.  Switching focus to the Windows Task Manager and back to firefox fixes the problem: sometimes only for one click, sometimes for a long period of time, but most generally for a few clicks.
The problem happens more frequently if firefox is being used via remote desktop, but also sometimes when on the machine locally.
Sometimes mouse input is partially accepted: you can do most things, but you can't select something in a dropdown.  You can drop it down, but the highlight won't follow the mouse, and clicking does not change the selection.  Switching to task manager does not fix this problem; you must navigate the boxes via keyboard.
This has been going on for a few pushed-upgrades now, but unfortunately I'm not sure how many.

I've got a bunch of plugins, can list as needed.  (Is there no way to get a dump of them into the bug?)
