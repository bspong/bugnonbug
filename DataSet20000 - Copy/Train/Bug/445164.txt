After clearing private data, the information may still remain in the .sqlite file although it can no longer be accessed by Firefox and SQLite.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure you haven't cleared your data in a long time (a few weeks)
2. Close Firefox.
3. Back up your data in your profile folder.
4. Start Firefox and go to Tools > Clear Private Data.
5. Check all the boxes and press the "Clear Private Data Now" button.
6. Open a .sqlite file (cookies.sqlite, for example) with a text editor.
Actual Results:  
The sqlite file is still the same size, and except for some changes in the beginning, it is identical. Personal data can can be easily read, since it is in plain text.

Expected Results:  
No traces of the user's data should be left. If a user clears private data, there must be a reason for doing so, so it should not be so easily recoverable.

A solution could be to run VACUUM after the data is cleared.

This has been tested on Linux and Windows XP.
