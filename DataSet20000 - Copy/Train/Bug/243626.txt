i have noticed everytime i goto any web page firefox seems to load from the
cache rather then check for new updates.  everytime i have to clear the cache
and reload the page to see a differnce.  this does not happen with just me.  i
have turned all of my friends into mozilla addicts, and they complain about the
same problem.  we go on alot of public forums where people update their
signeratures and avatars, but in order to see a change we have to clear the
cache.  this even happens when i make changes to web pages i am personally
designing.  it is just annoying. sure you can turn off cache, but i doubt
everyone will do that.  so it remains a problem.  this mainly pertains to
pictures only...text loads fine.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1.make a page with a grapphic
2.change the graphic...different size if you wish.
3.reload the page

Actual Results:  
when changing the graphic to a different size, it loads the new size with the
old image...it looks distorted.

Expected Results:  
loaded the new image properly, rather then from the cache.
