Firefox 3 shows only printer as "Print to LPR"; does not print until Firefox is closed or killed.

EVERY package of Firefox 3 that I've tried, both regular releases and betas, exhibit this problem on this SuSE 10.2 machine (HP Pavillion a1710n hardware).  Where Firefox 2 printed normally, Firefox 3 appears not to print at all.  However, closing or killing the application results in all spooled pages being printed normally.  (In addition to the inconvenience, this behavior causes my wife to print additional copies because not sure what she'd already invoked, and this uses reams of paper and a lot of ink.)

This problem manifests ONLY on Firefox 3.  Seamonkey, Firefox 2, and T'bird all print normally when invoked.  I have tried all sorts of variants in the config file (as visible in about:config) with no improvement.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Attempt to print any page.  Dialog box appears.
2.Select "Print".  Progress box appears.  Printer just sits there.
3.Kill or close browser.  Printing commences.
Actual Results:  
Printout appears once Firefox is terminated, not before.  Any number of spooled pages appear in good order.

Expected Results:  
Should begin to print as invoked, same as Firefox 2.

If you advise what you wish, I'll send any files you ask, or give you a login on this machine along with a logical DNS name so you can see what I see.  I've been hoping a fix would turn up in newer revisions, but not yet . . .

BTW, we run this browser just about stock.  No fancy themes.
