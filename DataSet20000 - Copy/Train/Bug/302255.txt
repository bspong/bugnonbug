IBM Remote Supervisor Adapter Remote Control Crashes Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U;Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050719 Red Hat/1.0.6-1.4.1 Firefox/1.0.6

The IBM Remote Supervisor Adapter has an IP KVM built into it, which loads a
java applet to control my IBM server.  The first time this page loads, it
usually works fine.  The second time it loads, a few seconds later, firefox just
quits with no explanation.  In windows, when this happens, the remote control
pop-up window continues to operate, but the main window hangs.  I believe this
to be partially a bug in the RSA card, but firefox doesn't seem to be handling
it very well either.

While this isn't happening on a public web page, I can provide ethereal dumps of
the problem, and perhaps provide access to the interface to a trusted Firefox
developer.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log into RSA card
2.Select remote control and start one of the remote control interfaces.
3.Close the interface.
4.Start the interface again

Actual Results:  
Firefox disappears as if I killed it.  Again, in windows, the main window of
Firefox hangs, although the remote ocntrol window java applet still operates.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should continue to run.  If I was lucky, some error message would show
up, but at the very least it should just not show a web page result.  But
crashing is never the intended result.

No error given when firefox crashes.  If there is a debugging option I should
provide it on the console I'd be happy to give the result.
