Add-on updates prevent browsing.

I use my browser to visit sites on the world-wide-web. When there are updates to extensions, I am prevented from viewing websites, due to two input screens. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have an extension that needs an update.
2.Open browser, and view "you have updates" screen. 
3.Install updates, and wait while this happens.
4.Browser is non-functional until you click "ok" when updates are finished.
Actual Results:  
Required to click "ok" once updates are applied to add-ons.

Expected Results:  
No user-input is necessary when a task is completed as expected.

"Click to continue" is to be reserved for unexpected events. Successfully installing updates is not one of those such events. If I have updates, and you can't do them seamlessly, at least automatically forward me to the browsing I WAS TRYING TO DO before the update reared its ugly head. 

It is NEVER ok to have to click on a button to continue, when that was the expected result.
