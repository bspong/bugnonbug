While catching up on a (new to me) webcomic, I got a hard hang several times.  One of the pages is http://sorethumbs.keenspot.com/d/20060213.html, however I had the problem occur on a page somewhere in the January (i.e. 200601xx) timeframe as well.  Didn't log that one.

The hang is present when Firefox is started in Safe Mode as well.

Naturally, MSIE 8 doesn't show the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Start FF (safe mode or not)
2.  Paste the URL above into the location bar.
3.  Wait a bit; the main image seems to get ~50% of the way through rendering when it tanks.
Actual Results:  
The browser became unresponsive, clicking the X button eventually gets the Windows "Really kill it?" dialog.

Expected Results:  
Continued being a functional web browser, allowing me to scroll around, select links, etc.

Problem shows in safe mode as well is full mode.
