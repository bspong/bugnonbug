Opening a youtube link from Thunderbird to Firefox v10 wont play in Firefox.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux i686; rv:10.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0.1
Build ID: 20120210021051

Steps to reproduce:

I am running Kubuntu v11.10, kernel 3.2.0-9, Thunderbird 9.0, and Firefox 10.0.1.

Firefox is closed.

In Thunderbird I click any link in an email, which opens Firefox. I go to YouTube and try to play a video.


Actual results:

Nothing. The video will not play.

If I open Firefox "natively", and click on same Thunderbird link, then all subsequent YouTubes play.


Expected results:

YouTube videos should play regardless of how Firefox was opened (natively or from a Thunderbird link).

I have already tested MANY other scenarios. Results:

This is NOT a problem on my Linux and Firefox v9.0. All videos play either way.

This is NOT a problem in XP operating system with same versions of TB and FF. All videos play either way.

In my Linux the problem remains if I run FF in Safe move or reinstall FF v10.

In my Linux the problem remains if I replace Adobe Flash Player with Gnash (open source replacement).

In my Linux the problem disappears if I open links in Google-Chrome or Chromium instead of Firefox.

In my Linux the problem DISAPPEARS if I INACTIVATE Adobe Flash Player plugin, but then I cannot play any Flash videos.
