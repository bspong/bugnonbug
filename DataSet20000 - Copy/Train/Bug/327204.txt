When checking inbox mail list, 5 of 7 boxes above will not hilite. (Two boxes stay hilited.)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/85.8.5 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/85.8.1
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.5.0.1

I have Firefox 1.5.0.1on my G-4 eMac.  Presently, I have one major
problem with this update.  When I access my email on Comcast.net,
which is hi-speed cable, I have no problem deleting messages while
in the message.

But, if I list my inbox messages, and check the block to the left of
the message, five of the selections above, "REPLY", "REPLY ALL",
"FORWARD",  "REPORT AS SPAM" and "DELETE", will not hilite.
So the only way I can delete my messages is to actually open the
message and delete it after reading it.

This does not happen with my former firefox browser, which was
version 1.0.3.

NONE of my other browsers have this problem, which include
Safari, Internet Explorer, Camino, Netscape, or Opera.
