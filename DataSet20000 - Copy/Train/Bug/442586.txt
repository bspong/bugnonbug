Firefox 3 is confused, thinks it's having unexpected shut-downs, but isn't actually.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

I have not noticed a pattern of pages or anything that causes this specifically, but about 1/3 to 1/2 of the times I've exited Firefox 3, it pops up with an error message that says Firefox 3 has suffered from an unexpected shut-down, would I like to restore my session or quit. I've yet to click "send feedback report" because I wasn't sure if I could file it correctly and decided to point it out on here. Firefox is NOT shutting itself down, I am manually closing it because I'm done with the internet, not because of any problems. I don't know if I'm closing it unexpectedly or if it's a combination of my add-ons, or if the pages I'm on have a lot of media. It's not even an issue that bothers me, but I thought you would be interested in knowing. I doubt it will help, but it the case it does, the add-ons I use are: Google Toolbar, GaiArch Toolbar, and AdBlock Plus.
