Firefox 36.0a2 Print Edit 13.3 issue.JPG

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:36.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/36.0
Build ID: 20141207004006

Steps to reproduce:

(with Print Edit 13.3 Add-on added and enabled in Firefox Dev Edition 36.0a2)
1. go to any site (ex. http://www.usnews.com/)
2. go to File (top of browser window), then Print Edit
3. make any edits (delete any boxes you wish)
4. click the Preview button (top center of window)
5. click the Print button (top left corner of window)


Actual results:

after you click the Print button, nothing happens: no additional menu, no error messages, and (most importantly) nothing prints (no job is sent to the printer)


Expected results:

after you click on the Print button, a Print pop-up window should have opened. In this Print pop-up window, there are 3 boxes: Printer, Print range, and Copies.

In the Printer box:
'Name' drop down menu: you can select which printer to send the print job to 
'Properties' button: you can open the Properties of the printer in Name drop down
'Print to file' check box: you can also chose to Print to file if you wish

In the Print range box: 3 radio buttons: 'All', 'Pages' with a from box and a to box, 'Selection'

In the Copies box: 'Number of copies' count box and a 'Collate' check box

After making all of the necessary selections, which ever printer you chose should have gotten the print job.

This issue began occurring after the recent update to 36.0a2

I have installed an older version of Firefox (35.0) and added Print Edit 13.3 Add-on and am able to make use of this feature that way (using Firefox 35.0 and Print Edit 13.3 to print edited web pages).
