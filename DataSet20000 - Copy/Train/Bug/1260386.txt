Global search in sources fails with two TypeErrors
Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to www.idnes.cz (Czech news site)
2. Open debugger, and start global search, i.e., type "!something" into the searchbox.

Expected result:
The global search shows some results.

Actual result:
No search results are shown, and after a while, two unhandled promise rejections are reported in the browser console:

Full Message: TypeError:  is not iterable
Full Stack: onError@resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource://devtools/client/debugger/content/actions/sources.js:254:1

Full Message: TypeError: text is undefined
Full Stack: GlobalSearchView.prototype<._doSearch@chrome://devtools/content/debugger/views/global-search-view.js:160:11

What happens?

The page loads a document with inline scripts from a misbehaving URL: http://bbnaut.ibillboard.com/g/ca2
This URL sometimes resets the connection, sometimes returns 304 status code... the result is that loading the source from debugger throws a NS_BASE_STREAM_CLOSED, and that error is not handled correctly by the debugger code.

The issue can be reproduced only when the idnes.cz page is loaded for the first time. On repeated visits, cookies are set and different resources are loaded. I open a private window when I want to reproduce the bug.

I tried to create a minimal test case (nodejs script that serves minimal set of requests), but then I discovered bug 1259743 and had to give up. I'll try again when creating a test.
