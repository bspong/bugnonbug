Firefox crashes when quitting with multiple modal dialogs open

I am able to crash my Firefox 1.0.4 when I attempt to exit while staring at the
cookie listing from within the preference panel.

I noticed the problem since I switched on to disposable cookies for all but the
websites I trust, and I wanted to check if the list got correctly cleared the
first times. By accident I hit Apple-Q to exit and I crashed Firefox. After
reproducing it on purpose, I'm fairly confident this is reproducable, at least
on the OS X platform.

The "bug" shouldnt be too dangerous as it requires an intentional process, and
there is easy work-around (just exit with the window closed!).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set cookies preferences to flush on exit.
2. Get some trash cookies browsing sites eg follow links from news.google.com
3. Open the preferences, go to cookie security, and display the cookie list
4. Try to exit : Apple-Q
Actual Results:  
Window disappear (but you can still notice the empty frame of the preference panel).
Then "Application Firefox has crashed" and the talkback agent appears.

Expected Results:  
Just exit :)-
