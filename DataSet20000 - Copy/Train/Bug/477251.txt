Running FF305 intercepts inbound X from remote FF

When I have FF305 open on a Linux/X box then try to display FF running on a different LAN Linux machine (via the X protocols `xhost +` and $DISPLAY=remote,0.0), the FF305 appears to hijack the inbound X and start a fresh local instance of FF305.

The other order runs fine:  When FF305 is not running, the remote FF can be started as expected and continues even after FF305 locally started.

This might be more a (performance?) "feature" than a bug.  I can see situations where using the remote FF as a relay rather than as a renderer would reduce network traffic.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  xhost +  then Open FF305
2.  [remote machinevia ssh]  export DISPLAY=machine1,0.0  then run FF
3.  examine FF opened (file:///home) and see it is local, not remote.
Actual Results:  

file:///home , Bookmarks, etc displayed is of local machine, not remote.  Closing this instance closes _all_ FF instances on local machine

Expected Results:  

file:///home should be of remote machine


This is only an X Windows System issue because MS-Windows does not natively allow remote display of running sessions.
