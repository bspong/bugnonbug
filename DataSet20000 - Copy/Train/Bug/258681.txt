OK, I have messed around with the updated stylesheet switcher and I think I have
found a (potential) bug.

Lets say you are a new user: 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a site with multiple stylesheets. (Like http://www.w3.org/Style/)
2. You see the AltSS icon in the statusbar, mess with it, appear amazed, and
browse away from the site with “No Style” set.
3. You go to a site with only one stylesheet (Like http://www.espn.com/) and the
AltSS icon does not appear.

Actual Results:  
With “No Style” set, the site appears to be messed up.
This will frustrate new users.

Expected Results:  
From the new user's standpoint: the website should look normal.

Because the AltSS icon does not appear on sites with only one stylesheet, the
average user will not know how to fix it using the menubar option (arguably, the
icon is more visible to the user than the menubar option). Considering that most
users don’t even know what stylesheets are, user troubleshooting is also
extremely difficult.

Solutions:
1) Remove the “No Style” menuitem from the AltSS icon menupopup. You can still
disable stylesheets via the menubar. If the user disables through the menu,
he/she can realistically recover from the above scenario. -> I like this best,
it is easiest to implement and least confusing to the average user.
2) Change “No Style” for the AltSS toolbar icon to be a temporary/site-only
setting to match the non-persistent nature of the listed alternate stylesheets
-> May have a localization impact, but this is more intuitive than the current
setup.
3) Show AltSS icon on all sites with a stylesheet. -> Not very (new) user friendly.
