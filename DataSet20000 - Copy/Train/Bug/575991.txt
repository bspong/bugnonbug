Here i have a Fritzbox 7270 with a USB - HD (Netdrive) pluged to the Fritzbox. When a Filetransfer is running to the Fritzbox USB - HD Drive via Windows Explorer and Firefox is startet, the Transfer breaks up with a Network Error Message.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Step 1. Connect a Netdrive (Y:) for Example \\fritz.box\SEAGATE-ST3160212A-01
Step 2. Open a Windows Explorer and select the connectet Netdrive (Y:) it will be the Target Drive.
Step 3. Open a nother Windows Explorer and select a HD on the Computer that containst the Datafile (Source Drive). The Datafile should be a big File, while short Files are very fast transfered.
Step 4. Start the Filetransfer by Drag&Drop the Datafile.
Step 5. If the Filetransfer is running, start Firefox by 10% or 20% or xx% of complete from the Filetransfer. If Firefox startet, the Filetransfer is break up with a Network Error Message.
Step 6. To check out that this is not a general Network Problem make the Steps 2 - 4 again. But at Step 5 start for Firefox the Windows Internet Explorer. Here it gives no Problem when the IE is startet, the Filetransfer will not break up.
Step 7. Install FileZilla an make the Filetransfer with FileZilla, if the Filetransfer is running, start Firefox and yet the Filetransfer will also not break up when Firefox starts.
Actual Results:  
It is at all Time the same Result. When Firefox starts, the Filetransfer is breakup when the Filetransfer is runnig with the Windows Explorer.

Expected Results:  
The Software should not break the Filetransfer, look at the IE.

No other Information, it is a Problem that occours on Vista 64bit and Windows 7 64bit. And i think that WinXP has the same Problem.
