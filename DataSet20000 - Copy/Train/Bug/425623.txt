Automatically select client certificate is incorrectly defaulted to OFF

This is an old bug from NS4.7 that was fixed in both NS4.72 and IE5.01 after much user complaint.

FF should ask the user to select a client certificate IF THE CERTIFICATE HAS NEVER BEEN USED BEFORE --or-- if AUTOMATIC SELECTION IS OFF, however the DEFAULT setting for AUTOMATICALLY SELECT CERTIFICATE should be TRUE.

This results in new client certificates generating a single user confirmation, the first time a certificate is used, but then behaves nicely.

If the default setting for AUTOMATICALLY SELECT CERTIFICATE is OFF (as in release 2.0.0.13) and the first page visited has a large number of SSL accessed items, the user is presented with many successive pop-ups all asking which certificate to use. (Remember that no-one uses SSL connection caching on the server, because it does not work correctly / consistently in most browsers)
