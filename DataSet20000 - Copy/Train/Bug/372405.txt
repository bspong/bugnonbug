If you open the Google Checkout (it comes at the bottom of the page when you are logged in and visit http://www.google.com/ig?hl=en), and click on the Signup Now button. The next page is shown partially, and the Firefox hangs. (I need to kill it)

I am using the Firefox from CVS, but this problem can be reproduced with latest nightly build.

The same page when opened using Konqueror, results in a hang for several seconds. Then Konqueror reports that KHTML is not responding, and I may or may not continue browsing the page. Clicking on continue results in page displayed with incorrectly placed elements, otherwise correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://www.google.com/checkout/signupbonus_google.html#utm_campaign=acct10&utm_source=igoogle
2. Click on Signup Now image button
3. 
Actual Results:  
Firefox hangs

Expected Results:  
Firefox should display the page

I am using Customize Google, Google adblock, and Nightly tester tools extension.
