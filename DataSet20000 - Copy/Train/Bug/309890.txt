High CPU usage, and increasing memory consumption upon opening specific URL
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050908 Firefox/1.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050908 Firefox/1.4

Just opening the specified URL, the CPU usage keeps steady at [70..90]%, and
memory consumption keeps steadily incresing, at a high rate (in less than a
minute it went from ~20mb, to over 150mb). Closing that single tab drops both
parameters, but memory consumption is still a little high (perhaps some caching
or something).  When left a few minutes to see what happened, it eventually
crashed (and, before that, the UI became ever less responsive). Tested on:

- Firefox 1.4 (Deer Park Beta 1, 1.8b4, Gecko/20050908, wXP-SP2): shows bug
- Firefox 1.0.7 (1.7.12, Gecko/20050919, wXP-SP2): works fine

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open Task Manager or any resource monitor (optional, you can feel the browser
less responsive)
2. open http://www.onlamp.com/pub/wlg/7887 while watching the monitor 
3. wait a few seconds

Actual Results:  
CPU usage: 70% < x < 90%
Firefox's Memory Usage: grew at a high rate (more than 60mb a minute)
Browser responsiveness: crawling

Expected Results:  
Keep it resource usage as low as possible.
