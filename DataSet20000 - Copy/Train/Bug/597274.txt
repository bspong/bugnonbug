Silverlight web sites lock up mozilla
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.3 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/6.0.472.59 Safari/534.3
Build Identifier: 3 and 4

Silverlight applications lock up firefox. I tried astajulian.com on version 3 and version 4 (beta) running on my computer, both would lock up. Others trying to view this site have mixed problems, mostly consisting of a blank white screen with nothing displaying at all. I tested the site on my computers and others' computers running all of the other popular browsers such as IE and chrome. Website runs with no problems. Please have a look and let me know what you can find out.

Justin Julian.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to www.astajulian.com
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
lockup as soon as you try to transition to another screen from the main screen, although for some, the site locks up immediately.

Expected Results:  
Of course, I would expect the site to work the same way it does for all other browsers.

Silverlight is already compatible with all other major browsers. Failing to incorporate this technology on Mozilla will negatively affect its relevance in the internet community.
