Uplift recent awesomebar improvements to Firefox 50
[Tracking Requested - why for this release]:

We made various improvements to Firefox 51's awesomebar that will fix the following issues:

a. Enter sometimes is not delayed until the first result comes, that means when typing fast sometimes we may open the expected url, sometimes a search page. The behavior is not consistent.
b. Enter sometimes is ignored and handled later, at the wrong time, that means we may visit a "random" page from user's history.
c. Enter may be delayed by a long time, even 2 or 3 seconds, that means from when the user presses Enter to when we start loading the page, we could be waiting that time.

Fixing this requires all the recent patches we landed, that is:
1. partial uplift of Bug 1180944. Only the autocomplete code part, not the one-off feature, since other patches are built on top of that autocomplete code.
2. Bug 1301093, all the three parts to fix the wrong enter handling
3. Bug 1283329, this fixes the long delay
4. Bug 1302472, this fixes a regression in toolkit/autocomplete that may affect some add-ons (currently under review)

So I'm building a merged patch with all these changes.
Every part has an automated test-case.

I know this is big, scary and non-trivial. The fact is that these awesomebar improvements are so important for our end users that delaying them to Firefox 51 (24th of January) may be problematic.
I'm currently testing patches on Try.

This is an heads-up for release-drivers.
