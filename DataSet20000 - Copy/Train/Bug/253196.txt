Go to http://www.usaa.com.  You're diverted to something longer
(https://www.gc.usaa.com/inet/ent_logon/Logon).  That page indicates that
JavaScript is not enabled.  If you go to the "check browser" page
(https://www.gc.usaa.com/inet/gas_corp/CpStaticPages?PAGEID=cp_checkbrowser), it
says that JavaScript is NOT enabled.  It also, by the way, says that SSL is
"Running correctly with -1 bit encryption."
