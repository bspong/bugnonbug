Provide logo images for about:home for each of the built-in search engines
For bug 738818's current UI proposal, we will need logo images to place to the left of the search textbox on about:home for each of Firefox's built-in search engines. Currently, we only have a logo image for Google, and it's hard-coded in aboutHome.js. (We also have a logo image for Yandex in the version history.)

Since it's probably not a great idea to keep adding data URLs to abouthome.js, a better option might be to add the images to the OpenSearch XML definition files for each search engine.

Here are some SVG images for the logos of our built-in search engines for en-US:

Amazon     https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Amazon.com-Logo.svg

*Twitter doesn't officially use their wordmark anymore, it seems.

Since these are all non-free trademarks, we might need to consult legal on whether our current rights to display the small (16x16) icons in the search bar also covers our rights to display these larger logos.
