As far as I can tell from the stack, this is because we add the listener and then load a page in a tab, where we assign to the 'tab' variable when the loadOneTab call returns. However, the listener seems to be invoked synchronously while loadOneTab hasn't returned yet, so the 'tab' variable has not been initialized yet.

I don't believe there are any ill effects from this as the conditions in the listener are guaranteed not to have been met yet anyway, and because it's just a progress listener it'll error out and just run properly the next time it's invoked, but we should probably still squash the error one way or another. Dão, can you take a look?
