xhr request not parsed properly with a XOP metro WS response

Hello all,

I use AJAX to access some Java/Metro based webservices. They use the XOP standard and send an XML response with a Contenty-Type header which looks like:

multipart/related;start="<rootpart*8d077d6b-19a4-4725-9ee2-f87f841541ad@example.jaxws.sun.com>";type="application/xop+xml";boundary="uuid:8d077d6b-19a4-4725-9ee2-f87f841541ad";start-info="text/xml"

The issue is that the field responseXML of the xhr browser is null then (not correctly parsed/content-type not properly recognized?)

would appreciate any help
kind regards


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. setup a page responding with the Content-Type header like described above
2. call this url over ajax/xhr request
3. check for the xhr object e.g. with Firebug
4. responseXML is null. (but not responseText)
Actual Results:  
as said, responseXML was null

Expected Results:  
responseXML should contain the XML response string
