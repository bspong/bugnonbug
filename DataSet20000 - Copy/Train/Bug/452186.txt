After Ctl-Shift-Del, or Tools dropdown, selecting clear Private data, there are still items in the address bar.

Please note this has been reported, several times noted as not confirmed etc.  I have tried to clear the browsing history dropdown under the address bar.  Using Control-Shift-Delete, or dropping down the tool bar and selecting clear private data.  The help screen for this shows a menu when the clear private data is selected.  I get no such sub menu.  When I select either Ctl-Shift-del, or select clear private data, there is no response.  I am still left with several addresses under the address bar. 
The websites that are there are:
zerobio
mozilla.com
signout
bug-writing-guidelines.html
umc women's division
trinity united church of christ
toshiba support
Toshiba product registration
toshiba games
Office live

I have visited none of these websites recently and definately not since updating to the current version 3.0.1
