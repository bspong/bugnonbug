FF3 regularly freezing for several seconds coinciding with memory spike.

I'm unsure what is causing this, but I am experiencing regular freezes/pauses that last several seconds (5-10) and occur quite frequently (1 or more times per minute).  It coincides with a large memory spike which is clearly visible in the task manager.  This spike is about 250MB in size.  e.g. my current FF memory usage is about 730MB.  When the spike occurs, it grows to 988MB and then drops back to 730MB.  The 5-10 seconds this spike occurs, the memory regularly ramps up and then just gets released at the end, at which point Firefox becomes responsive again.

I am a heavy user, meaning I usually have several windows open with many tabs.  At the moment, I have 6 windows open with a total of 54 tabs.  Some tabs are auto-refresh, but they don't refresh at the frequency I'm seeing, even if they were staggered.  

My list of plugins and addons (a total of 8) is no different than when I run FF2, and I've never experienced this in FF2.  I don't have many and the ones I do use are pretty mainstream - e.g. Java and Flash plugins, Firebug and Flashblock addons.

The memory spike and resultant freeze appear almost to be FF doing some bookkeeping or some other maintenance type task, though I don't know what it could be.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Unknown at the moment.  I'm not sure if it's a particular website/page or just the fact that I have lots of tabs open.
Actual Results:  
Frequent, large memory spikes which cause Firefox to freeze for 5-10 seconds, after which the memory goes back to "normal" and FF becomes responsive again.  They occur roughly from 1 per minute to several per minute.

Expected Results:  
No memory spikes :-)
