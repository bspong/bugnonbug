Recently I update my firefox1.5 to 2.01. When I open some sites in tabbed browsing mode, switching between tabs become very slowly,sometimes I must close current tab before switch to another.These sites are  working together very well in tab browsing mode for firefox1.5.
  I searched the mozilla firefox forum,and found someone encounted the same question with firefox2.0.1. A person said that forecast plugin is the key issue plugin. I disable all plugin in safety mode(but flash player plugin still work), but the 100%cpu usage is still there.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start a clean firefox 2.0.1(such as in safety mode) 
2.open following url in five tabs:
   (1)http://www.sina.com.cn/
   (2)http://ent.sina.com.cn/f/s/uneezs/index.shtml
   (3)http://www.sina.com.cn  //notes:it is the same url with the first,but in a different tab
   (4)http://comment4.news.sina.com.cn/comment/skin/default.html?channel=sh&newsid=1-1-12098314&style=0
(5)http://ent.sina.com.cn/v/m/2007-01-22/07581420105.html

3.after open above five urls in five tabs,please switch between these tabs for serval times

Actual Results:  
after switch between those five tabs ,the cpu will raise 100% usage. firefox2.0.1 will response more and more slowly.
