loading page with iframe containing a form that has been loaded before resubmits post data
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/522.11.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.0.3 Safari/522.12.1
Build Identifier: firefox 2.0.0.6

testing a cgi script (works in ie 6, 7; safari 3; firefox 2 mac) that after processing uploaded files, sends an updated html page from same template showing uploaded stuff.
the template has an iframe with a form to upload files. when the server sends the new page, firefox prompts for re-posting data. If i do OK the previously uploaded file is added again, otherwise it stops rendering. all other browsers tested behave the same: will refresh the window and render a blank form in the iframe.

firefox for windoz crashed. You Suck!
:-)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create html document with iframe pointing to a static html document with a form
2. create cgi that processes the form and sends back the same page iframe pointing to same form document
3. point browser html form from step 1
4. fill form and submit
Actual Results:  
upon loading and rendering html document, firefox pops up usual window warning of re-submitting pot data. pressing ok resends form otherwise renders page with a blank iframe.

Expected Results:  
all other browsers tested (including ff on mac) render the whole window with a blank form in the iframe

using an iframe to send uploaded files with firefox doesn't work. i'm sure there is a workaround at theserver side, but why should i bother if even ff 2 for mac behaves as expected?
