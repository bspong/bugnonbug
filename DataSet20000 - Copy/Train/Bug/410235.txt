if I try to open my FIDO mobile phone bill at fido.ca the bill does not open. Fido states that I have to use IExplorer with the Adobe Reader plugin but I find Firefox 3 Beta2 to be a much superior browser (multiple tabs, much faster opening sites, etc) that I cringe each time I have to use IExplorer. Also all the plugins will download but not install (compatability? they worked in Beta 1). It would be nice to be able to use the ones I was using in Beta 1.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.login to www.fido.ca
2.login to "my account" with name & password
3.highlight "My Account" to view current month's bill w/details
Actual Results:  
works quickly & flawlessly until it opens the bill page. Then it displays only the actual total in text mode with no other information.

Expected Results:  
To see each page as if in print form

Perhaps if an adobe reader plugin was available it would work. It used to work in earlier versions of Firefox and works with other browsers such as Opera and IExplorer, both have Adobe reader plugins
