This may be a Word/newest Firefox problem, but it cost me six hours of work yesterday. It has happened three times now, the last time was a test I set up intentionally.

If I download a Word file with an identical name as an existing file on my MacBook, such as Document.doc, the downloaded file overwrites the old file and I end up with Document.doc and Document-1.doc as the SAME file, and it is the older version. Since I work with colleagues doing edits, I need to rename the file on my MacBook after e-mailing it so that when I download suggested edits my work is not overwritten.

Prior to the latest version of Firefox, I could download the same-named file and have Document.doc, Document-1.doc, Document-2.doc, etc.--and Document.doc would remain the file on the MacBook prior to the download.

This may be connected to another problem I have noticed recently, which is that NO Word download succeeds on the first try. However, clicking on the "failed" name in the download manager makes it work the second time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Name Word file.
2. E-mail Word file to others.
3. Download file e-mailed back with the original name and will overwrite the existing file.
Actual Results:  
The existing file "xxxx.doc" is gone, replaced by the downloaded file, which is the same file as the "xxxx-1.doc" file.

Expected Results:  
The existing file "xxxx.doc" should remain untouched; the downloaded file should gain the name "xxxx-1.doc".

The e-mail system is Microsoft Outlook. I have not tested this in Safari.
