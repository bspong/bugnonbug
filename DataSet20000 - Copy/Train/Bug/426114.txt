I have Firefox configured to "ask me every time" for site cookies, but I also have the checkbox on the cookie popup checked (I checked it once way back when and when it comes up now it's already checked).

However, sometimes I get tons of cookie accept popups (one at a time) for a site. I originally thought it might be a problem with lots of cookies from the same site, however, looking at the details for the URL above, it's actually asking me multiple times about the same cookie. For instance, after answering "Allow for session" 38 times in a row for this url, I only end up with 5 saved cookies. All of the ones I got a popup for seemed to be for the RMID cookie (and with the same content).

I've tried other options (Allow as well as Deny) and it seams to have no effect. I've also tried manually unchecking and then rechecking the 'remember' box, all to no avail.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure Firefox to "ask every time" for cookies.
2. Go to a URL, such as that referenced above. (Make sure you clear out any existing exceptions and cookies from the site first, as it won't repro otherwise.)
3. Despair.
Actual Results:  
38 popups asking me to accept the same cookie.

Expected Results:  
1 popup asking me to accept 1 cookie
