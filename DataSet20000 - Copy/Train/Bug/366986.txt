[SessionStore] Browser components are handling listened events before extensions on removeTab

In a development version of Session Manager I am working on I register the TabClose listener and attempt to call the nsISessionStore component's setTabValue function on tab close to save data about that tab (specifically it's image attribute) into the ExtData field so that the image can be displayed in a menu with the list of closed tabs.

The problem is that nsISessionStore also registers the TabClose listener and apparently it gets called first since the data sent to the setTabValue call is lost (it never shows up in the sessionstore.js data file).  If my code calls the setTabValue function before the tab is closed everything works fine.

As it is now I had to hook into the removeTab code directly to force it to call my function before it calls any of the TabClose listeners to make sure that nsISessionStore hasn't done any tab close processing before my code is executed.  This is a hacky way of doing things and can cause other issues which is why listeners were created.

The other choice is to continuously monitor the tab load event and save the data I need every time the tab loads even though the data is only needed from the tab that just closed.

I believe that all close/removal events should call any extensions listening to those events first before calling brower compoments.  

The reverse should be true for any open/new events since my extension also generates exceptions when it calls SessionStore functions on the "load" event as SessionStore hasn't finished loading yet.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add a TabClose listener
2. In the listener make a setTabValue call
3. Close and reopen the tab and issue a getTabValue call.
Actual Results:  
Data set in the setTabValue call was lost.

Expected Results:  
Data set in the setTabValue call should be set.

I wrote this against SessionStore, but really it applies to any component in the system the adds a listener on window/tab close, open or load.
