Using Firefox 3.6.4 (beta 1) I am experiencing a continuous memory leak.

I have a fair number of tabs open, about 50. This takes up about 400 MB when I start Firefox. From there on I see, if I don't do anything with Firefox, the memory consumption (private working set in Windows task manager) increase in increments of 20 KB - 600 KB. Typically it is something like 70 MB in 5 minutes. This keeps on growing until the memory allocation reaches something like 1.5-1.6 GB on my laptop at which time it crashes and the crash reporting tool pops up.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I am not sure yet how to reproduce it. It started after an upgrade of Firefox 3.6.3 to Lorentz/3.6.4 beta 1.
Actual Results:  
Memory keeps on increasing until finally it goes out of memory and crashes.

Expected Results:  
Stable memory consumption.

I tried with all plugins and addons disabled, but it still kept on leaking.
