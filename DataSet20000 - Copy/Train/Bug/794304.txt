jQuery.ajax: contentType messing w\ HTTP POST Request with FireFox and Chrome, but not IE9
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/21.0.1180.89 Safari/537.1

Steps to reproduce:

Hi 

Firefox: 15.0.1 using jQuery 1.8.2

The reason I am filing this bug here is that I am not sure if this is a FireFox or jQuery bug.

I have filed the detail with jQuery Bug Reporting:
http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12608


First, the full discussion and details (code and Fiddler 2 debugger snapshots) of this bug was initially discussed within recent "Using jQuery" forum submittal:
 
http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-ajax-is-attribute-contenttype-deprecated 

I think I discovered a bug in jQuery.ajax() when assigning a value other than default to property contentType, or it is a bug in Mozilla and Chrome.
 
Reference:  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ , property contentType , Default: 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8'
 
Assigning contentType: 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8', this works fine with three browsers tested: IE9, Mozilla FireFox, and Chrome (all the latest stable versions).
 
However, assigning contentType: 'application/json; charset=UTF-8', this messes up the request body when run within Mozilla FireFox and Chrome and fails, but this same change runs perfectly fine in IE9.
 
Details of the Requests bodies are at the bottom of the aforementioned forum submittal.
 
Thank you for looking into this problem.
