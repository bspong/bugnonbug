A blank field gets accepted as the name of the new folder. Also if you create
numerous folders with blank names, they also get accepted without any warning or
prompts 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click the New Folder options to create a new folder.
2.Delete all the text from the name field and click O.K.
3.Repeat this several times.

Actual Results:  
The name field accepts the blank space when we clicked O.K.
It takes the blank name as the folder name and gets added to the root directory
of folders.
Doing this repeatedly creats several such blank named folders without
overwriting or prompting.

Expected Results:  
The empty or blank space as name of a new folder should not be accepted.
If provided as an additional feature, a new blank name folder should either
overwrite the previously exisitng folder else provide some other options.  

Follow Up Tests

1. Created multiple blank named folders as a follow up test. Doing this did not
prompt for any warning or conflict 
2. Replicated the same bugs for Konqueror.However Konqueror does not accept a
blank as a folder name.
3. Replicated the same bug for I.E. Even I.E(Windows XP) does not allow a blank
folder name.


Importance of the Bug:

The bug reveals a flaw in an important functionality of the browser.Since
several blank folders could be created using this feature,it can lead to
possible confusion and mismanagement of folders in the directory.
The browser offers no provision to overwrite or stop the process therefore as
many blank folders can be created as desired, therefore leading to a mismanaged
directory of similar named folders.
