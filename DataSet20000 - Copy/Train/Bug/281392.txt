If you minimize the window, for me I logon to yahoo.com and goto the finance
page, on the left side I see the daily stats on Dow, NDX and so fourth.  I
minimize the window so that it is centered on the left side in a small window. 
I click refresh and all of a sudden it goes backup to the top of the window. 
Meaning it does not remember where the scroll bar was....  In IE I can do this
without a problem.  For me Id like to switch completely over to firefox, yet I
cant when I need to minimize a window.

Thank you very much for the creation and Ideas involved with firefox, with time
I think this will help the community VERY much.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create window to a certain size(not full screen) try with a smaller size first.
2. move the scroll bars to somewhere in middle of page.
3. hit refresh
4. notice how the space where it was is now different.(what you were previously
viewing.)

Actual Results:  
Different viewing area in minimized window
