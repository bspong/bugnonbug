Keyworded bookmarks have no favicon, title or bookmark-star in awesomebar-results
Created attachment 8626989
Keyword-result: before - after

Set an unique keyword for any bookmark and enter it into the locationbar. The keyword is used a static shortcut, not as a way to use a search-engine.


Before the regression, the result for the keyword shows the title (not domain!) and the favicon. With unifiedcomplete turned off, title, favicon and the bookmark-star are shown.


After the regression, the result has no favicon, no star and shows the domain instead of the title.
With UC turned off, the favicon is there, but not the title or the star.


Regression-window, tested with forcing browser.urlbar.unifiedcomplete;true and false:
