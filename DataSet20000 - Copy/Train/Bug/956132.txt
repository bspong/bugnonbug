dom.event.clipboardevents.enabled adversely affects some chrome and still allows copy/paste but with side effects
dom.event.clipboardevents.enabled = false
adversely affects some chrome (eg scratchpad, stylish, firebug, etc)

Per the MDN docs, this should only affect whether events are exposed to content -- copy/cut/paste should happen as expected regardless of setting, and chrome should not be affected.

HOWEVER:

When FALSE, an initial paste appears to work; however, the persistence of the pasted text is highly inconsistent and varies, eg navigation by up/down/left/right arrow, typing text, pasting twice, etc.  After a paste persists, using the arrows to scroll through the pasted text seems to imply that the visible text is treated as a single block.  The fact that you can get any text to paste at all and to persist at that implies this is broken.

Further, this affects both Firefox's own chrome and addon chrome.

When TRUE, everything works as expected; however, events are then undesirably exposed to content.  Repeated toggling on/off/on/off is not a viable work around and leaves the user exposed while toggled.

Copy/Cut/Paste is a very common workflow when editing within text areas.  This misbehavior severely hinders that workflow.

Speculatively (this may be wrong) some chrome may be implementing a content type editor (eg for syntax highlighting?); however, this is just horribly broken and misbehaving.  Even if this were the case, hosting the editor as a resource:// or similar would seem to move it from content to chrome and thus not be affected by this pref?  Either way, copy/cut/paste should be working regardless, but it is adversely impeded.

Observed to affect multiple OS vendors, FF versions, and means of copy/cut/paste.
