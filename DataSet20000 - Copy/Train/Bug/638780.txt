User is not prompted to delete bookmarks.

I have a very large collection of bookmarks, organized in sub-folders by argument. 
Today I wanted to reorder one but instead of chosing "Sort by name" (Shortcut: "R"), i chose "Delete" (Shortcut "D").
Instantly the whole folder i was pointing, containing bookmarks collected over years of firefox usage, disappeared.

Fortunately, i'm using the Xmarks extension and I could recover them all by downoading the backup copy stored in their server, so I had no damage.

Perhaps a prompt (Are you sure? Y/N ) should be displayed before deleting bookmarks, so the risk to involuntarily delete an entire tree could be avoided... Such things can happen even to expert users.. and I'm not a beginner!
