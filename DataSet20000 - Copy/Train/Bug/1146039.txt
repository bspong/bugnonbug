Percent encoded URLs are normalized to human readable format too eagerly
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:36.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/36.0

Steps to reproduce:

Use a percent encoded link such as https://gitorious.org/%7Esstewartgallus on a site.
Try to examine the link by hovering over the link with the mouse cursor to see a little popup of what the link points to.
Alternatively, try to goto the linked site directly.


Actual results:

In many elements of the UI the percent encoded link is normalized into a nonpercent encoded link. In this specific case this means that the link shows up as https://gitorious.org/~sstewartgallus in many elements of the UI such as the URL bar. This is extremely confusing and makes it really difficult to debug complicated multisite interactions such as the bug at https://github.com/reddit/reddit/issues/1244#issuecomment-72949686.


Expected results:

The URL should show up as a percent encoded URL in the URL bar and in all other elements of the UI. Alternatively, the URL sent to the site when requested should be the same as the normalized URL (and not percent encoded). Either way, the URL shown to the user should be exactly the same as the one sent to the site when the webpage is requested.
