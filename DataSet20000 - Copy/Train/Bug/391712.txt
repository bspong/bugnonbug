Issue: When you log into my company website and get into your account. if you select the link "update your credit card information" which is a secured page, you will get logged off. It must be not be recognizing the (cftoken/cfid) cookies?

Background info: I am a jr web developer and am using version Mozilla version 2.0.0.6, my company's website is written using ColdFusion MX7. A co-worker of mine uses an older version of Mozilla and there is no issue (1.0.0.6) and there is no issue with Internet Explorer.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in to a site that is unsecured but offers a secure page
2. Click on link to go to secure page
3. You will be bounced to the login screen as if you weren't logged in at all.


Expected Results:  
bounced back to login screen

shoudl have taken you to our (internal) secure page - https. if the user logs in a second time they will be able to load the page, but it will no longer be secure. This gives the site vulnerability.
