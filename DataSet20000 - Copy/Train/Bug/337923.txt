Firefox sometimes crashes when opening several videos (quicktime plugin)

When opening several (eg 10) videos using the quicktime plugin (so i can watch them directly in new tabs = 1 tab by video); the video loads correctly, i may also watch some, but when clicking on the "play" button, it sometimes crashes, close the window and loads the "bug reporter" agent, which is then unable to send anything...

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
(Note that it may or may not crash)

1.Load several mpeg's in several tabs (you must have the quicktime plugin installed)
2. Wait for the videos to be loaded
3. Try to play them, one after another
Actual Results:  
Most of the time, nothing happens - but when it crashes, all data is lost, all pages are lost, sometimes even the history is incomplete (so that i cannot go back on all the pages i was viewing).

Expected Results:  
The software should close the plugin, or say that it caused an error, or save all visited pages in order not to loose everything...

Does not depend on the theme used.
Cannot tell what exactly is wrong, because the window automatically closes on crash, without telling me which module of which error is responsible for the crash.
