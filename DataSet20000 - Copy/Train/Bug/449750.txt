I have an idea for a more useful search bar, which would require less clicks to change engines and still be pretty much the same.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
To search with the last used search engine: click on the edit bar, type search terms and hit enter. Takes one click.

To search with a different engine: click on the change engine button, click on the engine, enter text, hit enter. Takes two clicks. Then it takes two more to change it back to the normal search engine (most users I know use basically one engine for web searching and other engines for searching a site)

Expected Results:  
Instead of a change search engine button and an edit bar, there should be search engine buttons placed horizontally in the bar.

When user would click on a search engine button, the edit box would appear (already active), he would then type in the search term and hit enter. That would make the edit bar should disappear and search engine buttons reappear and search with the search engine the user chose.
