when i have opened firefox and it has gone to my start page 'google'(sometimes i have to hit the home button a few times to et that far),  clicking on links and bookmarks work less than 50% of the time and i have to click multiple times on occasions.  Very irritating and slow when browsing and doing research.  i have installed the latest firefox and the problem still persists.  I have even closed ALL other programs to see if that helped to no avail.  I have NO idea why this should be happening. Can you help?

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.reproducing the problem is a hit and miss issue
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Once a link/bookmark has been clicked the page stays the same but the word 'DONE' appears on bottom left of page...when clearly it is not done.  the status bar wont show at these times either.  When the status bar does appear it usually means it has worked and i wil end up where i wanted togo.

Expected Results:  
to go where directed.

i cant think of any other information that i couldd provide to assist you with this,
