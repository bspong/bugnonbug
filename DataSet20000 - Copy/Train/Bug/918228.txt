Steps to reproduce:

This is the second time this has happened recently, there is an error in Amazon order processing, possibly related to Firefox and/or Aurora. 

Here's how it happens:

1. Item is in cart, I select to check out.  
2. My default shipping address is a PO Box, for which the only shipping option available to me as Amazon Prime member is "FREE Standard Shipping (3-5 business days)".
3. I "Change" the shipping address to my home address, and now the shipping speed button selected is "FREE Two-Day Shipping".  Which is what it needs to be.
4. Since everything is seemingly now fine, I hit "Place Your Order".




Actual results:

Once the order was placed,  Shipping Speed ended up as "Standard Shipping", upon reviewing the placed order.  Should have been Two-Day Shipping.

[note: Possible workaround is after changing shipping address (step 3 in what I did), select the FREE Standard Shipping button and then re-select the FREE Two-Day Shipping button, before placing order (step 4).  (This seemed to work when doing a trial pre-order (and to not work when not toggling back and forth between the two shipping speeds).)  This all on Mac running Snow Leopard, latest versions of Firefox and Aurora.)]


Expected results:

Once order was placed, Shipping Speed should have been Two Day shipping as per the button selected when order was placed.

(This seemed to happen correctly with Safari on trial pre-order.)
