Firefox' session restore fails to restore text area Description in Bugzilla
Firefox 29 on Mac OS X Mavericks.
In Firefox, I have this address : 
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?format=__default__&product=Firefox&short_desc=Apple-drag-and-drop%20from%20the%20History%20takes%20the%20wrong%20entry 
In the text area Description, I enter my description text. 
I quit Firefox. 
I relaunch Firefox.

* Expected behaviour : * 
Firefox restores my session. I have my page, with my entered description text.

* Actual behaviour : * 
Firefox restores my session, but in my page the text area Description is empty. My entered description text is lost.

The bug occurs in case of clean quit of Firefox. 
The bug occurs also in case of computer crash.

This is data loss.

This is a regression — in Firefox or in Bugzilla. 
A few months ago, this scenario used to work neatly. 

With a normal form such as this page https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Sandbox&action=edit the restoration of the text area works neatly. 
Something may be wrong in the Bugzilla page, but I have not found what.

The good news is that my entered text does get saved in the file sessionstore.js.

Thank you for correcting that.
