transfer from Thunderbird URL fails
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

When trying to connect with a emailed URL firefox remains inactive.  After clicking on the hilighted URL line nothing happens.  I have seen this come and go from changing versions of firefox from v3. to V4.2.  It seems that something in pref.js or user.js gets set off from on.  It may be a Thunderbird problem but doesn't appear to be one.  If I change versions now and then this happens. Once set it is sometimes possible to go back on versions and regain it.  Right now no luck  

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Startx ; callup Thunderbird and click on a email which has quoted or highlighted url.
2.NOTE: Firefox is set to default
3.
Actual Results:  
nothing happens - Firefox doesn't even show up with a wrong address.  

Expected Results:  
After you click on a URL on a Thunderbird email calls Firefox. Firefox should come up with the information displayed

If I am seeing something incorrectly please let me know.  If it is a pref.js instruction that is wrong I can try it a see if it works
