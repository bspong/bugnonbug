If a dark skin (that is, one with light text on a dark background rather than the standard dark on light) is used for Windows XP, the slight shading around the back and forward buttons does not shade properly. Specifically, the bottom half of the faux-indentation surrounding these indentations remains a bright white while the rest of the Firefox interface is properly colored to the darker color specified by the system. Apparently this portion of the UI is hardcoded rather than drawing its color information from the system settings.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set the system color settings to a dark theme. Easiest to do with Windowblinds, but doable manually given enough patience.
2. Check the color of the border around the back and forward buttons.
Actual Results:  
The border remains colored as if the system were using a light skin.

Expected Results:  
The border should draw its color information from the system color like the rest of the default theme does.
