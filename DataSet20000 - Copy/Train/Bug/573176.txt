Implement Site-Specific Privacy Preferences
Created attachment 452384
Mockups: separate windows in current design, interated interface

For Firefox 4, we are integrating the separate managers for individual privacy permissions into one site-centric interface within preferences.  Rather than having a separate window in preferences for each permission category, a single interface will display permissions per domain and allow the user to change preferences for a single or all domains.

Some windows that could be integrated into this single interface are:

- Pop-ups 
- Images 
- Add-on Installation 
- Cookies 
- Saved Passwords/Account Management
- Offline Data
- Geolocation

The problem with the current UI is that the one-window-per-preference design is framed around the implementation model rather than the user’s mental model; it’s designed in a way that corresponds with how it was built rather than how users perceive the action they want to take.  A better design would present controls in a site-centric rather than technology-centric view. If a user decides that he doesn’t trust site X and doesn’t want it to have any access, it would be more efficient to control all of site X’s access in a single preference window than hunt for the permissions individually.
