Keyboard buffer is flushed during new tab opening

When Ctrl-T is hit, a new tab opens, however if you type fast, you start to enter the address of the page you want to reach right after it. If the machine is not fast enough (the case here, due to X over TCP) the first few characters get lost before the new tab is fully initialized and the address bar got the focus again.

The lost keys actually get send to the old tab, as I just verified with the bug-reporting text-boxes. I'd like them to be gathered in some buffer and then inserted into the address bar of the new tab. Otherwise the semantics of a keystroke-sequence depends on the speed of the machine, which makes type-ahead impossible.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get your machine to be not-so-fast (tunnel your X connection over TCP for example
2. Hit <Ctrl-T>www.mozilla.org   quite fast

Actual Results:  
w.mozilla.org (or some other suffix) is present in the address-bar

Expected Results:  
www.mozilla.org is present in the address-bar

The firefox where this was observed displays on a not-so-fast (400Mhz) X terminal, and runs tunneled over TCP on a 3Ghz machine on LAN.
