Closing tabs quickly in succession causes the close button to "get stuck" (Minefield 3.0pre3, browser.tabs.closeButtons = 1)

When I want to close a lot of tabs, but not all of them, I typically just hit the close buttons really quickly (FF automatically highlights the next tab, which then exposes the close button, so I basically click in the close button of the rightmost tab).

This has worked fine in a trunk build from Dec. 05, but as of the trunk build of the 16th, when I attempt to rapidly close two tabs by this method, the first one closes but the second does not respond to the button click (the "depressed" icon is shown when it is clicked, but it fails to close).

Ctrl+W still works rapidly in the same circumstance.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have browser.tabs.closeButtons = 1
2. Open around 10 tabs in a new window (hold Ctrl+T is a good way to get this)
3. Repeatedly click (quickly) in the close button of the (currently) active tab: this will close the current tab and attempt to close the other tabs -- n.b. you should not move your mouse pointer, let the tabs and their close buttons come to your cursor
4. Note that the second tab refuses to close, unless you wait between clicks -- seems to be a double-click event which isn't working
Actual Results:  
Continually clicking the second tab's close button fails to close the tab.

I suspect this may be a misfired double-click or something similar.

Expected Results:  
The second tab and all subsequent tabs (until the close button is no longer at the very right) are closed.
