Context Menu Hangs When Right Clicking Certain Bookmarks

When you right click a bookmark while a subbookmark menu is visible, the context menu does not go away (I will explain - it's confusing)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go into the bookmarks context menu.(context 1)
2. Hover your mouse over a bookmark folder so another bookmark context appears. (I will refer to this submenu as context 2)
3. Right click on a bookmark that is not in a bookmark folder while the bookmark folder is still visible

Actual Results:  
The right click context menu remains visible on the page no matter where you click. The only way to make it disappear is to left click or right click something on the menu. However, it should disappear when you click anywhere ont he page.

Expected Results:  
The right click context menu should have disappeared when you click anywhere on the page. No matter what tab you go to or what you click, it does not disappear until you left click or right click the context menu. Like I said, it should disappear when anything is clicked.

Sometimes, it gets stuck in Windows and is still visible when Firefox is minimized, but I cannot replicate this all the time.

I'm using Firefox 1.5 RC3
