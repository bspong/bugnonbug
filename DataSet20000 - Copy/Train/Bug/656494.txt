On Linux from time to time firefox will become very unstable.  It happens with or without extensions.  I may have narrowed it down to after I have torrented something.  For example yesterday I downloaded a new Linux distro and it is crashing quite a bit today.

It is not exclusively tied to a distro.  It's not exclusively tied to a plugin.  It just starts crashing a whole lot from time to time.  If I start it in the terminal it only says "segmentation fault" when it crashes.  Restarting helps sometimes, but when it's happening it'll usually start up either right away after restarting, or it'll hold off before it starts doing it again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.torrent?
2.start firefox in linux
3.lots of crashing commences

Actual Results:  
I don't really want to *try* to reproduce this, because I'm pretty sure it'll get worse if I use torrents.  It last crashed when I started filling out this bug report.


This may just be a problem with my hardware and/or Linux.  I'm not sure how common this is.
