Dataloss: Drag to windows (tab detach) interferes with session save

Firefox 4.x has a feature to drag tabs outside the browser window to open them in new tabs. So far as I understand, this feature cannot be disabled.

This feature creates a dataloss situation if the user accidentally or intentionally drags a tab outside the window then closes the browser. The user has then lost all the tabs in that window: there does not exist a function to reopen a closed window, and trying to reopen Firefox results in a error that the profile is already in use.

Often using the History to refind the tabs is not a viable workaround: the History may be cleared, and some tabs may be very old and very buried in the History. Some sites do not use informative page titles, further hampering efforts to find the correct tabs in the History.

Possible solutions to the issue:
1) Offer a feature to disable tab drag-to-window. I believe that there exists an open feature request on this.
2) Offer a feature to reopen a closed Window.
3) Store multiple sessions in the event that multiple browser windows have been opened.
4) Store the tabs of all closed browser windows in a single session.
5) Any other solutions that devs or users post here. What is your idea?

My preference goes to implementing both solutions (1) and (4).

Reproducible: Always
