When trying to access pages with a login or registeration Firefox gives the error "The connection was interrupted" or "The connection was reset" when I try to access the site with IE8 there are no issues.  This appeared to have happened at the last update to version 3.6.8.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log into any site with a login for example to "bugzilla.mozilla.org"
2.Enter the login site
3.Fails with error
Actual Results:  
I get the error: 
The connection was interrupted

The connection to bugzilla.mozilla.org was interrupted while the page was loading.


    *   The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few moments.

    *   If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
connection.

    *   If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.

The "Try again" option results in the same error

Will attach the http logging file that captures the error.
