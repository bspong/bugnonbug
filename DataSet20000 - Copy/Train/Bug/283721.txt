page with complex embedded tables and javascript with style "display:none" are randomly displayed wrong

To see the bug, reload the page repeatedly.  It will usually format
the page incorrectly on the fourth or fifth try.

This is a very complex form for entering chemical searches (minus a lot
of graphics and stuff that were removed so they wouldn't obscured the
issue).  At the top are six tabs, each of which should show a separate
part of form.  Each of the sections is itself complex.  The most complex are
the first two, the "Required" and "Prohibited" tabs -- they each contain a
three-level drop-down menu.

If the system is working right, you should be able to click on
"Required", then click on any "+" sign to drop down a category of
chemicals, then click on the next-level "+" sign to select particular
categories of chemicals.

Thanks for your help.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Clear your browser's cache, etc.
2.Load the page
3.Click on the "reload" button repeatedly until it is displayed incorrectly.  It
usually takes anywhere from one to a dozen reloads.

Actual Results:  
Some of the drop-down menus, which should be hidden, are permanently shown --
that is, clicking on the tabs at the top and clicking on the "+" signs, won't
make them disappear.  They're shown in seemingly-random places on the screen. 
The display stays in this state untils you click "Reload" again, at which time
it may display correctly, or may randomly display some other chunk of the menus.

Expected Results:  
Format the display exactly the same way every time.

Well, I doubt many folks run into this bug, but I have to tell my users to use
Internet Explorer :-(
