location of 'open file' dialog improperly retained between profiles

The dialog window for "File:Open File" (Ctrl+O) and "Save As" both default to wherever the user last  browsed in either the "Save As" or "Open File" dialog.  This is expected behavior.  When an installation has multiple profiles, the "Save As" dialog defaults to where the profile in use last saved (stored in browser.download.lastDir).  This is also expected behavior.  But the "Open File" dialog defaults to wherever any profile last opened or saved a file instead of on a per-profile basis.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create two profiles (user1 and user2)
2. Run Firefox as user2.
3. Use "Save As" to store a file into C:\files\user2\.
4. Close Firefox.
5. Run Firefox as user1.
6. Use "Save As" to store a file into C:\files\user1\.
7. Close Firefox.
8. Run Firefox as user2.
9. File:Open File (or prompt to open a file in a webpage, e.g. when browsing to add an attachment to a message in a web-based email system).
Actual Results:  
"Open File" dialog defaults to C:\files\user1\.

Expected Results:  
Dialog should default to user2 profile's last-used folder (c:\files\user2\).

upgraded to normal from minor because this could be considered a leak of information between profiles.
