I can't bring the address/bookmark bars up after hiding them.

I normally have the bookmark bar hidden.  On occasion, I also hid the address bar with the URL and the the buttons such as reload, stop, back, forward, etc.  Before I always had the the top bar that had the file, bookmark, edit, view, etc. menus.  This time that bar disappeared.  

Aside from a possible issue with the a horizontal scroll bar not appearing when it should (not my primary concern, once I have the normal bars back I will then look into this more) everything is fine.  My bookmarks are still intact along with the my add-ons, NoScript and I believe Tab-to-Window (I would look this up but the problem is preventing me from checking).  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Right click on the top and hide all the bars.  
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
I don't have access to file, options, bookmarks, etc. let alone the address bar with the URL and buttons such as reload.  

Expected Results:  
Show the file, bookmark, etc. menus and allow me the option to right click on top to get the address bar.  

I tried an uninstall and install and a reboot and the problem persists.
