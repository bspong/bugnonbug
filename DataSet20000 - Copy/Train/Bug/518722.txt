Password options ON the Paypal site aren't showing up.

It's like someone has hacked Firefox AND IE by preventing user from "seeing" pw related icons/options. Can they hack in and block the word/options with "password" in it??

I put **astreks** where the most pertinent to Mozilla. The extra is for fuller story of what happened and FYI. No need to reply.

This is a copy of my dialog with PayPal:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"PLEASE read my comments I sent to you to begin this process. The below will not work.

This is obviously an automated response, because the directions below are the same as in Help. Not only did that not work, I , as stated in the "Contact Us" email, cannot find the supposed "Password" option at all. It is NOT there.

********************************************************************************
I AM computer literate. I can find my way around a website to get to where I need to go.
THERE IS NO PASSWORD OPTION UNDER: MY ACCOUNT>PROFILE. I am not yelling here. I AM trying to get across that there is a problem here. One that does not involve cookies or stuffed cashes. Why would all the other options show up and not Password??
Why can't I click on "Back to Profile Summary"? I've cleared all cookies. Still, does not work. Either of the ways above I spoke of.
******************************************************************************

Now I just tried with IE. Same result. With one exception. I was able to change the password just now by clicking "Back to Profile Summary" and then going to the password option.

The directions below are for IE only. There should be a Firefox set as well as any other prominent browser.

I use Firefox.

Again, there is NO Password option showing up under "Profile" with either IE or Firefox browsers.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Same common sense, common ways one uses PayPal. The option is just not there.
Actual Results:  
1.Log in and can't find Password related items. I.e. to change a pw.
2.Can't use usual roundabout ways to same password related destination like "back to profile summary".
3.CAN get to "back to profile summary" with IE  ??

Expected Results:  
Uggghh
See above

Someone is jackin' with browsers again.

I clicked Major because of it impacting anyone wanting to change pw OR possibly someone is using this to collect passwords???
