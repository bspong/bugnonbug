If I restore a closed tab, the history will be incorrect. It will always add the current page to the end of that tab's history, and the tab will be at the end of the history (i.e., no forward pages). For instance, if page be was current when the tab was closed:

A -> _B_ -> C -> D

When it is resotred, the tab's forward/back history will be:

A -> B -> C -> D -> _B_

Or,

A -> B -> _C_  => A -> B -> C -> _C_

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. With Session Restore operating, Open a tab
2. Navigate to any page.
3. Navigate to another, then a third.
4. (Optional) Click back once
5. Close the tab, or kill firefox
6. Restore the tab, or open firefox again.
7. Check the history of the newly restored tab.
Actual Results:  
After restore the current page will be correct, but it will appear twice in the back/forward history. Effectively the current page will be appended to the end of the history, and if the current page was at the end of the history, it will have a two entries.

Expected Results:  
As above.

I have tons of extensions which may be interfering with the correct function of this feature. I can provide a list if needed.
