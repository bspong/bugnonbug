Steps to reproduce:

Hey guys, have just been having issues with Twitter & Tumblr not rendering text correctly.

Have tried the usual trouble shooting. When changing the page style to 'No Style' - the text displays. Manually disabling all addons and plugins doesn't fix the issue however when using Firefox in safemode, the text appears fine. 
Changing the character encoding does not alleviate the issue nor does a new profile. Running windows 7 x64 with all the latest Windows 7 updates and the latest Firefox.

Chrome displays twitter and tumblr fine as does FF in safe mode. IE however has the same issue.


Actual results:

Attempted to update to the latest AMD Catalyst 12.3 drivers for my Radeon HD 5700. No luck in resolving the issue, however when hardware acceleration was turned off, the text appeared to display correctly. I attempted the same procedure with the AMD 11.9 drivers but the text didn't appear with hardware acceleration off.

Expected results:

Please view a comparison with Hardware Acceleration off and on in the latest Nightly build here:http://i.imgur.com/YPWp8.jpg
