This web page is the home page for my ISP.  I am currently running WinXP Pro 
V5.1 Build 2600.xpsp_sp2_gdr.050301: service pack 2 and using IE 
V6.0.2900.2180 w/128bit cypher as default browser.  I am trying to do a side-
by-side comparison with FireFox v 1.0.4.  FireFox has Web Features/Block Pop-
Up Windows turned off.  I am also running Symantec Internet Security 2005 and 
anti-virus.  It was loaded before FireFox and it is current with all updates.  
It has anti-spam and add-blocking off.

When I load this page in I.E, there is an ad(?) or pop-up(?) on the right side 
of the main panel, attached to it as part of the image that shows.  When I 
load this page in FireFox, that part does not display.  This particular 
situation may be insignificant but, if it happens someplace else....

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load the web-page under the conditions described
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
as stated

Expected Results:  
shown the pop-up or ad

Thank you for your consideration.  I also consider that this may be fallout 
from Internet Security but, I'm not sure.  I've disabled Internet Security but 
the problem still remains.
