Huge error dialog box blocks all further input

The following error was generated:

  SyntaxError: Unterminated string literal <giant string literal>

the pop-up dialog box shows the entire string literal.
I presume that somewhere below that is an [OK] button,
or something that would allow be to acknowledge that I
saw the error, and then continue.  But, the error text
is so big that the dialog box extends below the visible
screen.  Who knows how big it really is?

What I consider to be a Mozilla/Firefox bug is not the
offending web page and the error that it generated.
It is the fact that Firefox would ever generate a dialog
box that big, and then block keyboard and mouse access,
rendering useless my entire window with several tabs.

I believe Firefox should truncate error message in the
dialog box and place the complete error message in a place
that can be viewed as a web page, or saved.

I am having trouble reproducing the bug by visiting the
offending web page.  But that is beside the point.
I believe I could come up with my own toxic javascript
program with an unterminated literal, and very good
reproducible results, to be used as a unit test.
