I scanned a document and split it into individual images of words using my Image Reflow utility http://people.pwf.cam.ac.uk/ssb22/notes/#reflow and put this on a web server and pointed Firefox at it.  The page loaded OK no problem.  Unfortunately, the web server later went down, and I urgently needed to get the document across to a different computer.  The only copy I had now was in Firefox's memory.  So I set Firefox to Work Offline and tried File / Save As.  That is, attempting to save a page that has hundreds of images in it.  Result, I got hundreds of blank dialogs, and not all images were saved (about 200 of them were saved OK, the rest were not).  They are all present and correct in the browser window so I know they must be there somewhere.  I don't know what determines which ones were saved OK and which were not.

The blank dialog boxes had no message, just 2 buttons (with no labels on the buttons either).  The Downloads window cannot be clicked on due to the dialog boxes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a page with hundreds (preferably thousands) of small images
2. Work offline.  Verify all images are still there in the browser window.
3. Save the page
Actual Results:  
Not all images saved; hundreds of blank dialog boxes are displayed.

Expected Results:  
All images that were in the memory should be saved; no blank dialog boxes should be displayed (or at least the dialog boxes should be informative).
