Hi,

When I go to the french website oues-france.fr, the browser gets very unstable. It is particularly true if i open more than one tab for the same site. For example, looking at their homepage and opening a new tab for a couple of article. Today, even the homepage got firefox to crash. I suspect their ads to be the cause of the problem.

This is very unpredictable though. Sometime firefox works fine, but most of the time it doesn't for this website.

This is the only website I've come accross with this problem so far. 

Regards
Yannick Lavanant

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.ouest-france.com
2. Right click on one article heading and choose "open in new tab"
3. Repeat for another article or two 
4. Wait a minute or two. Sometimes, it takes a little while for firefox to crash
Actual Results:  
Firefox disapears from the screen. The only option is to restart it again. The task or process is gone from task manager.

Expected Results:  
At the very least, display an error message. There isn't even the option to send a bug report. The browser should display the page, or if it can't, display an error message. The tab could close at this stage, but not the entire browser.
