All product pages that use an add to cart .js scrpit to not put anything into
the shopping cart.   Product pages that do not have this script do work. I
realize that a bug has been reported that firefox does not put product into
shopping cart, but no one has mentioned that it doesn't work when the script is
present but does work when the script is not present. I thought this might help
you to narrow down your search for a fix.  Please fix ASAP as customers using
firefox cannot buy my products and I need to pay my mortgage <smile>   Oh
also,... Product is added to cart using IE and Opera

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click add to cart, box comes up stating that item has been added to cart
2.  click review cart 
3. 

Actual Results:  
Cart is empty  no product has been added

Expected Results:  
Software should've added product to shopping cart

I feel this is due to firefox having a problem handling the java script used to
post product to the cart.  Possibly the javascript feature does not work correctly?
