bookmarks manager doesn't escape quotation marks in attribute values
When the bookmarks manager serializes the bookmarks datasource to the bookmarks.html file, it doesn't escape quotation marks in attribute values like those for keywords and microsummaries, which makes it possible to modify bookmarks by crafting special keywords and microsummaries.

It's unclear how easy it would be to exploit this with keywords.  There's some code in addBookmark2.js to display and prepopulate the Keyword field with a "suggested" keyword, but it's unclear who does the suggesting (the site?) and if it's even possible anymore.  ispiked looked at it yesterday, and he doesn't see any code that actually uses that feature.

It seems exploitable with microsummaries.  A site would just have to generate a microsummary that included some reasonable looking text, a bunch of spaces, and then some malicious code that doesn't appear in the menu item representing the microsummary because the spaces push it off the right hand side.  There would be ellipses, of course, but no way to tell what they represent, and some users would select the microsummary anyway.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. bookmark any site;
2. open the bookmark properties dialog for that bookmark and enter 
   the following text into the Keywords field:

   " HREF="http://www.evil.com/

3. click "OK" in the dialog to save your changes, then restart Firefox;
4. click the bookmark.

Expected Results: you go to the site you bookmarked.

Actual Results: you go to evil.com.

It doesn't look like the name and description fields are exploitable in this manner, since both values are stored in text nodes (the name is the content of the A tag representing the bookmark, while the description is the content of a DD tag), and significant characters (& < > ") are all escaped in them.
