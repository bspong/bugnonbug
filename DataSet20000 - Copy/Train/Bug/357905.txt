Go button reloads current tab plus creates a new tab
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

When the location bar contains a URL (not a just-typed-in URL), clicking the Go button causes the current tab to reload, plus a new tab is created using the same URL. Click repeatedly on the Go button and you will have a new tab for each click.

In preferences, I have:
Load Web browser links into a: current tab
Load external links into a: current tab
Load these popups into existing windows: none
"Force all left-clicks links to open in new tabs" is unchecked.
When loading new tabs, load the: Blank Page
Load the following in new tabs: "URLs in the address bar" is unchecked, as is "Searches from the search bar"
"Load middle-clicked URLs in new tabs" is checked (problem occurs when unchecked)
Open the home page in a: current tab

The problem did not occur with Firefox 1.5.0.7 or earlier (for me).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type a URL into the location bar, e.g.: www.google.ca
2. Click the Go button
3. Click the Go button
Actual Results:  
No new tab at step 2.
At step 3, current tab reloads and new tab is created.


Expected Results:  
Just reloaded the current tab. No new tab should have been created.

There doesn't appear to be a preference in about:config controlling this behaviour... I checked thinking that something from my 1.5.0.7 config was causing this behaviour in Firefox 2, but that doesn't appear to be the case.
