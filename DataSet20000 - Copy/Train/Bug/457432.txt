find, followed by ctrl-V paste no longer works with firefox3 (it worked with firefox2)

On any wiki/editable page I was able to do "find and replace" in firefox2 but it no longer works with firefox 3. The cursor is no longer on the item that was found via ctrl +f and ctrl +v doesn't overwrite the content.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Replace all apt-get with aptitude (or any word you would like) on a wiki
2. select word aptitude and press ctrl +c
3. press ctrl +f to and type in apt-get
4. press next, this will find next item
5. Click on that item for the first time to put the cursor inside of the wiki
6. press next on the find bar (this will highlight the next found word and you will be able to replce it)
7. press ctrl+v to replace the content.
8. press next again and ctrl+v to replace next word.

This has worked on firefox2 but somehow the cursor doesn't select the word and stays on the page; for some reason it selects it and puts the cursor elsewhere while paste is not available.


Actual Results:  
Word is not replaced

Expected Results:  
the cursor should select the word and keep the cursor on the found word to allow for ctrl+v function to overwrite it

default theme...etc
