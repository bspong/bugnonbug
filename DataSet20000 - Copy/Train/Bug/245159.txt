Easier whitelisting of cookies from current site's domain

Currently in Firefox, you must go into the settings dialog area (Tools > Options
> Privacy > Cookies > Exceptions) to whitelist a domain, allowing it to set
cookies. This is a bit of a pain compared to Seamonkey's easy-access memus, as
brought up in the following topic:

While I don't think adding menu bloat is the way to do this, would it be
possible to duplicate the functionality of the Permit Cookies extension by
default, and have a keyboard shortcut to whitelist the current page's domain?

The extension can be found here:
http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/more-info/permitcookies and currently uses
Alt+C, although any good combination would do.

Another great addition would be a "Add current site" button in the Cookie
Exceptions Manager, but it would be somewhat less important if this can be
achieved with a key combination.

Apologies if this is a dupe, I couldn't find anything requesting this. Yes - we
have the extension, but this is a problem that should be solved by default IMO.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Disable cookies by default, or use any combination that requires whitelisting
of a domain.
2. Load a page which requires cookies.
3. Jump through hoops to whitelist it.
