mozilla-xremote-client "mailto()" returns failure, but makes Firefox try to launch the mail program
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6b) Gecko/20031206 Firebird/0.7+

I'm using the 2003-12-06-09-trunk gtk+xft2 Linux build. I also use (well, am
trying to use) Thunderbird 0.4 as my mail program, although Thunderbird doesn't
directly affect this bug.

When Firebird is running and Thunderbird is not,
  mozilla-xremote-client "mailto(me@example.com)"
exits with status 3, indicating failure, as it should. However, Firebird still
gets the command, and tries to launch the system default mail program.

This is particularly bad if the system default mail program is a Thunderbird
wrapper script that contains the above command (xremote || launch a new
thunderbird) -- it leads to an infinite loop creating thunderbird windows!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firebird.
2. mozilla-xremote-client "mailto(me@example.com)"


Actual Results:  
Exit status 3, but Firebird launches the mail program.

Expected Results:  
Exit status 3, and nothing happens, so the script that called xremote can detect
failure and launch the mail program itself.
