Using upgrade 3.07, Pop up summaries no longer work when I hover over content on Newser.com or my.yahoo.com/

After upgrading to Firefox3.07  today, and deleting my cache, I found function was gone. Normally, when on my yahoo homepage, I can hover over news items on most content modules, and a preview of the story pops up. That is now not happening. Also, when on newser.com, the option that I have selected, called "Show pop-up summaries" is not working. Normally, you can hover in the left hand corner of a news story cell, and a preview pops up. That is gone. When using Internet Explorer, the function still works.  I went on Firefox chat with member named Tobbi, who tried to help, but can not figure this out. We tested Javascript, and Tobbi said it seems to be working. I went into Firefox safe mode, and nothing changed.  I am finding some  messages when I click on tools/error console. things like : "error in parsing value for 'property display' Declaration dropped" which sounded interesting, but meaningless to me. I have not changed any settings. I tried changing the pop up settings in tools, but that didn't affect anything, so I went back to the default.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.restart whole system
2. open firefox 3.07
3.go to my.yahoo.com/ or newser.com/
4.Mouse hovers over content which normally generates a pop up summary (preview) of news item. content on my.yahoo such as Huffington post module, CNN module, NY Times module. On Newser.com/ my mouse hovers over left hand corner of a new article "cell", and a pop up summary opens.
5. I tried turning adblock off, with no result.
6. I tried changing the settings in my tools for pop ups in security, with no results
Actual Results:  
Normally, a pop up would happen. but, nothing is happening. I can click the hyperlink to the story and it works. but hovering over the appropriate area on the page does not generate the usual pop up.

Expected Results:  
the pop up summary should open. I should be able to read a preview of the news item, click it's hyperlink to read the whole item from it's originator, such as CNN, Huffington Post, NY Times, etc.
