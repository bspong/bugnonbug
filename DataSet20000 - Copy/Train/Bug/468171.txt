Firefox usage eats hard disk space

After running Firefox for a few hours (with ~20-30 tabs) it slowly eats the last amount of space on my HDD (which is always under 1GB to varying degrees).  Upon closing Firefox all of that hard disk space is reclaimed after a period of a minute or two.  This does not happen with Opera.  Cache limit is set to 50MB.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Check hard disk space (may only be if you have less than one GB HDD left?)
2. Open Firefox with some tabs, use it.
3. Wait a few hours (unless you notice earlier)
4. Check hard disk space--no empty space left.
Actual Results:  
No HDD space left.  This results in not being able to save any files (Firefox gives no error, just doesn't save the file).  A crash on any attempt to check for updates if there is an update when you have no space left.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should be limited to the 50MB HDD space set in preferences.

In trying to diagnose the problem I come up with two guesses:

1. Firefox is somehow storing things to some random files which are then cleared on close and ignoring the limits.
2. Firefox works really terribly with Mac OSX swap space and is taking virtual memory/swap space because the 1GB of memory in this Macbook cannot run all of the tabs.  It therefore takes more and more swap until the HDD is full which often causes Firefox to crash on certain actions.  This MAY be a problem with OSX but it doesn't  happen even with many tabs in Opera under similar situations.
