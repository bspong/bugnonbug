Ctrl keyboard shortcuts override expected system key bindings (chrome accesskeys vs emacs-like bindings)

In Cocoa applications (and carbon applications in Leopard) text views use the control keys for various emacs-inspired operations. Firefox seems to only inherit this behaviour sometimes. 

A list of the bindings can be found (on my Leopard system) at:
/System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Resources/StandardKeyBinding.dict

Some examples of the problem:
- The find features removes the ability to move to the beginning of the line (see reproduction). Control-a activates highlight-all instead.
- In Preferences > Security > Saved Passwords: Control-a asks if you would like to remove all of your saved passwords.
- In edit bookmarks Control-e toggles more/less.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Focus the address bar, placing the caret away from the beginning of the URL text
2. Press control-a to move the caret to the beginning of the line
3. Activate the find functionality
4. Focus the address bar, placing the caret away from the beginning of the URL text
5. Press control-a

Actual Results:  
Highlight all feature is activated

Expected Results:  
Caret should be moved to the beginning of the line
