The yellow software installation information bar that appears when clicking on
an XPI link that's not in Firefox's software install whitelist disappears when
switching back and forth to another tab.

1. In the Options dialog box (Tools | Options), choose Web Features and ensure
that the "Allow web sites to install software" option is checked.
2. Open a new browser tab.

Allowed Sites UI (accessible from the "Web Features" -> "Allow web sites to
install software" option of the Options dialog box).
3. Click on the XPI link.  The software installation info bar should appear
above the browser content area.

Actual Results:  
The software installation info bar disappeared.

Expected Results:  
The software installation info bar should remain in place.
