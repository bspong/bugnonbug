line up/down keys work like ctrl home/end: in some pages (not in this one)which don't place the cursor inside some field as you enter (a search box for example), when trying to scroll up or down using the arrow keys (line up/down) has the effect of going to the top/bottom of the page (the same effect as ctrl+home/end) instead of just one line up/down. Also the page up/page down keys have no effect whatsoever. I can't be sure, but this probably happened when version 3.0.5 was released and not before. Maybe some site incompatibility that didn't exist before with some brazilian servers (www.uol(or pop, terra, etc.).com.br).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.enter a brazilian server site (www.uol(or pop, terra, etc.).com.br)
2.if the cursor isn't blinking inside a search (or other purpose) box, try to browse up or down using the arrow keys

Actual Results:  
you will end up at the top or bottom of the page (the same effect as ctrl+home/end) instead of just one line up or down

Expected Results:  
it was expected to browse only one line up or down each time
