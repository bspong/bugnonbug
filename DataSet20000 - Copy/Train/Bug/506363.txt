Over-saturated color balance when compared to IE and Firefox 3.0.12

I recently updated from Firefox 3.0.12 to 3.5 and immediately noticed that the color balance on my company's website was strangely out of balance.  Suddenly the image was drastically darker and colors (particularly red) were over-driven and blotchy, giving the color tones in photographs an almost "solarized/posterized" effect.  This can also be readily compared with IE7.  I checked your bug forum and saw one post that suggested updating the drivers for my ATI video card - which I have done and the color saturation problem continues.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View a website with color photographs in IE7 or a pre-firefox 3.5 browser
2. Open same website in Firefox 3.5
3. Compare color tones between images
Actual Results:  
Consistently in websites with full color photographs Firefox 3.5 over-saturates
the color balance, causing hyper-intense coloration and loss of image detail and texture.  

Expected Results:  
The color display in Firefox 3.5 should provide real and accurate tones that does not exaggerate an image's color intensity and causes no loss of image detail in fine lines and texture. 

This is most noticeable in larger, high quality images and particularly in flesh tones.  A photograph of Elmo from Sesame Street is a good test as he is brightly colored, but also has many fine hairs all over his fuzzy body.
