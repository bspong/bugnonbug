This is probably not Firefox specific as it also occurs with Opera BUT doesn't occur using Konqueror.
The initial Flash movie plays but there should be a "slide bar' under the icons below the main Flash movie window. Also, clicking on the 'VIDEO PLAYLIST' button brings up a Flash pop-up window but apart from the main title (SELECT A LURE) there is no menu.
If this is not Firefox's problem could you please give me a clue so that I can file a bug in the proper place.
Thank you.

The website and the Flash player work properly using Konqueror.
Also works properly pre *buntu 9.10
