file dialog in save as is VERY slow if dir is large - and save button won't work until file list is displayed

The first time I save a page to a directory with 1000 odd files, it takes more than 10 seconds for anything on the dialog to respond. 
I can't just quickly save the file without waiting for the file list to display.
I must keep my download dir cleaned out to prevent even worse delays.
I can't change to another directory until it displays, then I must wait another 10+ seconds in the other directory before I can save. 
If I have other programs running and RAM is tight, the delays do not improve with time unless I save several things to the same dir quickly.

The directories are on a fast SATA HD.
I see this with over 2G RAM, dual core 2G CPU. 
It is worse and more frequent on single core CPU w 750M RAM.
This happens when HD and CPU were previously idle.



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start firefox
2. save page to a large directory
3. save the same page to another large directory
Actual Results:  
Dialog freezes until file list displays

Expected Results:  
Dialog responds, file list displays as background thread on 2nd CPU core.
