Broken auto-complete, nsIAutoCompleteController.input failure

I have not yet been able to find the cause but since around the 01/04 build I've been experiencing auto-complete issues causing the urlbar to be completly disabled.
The following error then appears when anything happens in the urlbar:
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component does not have requested interface arg 0 [nsIAutoCompleteController.input]"  nsresult: "0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://global/content/bindings/autocomplete.xml :: attachController :: line 271"  data: no]

This might be related(or not) to the following errors that do appear too:
Error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIWebNavigation.sessionHistory]"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://global/content/bindings/browser.xml ::  :: line 644"  data: no]
Source File: chrome://global/content/bindings/browser.xml
Line: 650


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Could not reproduce so far as I have not been able to identify when this occurs.
Actual Results:  
URLbar will not accept to load any url anymore.

Expected Results:  
URLbar should continue to work.
