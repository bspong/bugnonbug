Went from Facebook Games page to play FB  Cafe World app but got "Invalid URL" instead then went to my email with emails from FB friends but when I clicked on the gifts they sent, I got "Invalid URL" for each.  I downloaded Firefox because Windstream said that the problems I was having with Facebook apps was due to Safari but I'm getting the same problems with your browser.  Please report the issue with both Firefox & Safari to Facebook & ask them to fix the Aynga game issues!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to Facebook on an Apple computer
2. Try to go to Cafe World app
3.Get Invalid URL message instead of functioning app.


Expected Results:  
got "Invalid  URL" instead of the Cafe World app loading & letting me play

Was told by Windstream that this was only a problem with Safari but, not so am getting the same result with Firefox.  I changed browsers because I was told this FB app was not a problem with Firefox.... ha!Ha!
