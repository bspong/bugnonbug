I can not see a navigation button, such as "go", "order", or "continue". For example, on yahoo's finance page, when searching for a stock symbol, the "go" or "find" navigation button is invisible. The mouse arrow turns to a hand when moved across a blank space, but no button is visible. This situation also occurs when selecting an item to order and when making payments. I use a navy blue background and white text. This problem is not limited to yahoo, it also happens at other websites.
