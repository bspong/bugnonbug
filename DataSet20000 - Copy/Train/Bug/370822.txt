After running for many days (about a week), firefox starts refusing to open helper applications.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061208 Firefox/2.0.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061208 Firefox/2.0.0.1

This problem has occurred in several recent builds, including all the 2.x series.
My system is essentially a Fedora Core 3 installation. After about a week of continuous running, clicking on a link which requires a helper application or a plugin produces the following error:

! /tmp/listen-7.pls could not be opened, because an unknown error occurred.
Try saving to disk first and then opening the file.

                                     | OK |
Saving the page (in the case of a pdf file - I could not save a pls script) as
suggested in the error message does work.

Closing firefox and restarting returns all to normal (for about a week).

I've indicated "Happens every time" below because it does happen every time (after about a week)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start firefox and browse as normal for about a week.
2. Occasionally try to open pdf link (I use acroread as a helper application)
or pls. Try URL given above too.
3. Eventually firefox will start refusing to open all similar links (regardless of content type)
Actual Results:  
Dialog box described above pops up and link content cannopt be accessed.

Expected Results:  
I expect audio from .pls link or acroread to display pdf content.
