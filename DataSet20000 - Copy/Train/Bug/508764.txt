I get these weird rendering problems where parts of a webpage get rendered incorrectly: actual window toolbars get displayed on the page multiple times, or parts of pages from other tabs get mixed up with the page I look at. This rendering problem is illustrated by those two screenshots:

I experience such rendering problems on about 25% of the sites I visit. Usually the problem is not as severe though. I viewed the same pages in other browsers and they had no problem displaying them correctly. I created a new FF profile and even run FF under a brand new Linux user account with no add-ons, plugins, etc. Still the problem remains. Refreshing/reloading the page and changing font sizes does not help.
