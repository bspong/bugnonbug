100% CPU usage by the xserver process *only* when main throbber spins
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1b2pre) Gecko/20081016 Minefield/3.1b2pre

When the current tab is being updated (ie, the main throbber on the menu bar is being updated) the xserver cpu usage will go to 100%. This does not happen if the page is loaded in a different tab while the current tab is idle/blank (ie no main throbber updates)

Easiest way to reproduce is cause the proxy authentication dialog to appear. The main throbber will spin and the xorg CPU will go to 100% everytime. Completely reproducible. This problem has been there for some time, but I have just now narrowed it down to this. I proeviously thought it was cause by certain web sites, but it appears to be something more basic to firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Configure an authenticating proxy
2.Attempt to use said proxy
3.CPU will spike immediately when authentication dialog appears

-or-

pick a website with significant load time. If loaded in current tab you get a spike, if loaded in background, no spike. Spike occurs only when main throbber is being updated.

Actual Results:  
Xserver cpu goes 100% and all interactive response goes to crap.

Expected Results:  
Xserver cpu use should not peg at 100%. It should behave the same as it does when loading into a background tab.
