I usually browse with cookies set to ‘Accept for current Session’ as I do not
like sites tracking be between visits, however on all sites where I deliberately
created an account I obviously do not mind this and would benefit from the
connivance of them using a cookie. Whilst the ‘Ask’ preference allows for this
scenario, it leaves you to manually block thousands of cookies as you are just
browsing around.
It would be helpful under the cookie privacy settings to have separate settings
for cookies set when you follow a link, and cookies set when you submit a form.
If you are browsing the web then any page that sets a cookie before you give it
any information is obviously just tracking your browsing, however if you have
submitted a form then it is a genuine chance you may wish to allow the site to
use a cross-session cookie so you do not have to fill in the form again.
This would have to check that you had actually entered something onto the form
to prevent pages just auto-submitting forms.
