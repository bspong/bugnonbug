Pinch zooming works in 3.6+, but appears to have been unassigned in 4.0b*pre

For example, in 3.6 the pref "browser.gesture.pinch.in" has a default value of "cmd_fullZoomReduce" which results in a zoom out.  FF4.0b7pre and later (maybe earlier too?  Haven't checked yet...) appear to have this and several other gestures blank by default.

I can suggest default values to return the zoom pinches to their previous function, but I suspect a dev somewhere has better answers for this, and maybe even a reason they were unassigned?

Either way, this is a potential problem for tablet and Mac users.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install FF4.0b7pre or later
2. Attempt pinch zoom gestures with or without shift modifier
3. ...
Actual Results:  
Pinch gestures do nothing.

Expected Results:  
Pinch gestures should do something.  My preference would be zoom (I'm pretty sure this universally accepted function at current time)

...with adoption of tablet hardware, this could be a biggie for the 4.x release.
