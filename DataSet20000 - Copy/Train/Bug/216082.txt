The window was last minimized while loading a site and it was blinking so I
clicked to open up the window and give it focus. No matter what combination of
focusing and minizing and maximizing the window, clicking on the other tab, or
bringing it to other websites did it go away. This is the third time it
happened. The other times it was also the same thing, though I don't remember
the details as well.

This time I have two tabs in that window. I also had the computer hibernated
with the window there. I'm not sure how I had it the other times.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
I've tried reproducing it but cannot seem to do it, though it has reproduced
itself on me a few times now. I have also tried to hibernate with tabs, without
tabs, minimized, loading pages, etc. I'm not sure how to reproduce it.

Expected Results:  
Stopped blinking once I focus on to the tab/window. I'm not even sure why it was
blinking in the first place though I don't mind if it's telling me that it
finished loading something. But it shouldn't keep blinking and distracting me
while I'm trying to work.
