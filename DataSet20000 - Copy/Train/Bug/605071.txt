Pages are corrupted: text is scrambled/offset (unreadable), images are made of square blocks..

When scroll down/up the pages, often suddenly the text becomes totally non-legible / unreadable; text lines move one on top or the other, fonts are displayed partially, images have (or partially made up of) lines of even square blocks ('carree') which partially ruin the images displayed. This doesn't happen when I.Explorer is used.
The problem disappears when the page is either refreshed (F5) or scrolled up or down (outside the visible area of the screen) and brought back again into the view, where the page gets re-drawn and that fixes the problem until another part of the document/page gets corrupted.
I suspect compatibility with a latest Professional ATI's Workstation 3D FirePro model# 8800 video card. 

Reproducible: Sometimes

3.Using Internet Explorer, I haven't managed to have this problem yet...
