Multi-window flash causes loss of control

Opening multiple flash files in separate windows appears to cause a loss of control of Firefox as well as the inability to access (mouse over) the windows XP start bar & click anywhere with the mouse.  Keyboard control of the system remains intact but keyboard control of Firefox is lost.

Note that this may be a Flash bug rather than a Firefox bug, however, I am reporting it here because the plugin is causing the browser to become unresponsive.
