1. In Firefox click on Tools > Options > Main tab > Select radio button "Always ask me where to save files" > Click OK

2. Navigate to a website which has a link to download a file like http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm

3. Click on the link "WinRAR 3.80" and choose "Save File"

4. You should see the "Save to" window pop up briefly before disappearing.

5. Click anywhere on the Firefox window and "Save to" window will reappear and then function as normal.

Expected Results:  
After clicking the "Save As" button the "Save to" window should appear and remain in focus (not requiring the user to click on the Firefox window for it to appear)

I have been able to recreate this issue on three separate Windows XP machines.
