There is a flash header on the site provided above. It is in a table with a fixed 176px height. But when I open that site, the table cells height is more then 176, it's sometimes 181px, sometimes 183px (I check it in firebug). When I resize the window or open the firebug, firefox re-renders the top of the page correctly.
(If th table cells height is too big, then a brown border can be seen on the top of the page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the website provided above
2.The brown border is there
3.Resize the window (double-click on the title bar) or open firebug
4.The brown border is gone.
(I am watching it with the firefox window maximized, on 1024×768)
Actual Results:  
The border went away and the cell was resized to 176px height

Expected Results:  
The border should never be seen, and its initial height should be 176px, not just after resize.

We checked it on more computers, with different display resolutions, and the problem still occurs.
