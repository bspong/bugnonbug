Right clicking on links occasionally does not work within Firefox using Windows 7 x64
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.0 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.195.27 Safari/532.0

Occasionally right-clicking on links to, say, open a new tab, does not work within Firefox under Windows 7 x64. From my experience, this usually occurs after about twenty minutes of use. Right-clicking in all other programs and Windows Explorer continues to work, however.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate websites for a while.
2. Attempt to right-click on a link to open a new tab, etc.
3. Right click fails to operate within Firefox, but functions in all other programs and Windows Explorer.
Actual Results:  
Right-clicking fails to work after a period of time surfing the internet.

Expected Results:  
The software should allow me to right-click on links and open new tabs via that route the entire time I am browsing web pages. I have switched to Google Chrome until there is an update to Firefox (which pains me).

I was using the default Firefox theme and do not have any extras currently operating.
