Impossibly slow with scripts
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2) AppleWebKit/537.31 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/26.0.1410.64 Safari/537.31

Steps to reproduce:

Go to almost any web site, including the support web site for Firefox and simply try to use that website. I sometimes see a message saying it is trying to download from xxxx.yyyy.zzzz and sometimes I do not.

I am using Windows 8 and Firefox 20.0.1 but this problem goes back to when I updated to Windows 8. Firefox has been unusable ever since, and even a complete removal using Revo Uninstaller and a new install has not solved the problem for me.

My method of update was to go from XP to Vista, then Vista SP1, then Windows 7 and then Windows 8 in that order one immediately after the other. Firefox has not worked well ever since.


Actual results:

After a wait of up to 4 or 5 minutes the following message will appear. It will sometimes end in :js and sometimes it does not. It matters not, but it will eventually appear. I have to end the script to get to the next such message or to the site I am trying to see. This does NOT happen with IE, with Chrome or with Opera.

A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete.

Script: http://node1.bbcimg.co.uk/glow/glow/1.7.7/core/core.js:19

The Script: http.... will vary but it will take a long time to show up and the choice is to continue with the script of kill the script and I have found I need to kill the script. Then I wait again and sometimes another script issue shows up and sometimes I finally get to the web page I was trying for.

I have disabled all add-ons and gone to basic Firefox and still have the problem. I have reinstalled Java and still have the problem. I have also checked the Hosts file.


Expected results:

The scripts should run without problem and the web site should work fine.
