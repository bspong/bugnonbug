This page calls site's standard linked style sheet, which happens to contain a
background URL for the BODY. But this page needs to override that and so defines
a STYLE for BODY which attempts to nullify the background URL and simply set a
black background color. The specifications in the page's STYLE are desigated
"! IMPORTANT" per the rules. But the background specification in the linked
style is still taking precedence. This fails in Firebird, but works file in
Internet Explorer 6, Netscape Navigator 7.1 and Opera 7.11 ...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Simply go to page
2. Background should be black and the words should start black and fade to white
3. But background actually contains the linked style sheet's background image

Actual Results:  
You'll simply notice that the background is the background image from the linked
style sheet and not a plain black background.

Expected Results:  
It should have had a plain black background.
