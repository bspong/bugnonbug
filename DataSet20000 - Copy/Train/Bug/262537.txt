Tabs opened from left click and from external applications should always open in foreground

If links that open new windows are set to open new tabs instead, and new tabs
are set to open in background, left-clicking links might open them in background.

Although the settings' wording explains that perfectly, I believe left click
should NEVER open things in background. This is very confusing - especially if
you don't expect that. It looks like your click is being ignored. If someone
left-clicked, he wants to follow the link right now. If he wanted to open it in
the background, he would middle click.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set a perfectly reasonable configuration: tabs open in background, new tabs
open for _blank tagrets
2. Find a link with tagret="_blank". Click to follow.

Actual Results:  
You don't follow the link. Something happens (we know what) but you aren't
following the link.

Expected Results:  
The link should open before your eyes, just like for the other two options (same
tab, new window) and just like in other browsers.

Sometimes, a person who never used FF before sits before my computer. Until now,
he never saw a difference (wasn't using it too much) - browsing was just like
before.
Right now, I expect these persons to get stuck at first _blank link they
encounter (and no, I'm not changing my favorite configuration for them...)
