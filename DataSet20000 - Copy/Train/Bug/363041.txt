The active (foreground) browser window should prevent the mouse scroll wheel from interacting with inactive (background) browser, i.e. The scroll wheel should only scroll the tabs when the browser window is active.

Note that if the active window is not Firefox (e.g. window of any other application like Windows Explorer), or if there are no tabs in the background browser window, the mouse scroll won't be able to interactive with the inactive browser window with tabs opened.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Minimize all your windows
2. Start Firefox
3. Open a new tab
4. Open a new window
5. "Unmaximize" and move the the active browser window, so that it overlays the inactive browser window with 2 tabs. Make sure the tab bar is not covered.
6. Position the cursor on top of the tab bar of the inactive browser window and scroll it.
Actual Results:  
The inactive window becomes active and its tabs are scrolled.

Expected Results:  
Should ignore the scroll as it was not interacting with the active browser window (the cursor was outside the border of the active browser window).
