Nightly Plugin Container can't find Quicktime Plugin for ".mp4" (and other MPEG Type) Files.
Visiting a Page with an embedded ".mp4" File causes the 'Plugin-container' (? or whatever it is ?) to display "
A plugin is needed to display this content.
_Install_Plugin_..._
".

In addition there is a 'Notification Bar' (at the top of the Browser's Window) which says: "
Additional plugins are required to display all the media on this page 		[Install missing plugins] X
".


Here are some example Pages:
http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/mp4/cavity_flow_movie.html (more at: http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/mp4/mp4.html )
http://www.axis.com/products/cam_m1114/video/index.htm

Also these "MPEG" Tests do not work (the non-MPEG ones are fine): http://www.student.oulu.fi/~sairwas/object-test/video/ .


Right clicking here: http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/mp4/cavity_flow_movie.mp4 and opening in a new Tab gives a popup titled "Opening cavity_flow_movie.mp4" and has "(.) Open with [Quicktime Player (default)] [V]" showing. The Quicktime Player can play the File perfectly well. The problem is that Firefox that thinks I don't have Quicktime.


Please Note:
1. I do have the newest Quicktime Plugin installed.
2. I can play Quicktime (".mov") files embedded, just not ".mp4" (which Quicktime can play and FF knows it).
3. I can download ".mp4" Files and play them on the Quicktime (external Program) Player.


The problem is that when Firefox (Nightly) encounters an embedded ".mp4" (and apparently ".mp*") File it know to use Quicktime but it thinks that I do not have the Quicktime Player Plugin installed (but I do) and offers to take me to the "Plugin Finder Service"; which then says that I must install Quicktime manually (but I have already).
