I have encountered a strange bug in which a page reload will cause a new window to open up.  See http://tkmame.retrogames.com/ffbug.png for a screenshot.  This does not happen every time, it only happens after many many reloads of severral pages.  However I've noticed that once it starts happening, it happens more frequently.  If I attempt to close the newly created window, firefox will crash.  The only way to remove the new window is to go back to the original browser window and click reload again.

This happens to me on an almost daily basis.  I can easily reproduce this and possibly provide a backtrace on the crash when closing the newly created window if you think this will help.  I reload several pages dozens of times a day (when following stock prices).  After several hours of reloading pages this bug starts to show up.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Unknown if its just any page or just the yahoo! finance pages which trigger this bug.  But I see it happen on a daily basis.  Restarting the browser helps prevent this bug from showing up, as it only occurs after many page reloads.
