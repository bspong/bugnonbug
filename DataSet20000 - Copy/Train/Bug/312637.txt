links that have the _blank or _new cause my mouse-over to become a crosshair instead of the pointing hand

Whenever I point my mouse on a link that has the _blank or _new command in the
html, my mouse pointer changes into a crosshair instead of the pointing hand. My
Mouse preferences on the computer ARE set to the pointing hand, not crosshairs,
and this does not happen in IE. This crosshair setting was once set by me in an
extension a few months ago, but I uninstalled that extension and the mouseover
crosshair still occurs. I've tried searching for the exact extension that gave
me the preference to change my normal mouse pointer to the crosshair, but I
don't think it's available anymore. Even with ALL of my extensions uninstalled
and FF uninstalled and reinstalled, I still get this mouseover crosshair problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
None. This problem was located in an extension I once had but uninstalled it and
I now can't find it to get rid of the mouseover crosshair setting.

Actual Results:  
The mouseover pointing hand becomes a crosshair whenever the mouse hovers over a
link with a _blank or _new link.

Expected Results:  
Shown me the mouseover pointing hand, not the crosshair.

I'm not using any themes or extensions, and I still see the mouseover crosshair
whenever I hover my mouse pointer on a link that has a _new or _blank tag in the
html.
