(1) All sites not secure including mozilla, google (2) google recaptcha not visible
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/56.0.2924.87 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

I loved Mozilla for years but now cannot use Mozilla at all. All sites show security issues and Google Re-captcha does not show up at all.  There seems to be no logical or rational way to set the privacy and security settings for the product to be actually usable.  I found lots of similar reports online and tried everything suggested.
(version 51.0.1 64-bit Windows 7)


Actual results:

Trusted websites including Mozilla, Google, and others generate insecure warnings and some others generate certificate warnings.  (All of my anti-virus and Malwarebytes scans clean so there are is no malware and I have tried Mozilla with anti-virus and firewall completely disabled and also uninstalled but still no luck.  My system date/time and other settings are correct.


Expected results:

The browser should work.  A user of reasonable technical ability cannot get the browser to function.  Under no circumstances should the browser be blocking google.com or recaptcha requests (unless a tech specifically alters a setting to purposely do this).  The default behavior should be that google recaptcha works fine on all sites, but all of my online reading indicates that this problem is rampant everywhere.
