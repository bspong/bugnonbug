Downloads require write permission to "my documents"
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Nothing happens if I try to download to a custom location (using "save as" dialog) if I don't have write-permission to my user profile's "my documents" folder. I usually turn permissions for folder creation off in this directory, given the problem that any application creates a folder and at the end of the day you have hundreds of folders in there. Apparently from 3.5 onwards Firefox needs to create a folder "downloads" there, even if Download-Manager settings are to choose a location for every download.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn off permission for folder creation in profile folder "my documents" (or turn of write permission in gerenal)
2. Delete folder "downloads" in this folder, if it already exists
3. Click any download link in firefox
4. Choose "save to disk" (or similar, translating from german firefox, there it says "Datei speichern")
5. Nothing happens, "save as"-dialog box should show up
Actual Results:  
Nothing

Expected Results:  
Save-as dialog box showing

Might be related to Bug 505660, but there is no mention of the "my documents" permissions as cause to the problem, and the bug is closed, so I filed this one.
