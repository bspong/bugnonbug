Firefox has become a processor hog since v1.5.0.8
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1 Driver4FoBo.ru/0.0.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1 Driver4FoBo.ru/0.0.0.4

Firefox is using so many processor cycles that I can type faster than the text can appear on the screen. The only process with a higher CPU priority is the system idle process (CPU priority = 48-50) vs firefox (CPU priority = 42-47). The processor usage is 48-52% while filling out this form with only this tab open. It is using 157K of memory and 115 user objects.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open firefox, then open 5 tabs to various URLs (irrelevant which ones)
2.Open a new window and open more tabs until system slows down.
3.Close tabs and extra window. System does not recover.
Actual Results:  
System remains slow even though there is only one window/one tab open at home page [URL=http://www.google.com/firefox?client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official]

Expected Results:  
After returning firefox to one tab with home page, system should have performed at the same speed it was operating at when firefox was first opened.

I use the basic firefox app with 25 extensions, all up to date. I am running firefox on a Gateway computer with a Pentium 4 CPU at 3.40 GHz, 2GB of RAM, 1.25 TB of hard drive storage, broadband Internet access and my OS is Windows XP 2002 SP2 with all Microsoft updates except for their Genuine Advantage and IE7.
