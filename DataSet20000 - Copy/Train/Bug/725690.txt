MSNBC does not return to scrolled position
Open http://www.msnbc.com 
Scroll down page, pick a story, then use the mouse back button or the back arrow to return to the main page and note the page jumps around and ends up going to the top of the page, not the scrolled position.  

I also see the bing search box being highlighted, but not sure if this is part of the problem, as it also highlights in IE9.  I did see this behavior once in IE9, now I can't repo the problem with IE9.  Chrome returns to the scrolled position. 

Tested using today's nightly build cset:

This may have started a couple of days ago.  

This may turn out to be tech evang bug - I don't know how to debug site coding.

Not sure these are related but I get this in Console2 when using back:
