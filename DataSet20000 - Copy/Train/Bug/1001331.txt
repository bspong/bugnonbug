debugger doesn't jump to css error line
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:28.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/28.0 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:

http://JesusnJim.com/web-design/DHTML/js-associative-arrays-and-for-in.html
ctrl-shift-i
click console
make sure css only is depressed, for this test
click first error message



Actual results:

Selector expected.  Ruleset ignored due to bad selector. js-associative-arrays-and-for-in.html:5
Unexpected end of file while searching for closing } of invalid rule set. js-associative-arrays-and-for-in.html:6

- currently has css error I can't locate due to truncated filename message.
- error line number or error message doesn't match the file it shows when I over over it (shows html file, which doesn't contain that enough css to warrant 5 lines).
- when I click on the error or error line number, debugger always jumps me to stylesheet editor editing basic.css line 1 (no matter what css error).
- the 2 red circle (2) error messages (whatever that means) that it gives seem to be bogus (?) problem may be in basic.css or in code.css


Expected results:

- hovering over the css error message should have shown tooltip with the correct file with the error in it.
- clicking on the error message or error line number should jump to the css editor at the line number where the problem is.
- filename is truncated way too short. should be a percentage or have a splitter I can move with a default percentage position(well, that would be nice, but if the hover and click thing worked right I could live with it).
