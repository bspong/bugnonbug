After querying Oreilly on google, if the user clicks on the first link (the Oreilly homepage), Firefox will load the homepage, but it will fill only the middle of the screen, leaving the previous google page on the left and right of the screen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://google.com
2. Enter Oreilly and click search
3. Click on the first result
4. Notice that the Oreilly page loads, but leaves the google page behind it
Actual Results:  
The Oreilly homepage loads, but at approximately 60% of the screen, aligned in the middle. The remaining 40% is divided into 20% sections to the left and right of the Oreilly screen, containing the google.com result page.

Expected Results:  
After clicking the link, the browser should have completely redirected to the Oreilly web site, taking up 100% of the screen real estate.
