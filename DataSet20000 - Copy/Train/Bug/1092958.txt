CustomizableUI.jsm Changing toolbarbutton type in a custom widget, after moving it to the palette area, doesn't re-render the button, when 2 or more windows are open.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a custom widget with a toolbarbutton with type of "panel".
2. Set the defaultArea to AREA_NAVBAR.
2. Create an onWidgetRemoved handler and change the button's type to "button" within the handler.
3. Install the extension and open up two FF windows.
4. Go to customization panel in one of the open windows and move the widget to the palette area.


Actual results:

In the window that's been used to move the widget, the button type has changed and its overall look & feel has been updated, to make it look like a button (no arrow next to the icon, which we get for panels). Now if we switch over to the other window, we'll notice that the widget has also been moved, what is a desired behavior, but the way the button looks like, is still wrong, as it has the arrow and still looks like a panel widget, even though the type of the button changes successfully, what's been confirmed by debugging the onWidgetRemoved handler.


Expected results:

When we programmatically change the type of a toolbarbutton, its look and feel should update across all open windows.
