COMPAQ - Keyboard Internet Buttons worked in Internet Explorer, but now that
Firefox is default application, the internet buttons don't take me to their
respective pages.  I am directed to the "Configure Your Keyboard Internet
Button" Page.  I followed the directions on the page three times, and I am still
directed to that page when any of the buttons are pressed.  The normal functions
buttons (calculator, volume, help, sleep) are working properly.  The buttons
worked on Internet Explorer just earlier today.  

PS Having similar problems on laptop(hp pavillion ze5500), except the email
button still opens in internet explorer
