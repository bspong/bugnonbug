False (I think) Error Console Messages
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; rv:22.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/22.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130618035212

Steps to reproduce:

On my website: http://www.galapagos.to/MAPS/INDEX.PHP, practically every link opens a small window to display an image of a map. One example is the following:
http://www.galapagos.to/MAPS/L-945.HTM (it's the first link on the above page).



Actual results:

When the L-945.HTM file opens in a small window, the Error Console reports the following errors:
XUL box for_moz-generated_content_ . . . children to be wrapped in a block.
Unknown property 'box-sizing'. Declaration dropped. (This line displayed three times, first with "box-sizing: border-box; (and so on)" and then twice with "padding-0; (and so on)." However, if I instead use the above URL to directly open the L-945.HTM file, no error messages appear, and the page validates in strict mode at validator.w3.org


Expected results:

No errors should be reported, as there are none. This set of Error Console messages started appearing several months ago -- I guess after one of the Firefox updates. 
So, is there any way to kill these apparently incorrect messages?

Thanks,
