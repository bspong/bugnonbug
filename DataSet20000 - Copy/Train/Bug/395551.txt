The Hauppauge WinTV2K v 4.12.24054 screen blanks to a gray screen color (no image) while browsing using the firefox browser. This is a recent issue. I will look for an older version of firefox to downgrade to and also have to use oper browser (yuk) until this issue goes away.

These are standard drivers for 878 WinTV PCI cards found at:
http://www.hauppauge.com/pages/support/support_pci_878.html
Both the driver and the application exe were installed.

Windows Screen resolution is 1280 x 1024 32bit color

Internet connection is WiFi using
D-Link AirPlus Xtreme G DWL-G132

D-Link software 'not' installed (as found on their CD). Driver for USB Wifi device is found with MS Windows Update and WXP configures the connection.
Local Wifi 'B' 11Mbps connection is used.



My workaround is to maximize the WinTV window, then change it back to the smaller size I keep in the upper right corner next to the FF browser window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. flip through existing pages
2. open new FF browser tab page
3.
Actual Results:  
WinTV screen goes gray (blanked out), audio OK

Expected Results:  
No change to WinTV app, WinTV app should continue with displaying the TV image and not be affected by what is going on with the FF browser actions.

Problem does not occur when using either MSIE v 7.0.5730.11
or Opera
