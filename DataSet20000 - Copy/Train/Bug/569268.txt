Package correct Visual C++ CRT DLLs based on compiler version (fixes MSVCR100.dll error message on startup)
Steps to reproduce:
* Install ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla-central/firefox-3.7a5pre.en-US.win64-x86_64.zip on Windows 64-bit machine without VS2010 being installed
* Run firefox.exe
Expected results:
* Firefox starts
Actual results:
* A message saying that MSVCR100.dll is missing is raised

NOTE: can someone please verify this? I am just filing what I have seen on the mailing lists.

The following are comments from the mailing list:
> I suspect that this is a packaging issue -- if we build with VC10,

...
> Exactly.

From IRC:
