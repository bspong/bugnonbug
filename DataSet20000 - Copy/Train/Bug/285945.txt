on this pagehttp://usabusinesslisting.com/click/index.php , i clicked link
"help" at botton of page. Firefox took me to url then lost url and displayed the
following message:Not Found
The requested URL /click/PPC search engine and online auction combination that
will fill all your advertising campaign needs was not found on this server.

Apache/1.3.31 Server at usabusinesslisting.com Port 80
==================
"PPC search engine and online auction combination that will fill all your
advertising campaign needs" this is found on the faq.html page that the link is
supposed to take me too. It is located in the top of that page's html:
<html>
<head><title>ProductOnly SuperSurf</title><META NAME="keywords" CONTENT="search
engine, traffic exchange,manual surf,advertise you site, complete advertising
campaign package">
<META NAME="robot" CONTENT="revisit-after-10 days">

</head>
======================
How is this possible? 
=====================
i removed everything on that page between <html> and </head> and problem
dissappeared.

What is bad is that AOL browser worked fine..............

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.call up page
2.click link before i deleted head

3.watch

Actual Results:

Expected Results:

SOMETIMES WWW. ETC WONT LET THEM WORK
