When you browse through a site where you can read information and enter forms (e.g. a wiki), then submitting a form, then using back ...

... sometimes it would be nice to skip the form and directly jump to the information page where you came from.

I know, its a bit tricky to detect a "real" form because almost every page has them as a search field or similar; maybe it is possible by making an "educated guess" about the number of fields or the "dominance" of the form in the layout.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a informational page A, e.g. on a wiki
2. browse to a edit page B (with form)
3. enter form and get to the submit-page C
4. use "back"  ...
Actual Results:  
... and find yourself on the edit page B

Expected Results:  
... (optionally) find yourself on the informational page A

Maybe for this feature separated back-buttons are usefull that show in their icon wether they link to a form or the page before the form.

Background: Having the form opened sometimes leads to problems when they accidently submitted twice; it is just confusing.

From a workflow perspective getting to the form is in most cases not what I expect when using "back".
