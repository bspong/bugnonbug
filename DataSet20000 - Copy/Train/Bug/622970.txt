Cannot start Firefox from command line under Leopard
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_8; en-us) AppleWebKit/533.19.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0.3 Safari/533.19.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; rv:2.0b8) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b8

I used to start Firefox (certainly pre-4.0 builds, and I think early 4.0 betas) from the command line, since I can't figure out how otherwise to have multiple different profiles running simultaneously.  Even if there's a work-around, I still miss the ability.  It broke no later than 4.0b7, but possibly earlier; I may have missed some betas.

I have reported this as major because I think not being able to start the software from the command line is; but, since it starts fine via the 'usual Mac route', maybe it's merely normal.  Also note that this is Firefox-specific; Thunderbird 3.1.7, for example, will start just fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. On the command line, enter $ $FIREFOX_PATH/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin
Actual Results:  
The following message appears:
{{{
dyld: unknown required load command 0x80000022
Trace/BPT trap
}}}

Expected Results:  
Firefox starts.

Some Googling (http://www.google.com/search?q=dyld+0x80000022) suggests that this is a problem with running software on Leopard that was compiled under Snow Leopard; see, for example, http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2151112.
