Firebird crashes when I try to login to my Hotmail account.

Firebird crashes when I try to login to my Hotmail account. Browser usually
quits totally (clears cache automatically) though on occasions it freezes and
says "The Plugin performed an illegal operation. You are strongly advised to
restart Navigator" but doesn't tell me which plugin has given a problem?

This fault has only occurd since performing a clean install of Firebird 0.7
Final (15th Oct 03) all versions up to 0.7 (7th Oct 03) performed without errors
(me thinks Micro$oft has tried to nobble your new release ;) )  I've not yet had
this fault on any other page than the Hotmail login page.

I've pulled the 15th Oct. release and reverted to the 7th Oct. release and the
Hotmail error has now gone!?!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to http://lc1.law13.hotmail.passport.com/cgi-bin/login
2. Attempt to login to any Hotmail account!
3.

Actual Results:  
Either the browser quites (which is usuall) or it hangs giving the described
error about a plugin problem?

Expected Results:  
?? Not crashed or hung ??
