Context menu "Search _engine_ for _selection_" opens in new tab rather than in a new window, despite preference settings

There is a context menu entry "Web Search for ..." whenever text is selected. 
This executes a search against the preferred search engine.  The results always
open in a tab regardless of my preference settings.  I don't use tabs (so shoot
me :)) and would like this to open in a new window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn off all tab settings in preferences
2. Select text and right-click
3. Select "Web Search for ..."


Actual Results:  
Search results appear in a new tab.

Expected Results:  
Open the search results in a new window.

The relevant code in browser.js contains the comment "//XXXnoririty I don't want
any prefs switching open by tabs to window".  I don't know if this was because
of a morbid fear of new windows, or because of some problem related to the
preferences or to the search in a new window.  My own rather brutal changes to
this file show that, at least on my platform, opening searches in a new window
works fine.
