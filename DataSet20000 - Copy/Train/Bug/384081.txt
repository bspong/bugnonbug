The OCSP options need a browser restart to get reflected.

If I choose option 3 (Use OCSP to validate all certs using this URL and signer) it gets reflected immediately (and I get an error but that is not what I am reporting). After that if I change to option 2 (use OCSP to validate certs that specify a OCSP URL) it does not get reflected immediately. I have to restart the browser for this to take effect.
Test with gmail.google.com or mail.yahoo.com 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Tools->options->advanced->encryption->verification
2. Choose the third option in the list. (Use OCSP to validate all certs using this URL and signer). Press OK.
3. Go to gmail.google.com. You get an error. 
4. Now go the verification option again and now change the selection to the second one in the list (use OCSP to validate certs that specify a OCSP URL).
5. Press Ok
6. Go to gmail.google.com again. You get the same error as in the previous case.
7. Restart firefox. You can go to gmail.google.com without any errors.
