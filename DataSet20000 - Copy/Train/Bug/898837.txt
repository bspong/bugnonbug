Australis: Fix social-share-button CSS
When merging bug 886816 I noticed our social CSS is a little mixed up... Someone already noted this in bug 875488 comment 79 and bug 875488 comment 80, but I was too busy/lazy to followup at the time.

Note in particular:

It's missing from shared/toolbarbuttons.inc.css (http://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/file/b0549e859d22/browser/themes/shared/toolbarbuttons.inc.css )

However:

http://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/file/b0549e859d22/browser/themes/osx/browser.css#l471

(wrong id?)

http://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/file/b0549e859d22/browser/themes/osx/browser.css#l903

(only in customization panel)

But then:

http://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/file/b0549e859d22/browser/themes/osx/browser.css#l1873

And I don't know which of these wins because I don't know how to get this button to show up.

Because of this, I've left the button in our copy of @primaryToolbarButtons@ for now, because for Australis it *should* be using the sprite sheet, I believe. But this should probably be fixed properly.

(Marking P3 because I don't think this is seen by every user, and it might be OK for the moment but can use cleaning up? In any case, this might be P2 if the impact were bigger / brokenness is very bad right now on UX (which I can't tell))
