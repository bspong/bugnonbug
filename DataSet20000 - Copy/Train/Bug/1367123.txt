Steps to reproduce:

First time poster sorry for mistakes


https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4kuk2j/reddit_change_introducing_image_uploading_beta/

https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/

Goto reddit.com and login using as it has been setup properly

user: imagehostingreddit
pass: 1-8

goto homepage by clicking on top left or reddit.com and
in a new tab start downloading windows 10 iso(just to reproduce easily the problem & can stop it after testing)

Click/middle on images from reddit domain and open as many as possible like 50 or more.

Two problems happen

vanilla Firefox 55 Today's version(mac/linux 32/64bit)

1: images fail to load on many tabs though the connection is high speed and the download in the background also shows it, imagur is hit miss.

2: The tabs show the url name but awesomebar shows about:blank and tab cannot be loaded or refreshed and is gone from the data storage.

This also happens on various sites and not only reddit which have used for reference others like google accelerated pages(those light pages made for slow/mobiles) when on the move (uber to office and high latency/slow connection)

    Google images
    Facebook pages
    Imgur
    Wikipedia images links
    Twitter images/pages
    Bing images/pages
    Ebay review pics/ urls
    Linkedin
    Pinterest images/pages

These are the other sites where it can be seen if open many tabs quickly
*Try again / Reload page is never shown!!!!!!*

Some one suggested disabling throttling by toggling network.throttle.enable
but no use

Using Firefox 50 without this issue, 53/55 *I hit this problem every time*

Please help, chrome and others have no problem even if they hog cpu/ram
