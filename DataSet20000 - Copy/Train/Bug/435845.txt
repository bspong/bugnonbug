When I try dragging a link(bookmark/identity/link) onto menupopup of folder on
the Bookmarks Toolbar placed on toolbox,

At the positions more than the number that there was bookmarks/folders before reboot Fx.

A: Drag over bookmark/folder, dragdrop Indicator will is broken.
b: Drag over folder, the folder does not expand.





Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox  in new profile.
2. Create a folder named "AAA" in the "Bookmarks Toolbar" placed on toolbox,
3. Add 3 Bookmarks in the folder "AAA", Now "AAA" has 3 bookmarks.
4. Restart Firefox
5. Add 1 or more Bookmarks in the folder "AAA", Now "AAA" has more than 3 bookmarks.
6. Drag a link/Bokmark into dropdown menu of "AAA"

Actual Results:  
"Dropdown indicator" is not displayed at the positions more than the number that there was bookmarks/folders before reboot Fx.

Expected Results:  
"Dropdown indicator" should be displayed.

I think _endMarker(in places\menu.xml) may be broken in Bookmarks toolbar.

And this bug may cause serious Bug 435742 also.
