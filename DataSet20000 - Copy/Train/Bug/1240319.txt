Steps to reproduce:

Hello,

When using Firefox with our application, we can see in devtools/network tab that many long polling XMLHttpRequest (post request) are aborted without apparent reason (reproducible even on localhost).

The requests works at the beginning, the server is reached, then after a short period of time (usually less than one minute), they are aborted (status code of 0). There is no timeout on the requests, and not abort() call in the code.

This issue happen with Firefox 43 (and also tried with Firefox/Iceweasel 44.0~b6-1 from Debian experimental) even with --safe-mode. The issue doesn't happen with Firefox 42, Firefox 38, and Chromium 48.0.2564.23.

Our website can be tested at https://www.libervia.org (I have created the account mozilla/mozilla so you can test).

I join a screenshot of the network tab in devtools, where json_signal_api request are aborted.

Tested on Debian/Sid, Firefox/Iceweasel 43.0.4-1 (and 44.0~b6-1 from experimental).

Thanks


Actual results:

Request are aborted randomly (but really often) after a random but short (less than 1 min) amount of time.


Expected results:

request should be pending until an answer is received
