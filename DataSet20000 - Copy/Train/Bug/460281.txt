FTP does not seem to follow down directory links correctly

The way Explorer 7 and Firefox handle ftp directories is different  ( who is at fault I leave to your judgment ) 



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

A good example is on one of my suppliers web sites.....
http://www.abatron.ch/products/debugger-support/gnu-support.html

On the right hand side under more information is a link to a directory tree of support files

If I follow the config link 
ftp://78.31.64.234/bdigdb/
It shows the Config and Setup directory
So far so good  works the same in Explorer 7 and Firefox
but if I now select Config

in Explorer 7  it shows the sub directories  fine and I can follow down to the files
in Firefox 3.0.3 it does not show any subdirectories or files

Both show ftp://78.31.64.234/bdigdb/config/   in the destination box
But if I cut and paste the above ftp into firefox it shows what I expect 

A little more experimentation shows that on the page ftp://78.31.64.234/bdigdb/
the link down to the config level shows as 

ftp://78.31.64.234/bdigdb/config

Without the last forward /

Explorer will display the contents correctly with or without the  /   but Firefox needs the following slash

although when going down from the web page it shows that / in the destination box it does not seem to action it

 if when firefox does not action the slash you hit refresh it seems to work OK

I don't know it that's something the web server has control over or is something in my Firefox settings .... but I did take a look around and could find nothing
