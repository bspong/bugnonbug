Browser Console landing added 10 minutes to Windows debug browser-chrome tests
https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Fx-Team&tochange=26fb3bd67f5f&fromchange=07aae4e9a66a is the Browser Console landing and the push before it.

If you look at debug browser-chrome run times, they jumped 5-10 minutes, which is most severe with WinXP and Win7 debug, because buildbot has a 2 hour time limit per buildstep, and thanks to our gradual climb as shown in http://people.mozilla.org/~catlee/sattap/f10048de.png we were already getting close to being up against that. Now we are up against it, losing around one run a day to a timeout until the next time someone adds a bunch of new tests, or makes one work harder, or makes us slower, when we'll suddenly start timing out in nearly every one.

Ted suggested that "that patch mentions using the debugger api, wonder if it somehow enables the debugger api and forgets to disable it" which based on too small a sample size does seem likely to be the case. Comparing the time from the start of the test run up to the first devtools/ test, then the time for all the devtools/ tests, then the time for the tests which follow devtools/, we seem to be at around the same time, a couple minutes longer, around eight minutes longer. Making the tests *after* your tests run more slowly than they did before certainly does sound like leaving debugging turned on.

If so (or, really, even if not):

<jimb> It might be interesting to have the test harness assert that no compartments are in debug mode by the time we begin to shut down.
<jimb> That way we could catch "leaked" Debuggers.
