Massive Memory Leak when using NoScript in Firefox 4
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

Discovered this memory leak while doing some work on a highway project and was wondering why FF4 RC1 was using so much more memory than when I was doing this in FF 3.6.15 before the upgrade.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0. Have at least NoScript installed first.
1. Load: http://cmap.m-plex.com/hb/hwymap.php?mt=g&r=ky.us031w&sys=usaus&rg=all&gr=&off=&showint=30
2. View each layer in this order: Mapnik (starting point) > Osmarend > CHM > Yahoo Map > Yahoo Aerial > Bing Map > Bing Arerial > Bing Hybrid > Map > Satellite > Hybrid > Terrain > (back to) Map
3. Pan around the USA twice (around the border) using the mouse in the big window.
4. "center" the map back at the starting point via the hand in the middle of the panning circle.
5. Zoom in all the way with the "Zoom In" (the "+") button.
6. Zoom all the way out using the "Zoom Out" (the "-") button.
7. Repeat Step 5.
8. Repeat Step 6.
9. Firefox should dump some memory. (wait about 1-2 minutes)
10. Hit the Recenter button so it's zoomed back in.
11. Do another two laps panning around the USA (like in step 3) and then recenter again.
Actual Results:  
Memory Usage by FF was off the charts.

Expected Results:  
Memory Usage should have been no more that 200,000K at any time during this (especially if it was the only tab open).  More reasonably no more that 150,000K if possible. (IE9 can do it with less than 60,000K of memory usage.)

At that link, I have the exact memory usage results of several different tests (Safe Mode, NS by itself, AB+ by itself and AB+ & NS together).  This also might be related to bug 639186.
