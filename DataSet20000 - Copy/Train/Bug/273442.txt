Firefox hangs often when running it on KDE
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0 StumbleUpon/1.999
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

This is a bit of a tricky bug to report, because... well, it's very strange. 
Whenever I run Firefox (1.0, but it was present in earlier versions too) under
KDE (3.3.1, haven't tested earlier versions) the browser hangs at unpredictable
times.  The browser does not crash though; the hang only lasts a good five
seconds or so.

It is extremely annoying though.  The complete UI becomes unresponsive, and all
Firefox windows, not just the one I have open, freeze.  Other applications
continue to behave normally.

Under other window managers such as Fluxbox and other desktops such as GNOME, I
never have this problem.  Firefox runs perfectly.  But under KDE, it happens
quite often.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firefox 1.0 on KDE 3.3.x (probably any 3.x though) and just start using
it as you normally would.
2. Keep using it until Firefox hangs
3. Wait for the browser to hang.  When it does, wait it out and it will
eventually go back to normal.

Actual Results:  
browser hangs at unpredictable times

Expected Results:  
browser should behave normally under any desktop and not hang
