both Firefox 3 and Firefox 3.5 do not navigate back on a bookmark link placed in a division that had been set overflow: scroll (-y or auto) and has a fixed positioning

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Pls.try the attached HTML test case
2. Navigate on the  bookmark link placed into a fixed positioned div which has an overflow-y: scroll (Css attr), then press the browser GO BACK
3. 
Actual Results:  
It won't  position back to that document point where from the jump occurred.

Unfortunately, the GO Back from a bookmark link placed in either of similar design which has absolute or fixed positioned divisions set to overflow: auto or scroll won"t work. Listen to the bottom: 0 (Css attr) will affect hiding the body scrollbar if the BODY height: 100% set, even when the body overflow: hidden doesn't set.

Expected Results:  
Such kind of design is very useful, because doesn't require the content to be loaded into an iframe in which the bookmark links Go back also circumstantially work. 

I expect the GO BACK to work correctly in such a design under Firefox also, since it works well in IE7.

The HTML code of a sample page has been attached. Pls. try it.
