Crash and stops it from working when too many characters are typed in a textfield
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; pt-BR; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; pt-BR; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

The Mozilla crashes AND stop working (even when you reboot the machine, or try
to disable the auto-complete in settings menu)
When does this happen?
When you got the Auto-Complete feature enabled and you type a lot (I mean a
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT) of characters in a textfield, the next time the
browser try to recover that word it will crash.
And you can't disable the auto-complete feature because it crashes if you do so.

The only way to fix the problem is browsing (not with mozilla =P) to the folder
where the auto-complete words are stored (I forgot the path to it) and delete
THE file.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enable the Auto-Complete feature.
2.Type a lot, I mean a lot, more than k k k k characters in a textfield
3.Click on the submit button (so the browser will save the word you typed to
recover it when you visit the website next time
4.Get back to the same website and let the browser show the list of
auto-complete words and see it crashing...

Actual Results:  
The browser crashed, and the PC has become 100% used by the Mozilla Software

Expected Results:  
Have a limit of N characters to "remember" on auto-complete fields, like this...
* if the guy types 150 chars the browser saves only 30 (the dev. will have to
test the limit of the PC/software and set that number)
