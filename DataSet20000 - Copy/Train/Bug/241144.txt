when i open alot of tabs, in a window, and i wish to bookmark it, by using
CTRL+D, pressing on the right button of the mouse and choose bookmarks, or
choosing to bookmark using the "bookmark" menu.

afther i close many of the tabs i can bookmark again the pages.
if i open a new window, it is not effected by the problem.

happned when i had a lot of tabas opend (i don't know the amount).
