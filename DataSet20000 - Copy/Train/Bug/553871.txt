On YouTube particularly, if a video is playing or has just finished and another video link is clicked, a box pops up that says, "You have chosed to open watch which is a: application/octet-stream from http://www.youtube.com. What should Firefox do with this file? Open with (browse) Save File and an "OK" and "Cancel" button. If I click "cancel" and try again, it will just go into a perpetual "loading" and only rarely will it load. It usually requires me to shut down Firefox and reopen it again. Quite bothersome, especially since it never did it before and was very stable with video before this release.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to Youtube and start a video.
2.While it is still playing or immediately after it stops, click another video link.
3. If it doesn't work, do it a couple more times. It almost always does it to me.


Expected Results:  
Followed the link to the different video and started playing it. 

I haven't used any other video sites lately, so don't know if it will do it elsewhere. I am also using Walnut for Firefox 1.8.58.
