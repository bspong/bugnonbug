1st run with a pop up window
	65~70% usage of cpu
then with fullscreen
	100% with a jerky playback
	*I can't see any message about hardware acceleration in error console but see some dlls loaded which are d3d8thk.dll, d3d9.dll, opengl32.dll, nvoglnt.dll(NVIDIA Compatible OpenGL ICD)
back to window mode
	100% to the end, looks like something to be released hogging the cpu continuously.

2nd run with restarting firefox and opening video link in new tab
	about 60~65%
then with fullscreen
	100% with a jerky playback
back to window mode
	about 60~65%, no strange overhead here

Using DirectShow video mix render 9 do the rendering (yuv to rgb, scaling ...). This can support most graphic cards from dx7, dx8 ,dx9(intel945G)
