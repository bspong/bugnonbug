I have searched mozillaZine on variations of "broken website tool" to no avail.  I have searched BugZilla including ancient bug reports (circa 2003-2005) and find only "works as designed" commentary in very old versions without explanation. 
I have examined bug reports describing alternate profiles and entries in the about:config and confirmed my settings against the suggested values.
