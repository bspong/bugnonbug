Hello! I've been having some problems with some websites like Tumblr, Twitter, Youtube and Facebook. Every hour I have to clean cache so the website can look normal. Right now, even if I do that, everything looks bad and I just cant even log in... My computer has Windows 8, and Firefox, even with some problems like these ones, is the one that works better here.

When loading the Twitter website, the stylesheets do not load for some reason. I'm left with the display as if I'd went to "View" > "Page style" > "No style". Double checking, I do not have this setting applied. Twitter website currently works fine on other browsers.
