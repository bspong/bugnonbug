There audio to video delays in Final Cut and Quicktime caused by a memory leak caused by Firefox when is opened in the same time with the applications. The quick fix is to close Firefox when you play or export and the delay would go away.
The problem does not come immediately when Firefox is opened but it accumulates in time, reaching a peak of close to 1 second delay after one hour when the browser is opened. It manifests such that any quicktime existing on the machine will play delayed even if FCP is not open. You move the quicktime to another machine and it plays fine there.
I remembered having this issue in another facility several weeks ago and trying to close the applications to minimize the memory usage, I fixed it by closing both opened browsers, Safari and Firefox, so I never knew which one was causing the leak. I called now the editor to check what is the status and he told me that the problem is there but everytime when he needs to play audio he closes Firefox and the delay goes away.
