All the articles/stories on the USA Today website allow user-written comments after the story.  To post a comment, the user must be registered with a User-ID and password.  

With Foxfire 3.5, an attempt to post a user comment fails.  Nothing happens when I click on the "submit" button.  My attempted post never gets sent to USA Today.  

This feature has been working correctly on prior versions of Foxfire.  It is only the Foxfire v 3.5 that is failing.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Sign up for a user account on USA Today
2.  Login to your user account
3.  On the USA Today website, choose any current story and the text of that story appears.
4.  Scroll to the end of the story and you will see user comments.  
5.  Since you are logged on to USA Today, there will be a place for you to enter your own user comment.
6.  Key enter the text of your comment.
7.  Click the "submit" button.
8.  Your comment should get posted to the blog, but on my computer nothing happens.  
9.  On prior versions (prior to v 3.5) of Foxfire, this feature always worked correctly.  On v 3.5 it always fails.
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.  The comment that I have written does not post to USA Today

Expected Results:  
My comment should appear as the last comment on the article
