I added a new language to my preferences, but then was unable to move the
language up before I exited completely from the preferences dialog. I had a list
of: en-us, sv, es, en; I added fr. It appeared at the bottom of my list.  I
tried to click on the newly-added French selection, but it never became
highlighted like the other languages do, so I couldn't figure out how to move it
up at first. I had to hit ok on both the language dialog and the preference
dialog, and then reopen them before fr became highlightable.

Upon retesting I realized that you can actually move the language as soon as
it's created; it just doesn't show up visibly as highlighted.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Edit->Preferences->Languages
2. Choose a new language and add it to the list
3. Try to click on the newly added language

Actual Results:  
The language remained unhighlighted (white background / black text)

Expected Results:  
The language should appear highlighted (blue background / white text)
