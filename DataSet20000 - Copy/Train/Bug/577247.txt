plugin-container.exe uses alot of memory, as well as firefox.exe when viewing flash sites

After viewing a few youtube videos and other flash sites like hulu.com, firefox.exe becomes very unresponsive and i noticed it uses more than 1GB of RAM. Not many tabs are open... and only 1 window is open. I have had as many as 60 tabs all together in several windows open at the same time before, and this never happened before. also, plugin-container.exe causes firefox to become unresponsive as well, as uses memory in excess of 60MB which I feel is too much. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. watch a few youtube vids
2. watch a few hulu vids
3. have a few tabs open (like around 5)
4. continue browsing normally.... it should lock up and freeze or be really slow
Actual Results:  
firefox became slow and used more than 1GB of RAM, plugin-container.exe used more than 60MB of RAM

Expected Results:  
firefox.exe should have used around 500MB of RAM like it usually does and still be very responsive and fast, etc. 
why did u start using "plugin-container.exe"?
