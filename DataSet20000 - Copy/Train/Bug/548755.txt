After uninstalling an add-on with icons onto an user defined toolbar, this empty toolbar won't be deleted from firefox

I added icons from an add-on to an user defined toolbar.

I uninstalled the add-on and restarted firefox.

After every (re)start, the empty user defined toolbar is still there.
While empty toolbars should be deleted automatically this "visually" empty user defined toolbar, wasn't and won't be deleted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create user defined toolbar
2. add icons from an add-on
3. uninstall add-on
4. restart firefox
Actual Results:  
the user defined toolbar is "visually" empty and exists even after many restarts

Expected Results:  
the user defined toolbar should be deleted at the next restart, eventually already at the restart after uninstalling the related add-on with icons on this toolbar

the user defined toolbar should be really empty after loosing the icon providing add-on and should be deleted at the restart after uninstalling the add-on or at the next restart after restarting after uninstalling the add-on.
