Yahoo had taken over everything
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.11; rv:44.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/44.0
Build ID: 20160210153822

Steps to reproduce:

open firefox
try to watch video's on various sights
open a new search window
All this happened when I updated to the 44.0.2


Actual results:

90% of the time when I close firefox and reopen it, it opens to yahoo search. It doesn't matter how many times I go and change the home page and delete yahoo from my search engines it keeps coming back. Some times I'll go and change it open a new window to search something and it's back to being yahoo. Then to make things worse I'll try to watch a video on a this web sight or another. The video starts playing and I get yahoo again saying dsn solution yahoo error and the search bar as random crap in. Here's one of the link copped from the address bar,https://search.yahoo.com/yhs/errorhandler?hspart=gt&hsimp=yhse-gt&q=http%3A%2F%2Frc.rlcdn.com%2F361726.gif%3Fn%3D1&type=808263 (that's from anime-joy.tv) this one is from neon alley https://search.yahoo.com/yhs/errorhandler?hspart=gt&hsimp=yhse-gt&q=http%3A%2F%2Fbid.g.doubleclick.net%2Fxbbe%2Ftest%2Fwest2%2Fhuluuserid&type=808263


Expected results:

None of this should have happened. This is not how any of this should work. I should be able to watch hulu, or neon alley without yahoo coming up with random stuff.
