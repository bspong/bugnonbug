Firefox can use up to 700MB of memory when opened for hours with about 5-6 tabs open
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

I am using the final version of FF 1.5, and I have 2 themes installed (default, and flock 0.2), but I the one being used is default.  I also have some extensions installed (talkback, download statusbar, adblock plus, foxytunes, and sage) all of which are using the latest version and enabled.  I have a couple dozen bookmarks, nothing outrageous, and when firefox is open for a couple of hours, it always goes above 200-300MB of ram, but I have seen it go over 700MB.  I do not do anything that I believe is unusual, and I do not know if this is caused by a specific action on my part.

I have the AMD Athlon 64 3500+ processor with 2GB of dual channel RAM (4x512MB, all dual channel).

Also, I created a completely clean profile (no extensions, themes, bookmarks, etc other then those that come with a clean profile), and after about 15 minutes of firefox use (5 tabs are currently open), firefox is using 50MB of RAM and 40MB of VM.  This still seems fairly high and there are no extra anythings installed in this profile.

I can't think of any more information that might be needed or that I can offer, but if anyone needs any, please don't hesitate to ask.

Reproducible: Always
