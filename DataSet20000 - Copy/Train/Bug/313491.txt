All versions of Firefox (pre 1.0 - 1.5b2) on Mac OS X 10.3.x-10.4.2 with QuickTime 6.5-7.0.3 have had problems with stuttering video. If the QT movie loads completely before playing back everything will be fine. If the movie loads partially and begins playback, the moment the caching/loading of the remainder of the clip completes the remaining playback video stutters (looks like 1/2 the fps or worse). The audio sounds fine. If you then 'rewind' the clip and play again it will still stutter. It seems to return to normal playback for the last 1/2 second or so of the clip, too.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open provided link, or any other large(r) QT mpeg clip.
2. Wait for playback to begin. Watch quality of video while paying attention to the loading of the entire clip.
3. Notice QT video stream stutter as soon as the clip is loaded while playback hasn't completed.
4. Play clip from beginning, again, and notice entire clip now stutters in video stream.
Actual Results:  
Video stutters.

Expected Results:  
Video should play back smoothly.
