OS X: Firefox Find Bar should not transfer to global Find pasteboard by default
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.2.17) Gecko/20110420 Firefox/3.6.17

Currently, OS X and other applications can see everything the user types into the Find bar because it gets into the OS X global Find pasteboard.  I believe this violates convention/expectation, and so should at least require the user's explicit permission.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  In TextWrangler, hit Command-F and search for a term.
2.  In Firefox, hit Command-F and search for a different term.
3.  In TextWrangler, hit Command-G to "Find Again".

Actual Results:  
TextWrangler magically searches for whatever you just typed into the Firefox Find bar.

Expected Results:  
TextWrangler should continue searching for the same term it searched for before, and should not be able to detect what you typed into Firefox.

BareBones provides "defaults write com.barebones.textwrangler FindDialog:UsesFindScrap -bool NO" to stop it from using the global Find pasteboard, but I think Firefox should not be putting user's Find data there in the first place, at least without the user's explicit permission.

My understanding is that the convention/expectation of Command-C, Command-X, and Command-V is global while that of Command-F and Command-G is local, and that the probability of someone wishing to find the exact same term on a Web page in a browser and on an unrelated document in an unrelated application is too low to warrant violating the convention.
