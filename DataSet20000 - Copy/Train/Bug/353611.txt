User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20060918 Firefox/2.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20060918 Firefox/2.0

Use Case:
- A user, while on a web page might want to open multiple links from the web page or search for some text on the web page

Current Implementation:
- Right click on the link and select to open it a new tab
- Select the text and drag it to the Search Bar

Suggested Implementation:
- A user should be able to drag a link from a current page to anywhere on the current page (not just the tab/tabbar) and the link should load in a new background tab
- A user should be able to select text from the current page and drag it anywhere on the current page and Firefox should search for the text using the selected search engine. The search result should open in a new background tab

Extended Implementation:
- We could provide the user with an option (or a hidden about:config preference) to allow him to open the new tab in the foreground instead of background.

User Experience:
- A very useful functionality and a definite leap in browsing experience. Can be currently experienced through extensions like Drag De Go (https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2918/ ). 

Reproducible: Always
