In IE, when I access my company mail in web outlook, I get that day's calendar events that I have put in earlier in a popup. These are recurring events that I have setup. When I open the company mail in Firefox, this does not happen! I can setup recurring events even in Firefox. I have't set them up in Firefox yet but I looked in the new calendar event section of web outlook express using Firefox and saw that recurring option are available. Only, I don't get reminders of things that I have to do.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Access email via web outlook.
2.Setup recurring calendar events.
3.They do not show up as they are supposed to.

Actual Results:  
You will need access to email via web outlook.

Expected Results:  
No calendar event comes up even when it is scheduled to show up!

A popup should come with the calendar event scheduled. And yes, I have that page unblocked so that popups are not blocked.
