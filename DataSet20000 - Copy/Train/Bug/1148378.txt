User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E; InfoPath.3; MDDRJS; rv:11.0) like Gecko

Steps to reproduce:

While using Firefox 36, I will sometimes get to a page that locks up for a short period of time and then goes ahead. I try to back out of the app by ending it and then re-open the app.


Actual results:

You can end the app from your view but then you can never re-open Firefox because it says it is still running. This blocks opening any other session of the app and makes it impossible to launch it in any way. You cannot end any portion of it's DLLs to end the app, end the process in any way. You have to shutdown the machine and restart to be able to use Firefox again. All plug-ins and extensions are up-to-date and safe and this error has nothing to do with media based sites such as YouTube, etc.


Expected results:

When wanting to shutdown a Firefox session, it should be able to be done by simply ending the app or at least be able to kill the process. Nothing is possible to end the one session of Firefox running besides shutting down the Windows 7 machine it is on. When you do this, it may not give any detail in the crash report.
