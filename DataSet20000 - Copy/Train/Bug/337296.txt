Expected Results:  
Normal browsing experience.

Here's what I tried so far:

- Going back to FF 1.5.0.2
- Completely removing FF and all directories, reinstalling FF 1.5.0.3
- Upgrading video driver (was at lower version, now at highest supported)
- Disabling DirectX DirectDraw Acceleration via dxdiag
- Placing copy of GDIPLUS.DLL into Firefox installation directory

None of the above produced any improvement.  The problem seems to go away if I do the following:

- Enter (Windows 98) Display Properties, go to Settings, click on Advanced, go to Performance, knock Hardware Acceleration down 2 notches (so it's at the 2nd click from left).  After that the FF fault in gdi.exe does not occur any more.  However other applications like certain games etc. will not function now with the Hardware Acceleration degraded like this, so not a good permanent solution.
