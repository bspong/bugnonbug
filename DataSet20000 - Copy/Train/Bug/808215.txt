Disable social API in private windows (for per-window Private Browsing builds)
In bug 807217 we disabled social during private browsing.

We need to decide whether social will be available in per-window private browsing mode.  

If we do want to enable it, I think there are a couple directions to go:

#1 -------------------

Social is enabled, but separate from non-PB mode windows.

Get frameworker to support more than one worker per provider.  Any windows not in PB mode would use the global frameworker.  Any windows with PB enabled would have their own frameworkers.

Downside is added overhead in loading a social provider and the additional workers, per pb-mode-window.  Upside is being able to use a different account in PB-mode windows.

#2 ----------------------

Social is initially disabled (hidden) in the PB mode window. The user can "enable" Social for that window, and perhaps set a pref to always enable.

Upside, we can share the frameworker that is already loaded.   Downside, you end up using the same login as the non-PB mode windows.

#3 ---------------

We do not allow any socialapi functionality in private browsing windows.

Downside, my favorite discreet dating service cannot make a social provider I would use.  Yes I'm joking wink wink.

-------------

I prefer #3 for a couple reasons.  No surprise to the user entering private browsing.  Somewhat lower overhead.  I think this would be a simpler implementation given the current socialapi architecture.
