Regression: Youtube, Vimeo and Soundcloud players don't work anymore
What did you do?

First I updated Firefox to 9.0.1. Previously all the mentioned players worked. I'm using the Shockwave Flash Plugin 11.1 r102 from 13.11.2011, so it is not an issue of the flash plugin. My OS is Ubuntu 11.10.

Youtube: I tried to view several Youtube videos, e.g.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzLQGQY8EhQ

Vimeo: Again tried several videos, like

Soundcloud: I tried to play several audo tracks like those from

What happened?

Youtube: Instead of the player I only get a black rectangle so I can't view Youtube videos anymore. 
In the error console I got this:
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Failure"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: http://s.ytimg.com/yt/jsbin/www-core-vflhGADTg.js :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 70"  data: no]

Vimeo: Here it is a white rectangle instead of the player. In the error console I get an
Error: swap is not defined
Source File: http://vimeo.com/34447797
Line: 1

Soundcloud: Player looks normal but a click on play shows no reaction. Nothing in the error console.

What should have happened?

Youtube and Vimeo player should be shown and play the videos. 

Soundcloud player should play the audio clips.

Keep in my mind: Bugs like these make people move over to Chrome and others.
