When I loaded the new version my all history, and bookmarks disappeared. The history did not begin to fill in even after going to several pages. The history did not fill as I went from location to location. 

After several attempts to locate a possible fix for the I also noticed that the back a page button on will not allow you to back up a screen from the tab that you are working in. The only way to go backwards was to close the tab and reload where I was going. 

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
(1) I expected like in the last loads that the bookmarks would sync. 

(2) I would expect to see a history for the day to show with the ability to load a history from another day if needed. the history should fill in like the bookmarks upon upgrade of the version like the last version did.

(3) I would expect that if you go from one page to the next that you should be able to use the back screen button after the first page. 



(1) I would like to have a button in the bookmarks tab that if the bookmarks did not load for some reason that there was a manual sync button.
