Firefox (5 and above) doesn't follow some links
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:7.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0.1
Build ID: 20110928224103

Steps to reproduce:

I'm currently using Firefox 7.0.1. Ever since Firefox 5 a lot of website links which were working for me back in Firefox 3 no longer work.

For example http://is1.mum.edu/vedicreserve/kalp.htm -- none of the links under "PDF files" work (yes this site shows them as images but that is no reason why the link shouldn't work).

Also, https://www.akeebabackup.com/download/akeeba-backup/akeeba-backup-3-3-4.html -- go down to the Quick Start Guide or any of the following sections and click Download in each -- they don't work. Interestingly, the Download link under "Akeeba Backup Core" works.

All these URLs not working under Firefox 5 and above are found to be working in Google Chrome 12 and above.

In the case of the Akeeba site, I first thought maybe it is a site problem so I asked at the forums: https://www.akeebabackup.com/support/forum/sites-and-infrastructure/documentation-downloads-not-working-on-firefox-5/limit/50/offset/0.html where it was pointed out that it is a problem with Firefox only, and indeed, Chrome handled all the above websites/links perfectly.
