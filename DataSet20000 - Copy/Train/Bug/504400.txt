In Windows 7 x64 if Microsoft Speech Recognition is open and listening while a Firefox window is in focus the CPU usage spikes and both/all programs become almost unusable.  If the Firefox window is minimized or if speech recognition is turned off then stability returns and the CPU usage drops back down to usual levels.  Since speech recognition chooses the possible commands based on what is currently on the screen and the issue is only when Firefox is the selected/active window (not just if it is running), this may suggest that the grammar or contents of the window are overloading the speech recognition with possible commands to listen for.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn on Windows Speech Recognition and set it to listen.
2. Open Firefox and focus on it.
Actual Results:  
The loading circle appears on the voice recognition continuously and everything runs incredibly slow, CPU usage spikes and Firefox hangs

Expected Results:  
The loading bar should only come up momentarily after speaking a command and not at all if the user does not speak.
