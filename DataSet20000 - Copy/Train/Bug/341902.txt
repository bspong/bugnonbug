Bookmarks-> "Subscribe to this page..." is not aligned properly with "Bookmark This Page..." and "Bookmark All Tabs..." when there are two or more RSS feeds available on a page to subscribe to.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch FF
2. Navigate to http://www.cnn.com/
3. Click "Bookmarks" and observe that the padding for "Subscribe to this page..." is not the same as the padding for "Bookmark This Page...".

Actual Results:  
When visiting a page with more the one RSS feed available to subscribe to "Subscribe to this page..." is misaligned compared to "Bookmark This Page..." and "Bookmark All Tabs...".

Expected Results:  
When visiting a page with more the one RSS feed available to subscribe to "Subscribe to this page..." is aligned with "Bookmark This Page..." and "Bookmark All Tabs...".

This does not occur when there is only one feed available to subscribe to.  I assume this is do to the fact that this only occurs when the chevron is displayed to indicate there is more then one feed to select.
