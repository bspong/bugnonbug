When watching a Youtube video, which uses Flash video, while using Firefox 1.9.1.3593.   If music has been added to any video, and the music popup window
pops up, there is a list of music and if you click on the 'x' to close it out, the page scroll feature is disabled.  You then have to use the left click and hold on the scroll bar in the browser to scroll down.  However, the next time you
view any video and there is music with a popup, and you DON'T click on the 'x',
the page scroll feature is re-enabled.  There is an issue between the popup music window and the page scroll feature.  Not related to the sidebar scroll, just the scroll in page feature where you drag on the page to scroll down.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to Youtube and pick ANY video.
2.Wait for the popup music window inside the video window.
3.Try to scroll on the page, not the sidebar. 
Actual Results:  
You can test the page scroll before you view the video.
After the video pops up, click on the 'x' to close it out.
Now try to page scroll.
Click on another video, wait for the music popup.  DO NOT click on the 'x' to close it out.  Try to page scroll again.  There is a logic toggle that is happening with Flash player and the page scroll feature in Mozilla Firefox.

Expected Results:  
The page scroll is toggled when you close out the music popup and re-enabled on
the next popup IF you don't close the music popup in the video window.
