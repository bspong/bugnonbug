updated to 3.6 today. Now Firefox is dead
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0; Trident/4.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Media Center PC 5.0; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729)

All of my tabs say "Problem loading page" when I click to start Firefox. "Unable to connect" on all pages instead of content. IE works fine.
This was not a problem until today when it asked me to upgrade to the latest version.

Security settings off. Microsoft Firewall disabled. No malware present.

Apparently this is an ongoing problem that dates back several years. I've been using Firefox for a very long time now, and this is the first itme I have run into an issue such as this. If IE connects, why won't Firefox?

I have tried every trick I can think of, including using a restore point.
The only thing left for me to do is delete any and all signs of Firefox from my system, and hope a reinstall fixes whatever is hosed up. Hate to do that though.

Any tip or trick I might have overlooked? Is there an easy fix to this that I somehow missed in my efforts to get my Firefox back up and running? I'd appreciate any response.

I've tried flushing the dns.
I've tried setting ipv6 to true, then back to false.
I tried setting special permissions.
I referenced the connection settings to those of IE. Similar. No proxy.
I've grown a full head of gray hair...

I've rebooted more times today than I have since I bought the computer.
There is nothing else I have read about online (through IE) that I have not tried. All because of an update to 3.6.

Again, never had this issue before with any previous version of Firefox. I'm not sure why it would die like this now, but I'm really at a loss to fix this problem.

Thanks for your time and consideration. I look forward to any response figuring this out.
