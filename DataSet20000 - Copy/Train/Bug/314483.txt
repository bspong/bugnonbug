Intel P43.06 laptop recently upgraded firefox 1.0.4 to 1.0.7: www.yahoo.com links can not be accessed by clicking on them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to www.yahoo.com
2.click on any link
3.

Actual Results:  
I noticed that when I access www.yahoo.com  the links on the homepage can not be accessed by pressing the left mouse button. If I do a right click and select open this link in a new tab the link is accessed.

I tried clearing the cache, and cookies then go back to www.yahoo.com and links could be accessed.  But the next time that I open the browser, the problem reappears.  

But when I am at mail.yahoo.com or photo.yahoo.com the left mouse click works again.

When surfing at other websites, this problem does not seem to arise.

Presently I am using a desktop running Firefox 1.06 and the problem with yahoo is non-existent.

Expected Results:  
Well after clearing the cache and history, I could access the links in www.yahoo.com but when I close the browser then open a new browser, the problem recurs.

I was hoping that it was just a cache or history problem but since it recurs I am a bit lost.  At the moment I am resorting to right clicking the links then selecting open in another window, then closing the previous tab. :(

Am using default theme...no changes done on the browser.
