CPU usage spikes by firefox.exe makes streaming video unwatchable, delays web page scrolling

Steps to reproduce:

This problem started happening in Firefox 18, continues in Firefox 19. There are two related problems involving CPU usage spikes.

1. Streaming videos have become unwatchable: the video stalls then suddenly catches up while the audio continues to play without problem. This is independent of which web site I'm watching the videos from.

2. While attempting to scroll up and down web pages, the page stalls and then suddenly scrolls an unpredictable distance. This happens no matter whether I'm using my mouse's scroll wheel or the web page's scroll bar.

I'm running a quad-core CPU, 64-bit Windows 7, 8 GB RAM, 4 GB video RAM, on a high capacity broadband connection.


Actual results:

Usage in the CPU core (1 of 4) running Firefox spikes to near 100% and total CPU usage by firefox.exe spikes to ~25% when the video stalls, then drops below 10% and the video resumes. This is NOT a buffering problem. The same videos run without problem in Google Chrome. 

The same thing happens when page scrolling hangs up. Once usage drops below 10%, the page scrolls again.

Once this starts happening--it's intermittent--it keeps happening repeatedly. CPU usage will spike for ~5 seconds, then drop, then spike again, then drop again. The only solution is to shut down Firefox and restart it. This only works for a while, then the problem recurs.


Expected results:

Streaming videos should play smoothly, web page scrolling should be smooth and continuous. This is unacceptable performance and may force me to make Chrome my default browser after years of using Firefox as my default.
