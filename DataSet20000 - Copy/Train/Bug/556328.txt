"Bookmark All Tabs" only saves location. Does not save Name as regular bookmark does.

When I run bookmark all tabs, the resulting bookmark names are all, eg, "ploplinux.html" or "downloads.html" or "msg00101.html". The links do work, the URLs are fine, but because the Name field is left blank, I can't easily find them using the Awesome Bar.  Also, when I view the folder, the names tell me nothing. Making a regular bookmark saves the title in the name.  Bookmark all tabs not doing the same makes me think it's a bug.

I believe previous versions populated the name field with the page title tag for bookmark all tabs.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open several tabs, including specific pages, not just root locations
2. Run Bookmark All Tabs.
3. In Organize bookmarks, look at the resulting bookmarks.  They will not have user-friendly titles.
Actual Results:  
The resulting bookmarks will not have user-friendly titles. 

Expected Results:  
I expect the automated equivalent of creating a folder and bookmarking each page.  Using the bookmark page process saves the name in addition to the location.
