Load the referenced URL. Then, either increase the font size directly or in steps by using the ctrl++ combination. When the text reaches a fairly large size (perhaps 18), some content from the left frame bleeds into the main frame and corrupts  (overlays) content in the main frame.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load the referenced URL.
2.Either increase the font size directly (using 'view' menu) or in keyboard steps by using the ctrl++ keyboard combination. 
3.Continue increasing font size until failure is observed. (I see it after 2 "steps" beyond "normal"/ctrl+0.

Actual Results:  
When the text reaches a fairly large size (perhaps 18), some content from the left frame bleeds into the main frame and corrupts  (overlays) content in the main frame.

Expected Results:  
Increase font size to maximum possible prior to causing corruption?



On one hand, it's great that visually impaired can increase the font size to such a high degree and do it so easily (ctrl++)

On the other hand, it means the user has to look over the entire screen for abnormal artifacts before relying on the information presented or printing the page. The exposure is that even after such a thorough examination, artifacts due to this situation could still cause undetected misinterpretation of the presented data. That could have disastrous consequences.
