Scrolling does not work in advanced preferences dialogue; clicking cancel, and repeating fixes the problem

[Note: this bug might be similar to #272701 and a few others, but is specific
and limited to the Options dialogue.]

Theme: Noia Extreme.

After a fresh restart, one cannot scroll down in Firefox's Advanced Options
dialogue. Neither clicking the scroll bars, nor using the directional keypad
works. However, and rather strangely, this only occurs after a fresh start of
the browser and if the dialogue has not been brought up before (hence, canceling
and clicking Tools->Options fixes the problem).



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
See Details. Clicking Tools -> Options. Only occurs when starting Firefox for
the first time and only when the advanced dialogue is (pre-)selected. Been able
to reproduce this on three machines, all running on XP, Firefox 1.0.2; themes &
extensions are similar on all three machines and all up-to-date.

This is not specific to TBE (that was my first guess but disabling TBE doesn't
fix this). 
Actual Results:  
See Details. No reaction at all. Impossible to scroll down.

Expected Results:  
See above.

Extension: Noia Extreme, Noia Light. Appears to happen with the default theme,
too but I can't be sure at the moment.

Very minor "problem". Just thought I'd report it. Thanks & keep up the
extraordinary work, guys! :-)
