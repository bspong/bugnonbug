Bookmarks Toolbar: Almost impossible to re-arrange bookmarks the way I want, they snatch back to the old position or to a completely different one.

Using the SHIFT key + dragging the folder to a desired position on Bookmarks Toolbar doesn't work properly. 
When trying to move a folder at the visible end of the Bookmarks Toolbar it doesn't stay there. The folder snatches back to the old position immediately or after a FF restart. 
Searchbar is also located on the bookmarks toolbar and the Searchbar Autosizer Add-On is installed. At one occasion the searbar appeared with no space within it (width = 0). 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have many items on the bookmarks toolbar, so that not all fit into the visible area. 
2. Try to drag one (using SHIFT + drag) from the not visible end to the visible end of the bookmarks toolbar or to the second last position. that doesn't work at all. item snatches back to the old position or to the end of all items. 
3. Try to drag it to an other position on a visible bookmarks toolbar. if it works re-start Firefox and see if the item is still at the new position? most of the time it snatches back to the old position or to the end of all items after restart. 
Actual Results:  
was unable to re-arrange the bookmarks on the bookmark toolbar the way I want. 
I had to put all items from the non-visible area into one folder, so that only 3 folders were in the non-visible area (in order to have a folder that I need on the visible bookmarks toolbar actually appear there) 

Expected Results:  
it should be possible to re-arrange items on the bookmarks toolbar the way I want. right now it's very hard to do that (impossible most of the time if there are many items on the bookmarks toolbar)
