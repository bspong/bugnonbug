A tooltip shows up and does not go away when the browser window is behind a window belonging to another application. Let's say that Safari is the foreground window (the app currently being used), but the firefox bookmark toolbar is still visible. If the mouse goes over a link on the ff bookmark window, the tooltip for the link comes up and stays up even after the mouse pointer is no longer on the toolbar link. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start firefox
2.start any other application, for example Safari
3.move safari window so that it is not covering at least some links on the firefox bookmark toolbar
4. move the mouse over a link in the firefox bookmark toolbar (don't click)
5. wait until the tooltip comes up
Actual Results:  
6. move the mouse away from the firefox bookmark toolbar 
7. notice how the tooltip persists

Expected Results:  
the tooltip should not have appeared at all if FF is not the foreground application
