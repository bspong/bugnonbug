Firefox 4.0 b 2 rendering tabs vertically but not rendering tab client areas at all.

I did not set Firefox 4.0 beta 2 as the default browser. After using it and enjoying it I closed it and tried to reopen it. However, I opened Firefox 3.6. I wanted to continue using Firefox 4.0 beta 2 so I closed Firefox 3.6 and opened Firefox 4.0 beta 2 again. This time it appeared to pull in my Tab Mix Pro and Tree Tab plugins and displayed tabs vertically. However the tabs are not rendering.

I tried to close 4b2 and open 3.6 but 3.6 opened with just the basic window decorations and nothing in the client area. So I closed it and reopened 4b2. The above problem persisted. 

Firefox 4.0 beta 2 is now in an unusable state which is persisting between instances.

I believe this is due to the Tab Mix Pro plugin being enabled since the text on the title of one tab is red, which is a feature of Tab Mix Pro. However, Tab Mix Pro should not be enabled since it does not support 4.0 b 2. I believe this is a bug in Firefox's general plugin code where it let these plugins to be loaded.

I tried to disable plugins through safe mode but it was not successful in correcting the issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox 4.0 beta 2. 
2. Close it.
3. Open Firefox 3.6 with Tab Mix Pro and Tree tab plugins
4. Close it.
5. Open Firefox 4.0 beta 2 again.
6. Close it.
7. Open Firefox 4.0 beta 2 in safe mode with plugins disabled.

Actual Results:  
Tabs rendered vertically overlaying the file menu and back button, red text on the tabs. Tab client area not rendered at all. Unable to open the Addons tab (since it's now a tab) to disable the Tab Mix Pro and Tree Tab plugins.


Expected Results:  
Normal behaviour.
