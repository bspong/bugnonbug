Restart and quit alerts should use independent "don't warn again" prefs

Currently Firefox 3 nightly have the option to "always do this" when you restart the application. However, I would like the option to be able to have independent choices for add-ons and a normal restart. For example, I always want my tabs restored when I install and add-on, but I would like to keep the choice of whether to restore when I do a normal exit. Currently if you tick "always do this" then firefox will always restore my tabs, whether its an extension or normal exit.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install and add-on, or do a standard exit and save tabs
2.Tick always restore my tabs
3.Tabs are restored on restart for both add-ons and normal exit and save.

Actual Results:  
Tabs are always restored on either and add-on or standard exit.

Expected Results:  
Independent choices, so I can tick always restore my tabs when I install an add-on, while still preserving the choice on whether to restore my tabs on a normal exit and save.
