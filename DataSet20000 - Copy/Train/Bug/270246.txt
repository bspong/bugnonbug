Text on the left column overwrites the main centre, on the defendingthefox link

Scrolling just a little way down, on the left colum the defendingthefox link
overwrites the main centre column text body.  Viewed in IE it is fine.  This is
a commmon complaint & related to how FF handles tables etc, but this is
happening everytime on my, and other computers using FF.  Past excuses for FF
not displaying links, text, columns, or tables correctly has been the website,
and its bad coding.  This happens on many well coded websites, and this on the
spreadfirefox homepage shows clearly there is a problem running a little deeper
than that here, and it is AT LEAST far to easy for a page not to display as it
should in FF.  If it is not happening to EVERY FF 1.0 user, then it narrows down
the problem perhaps, but does not mean the problem does not exist.  It does on
many win 2k & XP so far here for this site, & all versions of FF.  There's
clearly a problem here, not just on badly coded sites, but well coded ones, or
theres reasons why FF is so prone to this amatuer looking display problem.  It's
 happening on the spreadfirefox homepage, that is embarrasing & needs sorting,
sorry, but it does.
