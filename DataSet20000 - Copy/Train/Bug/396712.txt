Can NOT establish connection using VPN/proxy connectivity, which prev version could

Not like the previous release, this release can NOT establish connection using VPN/proxy connectivity. No matter which option I selected and set up in Tools-Options-Advanced-Network-Settings, Firefos still can NOT get onto the internet. I had to switch to IE for my Internet surfing.

Please address this issue asap.

Thanks.

    *   Check the address for typing errors such as
          ww.example.com instead of
          www.example.com

    *   If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
          connection.

    *   If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure
          that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.
