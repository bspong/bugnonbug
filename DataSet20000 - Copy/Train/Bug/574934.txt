FireFox crashes with the usual crash message box window
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.3a6pre) Gecko/20100625 Minefield/3.7a6pre ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Not so much to add in detail. FireFox simply crashes when going to http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/stalkin-ya-mom/id368385436 . It is a free song, I believe. It may be somewhat related to Itunes on my computer, but I am not sure. I am not so optimistic, thinking that this issue will be solved in today/tomorrows (midnight?) nightly build. This issue does not arise in Mozilla FireFox 3.6.4.

The nightly build is basically a almost perfect web browser with just a few issues, although they are really easy to solve. I understand that these issues arise, due to a nighlt build, as they are not completely developed, so bugs may very easily appear, but I am already aware of it. Keep up the great work Mozilla! Mozilla should never die! Thanks.
