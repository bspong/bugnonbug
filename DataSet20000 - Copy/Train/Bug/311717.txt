Firefox continues to use old Talkback version (Firefox10) even when upgraded to 1.5

Firefox crashed today, so Talkback started up... well, I noticed that Talkback
said "Firefox10" so I investigated some more. It seems that I now have two
copies of Talkback on my system: one in the components directory (Firefox10) and
one in the extensions directory (Firefox15).

Even though I am using Firefox 1.5 Beta 2, it used the old Firefox10 version of
Talkback instead the new one.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Firefox crashed
2. Talkback started
3. Talkback was version Firefox10

Actual Results:  
Talkback was version "Firefox10"

Expected Results:  
The new talkback version (Firefox15) should have been used for the bug report
and not the old version.

When I upgraded to Firefox 1.5 (beta 1/2), it should have removed the old
Talkback version and made the new one kick into effect.

Also, would it be possible for Talkback to transfer your settings from the
Firefox10 version to the Firefox15 version?
