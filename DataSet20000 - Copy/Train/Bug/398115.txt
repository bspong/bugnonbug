Every time I'll click on Firefox Browser, the display setting will revert to 8-bit colors and graphics become grainy.  I always have to click on personalization page and restore display settings back to 32-bit colors...  IE does not affect my display settings...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on Firefox Icon
2.Firefox will appear on screen, but graphics become grainy.
3. Click on "Personalization screen" and click on display settings and click on 8-bit colors and set to 32-bit colors...  EVERY TIME I CLICK ON FIREFOX....
Actual Results:  
Clicking on Firefox caused my display settings to revert to 8-bit color and I have to click on display settings and click it back to 32-bit color setting....

Expected Results:  
Grainy graphics and pictures...

What else.  Something about Firefox browser causes my display settings to revert to the lowest setting, resulting in lousy graphics and pictures, when I minimize Firefox, I'll be seeing Desktop Wallpaper as grainy and dull colored picture...
