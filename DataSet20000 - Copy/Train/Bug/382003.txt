Firefox will not hide or minimize when a window is open, or if I try to put another program window in front of it. I have to close the window to get rid of it. It happened in the last one as well. I also noticed another bug. Sometimes forms and drop down menus on certain sites such as a banking site or even myspace do not work. You cannot type anything into the form boxes or even select the form drop downs like for a country or state menu.
