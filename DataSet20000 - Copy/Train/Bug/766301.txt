segfault when I visit a specific website
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:13.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/13.0.1
Build ID: 20120615233552

Steps to reproduce:

Clicked on a link.


Actual results:

It crashed. This is what I get when I open firefox from a terminal emulator and it crashes again:
###!!! ABORT: X_CopyArea: BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter); 19 requests ago: file /build/src/mozilla-release/toolkit/xre/nsX11ErrorHandler.cpp, line 190
###!!! ABORT: X_CopyArea: BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter); 19 requests ago: file /build/src/mozilla-release/toolkit/xre/nsX11ErrorHandler.cpp, line 190
Segmentation fault


Expected results:

The website should show without making my browser crash.

I'm using archlinux. The website started making firefox crash after an update. I think it only happens to me, other users seem to be fine browsing the website with firefox (maybe they aren't using the same OS as me).

This is the website:
http://www.chapatiz.com/bbs/

It's a phpbb forum, and it only crashes when I visit this section of the website. I just click on a link to a thread or to a forum and it randomly crashes. You don't need to be logged in to browse it or to experience the same bug.

If you need more information, like the plugins or add-ons I use, feel free to ask. I don't want to make it too long and I think I provided the necessary information.
