While scrolling using mouse wheel a strip of web page moves and behaves differently from rest of the page. for example

- While viewing a long page and scrolling using the mouse wheel causes a strip of web page about 3 inches on the left side of window to move at a different rate than the rest of the page.

- Within this area the I-cursor disappears while entering text.

- Phenomenon is most visible while playing YouTube videos with normalized window(no maximize)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Case :1
1.Restore (no maximize) the window to size of about 1/4 size 
2.Play any video from YouTube

Case 2: 
Scroll a large page using mouse wheel

Case 3: 
Open this page (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox&format=guided)
and try to place your cursor to the first character of any textbox in this page.
Actual Results:  
Case 1 : A white strip is visible on the video being played
Case 2 : A strip of web page at the left of the window moves at at different rate than the rest of the page.
Case 3 : Cursor disappears

Expected Results:  
Case 1: Clear video playback (without visual obstruction)
Case 2:  Smooth Scrolling
Case 3:  Cursor should be visible

I wanted to upload images of the phenomenon to explain the problems better. But this page doesn't has that feature. I suggest you to add a way to upload problem screen-shots.
