With the preferences privacy setting to ask me every time for cookie approval, Firefox ignores my command to apply my selection to all cookies form the site. Consequently, when I click "deny", the website will keep feeding me cookies to deny, sometimes up to ten cookies from the same website. It's boring and irritating. When I tell Firefox to deny a cookie from a website, when I click the box to deny all cookies, I want my command honored, not ignored.
