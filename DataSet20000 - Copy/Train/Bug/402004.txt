When accessing the Internet via a router, and the router loses a connection, Firefox no longer loads pages but shows a 'Done' status in the status bar. Even once the connection is re-established (in a matter of seconds) the issue is not resolved. Any page that is requested will cannot be viewed even though the request is said to be completed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox and open up a URL
2. Disable connect via os internet options
3. Re-connect
4. Try to access another page
Actual Results:  
Page loads instantly with a no information and a 'Done' status in the status bar

Expected Results:  
Connection is re-established so page should load

This happens most often when running a bit torrent client. The router drops out and then when it re-connects cannot access any pages even when closing and restarting a Firefox session. Only way to resolve problem is to re-boot system
