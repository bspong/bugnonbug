JS warning "anonymous function does not always return a value" resource:///modules/devtools/framework/target.js:218
I noticed this in the output of my debug build today (not sure exactly what triggered it, but that doesn't really matter because the warning is pretty clear on its own):
{
JS Component Loader: WARNING resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource:///modules/devtools/framework/target.js:218
                     anonymous function does not always return a value
}

The code in question is:
> 218   get window() {
> 219     // Be extra careful here, since this may be called by HS_getHudByWindow
> 220     // during shutdown.
> 221     if (this._tab && this._tab.linkedBrowser) {
> 222       return this._tab.linkedBrowser.contentWindow;
> 223     }
> 224   },

...which, as the warning says, does not always return a value. (It's only got one return statement, which is inside of an "if".)

The function used to be an unconditional return (& hence not trigger this warning), but it was changed to its current form here:
 https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/ca621a4ceaa1#l4.124
for bug 820524. (back when the file was named Target.jsm -- it's been renamed to target.js since then)

CC'ing :past and :jwalker (author and reviewer on that cset), in the hopes that at least one of you might know what the correct fix for this is. :)
