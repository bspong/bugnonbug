On my page, http://s10.invisionfree.com/ShopModv3/index.php?, the 'Purchase'
button in the Cart moves down when you change an item in the cart. See
reproduction steps for how to do this.

This bug does not occur in Opera, and IE's too crappy to even display the page
right.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on 'special items' to open category.
2. Type in anything to the right of 'Gmail Account:' (that's a borderless textbox)
3. Click 'Buy' to add the item to the cart.
4. Press 'Buy' several more times.

Actual Results:  
As the quantity increased in the shopping cart area, the 'Purchase' button moved
downward, eventually going off the screen.

Expected Results:  
The 'Purchase' button should have remained when it was.

I am a skilled programmer who would be happy to help in the fixing of this bug
and I will be available to explain the code in my script,

That script is where the problem actually occurs.
