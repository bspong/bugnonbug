Downloading large files (300M+) such as the one in the URL field above frequently stalls. I have had this problem for months, so it has not recently been introduced.

What happens is that one or more downloads will stop downloading; progress remains fixed, neither size nor speed is updated. Clicking pause and unpause on a download in such a halted state makes the problem go away, and the download resumes. It is a nuisance to have to do a pause/play on downloads every other minute, though.

Note 1: As I usually download multiple such files at the same time, the number may of concurrent downloads may play a part. 
Note 2: I usually see this only with eve-files.com, as I rarely need large files from anywhere else, so I guess it may also be site-specific.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to page in URL.
2. Use download link as.. to initiate download of multiple such videos.
3. Wait for one or more to stall.
Actual Results:  
Frequently (more than half the time) one or more downloads will stall at partial completion as described in Details.

Expected Results:  
Downloads to continue until completion.
