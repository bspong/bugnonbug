Spam pop-up windows keep opening in a new firefox window while i am browsing. Incentaclick and "hotebar.com" are two of the windows. All pop-up windows are advertisement windows, or dating sites. Have used Windows Security Essentials, AVG, Avast Pro, as scan/removal tools, but even after 'removing' the problems, firefox is still being infiltrated and continues to open up pop-up windows. I have set my privacy and security settings to block pop-ups, and am using Adblock Plus and Ghostery as firefox add-ons. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open web browser
2. Type in website i want to go to
3. Browse for a minute or two, and a new firefox window pops up every time with a new ad.
Actual Results:  
Every time I have a firefox browser window open, regardless of whether or not i'm actually browsing, eventually a new pop up window opens with an annoying ad.

Expected Results:  
I was hoping that firefox would block any pop-up.
