Proxies to access the Network setting not persisting.

My site has a security proxy that must be considered in order to make external internet connections.
I can get this to work fine through firefox by setting the "Auto-detect proxy Settings for this network" option from Options[Advanced]->[Network]Settings dialog.

However, action of closing and reopening (and sometimes upon a popup browser window instance) the settings revert to "Manual proxy configuration" with the local host address (127.0.0.1) which forces me to go back and reset this each time. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure a network that enforces a proxy pass through to access external internet. 
2. From Options[Advanced]->[Network]Settings dialog set the option to "Auto-detect proxy Settings for this network"
3. Verify that you can now properly access external web sites.
4. Shutdown browser (all instances) and restart.


Actual Results:  
as stated in description, the settings revert to "Manual proxy configuration" with the local host address (127.0.0.1) which forces me to go back and reset this each time. 

Expected Results:  
Settings to persist so the Auto-detect proxy option is used upon startup.
