Some visited links stop being shown in magenta

I have an intranet system that presents lots URLs on pages.  The list of URLs appears in one frame, the result of the URL is in another.  There's some javascript, too.

<a href="/B-40999" target="bug" onclick="highlight('B-40999',0);current_rowid='B-40999-1';return CheckFrame(this);" class="bugid">B-40999</a>

First time I click on such a link, the link changes colour.  But after I've refreshed the page, a large portion (90%) of the links revert back to blue.

Sometimes it takes 2 refreshes for the link to revert back to blue.  It appears that visiting similar-looking links (say href='/B-40999' and href='/B-30385') cause the memory of the visit to be lost.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a page containing a link like <a href="/B-40999" target="bug" onclick="highlight('B-40999',0);current_rowid='B-40999-1';return CheckFrame(this);" class="bugid">B-40999</a>
1a.  Note, link goes magenta.
2. refresh the page containing the link
3. See link go back to Blue.





This bug afflicts FireFox 3 Beta 4 (and Beta 3 before it).  It does not affect Firefox 2.
