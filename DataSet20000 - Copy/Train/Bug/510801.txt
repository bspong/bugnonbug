Pop-up Blocker blocks whitelisted sites, gives no option to unblock

Happens on all whitelisted sites using popups; I'd whitelisted the sample site several versions of FF ago.  Firefox blocks popups I'd set to be allowed, then only gives the option of blocking--which, of course, it's already doing.  How do I UNblock, and why is it suddenly blocking now anyway?

Incidentally, I've seen seen this behavior off and on in the past couple releases of Firefox, but never prior to, as a guess, a couple or three months ago.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to 4chan or any other similar imageboard which has been whitelisted as an exception to blocking
2. Click on an image thumbnail
3. ???
4. PROFIT!

Can be done in other places which normally open new windows, like clicking news links from Yahoo! Mail.
Actual Results:  
Clicking on an image shows the popup blocker dialog at the top of the page reading "Firefox prevented this site from opening a pop-up window."  Clicking on the Options button gives the choices of:  "Block pop-ups from img.4chan.org"," "Edit Pop-up Blocker Options", and "Don't show this message when pop-ups are blocked"

Expected Results:  
The full size of the thumbnailed image should be displayed.
