When I try to go to http://www.wingmanteam.com Firefox crashes.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Go to http://wingmanteam.com
Actual Results:  
FF crashed.

Expected Results:  
Load the site.

I had FF 0.9.X installed. It worked ok but did crash much more than 0.8.X. I
didn't file a report because I couldn't put my finger on a distinct cause. FF
0.9.X did tend to crash more on certain sites (such as http://www.ynet.co.il -
news site in Hebrew), but it wasn't consistent.

Anyway yesterday I uninstalled FF completely including delete the program
directory, but kept profile. Then installed 1.0PR and updated some extensions.
Mostly 1.0PR works, but it crashes even more than 0.9.X.

By the way, I did manage to see http://www.wingmanteam.com once or twice with
1.0PR, although it crashed once after I was already browsing the site. After
that I can no longer see the site at all.

I have the following extensions installed:

Add Bookmarks Here 0.5 (Disabled - not compatible with 1.0)
Single Window Mode 1.4 / 1.0 (The older version still shows on the list)
Download Statusbar 0.9
Text Links 1.0
Flat Bookmark Editing 0.6 (Disabled - not compatible with 1.0)
Plain Text Link 0.2
Show Old Extensions 0.1.3
Web Developer 0.8
User Agent Switcher 0.6
Junp Link 1.2 (Hacked MaxVersion to make it work with 1.0)
Sort Bookmarks 0.5.0.1 (Disabled - not compatible with 1.0)
BiDi UI 0.3.7
Disable Targets For Downloads 0.6

I have also tried to create a new profile and access the same site under the new
profile, but FF crashes just the same.
