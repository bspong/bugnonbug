Verified on Fedora Core 8 and Fedora Core 9, doesn't happen in Windows, and apparently not on OSX. It's been confirmed by user dr|z3d on #firefox. 

Use FF3 on Linux with Mozilla's .tar binaries and have tabs visible. 

1) Go to https://staff.spsis.com. 

2) Drag and drop the "Home" link (or anything on the menu) to a new tab. (it has to be DRAG, not "open in new tab") 

3) In the new tab, hover over the menus, especially the "Administration" menu. It will "throb", showing for a half-second or so, and then disappearing. It appears to be somehow tied to the javascript clock on the bottom bar. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Verified on Fedora Core 8 and Fedora Core 9, doesn't happen in Windows, and apparently not on OSX. It's been confirmed by user dr|z3d on #firefox.

2) Drag and drop the "Home" link (or anything on the menu) to a new tab. (it has to be DRAG, not "open in new tab") 

3) In the new tab, hover over the menus, especially the "Administration" menu. It will "throb", showing for a half-second or so, and then disappearing. It appears to be somehow tied to the javascript clock on the bottom bar. 
Actual Results:  
"throbbing" menus that show then disappear in less than a second. 

Expected Results:  
Solid, steady menus that remain as long as the mouse is hovering over any part of the menu. 

It only happens when: 

1) Using Linux binaries (confirmed on Fedora Core 8 & 9) 

2) Firefox 3. (doesn't happen in FF2) 

3) When you DRAG a link to a NEW TAB. Doesn't happen if you right-click and choose "open in new tab". 

4) The javascript clock is running. 

The following MAY be factors that we haven't ruled out: 

1) Xwindows / KDE (We're using KDE)
