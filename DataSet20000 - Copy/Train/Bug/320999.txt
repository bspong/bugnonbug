I have bookmarks for manual surfing sites which I open every day.  There are no more than 16 URLs in any of them.  Since I downloaded the new version of Firefox I just start to surf each site then all of a sudden only one tab is available and the others are frozen.  The tab that can be refreshed does not progress the timer and the status bar does not completely clear from the bottom of the Firefox browser but sometimes another tab will open after the refresh and it will be the only tab available.  This did not occur in the previous version.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open multiple tabbed bookmark for surf sites
2.Log in to each one 
3.Start manual surfing each tab

Actual Results:  
After the first few iterations only one tab became available and the timer locked up

Expected Results:  
Each tab should be available to be updated for each site.

I have looked at all the current bugs and couldn't find this specific problem.
