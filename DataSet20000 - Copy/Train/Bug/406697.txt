Can't load the correct bookmark in sidebar after opened another page in it.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9b2pre) Gecko/2007120204 Minefield/3.0b2pre

This bug is happened both on my XP and Linux (minefield build num is the same.)

If you loaded one bookmark in  sidebar before in the browser window, you can't load another page in it correctly -- the page loaded in sidebar will still be the previous one.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add one bookmark (say, http://google.com) by dragging favicon to Bookmarks Toolbar, check "Load this bookmark in the sidebar" in the bookmark's Properties dialog.
2. Add another one bookmark (say, http://yahoo.com) by dragging favicon to Bookmarks Toolbar,  also check "Load this bookmark in the sidebar" in the bookmark's Properties dialog.
3. Click the 1st bookmark, the sidebar should open with Google loaded.
4. Close the sidebar.
5. Click the 2nd bookmark.
Actual Results:  
Google shows again.

Expected Results:  
Yahoo! should be loaded this time.

If you open another browser window and click the 2nd bookmark, it would be Yahoo! loaded correctly in sidebar, and then you can't load Google in the window's sidebar. This problem didn't happened in Firefox 2.
