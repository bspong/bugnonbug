Tabs no longer use Gtk theme style
Build old: m-c trunk from 2010-08-17
Build current: m-c trunk from 2010-09-15

Firefox on Linux uses the Gtk theme (by default). It matches the look of Gtk apps pretty well. Also, KDE apps have a brigde theme, so my whole desktop has a 
consistent look. More importantly, it's a look that I had explicitly chosen the Gtk theme to what I like.

This is good, that I can choose the look and all apps follow, and I consider that to be a major platform advantage. The apps look "nice" to me, and I despise other random looks like Windows or the default Gtk or KDE themes. It's not just the colors, but the styling, too: rounded corners vs. edgy, gaps, sizes, scroll bar look etc..

Until last month, Firefox followed the Gtk theme, too, including the tabs.
Now, the tab bar and url bar don't anymore.
1. The tabs have rounded corners instead of being edgy as in the theme.
2. The tabs have very ugly gaps between and above them.
3. The colors are slightly off, too. It *seems* that the bottom of the urlbar has the right color (same as menu and widgets), but then uses a gradient crossing urlbar and tab bar to a slightly brighter grey for the tabs. That looks ugly, too. Inactive tabs use a different, darker gradient.

None of that matches my theme, looks totally off, and is ugly for the user (ignoring his theme).
