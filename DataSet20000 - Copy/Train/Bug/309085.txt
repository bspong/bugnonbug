False positives from FeedHandler.harvestFeeds hide distinct feeds
FeedHandler.harvestFeeds() tries too hard to hide "the same feed content in
different feed formats" listings, and as a result hides feeds with different
content, when the distribution of number of feeds in each type happens to be equal.

http://plasmastrum.org has autodiscovery links for two feeds:

<link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" href="/syn/" title="Full text" />
<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"
href="http://del.icio.us/rss/ap/!log" title="Link log" />

Anyone trying to subscribe to the "Link log" feed will need to copy the URL out
of the source, open the Bookmark Manager, find the Add Live Bookmark item in the
File menu, and paste it in.

Suggested alternate algorithm:

1. strip (case-insensitively) "rss" and "atom" and all numbers from link titles
2. if all the titles in each type are also in the other types, return just the
first type (or, a preferred type if we actually have a reason to prefer one).

e.g., for

<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="Entries in RSS 2.0">
<link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" title="Entries in Atom 1.0">
<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="Comments in RSS 2.0">
<link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" title="Comments in Atom 1.0">

once the titles are stripped down to where
feedHash["application/rss+xml"][0].title is "Entries in ", every title in
feedHash["application/rss+xml"] is also in feedHash["application/atom+xml"], and
we can (more) safely assume they only differ in format.
