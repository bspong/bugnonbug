In Windows Vista & firefox, I cannot print downloads (mapquest/google maps, messages, PDFs). Print was always good/correct w/Windows XP Pro. I can print now only through using Internet Explorer.  Firefox print set-up looks like it is going to function, but it does not create any response in the printer.  Also, I cannot input fax/scan information from my printer/scanner/fax machine into my computer.  That function will not work. When using Windows XP Pro, there was never a problem. The new computer is a HP a6030n.  The new fax/printer/scanner is an HP Photosmart C7180.  Help!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the PDF, file or folder (normal)
2.Use the "File" tool bar or "right click" to select print options
3.Select "print."
4. Nothing happens after that.
5. Switch to Internet Explorer and all functions work properly EXCEPT input to the computer from the fax/scanner/printer.
Actual Results:  
"0."  The actual results are "no print," or any mechanical or visual differences in either machine (computer or printer)

Expected Results:  
No response observed or experienced.

A "no print" or "no connectivity" use to be experienced when there was no connectivity between the computer and printer/fax/scanner.
