Firefox fails to end it's own process if I choose to "Save & Exit"
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.13) Gecko/20100914 Firefox/3.5.13 GTB7.1

When I use Firefox on my laptop, I usually choose to "Save & Exit" when I close the program. However, in the latest release, if I choose to do this, then re-open Firefox, I get an error. This error tells me that Firefox is already open, and I should close the program before trying to open up a new one.

However, if I just close the program, I have no difficulties re-opening Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start a session.
2. Close Firefox using the "Save & Exit" option.
3. try re-opening Firefox moments later.
Actual Results:  
Received an error telling me that Firefox was already open and I should close the program before opening another. I have to open Task Manager, and manually end the process, and this does not save my open tabs.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should close, save my open tabs and windows, and then exit the process.

It's just a pain having to manually exit the process via Task Manager and Firefox not saving any of my previous session data, ie open tabs and windows.
