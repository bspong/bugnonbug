Vista has a feed reader widget available in its sidebar.  There is no clear way for a user to register a feed with this widget from Firefox.  This should be offered to users as an option when running on Vista.

(It seems like this bug should exist, but I could not find it, I apologize if this is already a dupe)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install GP on Vista
2. Turn on the Vista Sidebar, add the Feeds component to it
3. Attempt to register a feed from Firefox to the Feed reader widget.
Actual Results:  
You can't.

Expected Results:  
You should be able to.

IE 7's feed button (on its toolbar) will register an RSS feed with this widget automatically when the user subscribes to the feed.

This is an enhancement, but to users of Vista, I think this is a very conspicuous lack of functionality where Firefox falls behind IE.  It's made worse because that Feed widget is prominently displayed in the sidebar.
