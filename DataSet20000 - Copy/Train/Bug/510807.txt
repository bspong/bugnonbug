In Westwood Online College's webtests <= displays as ^3 and >= displays as the british pound sign (the curly L with a line through the middle.)  I'm not sure if this is decoding or an incorrect character table.  I've tried switching encodings and this doesn't affect it.  IE8 displays the correct symbols, and it says it's using Western(WINDOWS) but I've tried that to no avail.  This makes taking test impossible for my math class.  Finally, In the previous math class I had taken, there were no symbol errors.  I'M currently running Vista 32, and I've also tested this on XP 32, with firefox 2.x (unsure of the exact version.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Just visit a math test using the same software.
Actual Results:  
<= displays as a superscript 3 (cubed or ^3) and >= displays as a British Pound.

Expected Results:  
displayed <= or >= appropriately.

I'm working with the math teacher to gain access to a practice test of some sort, and get information about the software they use to run the site.  Argosy University uses the EXACT same software.
