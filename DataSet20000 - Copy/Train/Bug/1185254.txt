Web page uses too much memory (~100-140 MB) for no apparent reason
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:42.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/42.0
Build ID: 20150718030211

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open firefox with only about:blank tab. Notice the memory used (Private working set) with task manager, and with about:memory. 

2. Open and load the following web page, open another blank tab and move to the blank tab. Wait some time (1 minute for example).

Actual results:

3. Notice the additional memory used using 2 methods: task manager, and about:memory .
All methods show a memory increase of about 100-140 MB , caused by the web page, and that it persists and doesn't drop although you moved away from the tab, and this is not a selected and visible tab anymore.



Expected results:

I think the web page should have used much less memory.
It is a forum page with a lot of comments (490), but most of them text or simple html that shouldn't take too much memory.

Yes, the page has many images and embedded youtube videos, but since the tab is not visible I would assume most images memory could be discarded due to changes that I know were done in the past to improve image memory use, since the tab is not visible and I moved to another tab.

The page contains many youtube videos, but this should not be a reason for the large and persistent memory consumption even when I move to another tab.
First, the data about them can be discarded or be cached on disk until needed if youtube embedded videos that aren't played or used consume too much memory. Second, the about:memory report shows (under "active", under the window object for the tab) 11 youtube windows each consuming 3.22MB, totalling ~ 35MB . 
Even if we ignore or decrease the youtube videos memory from the total, that doesn't explain the rest of the memory used by the tab which should be ~50MB or more.
