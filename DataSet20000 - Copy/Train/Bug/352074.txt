profile management broken

I have three profiles, let's call them "default", "user", and "anon".

What I would expect to happen is that "firefox -P someprofile" makes sure that there is exactly one firefox process running for profile "someprofile" and then opens a new window for the browser running with that profile.

Well, that's not what happens. 

"firefox -P default" always seems to open a new window in whatever firefox is already running, even if it's running a different profile.  When choosing "default" through the profile manager, however, the "default" profile behaves like "user".

"firefox -P user" starts a new firefox process for profile "user" if one isn't already running and opens a window.  But if one is already running, it complains that I "first need to quit" the running firefox process and then doesn't start up a new one.

(The firefox developers should probably also rethink how firefox works in a distributed X11 environment, where multiple instances of firefox may be using the same X11 display but running on different hosts and even as different users.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Create multiple profiles, then try to start them up with "firefox -P something" and "firefox -ProfileManager".

Actual Results:  
Sometimes opens windows for the wrong profile, sometimes refuses to start up firefox (see above).

Expected Results:  
The profiles should behave as if each of them were the default profile for a single-profile user; they just happen to share the same display.
