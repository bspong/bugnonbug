Cannot move folder with "move" button in Bookmark Manager
If the user opens up the Bookmark Manager, selects a folder, and then selects the "move" button, the move dialog will come up. If they select a folder to drop the selected folder into and click "ok" in the move dialog (sheet on a mac), nothing happens. Clicking on "ok" doesn't dismiss the dialog or move anything. The only way to dismiss the dialog is to select as the destination folder the one that the folder to be moved is already within. If this is done, the dialog will dismiss with "ok" but nothing happens since the destination folder is the same as the current location of the folder that the user tried to move.

Steps to Reproduce
1. Have a bookmark with at least two folders in it.
2. Launch the Bookmarks Manager.
3. Select a folder and click on the "Move" button in the Bookmarks Manager UI.
4. Select another folder in the dialog the comes up (the destination folder to move the item to...).
5. Select "OK" to complete the move.

Expected Result: Dialog is dismissed, folder selected in step 3 is moved to folder selected in step 4. 

Actual Result: Click "ok" does nothing. Dialog is not dismissed. Only if the original location of the folder in step 2 is selected will allow "ok" to dismiss the dialog. This results in the folder in step 2 staying at its original location.
