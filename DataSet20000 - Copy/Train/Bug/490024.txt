When using a wysiwyg online text editor, graphics or links dropped into editor create a relative link even when full web address is given.

I am a sysad for compuhigh.com an online highschool.
We use a wysiwyg text editor for communications between students and teachers.
Teachers will sometimes drag linked text to another lesson or a graphic into the text box.
Here is an example.  When we link to a lesson a href "http://compuhigh.net/directory" from a text box created in a web page located in compuhigh.net/directory Firefox changes takes out the compuhigh.net/directory and replaces it with a relative link.
This creates a problem.  When the final post is read by the student, it is in a different directory, and the relative link does not work.  Web designers know when they can use relative links and when they can't.  Having Firefox interpret what the designer wants limits its flexibility.  Since the form in question is in a password protected site, I can't give you access to see it.  The problem is a new one for Firefox, and is not present in Explorer.
