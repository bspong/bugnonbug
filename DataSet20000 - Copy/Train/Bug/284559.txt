Palette for Firefox and Thunderbird different from other applications. Relogin to CDE fixes problem.

When I startup my SunBlade 100 workstation (Solaris 9.0) CDE reloads
applications I had running on logout. This usually means emacs, StarOffice,
Firefox, Thunderbird, and a couple of terminals. However, when the Mozilla.org
apps open, their palettes are clearly different from those of the other
programs- the window contents are displayed using "wrong" colors until I make
them focussed (using point-to-focus), at which point the window decorations,
rest of the applications, and desktop are now using the wrong colors.
Strangely, if I exit CDE and log back in without restarting the machine, the
programs will load fine. The fact that both Thunderbird and Firefox display this
problem make me think it lies with them and not with Solaris.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Boot up my Sun workstation.
2. Login to CDE.
3. Wait for Firefox and Thunderbird to load.

Actual Results:  
Palettes for window contents of these applications is only correct if I focus them.

Expected Results:  
Palettes should be the same whether the applications are focussed or not.
