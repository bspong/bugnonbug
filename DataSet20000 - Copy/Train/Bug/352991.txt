Sites with CSS show up broken, formatting stripped to defaults, <div> and <span> tags broken.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7
Build Identifier: Firefox/1.5.0.7

Downloaded a nightly build which fixed it for a while, problem occurred again. Downloaded more nightly builds, didn't fix.

Viewed source on broken webpages, noticed lots of <div> tags. 

Pages display properly in IE6. 

Apparently, Firefox doesn't like <div> tags.

Have to press CTRL+F5 to reload properly. 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a page with lots of <div> tags i.e. one of the pages mentioned above. 
2. Firefox may or may not load the page properly. 
3. Refresh, wander around page, etc. 
4. Hit Ctrl+F5 to load page properly 
Actual Results:  
1. Load Wikipedia home page (Success) 
2. Input search for article "foo" 
3. Article "foo" broken as stated above. 
4. Had to hit CTRL+F5

Expected Results:  
Loaded the DIV tags properly, resulting in correct display of Wikipedia article interface.

Note: Used Wikipedia as a test case. This is NOT the only site it has problems with. 

PC Configuration

OS: Windows XP Professional 64-Bit Edition
Firefox Version: 1.5.0.6 and 1.5.0.7 (Just updated today) and all nightly builds from 8/6/2006 to 9/16/2006
Extensions: GaiaBar 2.1.5 and Adblock Plus 0.7.1.2
Issues: Seems only to happen on a Windows machine. 

Does not seem to be fixed in Minefield or Firefox 2 beta 2, both of which I have tried to use.
