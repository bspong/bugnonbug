Integrated PDF Viewer doesn't sometimes display some letters (at least Icelandic þ and ð)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:19.0) Gecko/20130107 Firefox/19.0
Build ID: 20130107082023

Steps to reproduce:

Opened attached PDF file (by clicking on a https link).


Actual results:

On page 2:

"Inngangsorð" displays as "Inngangsor "
while the letter is ok in:
"Fréttakorn frá Vefverksmiðju"


"Forsíðan" displays as "Forsí an"

"Sæþór" displays as "Sæ ór"


"Ábyrgðarmaður" displays as "Ábyrg arma ur"

there are more cases there and probably on other pages.

[And display of the document is a little slow]



Expected results:

These letters should display right as they do with the non-integrated readers.

Note that the letters þ and ð do in some cases display right in the same document and the capital versions Þ and Ð are do always seem to display right. That could be a coincidence if this is font related. While some of the examples are in italics or bold or possibly another font, that seems not to be the case as under EFNISYFIRLIT ("contents").

Note that copy-paste from the document works and search for the letters.

Not sure if there is a relation to:

I'm not using this extensions (was this integrated into Firefox?), hope I'm reporting to the right place:

This is my first bug-report so I hope that while I think it is complete and correct you'll be lenient if not..
