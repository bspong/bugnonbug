Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 will support the OpenSearch 1.1 specification for
hooking into its integrated web search function (
http://opensearch.a9.com/spec/opensearchdescription/1.1/ ).

Although the specification is still draft, I think it would be prudent for
Mozilla to monitor the progress of the specification and to implement it in
Firefox when it becomes final.

Here is the overview of the specification from the specification document:

"OpenSearch™ Description files are used by search engines to describe what kinds
of content they index, how they can be queried, and how they can return search
results. OpenSearch Description documents can be used to integrate third-party
searches into search clients using the OpenSearch Query Syntax. These documents
are published as simple XML files over the web. Search results are usually
enhanced with the OpenSearch Response extensions."
