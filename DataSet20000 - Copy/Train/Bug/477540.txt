This morning the latest update to FF 3.0 installed.  Since then gmail.com can only load in basic view and sites like kayak.com do not properly load and are impossible to navigate (any buttons related to javascript are non-functional).  In addition, I tried to download the 3.1 beta to try to get around the problem that way and it tells me the installer files are corrupted.  I have tried restarting Firefox several times and have also restarted my computer several times.  I have disabled all of my extensions and still have issues with website loading properly.  I have gone into IE to see if it was a general problem with my network and IE loads the pages fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Sign into Gmail

1. Open Firefox
2. Navigate to www.kayak.com
Actual Results:  
Gmail gets stuck on the loading page.  The only way to access gmail is through basic view.

Sites like www.kayak.com do not load properly and appear scrambled or misaligned.

Expected Results:  
Properly load the websites.

Occurred after the latest Firefox update was installed.
