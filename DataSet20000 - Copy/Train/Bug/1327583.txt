It's possible to accidentally drag-and-drop a folder in bookmarks panel
>>>   My Info:   Win7_64, Nightly 49, 32bit, ID 20160526082509
STR_1:
1. Create new bookmarks folder on bookmarks toolbar. Create 1 bookmark in it named "asdf"
2. Open bookmarks panel, hover mouse over that folder  [popup with item "asdf" appears]
3. Hover mouse over the area between visual border of popup and item "asdf", hold left mouse button,
   move mouse to bookmarks panel (e.g. 1px after the last folder there), release left mouse button

AR:  In Step 3 drag-and-drop starts, and the folder is moved to another place
ER:  Either X or X+Y (See Note 1)
 X) Step 3 - drag-and-drop shouldn't start
 Y) If FF devs really had some intention to allow dnd operation from popup representing its contents,
    then a better UI (better than 2px area) should be used for that.

Notes:
1) I often encounter this bug accidentally, when I'm trying to drag-and-drop one of bookmarks.
   The way browser creates 2px "trap" area reminds me about bug <>, which is very similar.
   Basically, nobody can rely on 2px areas unless they are located near the edge of the screen.
2) I think that current UI is not intended, because otherwise browser would allow me to start
   drag-and-drop of empty folder, but instead I simply click on "empty" item and nothing happens
