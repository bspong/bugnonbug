When I put my computer in suspend each night everything is working fine and sound plays properly when in the browser. However the next day when I resume the session the sound will not work in the browser but it works fine natively in the system. For instance if I had playlist.com opened in the browser to a particular song it will play fine until I put the system in suspend. When I return and try to play it after resuming it may show as playing but no sound comes out or in some cases it will not even show its playing and nothing will happen. However system sounds in native applications play fine. I can fix this issue by closing out the browser and reopening but it is still a bug and should be addressed. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open browser and play some media (in my experience it always happens with playlist.com so just go there and find a song. I also get the same result with youtube
2.Put the system into suspend mode with the browser still open. 
3.Resume the session from suspend and try to play the same song. (it doesn't matter if you refresh the window)
4. The song will not play (although it may or may not act like it is playing)
5. The only way to get sound back is to restart the browser at which time everything is fine. 
Actual Results:  
What I expected to happen. No sound until I restart the browser. 

Expected Results:  
It should play audio after resuming from suspend the same as it does before the system was suspended. 

Bug occurs with default themes and only Roboforms and Ubuntu Firefox Modifications addons enabled. My sound card is an X-Fi Titanium Champion Series and 5.1 surround is enabled.
