Steps to reproduce:

Resolution of https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=658245 introduced ability to open bookmarks in new tab (with left mouse-click) instead of current one by default.

Enable new feature by setting browser.tabs.loadBookmarksInTabs:true in about:config


Actual results:

Left mouse-click opens bookmarks in new tab
Middle mouse-click opens bookmarks in new tab


Expected results:

Left mouse-click opens bookmarks in new tab
Middle mouse-click opens bookmarks in current tab


Why it sound like a bug?
Before browser.tabs.loadBookmarksInTabs was introduced there was a possibility to open bookmark in new or current tab (with different effort from user).
After entablement of browser.tabs.loadBookmarksInTabs:true there is no convenient way to open bookmark in current tab.

The whole feature is very useful and much needed however it sounds more logical if it acted as toggler to switch functionality of left mouse-click and middle mouse-click when used with bookmarks.
