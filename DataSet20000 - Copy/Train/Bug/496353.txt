In my extension Cookie Monster, I implement a prefwindow for the options dialog.  Within the prefwindow, there is a prefpane containing preferences and a vbox containing checkboxes.

For all versions previous to FF3.1 beta 2, this rendered properly.  For FF3.1 beta 2 through FF3.5 beta 4, the last checkbox is only partially visible (i.e cutoff).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  In Firefox 3, download and install Cookie Monster (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4703)
2. From the Firefox menu, choose Tools->Add-ons, then Options for Cookie Monster
3. Notice how all of the checkboxes are completely visible
4. Perform the same steps in Firefox 3.5 beta 4
5. Notice how the last checkbox is only partially visible
Actual Results:  
The prefwindow dialog is rendered differently for Firefox 3 than for Firefox 3.5 beta 4.


Expected Results:  
The prefwindow dialog should render exactly the same for Firefox 3 and Firefox 3.5 beta 4.
