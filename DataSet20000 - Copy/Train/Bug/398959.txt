I'm not clear on the CSS specification as far as inline elements being displayed as block level elements. I can clarify that if an inline element is supposed to act *exactly* as a block level element that input buttons are not having their borders added to the total height if they are set to display: block. For clarification the input I've been messing with is set to type="submit" however changing it to type="button" has no effect on the styling.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. <input class="mybutton" type="submit" />
2. input.mybutton {display: block; border: #000 solid 1px; height: 18px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;}
3. Take a screenshot, I'm sure it should be displayed as 20px though not 100% sure.
Actual Results:  
The button is rendered as 18px, the border is not added to the total height.

Expected Results:  
The button should be rendered as 20px (top to bottom borders included at 1px respectively) in total height. Since it's an inline element not sure if there is anything special to block level measurements.
