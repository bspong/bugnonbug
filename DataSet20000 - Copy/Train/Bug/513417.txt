In an Applet, a java.awt.event.ActionEvent thread appears to die before completing

I am an experienced professional Java developer.  The Applet at the site listed above works 100% correctly on the following platforms: IE7, Opera, FireFox 3.5 for Windows, Safari, Java Appletviewer for Windows, Java Appletviewer for Mac.

It DOES NOT work on FireFox for Mac, 3.5 or 3.7pre.

This Applet is the child's game of "Battleship." Clicking any of the 144 buttons on the game grid or the single master button triggers an ActionEvent.  All of the buttons/events use the same handler. The thread launched by the ActionEvent causes abnormal display behavior and the thread seems to die before completing.  To demonstrate this, play the game on a good platform (e.g. FireFox for Windows) a few times to get familiar.  Then start a game on FireFox/Mac 3.5.  The problems occur every time and will be clearly visible.  Send me an e-mail address and I will provide the code for the Applet to you.
