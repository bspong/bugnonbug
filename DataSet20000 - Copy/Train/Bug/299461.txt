Required popup windows appear erratically or not at all in Yahoo bridge

You'll need a Yahoo login and preferably someone who plays bridge, to check
this.  Beside the pop-up bug, the Lounge window is much slower to refresh than
Safari or IE are.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to URL above (you'll need a Yahoo login)
2. Click on one of the available "Lounges"
3. A lounge window should appear.
4. Click on a game to sit down at.  A game window should appear.  If it doesn't,
there's your first confirmation of the bug.  Minimize and maximize the lounge
window as this usually cause the game window to appear.
5. Once you get the game window, click on Review Bidding, Score, and Last Trick
buttons.  Each of these should immediately pop up a small window.
6. If you really want some fun, sit down at a game to play and wait for the
bidding to come around to you.  When it does, a tone will sound and you should
get a bidding window with all possible bids listed as clickable buttons. 
Usually it does not.  Usually you can get it to appear, by minimizing/maximizing
various windows.  After you bid, it's supposed to disappear, but NEVER does. 
And don't close it manually, as you'll have to go through the whole rigmarole
again of getting it to reapper when it's your turn to bid again.  
Actual Results:  
Popup windows routinely do not appear when expected.  Sometimes they don't
disappear when expected, either.

Expected Results:  
This whole thing works perfectly in Safari, if you'd like to see an example. 
I'd prefer to use Firefox, but this thing has driven me back to Safari to play
games on Yahoo.
