Here http://www.altvision.pl/error.doc is source code of solution under I found problem. Problem is that when the formular is submited from child page reached by parent.formular.submit() (open in <iframe> it can not be submited in Firefox, konqueror and Netscape but Internet Explorer and Opera (while presenting as Internet Explorer). When in Netscape rendering is set to "Internet Explorer" above example works ok.

The same formular put in child page can be submited obviously with parent variables even.

More. When the formular from parent page is writen into <div> tag by child.document.all.div.innerHTML command it can't be submited also ! Despite of when is tested with alert("showing consistency of formular") calling from child page it show that formular is local for it ! As I assume it can't be submited because was written from parent page (!?) and there is some problems with everything asociated with "parent" and "formular" when they appear together.

Reproducible: Always
