The game at http://contrasaur.us generally works well, but by the time you get to the third or fourth level, pauses occur somewhat frequently. The game will stop, sound, input, and graphics, and stutter for several seconds before resuming and playing correctly for a short time. After this time, the stutter repeats, and the game resumes, and so on until the end of the game.

My "shot-in-the-dark", useless, and likely embarrassing guess is that these are GC sweeps that pause the whole game. I guess this because the stuttering becomes more frequent as the number of objects increases, with no stuttering or almost no stuttering for the first couple of levels, and a lot of stuttering by the final levels, where there are a lot of bad guys and weapons on-screen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Play the game for a while.
2. Observe the behavior described above.
Actual Results:  
Gameplay interrupted by intermittent stuttering

Expected Results:  
Smooth, uninterrupted gameplay

I am using a nightly from Dec. 1 on Linux 2.6.36 x86_64. I have a GeForce GTX 285, nvidia 260.19.21 blob drivers. Toggling layers.accelerate-all seems to have no effect.
