Under FF 3.0.4 Fedora 10 Linux (under VMWare VM under Windows (!)), the Ctrl++ zoom expands western characters, but leaves Chinese text at original size, even after multiple ctrl++ strokes.  The same page and actions on FF 3.0.5 and Windows produces desired effect of both western and asian characters enlarging. 

Trying to play with Edit / Preferences / Content / Fonts & Colors / Advanced and "Fonts for" and "Minimum font size" also never seems to affect the Chinese characters.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open above URL, web page with mixed Chinese and Western chars, in UTF-8, both character sets begin approx. same size/height.
2. Hit Ctrl++ (zoom) 3 or more times.  
3. Western text is now twice height of Chinese text which hasn't changed size
Actual Results:  
Chinese characters have not changed size or enlarged.

Expected Results:  
Chinese characters should expand along with Western characters

I can only test the Fedora 10 FF 3.0.4 from within the VMWare guest.  I don't think this makes a difference...
