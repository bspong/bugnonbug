When any scripted window (with window.open method) opens in javascript, new window  opened opens in different (always 1st monitor), where else we use dual monitor desktops (iMac with additional ViewSonic monitor).

When we open same website on Internet Explorer and Javascript effect opens new window on the same monitor where the parent (opener) window resides.

But on firefox this window opens always in first monitor, this causes problems as users presses some button like open and they expect window coming on their screen which opens in different monitor.

This procedure works well with Safari on mac, windows and IE on windows. Firefox fails.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Dual Monitor
2. Switch Firefox to 2nd or 3rd monitor
3. Open any website, which will open a new page on new window with javascript or else open following html...

<html>
<body>
<input type=button onclick="window.open('www.mozilla.org','_blank');" value='click me to open'>
</body>
</html>
Actual Results:  
Window opens in first Monitor

Expected Results:  
Window should open on the same monitor
