option to return to old ssl warning dialog required

While the new SSL warning dialog may be good to discourage average users from ignoring ssl warnings, users who know how ssl works are extremely annoyed by it. Additionally, the warnings for untrusted certificates and certificates that are issued for the "wrong" domain (for example with "www" in front of it) are very similar now, while they were clearly different in FF2.

I suggest to:
- create an hidden about:config option "show quick SSL error buttons" which makes the following buttons appear on the ssl warning page: "ignore warning, connect insecurely", "show certificate" and "trust certificate".
- make the "valid cert but wrong domain" and "expired" warnings clearly distinct from the "invalid cert" dialog (maybe only in the "ssl expert mode")

 - AND/OR -

- create an hidden about:config option "use old SSL warning method"
- add an option to remember the decision to the old "wrong domain" dialog
