Whe I go to the Big Fish game site and look at a game I am interested in, there are always 3 small windows at the bottom of the game description which you can click on to see a magnified version of the small window. Gives good detail about what the game looks like, how dark it is, etc. Starting with the update previous to 5, clicking on the window causes a new tab to be created and the whole of firefox shrinks down to the size of the window. That means I have to enlarge firefox, click the tab to make it go away and go to Safari where this does not happen. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on the small game picture window below game description
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Window opened in new tab and firefox shrunk.

Expected Results:  
Before the update prior to 5 the window just used to open on the Big Fish page and then you would click the red button to close it and you would be right back where you started from.

Just opened a small window on the game page
I use Safari now when I want to go to that game site because the problem does not happen in Safari. When the update to 6 arrived, that was the first thing I checked and it is still happening.
