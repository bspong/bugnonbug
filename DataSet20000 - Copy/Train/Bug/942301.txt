Windows8 attempts to kill Nightly classic firefox on startup, due to faulting
STR:
- Click on firefox desktop shortcut in classic mode on windows8
-- local build of m-c, from tuesday
- See fx addon compatibility dialog
- See Windows8 "Nightly has stopped working" dialog, with options to attach the debugger ot close the program
- If you wait & ignore the dialog, Nightly classic might start running anyway
- If you attach to a debugger, it breaks immediately at the end of
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\VC\crt\src\crt0dat.c
void __cdecl __crtExitProcess (
        int status
        )
{
        __crtCorExitProcess(status);

        /*
         * Either mscoree.dll isn't loaded,
         * or CorExitProcess isn't exported from mscoree.dll,
         * or CorExitProcess returned (should never happen).
         * Just call ExitProcess.
         */

        ExitProcess(status);
}
