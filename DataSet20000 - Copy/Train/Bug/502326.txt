Can't drag/drop bookmark folders, can't export bookmarks
Created attachment 386798
"empty" json file that is produced when exporting

When I attempt to drag/drop a bookmark folder (either from the Bookmarks menu or in the Organize Bookmarks window), the following error appears in the error console:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE) [nsINavBookmarksService.getFolderIdForItem]"  nsresult: "0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/places/controller.js :: PCDH_canDrop :: line 1426"  data: no]

The following error appears in the error console when I select the "Bookmarks Menu" item in the Organize Bookmarks window:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE) [nsINavBookmarksService.getItemTitle]"  nsresult: "0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/places/editBookmarkOverlay.js :: EIO__appendFolderItemToMenuList :: line 291"  data: no]

When I export my bookmarks, the json file that is produced is missing all of my bookmarks (see attachment). However, "Export HTML" does work as expected.

No steps to reproduce. I frequently upgrade and downgrade between nightlies, which is what probably caused this.

I'll debug this myself when I get time to. If anyone has any tips on where to start looking, they'd be much appreciated :)
