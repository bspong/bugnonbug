Cursor jumps from e-mail text area to e-mail address area when pop-ups change.

When you open an e-mail that is forwarded or a reply, the cursor jumps from the text box to the "TO" address and the text prints in that area.  This occurs when the pop-ups change for the first and sometimes the second times.  You have to move the cursor back to the text box and click it there.  Then you can begin typing the message.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the "Compose" or click on "Reply" when you have an e-mail you are viewing.
2.  The cursor starts in the text message box, but jumps to the address line of the e-mail just after the pop-up advertisement appears above the e-mail window.
3.  Click the cursor back in the e-mail text box and begin typing the message.
Actual Results:  
Cursor jumps to the address line of the e-mail.  You have to take the mouse and move the cursor back in the text message area and click.  Then you can type the message.

Expected Results:  
When I click on the "Compose" button, I expect the e-mail window to open and the cursor to be at the top left of the text box.  I expect to begin typing the message immediately.  This used to be the way the Firefox e-mail system worked.  I had hoped that the new download of Firefox 3.6.4 would solve the problem.

The problem occurs on all XP Pro windows systems.  I first noticed it in Firefox 3.5.7.  I put a notice in your questions to be answered by other Firefox users back in February 2010.  This is a small problem, but it wastes time moving the cursor back to the text box and is at the point of being very annoying.
