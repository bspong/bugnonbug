Problem with lines in popups. If I marked a text who is in 2 or more lines, there is a bug in popups.

I'm a member in a discussion forum. There is a function, that helps you to strike out a part oft the text in a post. If I mark the part oft the text and click on a button, a popup opens. In the popup should be the part oft the text, that I marked. But there is only the part of the text used, which is in the first line. The other part is deleted.
I tested if the bug is in the board only, but this bug appears on other sites as well.
There is the same problem. Firefox only marked the text in the first line. 

I have some screenshots(it's a german forum), so you can understand it better I hope...

--> There you can see the text (6 numbers, 1 number in a line)

--> The same in the Internet-Explorer.

--> There opens a popup. There should be the marked text. But you can only see the first number from the first line.

--> The result: Only the first line with the number 1 is in the "[d]-clammys".
(The text which is in the "[d]-clammys" will be crossed out.)

--> In the Internet-Explorer is allright.

I noticed, that the problem is only in "popups". In an other forum-system, there is the same function without the "popups" and there is all right. 


I hope that you understood the most. My english isn't very good (because I'm german).
A nice person helped me with some words and I wrote it with my own knowledge base. So, it isn't very perfect ;-)




  
 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Well, thats very difficult to discribe. Please read the details...
Actual Results:  
I wanted to edit a post, and cross out a part of it. Then I saw the problem. I think, there should be the same result which is in the internet-explorer.


I had the problem with the standard-theme, so I think it is in other themes also.
With other system there's the same problem.
