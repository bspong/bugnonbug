Although it currently works on the Bookmarks Toolbar and in Places Organizer, using a drag n drop key-modifier on a bookmarks *FOLDER* in the Bookmarks Menu does not work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Bookmarks menu and navigate to a bookmarks folder ("Places" will do, or create a new one)
2. Try to move or copy the folder using either SHIFT or CTRL keys as a modifier (ie: hold down SHIFT or CTRL then left-click-and-hold then drag.
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens. Can't move or copy a folder. The pointer does not change to its expected modified state of '+'(copy) or rectangle(move).


Obviously, no drop indicator is shown - which is another bug, actually Bug 389290, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=389290 but possibly tied in.

Also be aware that the Ctrl key modifier is partially-broken anyhow: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=400661

And that bookmarks menu sub-menus(folders) no longer expand when the mouse is held over the -> arrow during drag n drop. I'm about to file this Bug too....
