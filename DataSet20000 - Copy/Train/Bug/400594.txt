REPRO STEPS

preparations: make sure you got firefox configured to use the password manager and that there is a master password set.

1. start a new firefox session
2. go to some video site like youtube etc and start something you like
3. keep the video running and start a new firefox window/tab and while listening to the video audio you surf around on other webpages
4. suddenly you click on a link where there is a login form for which the password manager knows the password. the password manager will now try to populate the form username/password etc, but because you have not yet specified the master password a password prompt dialog appears.
5. while the master password dialog is visible, the audio from the video is pauses (and I assume the video is also standing still).


Firefox may be used by someone who is using this computer only temporary; a person who does not even know the master password. So like while surfing around, every 5-10 minutes... and as usual; opening like 10 tabs at a time.... the audio stops pretty frequently and the user has to find the master password prompt and press cancel to make audio play again.

Reproducible: Always
