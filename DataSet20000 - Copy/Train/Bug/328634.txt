Disable Freetype2 by default

I had the following error when I tried to build the cvs version of the Firefox:
/usr/include/ft2build.h:56:38: error: freetype/config/ftheader.h: No such file or directory

At irc.mozilla.org / #firefox I received an answer that to fix this I needed to add these lines to my .mozconfig file:

ac_add_options --disable-freetype2
ac_add_options --enable-xft

There was also suggested that freetype2 should be disabled by default as many people are currently using these settings. So this bug is a suggestion to do so.  I hope that someone with better understanding about the subject knows whether this is a good idea or not. If the defaults settings are not a good idea, perhaps something else could be done for that error to appear during the compile time.

I compiled with Ubuntu 5.10 and the .mozconfig looks like this:
---------------------------------
. $topsrcdir/browser/config/mozconfig
mk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=@TOPSRCDIR@/ff-debug
ac_add_options --disable-optimize
ac_add_options --enable-debug
ac_add_options --disable-static
ac_add_options --enable-shared
ac_add_options --enable-tests
ac_add_options --disable-freetype2
ac_add_options --enable-xft
mk_add_options MOZ_CO_PROJECT=browser
---------------------------------


Reproducible: Always
