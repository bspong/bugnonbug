Operatin system is windows 2000 professional

In firefox  I have choosen the option to check for updates.

There was an update. Si I loaded down the update: 

Firefox 3.5 herunterladen
3.5.6, Deutsch, Windows (7.6MB)

I started and was able to choose the Directory to put the programm in the directory D:\windows\programme

Then I clicked on for further installation.

Then the istallation window told to close firefox. I did close firefox. But the download window was maybe somehow active in background.

In effect for the installation assistant firefox was not closed. In Taskmanager firefox was no more.

So I loaded the installation file down with internet explorer and started the update. No problem, because firefox was not running at all.
The installation of the update was successfull.

Does Firefox need IE to get up? I hope not. In my case it was alike.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
So I loaded the installation file down with internet explorer and started the update. No problem, because firefox was not running at all.
The installation of the update was successfull.

Actual Results:  
No problem, because firefox was not running at all.

Expected Results:  
The installation of the update was successfull.

Normal user may not be able to install the update.

Could be risky. Is it an internal error or a problem affected by outside action?
