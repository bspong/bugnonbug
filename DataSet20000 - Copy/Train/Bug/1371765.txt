Only show the downloads button when necessary
As part of the downloads animation discussion with UX, we have learned that UX would like to change how the download button appears/disappears.

At startup of Firefox, the downloads button should be hidden.

When a download is started, the downloads button should appear.
- If a flexible spacer is in the toolbar and there is room available, the downloads button should appear and take space from the flexible spacer.
- If a flexible spacer is not in the toolbar, or if there is one but there is no room available, the downloads button should appear and take space from the location bar.
-- The location bar will need to have a min-width. Through minor testing I did not see a min-width already applied to the location bar.
-- The min-width should vary based on the window size, though exact specifics on what the min-width should be have not been specified.
-- We should have a min-width without the downloads button, and another min-width with the downloads button, for the various window sizes.
-- We may decide to support a few window sizes, hopefully this can all be implemented through media queries.
-- The appearance and disappearance of the downloads button will not have any animation associated with it, besides from the "download started" animation.
- The downloads button should appear in the first position to the right of the location bar, unless a flexible spacer or the search box is immediately to the right of the location bar. If a flexible spacer or the search box is immediately to the right of the location bar, then the downloads button should appear to the right of the flexible spacer or the combination of the search box and flexible spacer.

The downloads button should remain visible for the entirety of the session unless the user clears the preview panel, at which point the button should be removed when the panel closes.

Previous customizations as to the placement of the download button should be forgotten. The location of this button will no longer be customizable and it should not overflow.
