Dragging images into other applications doesn't work on Win98

In older Firefox versions, it was possible to drag an image outside the browser and into another application and have the application handle that file - for example, an image editing software would open the image, a file manager would offer to copy the file to the target location, etc.

Now it is broken. When the image is dragged and dropped, generally only the first character of the file name is given to the application. For example, if the image is stored as "C:\Temp\image.jpg", the target application would attempt to open "C". Applications that are capable of opening multiple files attempt to open a separate file for every character in the file name, such as "C", ":", "\", "T", "e", ... etc.

This behavior makes me believe that the problem might be caused by erroneously using two-byte Unicode string encoding where ANSI string encoding should have been used. This would explain why the file name is broken into a list of single-character file names.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open an image in Firefox on Windows 98.
2. Drag the image into another application - for example MS Paint.
3. Observe the bug.
Actual Results:  
MS Paint attempted to open a series of single-character file names, composed of individual characters of the correct file name.

Expected Results:  
It should have attempted to open the correct file name. (And presumably fail to do so unless the image was actually in BMP format.)
