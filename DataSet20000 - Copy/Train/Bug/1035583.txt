[Breakdown] Instrument search improvements for fx33
There are several search-related areas to measure in the next sprint (33.3). 

An etherpad to collect these is here: https://firefox-ux.etherpad.mozilla.org/areas-to-measure-for-33-3-sprint.  The list so far:

1. Search suggest on newtab and on about:home 
* How often is it being used?
*  How often do users re-query immediately after a suggested search (possibly a mistaken click)?

2. Search via search history items in awesomebar results (bug 1034381)
* How often are previous searches being clicked in awesomebar results?  (this would be compared with searches clicked after that bug is finished)

3. Clicking on the awesomebar results for "this will search $searchprovider" vs. just hitting enter
* How often to users click enter for a search string vs click the awesome bar results?

4. Searches urls with bogus protocols made from URL bar going to Google rather than error pages (already landed via bug 982428)
* Are more searches being made via the URL bar?
* Are Google-specific strings (eg site: define: and math) being used more?

5. How often are people searching for strings via the URL bar vs the Search bar?
* Our data on this is old
* Could help inform bug on adding search suggestions to awesomebar (bug 958204)

Some others will likely be needed.
