KDE provides a well thought-out and efficient means of accessing files outside
of the root file system. For example, KDE applications can open up and save
files to un-mounted Floppy, Network (SMB, SSH, FTP), and other Storage Media.
Currently, Firefox can't take advantage of these capabilities because its “Open
File” and “Save As” dialogs only see the root filesystem (in other words, only
what's currently mounted).

It would be very nice for Firefox to use the native KDE “Open File” and “Save
As” dialog boxes because it is much more flexible and customizable than the
current Firefox dialog boxes.  After all, Firefox has always used the native
Windows file-accessing dialog boxes when running under Windows, so it should use
the KDE counterparts when running under KDE.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use K Desktop Environment (KDE)
2.Click on File -> Open File
3.Click on File -> Save As

Actual Results:  
A limited dialog box shows up that *cannot*:
1)Access files outside of the filesystem
2)Rename any file

Expected Results:  
Wish to see the powerful native KDE filde dialog that *can*:
1)Access files outside of the filesystem
2)Rename files
3)Be customized

Here's a screenshot of the native KDE "Open File" dialog (preferred):
