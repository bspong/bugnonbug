Whene I press on the ">>" button at the end of the toolbar the one missing bookmark pops out. If I then move the mouse at a certain part of this bookmark (so that it is highligted) and press CTRL+T (new tab) a totally different bookmark is opened. This does not always work, as I have to move the mouse around and press CTRL+T many times, but I can reproduce this very fast.
The overlapping bookmark is a single bookmark, whereas the opened site belongs to the first entry in a bookmark folder (which is several places to the left, even after another bookmark folder).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Fill the toolbar so that one item does not fit.
2. Move the mouse over this link (after pressing on ">>")
3. Press CTRL+T and move the mouse around until a new tab opens (with a different bookmarked site)

Actual Results:  
A bookmarked site opens (in the same tab).

Expected Results:  
An empty tab should open I guess.

I can provide a screenshot of my toolbar or perhaps even the actual bookmarks file if needed.
