I've found that Firefox is a little inconsistent when it comes to handling large numbers of onerror events attached to img tags.

In both http://dev.signpostmarv.name/pub/twitter-avatar-display/really-huge-grid.html and http://dev.signpostmarv.name/pub/twitter-avatar-display/really-huge-grid-data-uri.html , javascript is used to apply a background image when an image fails to load. The former uses a src attribute of "http:" while the latter uses "data:image/png,".

data URIs result in the expected behaviour, though I have suspicions that a really, really big list might still trigger the problem.

using complete urls (e.g. "http://example.org/" instead of "http:" makes no apparent difference.

enabling the cache makes no apparent difference

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load or refresh http://dev.signpostmarv.name/pub/twitter-avatar-display/really-huge-grid.html
Actual Results:  
Not all img tags that fail to load have a background applied e.g. error event does not fire for all relevant img tags.

Expected Results:  
All img tags that fail to load (regardless of HTTP status code or specified attribute relating to a valid image) have a background image applied.

Number of events fired seems dependant upon free resources/device performance, since there were fewer background images being applied when I was running games etc.
