Plugins should be easy to share and install in groups

People often ask me what browser I use, and then why. I explain about Mozilla
and show them all it does, and they run home excited.

Then, they're very, very turned off by the number of steps required to actually
bring Mozilla to my level of functionality - downloading and installing the
browser, downloading, installing, and switching themes, downloading as many as
10 plugins, and configuring many of them in a very tedious process.

There ought to be away I can take my configuration - my plugin settings, theme,
everything - and tie it into one download, simply. This seems to me to require 2
efforts:

1) Create an Export Plugins/Themes Settings dialog, which when called lets you
select which plugin and theme selections and settings you want exported, then
writes out some XML to a single file. The XML would be packaged into a
"myPlugins.zip" file (or some new extension), zipping up the XML file and all
related plugin config files.

2) Create some way of Importing these Settings. Ideally the XML file could be
packaged with a Mozilla/Firefox installer somehow. To keep things simple, a
first step would be to simply have a Plugins/Themes Settings Import dialog, that
the user could access after installing the base product.

The XML format would have to list the plugin name and URL of each plugin/theme.

It should be obvious this will have additional configuration backup/transfer
benefits to a single user with multiple computers or frequent installs. This
functionality could drastically benefit Firefox evangelism if Firefox is meant
to be so light in its base install.
