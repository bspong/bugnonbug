Firefox will not load/start

I use Direcway satellite for my ISP. When the signal is a little weak, I double
click my Firefox icon but the program will not load and start. During this time,
the signal is strong enought to download email using Outlook and I can connect
using Interntet Exployer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use Directway service (or simular?)
2.Have a weak signal
3.Try to use your product.

Actual Results:  
Firefox will not load or start.

Expected Results:  
At least startup and state that it cannot connect to the internet due to a problem.

This has forced me to download and install IE. I have to keep IE as a backup
because Firefox is not reliable for my use.
