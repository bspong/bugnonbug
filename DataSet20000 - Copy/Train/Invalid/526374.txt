[taskfox] Add a pause before processing taskfox commands

When typing a command into taskfox, the output is reprocessed every keypress.  This can cause the browser to hang, and miss keypresses.

This seems to be more common with multimedia panels like 'map'.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type 'map' into taskfox
2. Quickly type an address (ie: Melbourne, Victoria, Australia)
Actual Results:  
Browser recognizes half the keys typed (ie: Mebr Vioi Autrlia)

Expected Results:  
Browser recognizes all keys pressed. (ie: Melbourne, Victoria, Australia)

This should be fixable by performing a timeout for processing, rather than immediate processing.
