Sometimes mozilla firefox 4 stops the k9 web protection service and then I have to go into the task manager and restart the service

Reproducible: Sometimes

Actual Results:  
K9 web protection whined that it was not responding

Expected Results:  
It should have not said that K9 wasn't responding and just let we go on the web without making me restart the K9 service

K9 version: 4.1.52
