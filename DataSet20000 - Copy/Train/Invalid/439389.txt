I'm using Vista Home Premium. while using firefox 2.0.0.13 everything works well and good but then it poped up to upgrade to 14 so naturally I did so. after that no pages would load. I would just get the "Page unavailable" page. So I rolled back to 13 alls good again. I then (just) tried upgrading to firefox 3 beta and same problem. I just re downloaded the 2.0.0.13 install with IE (eww..) and now all works fine again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.upgrade to 2.0.0.14 or 3 beta
2.open the program
Actual Results:  
Same as described no pages would load.

Expected Results:  
worked seamlessly (just like all other firefox has).

Vista Home Premium.. tho I've heard it works fine with Vista busyness.
