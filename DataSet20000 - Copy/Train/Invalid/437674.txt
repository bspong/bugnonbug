I had bookmarked sometime ago this site, www.wneurope.com ; on my browser, at the moment it had no favicon in the bookmark sidebar. Now I visited the site with firefox 3 RC2, and I noticed that the favicon in the bookmarks sidebar, after refreshing, has double width (the height is normal); the image is a "mondino", (a small planet earth), and it appears normal in the url textbox, while in the bookmarks sidebars it has double horizontal size (only the upper half of the world appears; the other one is sliced away because the height remains normal)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to www.wneurope.com
2. bookmark it
3. watch its favicon in the bookmarks sidebar
Actual Results:  
the favicon has double width and appears sliced in its lower half

Expected Results:  
the site's favicon it should be small like all the others favicons.

I'm using the theme "Scribblies kids", v.2.8. I would like to change the theme to the default, but I'm afraid that if I switch I must restart firefox and I somehow lose the text I entered here.
