this is new to beta99.  flst extension moves focus to the newly opened tab.  so if you middle click on a link, the new tab gets focus.  this no longer works.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. (install flst)
2. visit a page with links
3. middle click or ctrl-click on a link
Actual Results:  
the new tab is created, but focus stays at the current tab

Expected Results:  
focus moves to the newly created tab

this failure is new to beta99, AFAIK.
