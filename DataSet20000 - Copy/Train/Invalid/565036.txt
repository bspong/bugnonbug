Addon buttons in toolbar do not appear with multiple Firefox windows

I have a number of addon buttons (Download Helper, NoScript, Flashblock, Adblock, Tobutton) in my menu toolbar, but when I open additional Firefox windows they do not appear in those toolbars.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Open additional Firefox window (either using File->New Window or by reopening Firefox)
3. Buttons do not appear in menu toolbar of new window, but are still in original window.
Actual Results:  
Firefox window opens normally, but buttons do not appear in menu toolbar of new window, but are still in original window.

Expected Results:  
Would expect to see same toolbar buttons in all windows. Statusbar buttons/icons appear in all windows as expected, even for the same addons as do not appear in the toolbar.
