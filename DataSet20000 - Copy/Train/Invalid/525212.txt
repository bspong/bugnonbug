I use Firefox on my work PC (running Windows XP SP3, patched up-to-date). 

I returned to work today to find an invitation to upgrade to version 3.5.4 on my screen. It was only after I finished the upgrade that I learned that version 3.5.4 is a beta.

When I use software for my work, I want stability, not the possibility of bugs and crashes.

Please make sure future upgrade invitations clearly mark whether the software is alpha, beta or released.
