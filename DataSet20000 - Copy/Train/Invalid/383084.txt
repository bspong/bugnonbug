Attempting to import bookmarks in the Bookmarks Manager from a file fails, with a strange blank error popup with the title of "The filepicker was unexpectedly closed by Windows", the standard red X error icon, and an OK button.

After hitting Ok, the Bookmarks Manager window is totally locked and cannot be closed until Firefox is killed via the Task Manager.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up Bookmarks Manager
2. File -> Import -> From file

Actual Results:  
Get an error popup with no internal text, just a title bar of "The filepicker was unexpectedly closed by Windows", an red X error icon, and an ok button, no other text.

Expected Results:  
File picker should appear, to select the file you want to appear from

This is under Vista 64bit Home Premium. Do not have any other versions to check on. Does not occur on another box with identical FF version running XP Pro. Must be a Vista issue.
