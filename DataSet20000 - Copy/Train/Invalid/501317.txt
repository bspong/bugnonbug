After updates of add-ons problems with tab mix plus, no symbols of the most add-ons, no new tabs (strg-t), sessions were not saved. When starting FF default page appears, new page could be opend (strg-n) and there new tabs possible, but not in the first opened page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. deinstalling FF, reinstalling, installing only tab mix plus
   problem not solved
2. creating new profile (...\firefox -P), starting, installing tab mix plus
   same problems
Actual Results:  
After updating some add-ons firefox starts not as desired. Only deault page was loaded and no new tabs could be created. No symobls of tab mix plus, noscript on the screen or in the list of symbols.
Deinstalling Firefox (with user data), then installing and reinstalling tab mix plus, problem does not disappear. Sometimes the configuration-page of tab mix plus can not be opened. Then I have to reboot the pc.
Creating a new profile and installing tab mix plus, problem already there

Expected Results:  
Problem is already there, i.e. firefox starts with default page, could not create new tabs on the first page but open a new and there I can create new tabs. Althoug I have configured tab mix plus, no question about saving session or recreating session by restarting firefox

firefox starts only with the default page.

On an other pc deinstalling of ieview helps but on the above mentioned nothing helped.
