firefox -remote option doesn't work on MacOS X
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 FireFox/0.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 FireFox/0.8

The -remote option doesn't work on MacOS X. The browser just tries to startup as
another instance, and displays the "choose profile" dialog. It works fine on Linux.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Try to run something like:

/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox -remote 'openURL(whatever)'


Actual Results:  
Another full instance of Firefox launches.

Expected Results:  
Should have followed the -remote directive just like the Linux version does.

I ran a "strings" and noticed that -remote wasn't present in the firefox-bin in
the MacOS X build, but IS present in the Linux build. Did this somehow get
#ifdef'ed out on MacOS?
