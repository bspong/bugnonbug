Bloglines Toolkit permanently reporting 'No unread items'

The well-known blog aggregator service 'Bloglines' has an extension for Mozilla browsers called 'Bloglines Toolkit' (http://www.bloglines.com/about/notifier/#moz).
Its most noticeable feature is a "B" icon in the lower-right part of the browser which features an additional red dot when there are unread blog entries. In the 'unread posts' state, one can click on it to be taken to bloglines.com, in the "no unread posts' state, clicking triggers it to check again whether there are new posts.

In the last few nightly builds (ca. the last 7 days, though I didn't check), this extension is no longer working, as in, it always behaves as if there were no unread posts (despite there being). 

Can anyone confirm this and does anyone know whether a recent change in Firefox trunk code caused this?

Using Bloglines version 1.7.0, re-install did not work.
