When firefox is started up, it shows an error box and the error console contains <script language='javascript'>postamble();</script> each time firefox is opened
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

When opening firefox, a error message appears stating there is a problem with the postamble
the error console has
<script language='javascript'>postamble();</script>
each time firefox is called
I have removed and reloaded firefox and it still happens
I am not sure what triggered the effect initially
