When you download a file, after it has completed the 'Download complete' notification slides up and then down. Clicking on this box used to bring up the 'Downloads' dialog. The box behaves as a link still (cursor changes to the pointing finger), but if you click on the box nothing happens.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download a file.
2. Click on notification box

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
Downloads dialog should be shown (as if you've hit Ctrl+J).
