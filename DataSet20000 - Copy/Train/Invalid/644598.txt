I make visible the bookmarks toolbar, and often (about every day) I see in this toolbar some bookmarks with a wrong favicon.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
I still don't know how to always reproduce the bug, but the problem is in brief:

1. I bookmark site1, so I have:

favicon1 site1

2. I bookmark site2, so I have:

favicon2 site2

3. I visit some pages, I don't know what are the exact steps.
Actual Results:  
A bookmark has a wrong favicon, something like:

favicon2 site1

Expected Results:  
favicon1 site1

This report is probably a continuation of bug 487003. I had this bug for a while with Firefox 3, and I still have it with Firefox 4.
