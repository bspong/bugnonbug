My start page is a local file where I have a number of sites coded in a HTML 
file. When I call up the file in Internet Explorer it shows as the correct 
size but when I call it in FireFox it comes up about three or four font sizes 
too small so I must use the CTRL UP ARROW combination each time I open Firefox 
to be able to read the links. File is available on request. Otherwise great 
program!  Don
