CSS for links (i.e. a:link spec) not applied to secure (https://) links.

Given the existance of pre-defined CSS which defines a new style class and it's behaviour specifically for links, i.e. 

.foo {color: #666666}
.foo a:link {color: #ff9900}

and/or general re-definition of the link type a, i.e.:

a:link  {color:#ff9900; text-decoration: none}
a:hover {color:#ff9900; text-decoration: underline}

This is applied correctly to all links on a page when rendered in Firefox, and in the case of .foo either when specified inline, i.e. <a class="foo" .. > or within a span i.e. <span class="foo"> .. <a .. > both work.

However if any of the links are changed from http:// (or mailto: etc) to being a secure link (https://) the displayed link text no longer retains or respects the required CSS style (which it does in other browsers).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Given the existance of pre-defined CSS which defines a new style class and it's behaviour specifically for links, i.e. 

.foo {color: #666666}
.foo a:link {color: #ff9900}

and/or general re-definition of the link type a, i.e.:

a:link  {color:#ff9900; text-decoration: none}
a:hover {color:#ff9900; text-decoration: underline}

This is applied correctly to all links on a page when rendered in Firefox, and in the case of .foo either when specified inline, i.e. <a class="foo" .. > or within a span i.e. <span class="foo"> .. <a .. > both work.

Now... try changing any of the links to https:// ..
Actual Results:  
If any of the links to which the CSS is applied are changed from http:// (or mailto: etc) to being a secure link (https://) the displayed link text no longer retains or respects the required CSS style (which it does in other browsers).

It still inherits the style's base definition, but does not pick up either the global or the style's own :link or :hover properties. 

Expected Results:  
Re-defining the appearance of all links, or those covered by a particular style, should affect ALL links. There is no argument for excluding secure links unless particularly officious about highlighting their difference at the cost of design.
