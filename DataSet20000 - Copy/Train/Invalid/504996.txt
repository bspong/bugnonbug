Whenever I open a saved bookmark or a saved HTML or URL file by dragging and dropping it as a new tab in Firefox, it opens the site in both the currently opened tab AS WELL as in the newly created tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a bookmark (on the Bookmarks Toolbar, for example)
2. Open it by dragging and dropping it as a new tab

Actual Results:  
The link is opened both in the currently opened tab as well as in the new tab.

Expected Results:  
The link should only open in the new tab.

The same happens with locally saved HTML and URL files.
