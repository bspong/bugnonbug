Steps to reproduce:
1. With Flash Player 8 installed, navigate to http://www.playercore.com/bugfiles/99329/jstest.html
2. Click on top circle, which causes Flash Player to call: javascript:alert('touché');
3. Click on bottom circle, which causes Flash Player to call: javascript:alert('touch&eacute;');

RESULT:

On Windows --
The top button correctly brings up a JavaScript alert box that says: touché
The bottom button brings up an alert box that says: touch&eacute;

On Mac --
The top button doesn't bring up a JavaScript alert box at all
The bottom button brings up an alert box that says: touch&eacute;

EXPECTED:
Each button should bring up an alert box that says: touché

If you click on the top html link below the Flash Player content, you can see the correct and expected behavior.
