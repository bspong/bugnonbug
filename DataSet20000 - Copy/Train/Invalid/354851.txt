File Menu Title "Organize Bookmarks" does not match corresponding entry in window that launches
Someone reported this via Hendrix, but it may by design.

STR:

1. Choose the Bookmarks | Organize Bookmarks file menu item

Observe that the title of the window that launches is "Manage Bookmarks" instead of "Organize Bookmarks"
