I just checked the error console and found these. I have many reports of this one and here are the others in error console language--lost me. there is a huge file below this if you click on and the same with all the others. I'm sure someone there could understand it all, I sure don't. I had a thought that maybe since it was logged in the error console meant it was auto maticall y being fixed ,but I thought on the security ones it might be a good idea to report them and these about Hotmail, gmail and googleblog

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Hotmail
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
an error message came up in error console

Expected Results:  
I have no idea- hotmail opened and all seemed fine.

not produce an error message. It did the same with gmail and google blog.
Now the whole error console is filled with this warning instead of the others which have all been erased by this one a hundred or so times.I PASTE:
