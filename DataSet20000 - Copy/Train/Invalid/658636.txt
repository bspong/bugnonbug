FeedWriter keeps objects alive through its prototype

FeedWriter holds a number of XPCOM objects alive through its prototype. These shouldn't live on the prototype, but on the instances. The prototype stays alive until shutdown, so it leads to bloat and sometimes to leaks because the CC can't collect any cycles involving objects held by FeedWriter.prototype.
