Print Preview doesn't work properly in gmail accounts

The print preview option is not working properly in Mozila Firefox 4 and even 5 also. Only for that reason I'm still using Mozila Firefox 3.6.18.

When I choose the print preview option it shows the preview in a new tab. After closing the tab I'm not able to go back to my gmail inbox to check the same/other mail. And there is no option left. You have to close your gmail tab and re-login again to check mail. This is horrible indeed.

Please fix the problem. Print preview is not an option, it is necessity for me. I'm using Mozila Firefox since its inception. It makes me feed very bad that I'm not able to use the latest version of Mozila Firefox only because of the Print Preview Option.

Regards,

Reproducible: Always
