I've read some fixes online but nothing helps.
It says to copy all the fonts from the Fonts folder somewhere, then delete all the fonts from the Fonts folder and after that copy the fonts back. I am using Win7 and I cannot delete Times New Roman and then replace it, it says that the font is "System Protected".
This bold rendering started just a few days ago, after I've updated to the last FF build. In some cases, the default font is not bold, but in Italics or both styles.
