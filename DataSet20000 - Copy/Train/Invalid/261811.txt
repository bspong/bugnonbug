New window toolbar has multiple problems

When a new window is opened with no toolbars, the new static toolbar with the
urlbar has multiple problems.

The biggest problem is that if the urlbar has been moved to another toolbar then
it is not displayed in the new window.

The next problem is that toolbar customization is allowed. Customization should
be disabled for toolbars when the window is in this mode.

The third problem is that, while toolbar buttons are hidden, toolbar separators
not not hidden. Perhaps toolbar separators should be given a class of
"chromeclass-toolbar-additional" like toolbar buttons have so that it will be
properly hidden. An alternative, but less elegant, possibility is to add a
selector to /global/content/xul.css for these separators.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. View > Toolbars > Customize
2. Move "Location" urlbar to the "Bookmarks Toolbar."
3. Place some separators on the "Navigation Toolbar."
4. Exit toolbar customization.
5. In the browser, click a link which opens a new window with toolbars disabled
(e.g., gmail contacts).
6. Notice that the toolbar is visible but the "Location" urlbar is missing.
7. Right-click toolbar and notice that it is customizable.
8. Notice that the toolbar separators are visible.
