browser.xul elements getting included in other XUL windows
XUL elements that appear to be specific to browser.xul are getting included in other Chrome windows.  For example, if I open the JS console, then examine it with the DOM inspector, I see lots of browser.xul specific elements.  See attached screenshots.

This doesn't seem to happen on all XUL windows.  E.g., if I point the DOM inspector at itself, there are no extra elements.
