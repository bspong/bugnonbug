i have an p4 3.4 ghz Hyper-threading system and it shows 2 (two) logical cores in task manager...

if i open multiple php forum related pages or yahoo mail pages one of my cores goes CONSTANTLY to 100% ( the first core actually ).

using only one firefox window works ok... processor is never over 15%... on either core.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start firefox
2.Open 5 forum pages or threads of the same forum
3.one core goes to 100% while the other just stays normal ( to a maximum of 15-20% )

Actual Results:  
very annoying... i have to shut down firefox and start it again...

Expected Results:  
after i restart firefox... another 10 min .... same thing

seems to only happen on multi threaded / multi core cpus
