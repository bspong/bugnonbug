On E*TRADE https://us.etrade.com/e/t/home pages are missing info such as
buttons, data entry fields, and graphics - Works fine w/Internet Explorer 6+ and
Opera. This problem occured after upgrading FF from 1.0.2 to 1.0.3. Tried
reinstalling, going through preferences etc. but can find nothing to correct
this. Try the above URL w/IE6+ and you'll see what should be there.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to https://us.etrade.com/e/t/home with Firefox 1.0.3 and observe what appears.
2. Go to https://us.etrade.com/e/t/home with Internet Explorer(Yuck) and see
what should be there.
3.

Actual Results:  
I got mad having to use IE6 because Firefox 1.0.3. isn't displaying the correct
page info.

Expected Results:  
Displayed the webpage as IE6 does.

nothing else
