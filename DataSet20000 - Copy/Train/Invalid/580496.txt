If you middle-click (press in the mousewheel) on the Gmail icon in Google Toolbar, it should open Gmail in a brand new tab. The exception to this is when a new, empty tab is opened and is yet to be populated with a web page. However, if this new tab is in the process of loading in a web page, Gmail still takes over this tab, but it should open a new tab instead.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a new tab by pressing Ctrl+T
2. Go to a URL in this tab (ideally one which you know will take at least a few seconds to load)
3. While it's loading, middle-click on the Gmail icon in the Google Toolbar
Actual Results:  
Gmail opens and replaces the loading tab.

Expected Results:  
Gmail should open in a new tab.

Works fine if the loading tab is another Google page.
