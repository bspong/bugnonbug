When opening a second firefox window and after that closing the first window
will result in not functional buttons and empty (context) menus.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open first instance of Firefox
2. Open a second instancen of firefox (CTRL-N or using start menu)
3. Close first instance of Firefox

Actual Results:  
(context) Menus are empty on the second interface.
Buttons do not work


Expected Results:  
Working (contect) menus and buttons.

I've set this to major: I think this is a highly visible bug for non-tab users.
