Tabs do not respond to any action/commands right after coming out of the sleep mode.  The top menu items do work.  

The only way that I have found to unlock the tabs is to open a new window and start "private browsing" and then stopping the "private browsing" session.  This will reload information to each tab that was open on the initial window that froze.  I do have to enter a password to get the computer to come out of the "sleep mode".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Computer goes into the "sleep mode"
2. I enter a password to get the computer to come out of the "sleep mode.
3. Bring up the Firefox application that displays the window with all tabs that were open but tabs do not respond to any commands.
4. Open new window
5. Open a new window and start "private browsing" 
6. Once the "private browsing" sessions has started 
7. I then stop the "private browsing" session
8. Bring up the window with the frozen tabs which will show that all tabs are being reloaded.
9. Continue as usual
Actual Results:  
Normal operations continue as usual

Expected Results:  
All Frozen tabs do not respond to menu commands

Allows manipulation of tabs
