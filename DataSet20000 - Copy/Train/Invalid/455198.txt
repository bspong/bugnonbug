Firebug Lite HTTP headers need improving

The current version of Firebug Lite generates four HTTP requests. The headers for these need to be improved to make sure users get the right version of Firebug Lite and to improve performance. The suggested improvements are listed for each HTTP request.

1. http://getfirebug.com/releases/lite/1.2/firebug-lite-compressed.js
    A. Add an Expires header with a date in the past, so that on subsequent requests it'll generate a Conditional GET request.
    B. The ETag should be removed unless it is being used in some way.

2. http://firebuglite.appspot.com/firebug-lite.css
3. http://firebuglite.appspot.com/firebug.gif
4. http://firebuglite.appspot.com/spacer.gif
    A. Add an Expires header with a date 1+ years in the future. Add a version number to the filename (eg, firebug-lite-1.2.css). If the file ever changes, the main firebug-lite-compressed.js can be updated to point to a new filename.


Reproducible: Always
