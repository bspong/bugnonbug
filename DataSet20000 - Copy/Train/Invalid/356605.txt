Good afternoon:

After the first article in the above referenced newsletter URL, the next heading does not appear properly, and the text is garbled for about a paragraph or two. Then it resumes to its proper state in the Times Roman font.

I tried loading this page in MS IE, and the problem does not occur. I don't know if it is a coding problem since it only display this way in Firefox.

Thank you for your consideration.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load page.
2. Read the first article which displays properly in Times Roman.
3. The second article does not display the heading, and the first paragraph or two has garbled text before returning to the proper state.

Actual Results:  
Same as above.

Expected Results:  
Same as above.

First paragraph should not be garbled.
