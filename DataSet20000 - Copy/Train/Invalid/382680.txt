hello, i wrote you for a problem of adding buttons in tool bar and size of the window. in the links that you sent me i can read thsi 
Firefox: Open the Windows "Start" menu, select "Run" (on Windows Vista, use "Start Search" or enable the Run box, as described here) then type and enter one of the following:

    * firefox.exe -profilemanager
    * firefox.exe -P 

For a zip install or if the above instructions do not work, include the full path to the executable surrounded by quotation marks in the "Run" (or Vista "Start Search") box, as in this Firefox example:

    * "C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe" -profilemanager 

the problem is that this command open a firefox window, nothing more, and nothing where to manage my profilee. i must say that all your explanation are so complicated, one link sending to another and then and then.
your work wouldn t be to write me something instead of saying "go there", where it s a mess of post of people ?
could you sned something more summed up ?
thx
