Hi all

This is more like nit-picking but you can end up clicking wrong.

The right-click on the image context menu has Set as Desktop Background and Block Images from <sitename> too close by.

I just happended to click on Block instead of Set as, just once of all these times *vbg*.

Could you kindly put in a seperator between these two, or change the placement.

Regards
Bhavbhuti
