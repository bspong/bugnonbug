Firefox does not recognize HEADER tags <h4> etc accurately and TABLES drawn incorrectly

A header 4 <h4> tag is significantly smaller than a header 5 <h5> tag. All our
web pages on two sites use header tags and they are too small at 4 and too big
at 5. 

On some pages some tables show correctly the first time they load, others don't
show correctly the first time, and others show ok the first time loaded but not
again. 
example table pages:

Since 90%+ users (unfortunately) use IE, we have to make our pages work and
comply with IE. Firefox (Mozilla) needs to be closer to IE than it currently is.

Firefox by far is the fastest browser on Win and Mac! Thanks for your efforts.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. return to the pages in question
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
same results

Expected Results:  
Headers should increase in size more evenly, like font size.
Tables should draw correctly every time.
