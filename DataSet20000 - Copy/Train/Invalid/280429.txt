when browsing the junk mail folder, there is an option to empty the folder. This
button produces a pop-up with a check box for reporting the mail as junk when
you delete the messages. This popup causes firefox to crash when it closes,
weather you close it yourself or wait for it to close itself.

Reproducible: Always
