Steps to reproduce:

I have upgraded to the latest version of Firefox 6.1. When I launch Firefox, it throws a Javascript Application error.


Actual results:

It should have just opened Firefox directly. I am facing the same issue during pop-up window launch as well.


Expected results:

This pop-up error should not have appeared.
