column descriptions overlaying on alternate rows in Bookmarks Manager

When I clicked on Bookmarks/Manage Bookmarks, the screen that displays my
bookmarks displayed in an unusual fashion.  First, every other row appeared
selected (for my setup, alternating rows had a blue background).  If I switched
to another application and returned, the background on the alternating rows
disappeared but those same rows now appear with text "on top" of them. 
Sometimes the text overlaying the alternate rows is "Bookmarks Toolbar Folder"
but other times has been a portion of the text from the preceding row.

If I click on the row showing the overlaying text, the description clears up. 
If I click on a row under the "overlayed" row, the problem disappears for the
overlayed row.  However, if my next action is to select a link above that row,
the problem reappears on the overlayed row. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on Bookmarks/Manage Bookmarks...
2.

Actual Results:  
First, alternating rows showing a background color (as if selected).  After
minimizing window (or switching to another application and returning),
alternating rows displayed overlaying text.

Expected Results:  
No overlaying text or selected background colors for every other row.
