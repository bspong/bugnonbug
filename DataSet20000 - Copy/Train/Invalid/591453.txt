for both of these games there is a daily quest that in order to complete you
must click a button in game that opens the bookmark thing to add the games URL
in the bookmarks.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Caesary:
1.open quest list
2.click daily tab
3.select bookmark quest (the middle of the 3)
4.to the right of the quest list there is a save bookmark button... click it
and fire fox freezes up.

Lords online:
1.open quest list
2.click daily tab
3.select the quest (it is the only one with a green check mark)
4.click on complete quest and firefox opens the bookmark thing and freezes.

Actual Results:  
a box opens with asking you to fill out bookmark name, select the bookmark
folder to put it in and the ok or cancel options... then firefox completely
freezes up.

most the time firefox stays frozen... but some times opening taskman and trying
to minimize and then maximize firefox with the taskman options unfreezes it.


Expected Results:  
the bookmark box should open allow you to fill it out and submit the new
bookmark or cancel making a new bookmark.


i have added add-blocker and adobe flash.
also made it so it clears all data when firefox is closed.
other then that no changes to firefox.

** i filed this yesterday but since i used Flock to fill it out instead of firefox it was set to "RESOLVED INVALID" ... so now i am filling it out with the latest version of firefox.. problem still happens**
