Hang occurs when laptop case has been closed for some time.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build ID: 20110615151330

Steps to reproduce:

Close my laptop cover while Firefox 5.0 is active.


Actual results:

Firefox freezes when laptop is next opened.    I can still use other applications, but somewhat sluggishly.    Using Windows Task Manager, I "End Task" Mozilla Firefox and things return to normal.    Mozilla Session Manager correctly recovers the session.

Even if I wait several minutes, Mozilla Firefox remains hung until I "End Task."


Expected results:

No crash, I presume.
