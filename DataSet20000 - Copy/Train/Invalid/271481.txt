Programs don't open sites in new window since installing Firefox 1.0
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Ever since I installed Firefox 1.0 the programs that used to open up new browser
instances when clicking on a link (MSN Messenger, Gmail Notifier, etc.) now use
the current page I'm looking at instead of using a new page.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox 1.0 (not Pre-release or any previous versions) and go to a website.
2. Click a link in MSN Messenger and watch it open in the same window.

Actual Results:  
The link opened in the same window/tab I was currently looking at.

Expected Results:  
The link should have opened a new instance of Firefox and shown just that site.
