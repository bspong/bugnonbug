Google street view does not load

When dragging the icon for street view onto the map section, nothing happens. This is a behaviour unique to Firefox. I have tested the page with the same map location in Safari and Chrome where it works fine. There is no add-on blocking scripts turned on either. One could argue that this is a web page problem, but I doubt anything will be done from Google's part with this issue. And Google street view is a much used service so I hope someone from Mozilla can have a look.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load url
2. Type any valid address and click one of the search results
3. Try and drag the street view icon onto the map (yellow icon in top left corner)
Actual Results:  
Although map items turn blue indicating that street view is available, nothing more happens. Only thumbnail will load, not the actual street view script

Expected Results:  
FF should render Google's street view script/view.
