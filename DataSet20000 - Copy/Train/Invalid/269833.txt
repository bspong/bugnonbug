In the page at http://www.importantgifts.com/give_gift.htm there you will see a 
main menu (Home, Give A Gift, Get a Gift).  Clicking on Give a Gift should 
bring up a sub-menu (Shop by: Occasions, Recipients, Causes, etc.) with drop-
down choices (for instance, under Causes, you would see Children, Democracy, 
etc.  This works fine in IE.  The sub-menu does not appear in Firefox.

Reproducible: Always
