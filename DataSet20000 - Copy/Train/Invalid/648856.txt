Broken sessionstore.js causing pages to appear blank on startup
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

Firefox was closed while in Private Browsing mode. After reopening it, I noticed that all my tabs appeared as blank pages, and that I needed to reload them manually.

Curious if this was related to Private Browsing, I tried switching to that mode again. Nothing appeared to happen, so I pressed it again. Now, my two pinned tabs became unpinned, but otherwise, again, no effect. A third press finally brought me to Private Browsing.

I stopped Private Browsing, which immediately brought all my tabs back.

Now, every time that I start Firefox, my tabs appear blank. I have resolved this by renaming my sessionstore.js, which appears to have somehow become corrupted. I have a backup of this file if that is useful for debugging the problem, but it contains login tokens to work-related websites.

I would be happy to attach the file if anybody can tell me how to strip this information.

To give a clue: the sessionstore.js is very large (700kb) and contains 1 tab item with 50 entries, each with about 5 children. The impression I get when switching to Private Browsing is that the windows are somehow internally stacked, and that Firefox is opening the pages on top of each other, so to speak.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Private Browsing
2. Exit Firefox
3. Start Firefox
Actual Results:  
All tabs are blank. Switching back to Private Browsing takes several attempts, between which tabs appear to jump.

Expected Results:  
Pages reload and show content. Switching back to Private Browsing is instantaneous.

If you want me to do some testing with the sessionstore.js, I'd be happy to comply. I can also try this in Fx 4.2a1.
