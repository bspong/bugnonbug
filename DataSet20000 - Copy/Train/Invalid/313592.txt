After uncompressing Firefox 1.5 beta2 into a new folder and starting it for the first time, you see in the Preferences window in "Advanced" -> "Updates" the "Firefox" check-button enabled and checked. After you uncheck it, it is disabled.
1.5 beta has no auto update functionality, right? If it is so, this initial configuration is somehow confusing.

Reproducible: Always
