I generate flash web gallery's in photoshop cs3.   
When trying to open the gallery from the index.htm page (as in the above url) I get the following

"Please upgrade your Flash Player.

Already have Flash Player? Click here if you have Flash Player 6 installed."

Note that this url works fine with IE

I have installed and reinstalled flash 10 many times and it works with other web pages

The html of the index.htm page is

{%FLASH%
test
1/21/2009
#F0F0F0
#FFFFFF
#000000
#0000FF
#800080
#FF0000

You must enable Javascript to view this content.  }

note that Javascript is enabled and that is not the error message that I get.

In order to see the correct display, I have to go to the following url
http://members.verizon.net/~vze29twi/test/gallery.swf

the other files in the test  directory are
UserSelections.txt
photos.js
photos.xml
galleryconfig.xml
flashobject.js

then there are sub directories
images
pages
thumbnails

let me know if you need additional information  jafried@ieee.org
