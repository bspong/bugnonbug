Email problems specific to Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier:  firefox-1.6a1.en-US.linux-i686.complete.mar     04-Dec-2005 12:47  7.6M  

I am unable to compose or reply to my emails at yahoo, and that is only with Firefox.  I go to explorer for the same address and am able to use my email with ease.  

With firefox the entire area where one would compose an email is missing.  The send, safe draft, to subject, attach files and other such buttons at the top are present.  The next offering is the "use my signature" box which is customarily at the bottom below the composition box.  

Again, I immediately go to explorer to reply to the same emails, compose etc. etc. with no problems at all, with the window being normal.  





Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Repeated attempts to compose and reply two days in a row.
2. Each time went to explorer to attempt the same action with no problems
3. Used varying emails in order to ensure specific emails were not the problem

Actual Results:  
Enter my firefox facilited yahoo inbox, observe new or old emails, click reply with no space available for writing an email.  Click on compose only to get the same predominantly missing window.

Expected Results:  
The same results that occurred before.  A window that is absent a way to send or compose mail.  If I enter an email address in to the slots and click send (with obviously no message) neither the send, save draft or other buttons respond.  


I don't know what else to write here.  When you send mail, I will have to respond to you from explorer.
