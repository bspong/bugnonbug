The leak springs shortly after the theserverside.net site is opened. Firefox memory continues to grow unabatedly until the CPU also starts to pick up. Program must be closed through Task Manager when it stops responding.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to theserverside.net
2. Watch Firefox memory usage grow in Task Manager. CPU also hits 100% after a while.
3. Closing the relevant tab frees the memory immediately.
