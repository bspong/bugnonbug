It does this in the window at the bottom of the page or when I move to the next
page. Adding full text to the bottom window does not remedy the problem. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enter multible word query
2.Check bottom of the page
3.Click to the next page

Actual Results:  
Not able to find the query I was asking for.

Expected Results:  
used original query throughout search

I installed the Customize Google extension afterwards hoping for a fix but it
did not help.
