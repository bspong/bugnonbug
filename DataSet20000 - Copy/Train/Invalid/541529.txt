Whenever I mousewheel click on a link to open it in a new tab, it opens a new tab with the correct URL in the address bar but does not actually go to that URL. The same thing happens when I Ctrl+Shift click links.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Mousewheel click on a link, OR
2. Ctrl+Shift click a link
3. A new tab with the URL in the address bar is created, but Firefox does not go to the URL
Actual Results:  
A new tab with the URL in the address bar is created, but Firefox did not go to the URL.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have opened the new tab and gone to the URL.

I was using the default theme. I am using Tab Mix Plus .3.8.2
