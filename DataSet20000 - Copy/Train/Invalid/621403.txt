"Show My Windows and Tabs from Last Time." option does not work.

I chose to have Firefox restore my tabs whenever I close it. However, rather than restoring the tabs, it defaults to my homepage. I just switched from Firefox 3.x and it was working fine then.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open several tabs
2.Close Firefox
3.Reopen Firefox and the tabs will be gone
Actual Results:  
All the old tabs were gone, replaced with my homepage.

Expected Results:  
The software should have reloaded my tabs from last time.

This is a fresh install of Firefox 4 on top of a fresh install of Firefox 3.x (I just got this laptop today)
