Keyboard events get stuck in this javascript

The dhtml game on this page (and all others on this site) monitor key events 
for control. In this build of Deerpark Alpha 2, the keyboard seems to 
get 'stuck' while playing the game. At a certain point, the keyboard stops 
responding to new key presses, and will not recognize keys being released. 
This is the first build that I have noticed this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load dhtml JS on page www.def-logic.com/swarm/swarm.html
2. press Z key to start game. Navigate ship around using IJKL and fire with Z 
key.
3. Continue to move around the screen for about 15 seconds until keyboard 
locks up.

Actual Results:  
The keyboard locks up. Deerpark does not recognize new key events, and will 
not release current key event.

Expected Results:  
When the game control keys are released, Deerpark should not continue 
triggering a key event.
