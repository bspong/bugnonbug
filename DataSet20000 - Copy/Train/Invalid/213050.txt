I'm reading the SAP R/3 manuals - quite boring stuff ;-)

The source code tells Firebird: <font FACE="Symbol">&#174;</font>. This means an
left arrow, my charmap tells me. This makes sense ;-)

Firebird instead shows &#210; or &#226; instead (can't tell the difference, same
sign in my charmap). This sign is an (R). This makes no sense ;-)

Bug or feature (if text too boring, put s.th. inside to attract the user's
attention)?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. looking at the text
2. looking at the source code
3. comparing source with charmap

Actual Results:  
I notice that the source tells the browser to show a left arrow. Firebird shows
the (R) sign instead.

Expected Results:  
Firebird should show the correct char of the font.

Changing the theme does not change the effect. As said, the charmap tells me
that the character requested by the source (the left arrow) has the given code,
so my font file seems to be OK.
