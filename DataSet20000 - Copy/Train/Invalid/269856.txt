I was looking at amazon.co.uk when firefox started to produce errors about not 
matching security algorithms

Firefox relaunched - would not launch. Above error.

Firefox has been reinstalled (1.0PR), and I've tried reinstalling java
j2re-1_4_2_05-windows-i586-p

No joy - the error message seems to imply I'm running MSIE, I'm not!

The error survives a reboot.

Today I installed the weather plugin, but that was working nicely. I also have 
gmail plugin and a whole slew of others (mouse gestures, and a lot not 
compatible with 1.0PR that have been there so long I forget they're plugins).

Really quite annoying this, I can't get into FF at all! Eek!

Firefox seems to be running, but takes up 98-99% of CPU time. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch Firefox
2.Get error message
3.Go to task manager to get the machine working again

Actual Results:  
The thing won't run

Expected Results:  
Run

MSIE works... but please don't make me use that. I got used to FF.

Thunderbird runs okay.
