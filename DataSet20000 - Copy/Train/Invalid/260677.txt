Ok, this might be a problem with the Flash plugin I don't know.
But it doens't happen with IE. Watching this demo made with flash will eat all
memory and then swap! Machine becomes almost unusable.
It is interesting to notice that if you just leave the page loaded and go
browsing using another tab, Firefox stops eating memory (and will restart once
you click on the tab again).
