Everytime I download the toolbar for Firefox and I do a spyware scan I get the following: Un-named Trojan Spyware , type=application. I thought that trojan was a type of virus so I delete it . But when I do the toolbar for Firefox is deleted also. Could you clarify this for me please? Is this Trojan a normal application that you are using or should it not be there?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.delete firffox toolbar
2.re-download toolbar
3.Trojan spyware shows back up.
