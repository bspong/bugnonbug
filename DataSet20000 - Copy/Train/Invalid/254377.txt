<div style="border:2px red solid;padding:5px;">
	<div style="border:2px blue solid;width:500px;">
		TESTING
	</div>
</div>

if browser window is resized to smaller than 500px, the outer DIV will shrink to
match window size, while the inner DIV is still fixed at 500px.
However, the inner DIV's contents is spilled over to the outside of the outer DIV.

should the outer DIV resize with the window and ignore size of its contents, or
should stop resizing until it reaches the limits of its contents?

compare with when we used a TABLE instead of DIV 
<table style="border:2px red solid;padding:5px;width:100%;">
	<tr>
		<td>
			<div style="border:2px blue solid;width:500px;">
				testing
			</div>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

sorry, I've to compare with another browser, MSIE 6 in standards compliant mode

in MSIE6, the above 2 examples look almost exactly the same, the "elastic" outer
box stops resizing when it reaches the content's boundary.
