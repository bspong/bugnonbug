[meta] restore page's content as accurately as possible
This tracks the bugs where Session Restore doesn't manage to restore a page's content exactly as it was when its state was saved. Many of dependent bugs are dataloss.

The specific solution of storing bfcache of a page (bug 387598) was shot down for performance reasons, so we need to improve the existing approach of saving the most important data about the page to cover more common cases.
