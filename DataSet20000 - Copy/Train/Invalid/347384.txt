.gif images do not show up.

Expected Results:

I think it has to do with "\" versus "/" in file pathnames.  HTML likes "/", but pc's use "\" in pathnames.  When the html page is saved to my hard disk using Internet Explorer, only "/" forward slashes appear in the html source, and it loads just fine in Firefox.  It won't load if I have used Firefox to save the HTML page.
