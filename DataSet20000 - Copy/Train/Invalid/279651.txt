crashes and forces computer restart without warning after a long session

Firefox normally works fine. However, after long sessions involving extensive
web browsing, often after my laptop has been on without restarting for several
days, I have now had four or five occasions when, while using Firefox, the
computer restarts without warning. I am not 100% sure this is a Firefox problem
as opposed to a system problem, but every time it has occurred, Firefox has been
the open window and I've just clicked on a link (which works fine on other
occasions). It has usually been preceded by dropping my wireless connection,
requiring a connection to Ethernet to continue browsing. Is cache management an
issue? This never occurred with IE.

wireless router).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Keep session active for days.
2. Browse a lot.
3.

Actual Results:  
Computer restarts without warning.

Expected Results:  
At least give a warning so that I can close other programs.
