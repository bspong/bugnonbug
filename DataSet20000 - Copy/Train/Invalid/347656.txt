User-chosen homepage address is not loaded when a new browser is started

Many times, no matter what you enter in the Tools/Options/General/Homepage field, Firefox will load a different homepage when started (including when about:blank has been specified). This is not related to spyware or virii.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a browser, either by double-clicking its icon on the desktop,  left-clicking it on the fast access bar, or pushing a programmable key in your keyboard.

Actual Results:  
An unexecpected page is loaded. In my case, typical webpages are vh1.com, formula1.com or anything related to the number 1.

Expected Results:  
The user-specified homepage should be loaded.

In fact, Firefox seems to ask GOOGLE for a "I feel lucky" query with a search regarding number 1.  I'll explain: if you visit Google after the bug has appeared, enter a simple number "1" and click on "I feel lucky" button, you will ALWAYS land on the same webpage Firefox has erroneously shown as your homepage.
I think local software problems could be discarded as the bug has also appeared just after a disk formatting and a fresh (original) Windows XP Pro setup. I'm trying to reproduce the error in other computers, but somehow it could be related to my Dell Inpiron 8200 laptop, because it's strange such a noticiable bug hasn't been reported by other users.
The bug happens to me more or less 80% of the times I open a new browser.
