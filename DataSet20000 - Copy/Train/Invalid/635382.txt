App tab changes user on restart.

When multiple app tabs exist containing instances of a page logged in as different users, restarting changes all app-tabs to one user.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in to Twitter with login A.
2. Pin the page as an App Tab.
3. In a new tab, log in to Twitter as a different user (user B). (I do this to have a dedicated log-in for Army of Awesome tweets).
4. Pin the second page as an App Tab.
5. Restart Minefield.
6. Note that both Twitter app tabs are logged in as user B.
Actual Results:  
One of the app tabs has changed to be a duplicate of the other.

Expected Results:  
Both app tabs should retain the functionality they had before the restart.
