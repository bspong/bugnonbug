I just upgraded to 3.5 and the right click doesn't work, i.e it does not display right click menu. I tried different ways to fix this and found the following will work.
I have to start the browser from scratch and immediately "right click" then the right click starts working and the right click menu shows up.

Windows XP;
hardware:IBM/Lenovo T61p 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open FF 3.5, open couple of tabs..and navigate to various sites in each tab
2. try to right click on any link within those tabs.
3. nothing happens.
