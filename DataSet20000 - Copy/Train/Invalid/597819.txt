browser freeze on loading applet in Java 6 / 64-bit on OSX 10.5

Firefox locks up when opening a page that includes a java applet, if OSX 10.5 Java preferences is set to only allow use of Java SE 6 64-bit in web-browsers.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Applications/Utilities/JavaPreferences.app
2. Select "Run applets: Within the browser process" (I have not tested with "in their own process" selected)
3. Drag "Java SE 6     64-bit" to the top of the preference order (in the upper list box, used by web browsers)
4. Uncheck "J2SE 5.0     32-bit" and "J2SE 5.0     64-bit" and any other options other than "Java SE 6    64-bit" in the upper list box
5. Close Java Preferences
6. Open Firefox (if open, close and re-open Firefox)
7. Open any page that contains a Java applet, for example http://java.sun.com/applets/jdk/1.4/demo/applets/ArcTest/example1.html
Actual Results:  
Browser hangs, completely stops responding. The loading icon freezes, and it is not possible to select a different browser tab. Hang is not detected by the operating system, Firefox must be terminated by opening Activity Monitor (Applications/Utilities/ActivityMonitor.app), double clicking the Firefox process, clicking "quit", and then "force quit" to kill the process. No crash report is generated.


At least for users of OSX 10.5, this is only likely to affect Java applet developers that are guaranteeing that their applets load in Java 6 by leaving it as the only option in Java preferences, resetting the preference order to the default solves the issue (though I have not tested with an applet that requires Java 6).

Firefox did not hang last spring under the same settings, so it was likely introduced in a recent version, must have been at least after the middle of May. It may be related to bug 290671, which describes a browser freeze in Linux when loading a Java applet; however, that bug indicates that processor usage spikes in association with the freeze, which is not the case here (CPU usage remained around 5%, Firefox normally uses between 5% and 45% on my system, depending on number of tabs open and their contents), so it may be a different problem.

Google Chrome is still able to load java applets without crashing under these same settings, so it is not a universal issue with using Java 6.0 for web-browsers under Mac OS 10.5 (assuming Chrome honors those settings).
