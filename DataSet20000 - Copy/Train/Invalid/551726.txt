Debug builds still trip bug 546909 -  Firefox should not load chrome URLs dragged from plugins
Bug 546909 -  Firefox should not load chrome URLs dragged from plugins was just fixed for all branches but it turns out that on 1.9.0 and 1.9.1, the bug is still tripped in debug builds. The retail builds are fine but someone should investigate why the debug builds are still susceptible since it is an SG:Critical bug.

The testcase is in bug 546909.
