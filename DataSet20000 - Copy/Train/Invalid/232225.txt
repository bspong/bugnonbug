When 2 tabs refer to the same animated gif, closing 1 tab causes the gif on the other tab to stop animating

When more than 1 tab contains the same animated gif, which is pretty common as
in the signature portion of any bbs forum, they both (i guess) show the same
instance of the gif and closing one of the tabs stops the gif from playing in
all other tabs that contain it.
(If they are in 2 different windows, OK if I close one of the windows, but not
if I close the tab in one of the windows)
(btw, they shouldn't be playing the same frame if I open them at different time
- a different bug?)
(Not sure though about other embeded object like avi, rm, mp3...)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open an animated gif, locally or on the internet
2. Open it again on another tab
3. Close 1 of the tabs

Actual Results:  
The animated gif on the tab stops playing

Expected Results:  
The animated gif should keep playing (animating)
