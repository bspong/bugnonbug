3.1b + 3.5b4 regression: Images nested inside <UL> in <FIELDSET> in <DIV> renders incorrectly with @media

This looks like a regression in 3.1b and 3.5b4:

Multiple images in <LI>s of a <UL>, nested inside a <FIELDSET> in a <DIV> renders incorrectly, by stacking the images on top of eachother, and outside the boundary of the fieldset. This is from a live forum website (not mine).

The attached index.html and my.css, and two large screenshots that make up the minimum example I've been able to reproduce with. Removing either @media or thumbview from the css fixes the problem, as does any of the <div> and/or <fieldset>, or class definition of the fieldset, from the html.

The attached example works fine with FF 2.0.0.x and 3.0.x, but not with 3.1b and 3.5b4.

Right-clicking and "view image" shows full image correctly. As does clicking to drag image. This leads me to think this is a rendering issue in this specific nesting scenario.

I've tried looking for similar bugs, but found none that matched this exact scenario. I apologize if I missed it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. put attached example on a webserver
2. visit page with FF 3.5b4
3. Look at images
4. visit page with FF 2.0.0.x
5. Look at images
Actual Results:  
In 3) the images are stacked on top of each other, by ~200 pixels, and exceed the bounds of the fieldset.

Expected Results:  
Expected 5) where images stack correctly, below each other due to size
