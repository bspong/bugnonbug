I have Firefox 3.0 installed on 3 PCs at home... an old Windows XP Home machine with 512 Mb RAM, a Windows Vista Notebook, and an old Windows XP Professional machine... *only* on the Windows XP Professional machine do I experience a severe memory leak when running Firefox 3.0... it makes the machine quickly unusable as the working memory dwindles down to less than 10Mb and Firefox will start sucking up to 250Mb and more.  This can happy with several tabs or just a few... almost always, I have one tab open to Gmail.

This memory leak is making Firefox 3.0 unusable on my Windows XP Professional machine...  I have to use IE or Safari.
