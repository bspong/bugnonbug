Hi,

first off, thanks for a GREAT product!

Since release 2.0.0.4 has automatically been installed I experience problems when the yahoo.com shortcuts are to be displayed.

This is: special words or http links are underlined with dotted line and  a local scripted menu appears if one is hovering over it.
These menus are now not correctly drawn. Maybe their scripts are buggy...

Thanks again
Uwe
