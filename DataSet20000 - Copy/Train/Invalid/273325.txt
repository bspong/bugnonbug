Cisco NetAcad (http://cisco.netacad.net) includes a gradbook feature, with links
to click on exams you have already taken to review the questions (see the
answers).  The links do not load properly in FF on OSX 10.3.6.  This is hard to
fix because it requires a login and password to see the page the bug is on.  The
links just are not there on any OS X browser (including Opera, Camino, Mozilla,
IE, or Safari), and also Firefox.  But on the windows side, IE, Opera and
Firefox all load the links just fine.

By loading the links I mean the browser does not show that any link should even
be there at all.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. login to website
2. go to your class, click on gradebook
3. there should be verticle links that say things like Module 1 Exam, Module 2 Exam

Actual Results:  
no links found

Expected Results:  
to find the links so i can click them
