Quality Feedback Agent suddenly appeared without warning. Never seen it before
and  was I was wary.  Made a note of how to access the program and pressed
'cancel' key.  Computer crahed within seconds.  Two important pieces of text in
gmail and a bulletin board with a number of hyperlinks to various websites
(which had taken over an hour to draft) were lost as a result

Reproducible: Didn't try




Whole computer froze after QFA ' cancel key pressd - do not remember seeing any
warning - but unable to see all that was 'live' due to freeze

My gmail accoun was open at the time - but I've never had a problem previously
running it with Firefox.  Draft e-mail was lost

I had a number of websites open plus Photoshop Elements 3.0 and was in the
process of transferring web-sized images to a post for a thread - this has never
caused a problem before - I do it frequently.  Draft post was lost.
