When I go to the Add-ons Manager while using Sandboxie - Minefield Crashes
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:2.0b8pre) Gecko/20101020 Firefox/4.0b8pre

THIS IS NOT THE SAME BUG AS Bug 601355!
Anyways, I run the program Sandboxie at www.sandboxie.com
This program sandboxes whatever program is run within it. It is quite stable and I'm running the latest version 3.50.
When I try to run Firefox Sandboxed it crashes immediately when I go to the Add-ons Manager.
I also disabled Java-script and all Add-ons it still crashes when going to the add-ons manager.
If I start a SANDBOXED Minefield in Safe Mode, the Add-On Manager loads properly.

I cannot use the latest minefield with sandboxie because the add-ons do not work. Sandboxie does not crash at all. I will report the problem to www.sandboxie.com as well, but this is possibly a Minefield problem too. 

A lot of people use Sandboxie so Firefox should investigate the problem!!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run Minefield with the program Sandboxie
2.Go to Tools-Add-ons or Ctrl-Shift-A
3.Minefield crashes
Actual Results:  
Minefield crashes with the following report:

Expected Results:  
Add-ons Manager should load properly. It shouldn't crash.

Sandboxie is a free unlimited download which is popular. Please just try to see why this is crashing because Sandboxie has been totally stable for everything else including older versions of Minefield! This is possibly related to bug#601355 because before that problem started, Sandboxie and Minefield working fine together. But then I couldn't use Minefield for 3 weeks until the Javascript bug was finally fixed. So I don't exactly know which build this particular problem started. I'm saying this is critical because I won't use a web browser unless it is sandboxed and right now, I can't use any add-ons because the add-on manager crashes with Sandboxie running.
