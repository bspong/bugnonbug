The Adobe Acrobat toolbar button to convert a viewed web page to a PDF document
does not display. Note: this is not the Acrobat READER, which requires no
toolbat button, but instead this is the PDF MAKER toolbar button. A toolbar
button is required to manually launch the PDF maker when the user (that's me)
decides to convert a web page to a PDF document.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Mozilla (that's all - just start it)

Actual Results:  
The PDF Maker toolbar button does not appear

Expected Results:  
Display the PDF Toolbar button on one of the toolbars, or at least give me the
option in "Customize Toolbar" to find the button there, and drag it to a toolbar
of my choice.

I have Adobe Acrobat Professional 6 running on this WinXP Home machine.
