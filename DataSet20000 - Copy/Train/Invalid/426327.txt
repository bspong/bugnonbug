The HTML code in the link is of the general form

<!-- comment header for week N -->
<tr> Lecture information for week N. </tr>
<!-- comment header for week N+1 -->
<tr> Lecture informatino for week N+1. </tr>
<!-- comment header for week N+2 -->

etc. Firefox (minefield) matches the start of the comment tag for week N with the end of the comment tag for week N+1, effectively hiding every other row of the table.
