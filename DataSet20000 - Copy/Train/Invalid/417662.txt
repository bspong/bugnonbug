When a div that uses the margin property to set all margins (e.g. margin:20px;) and one of the margins is overridden (e.g. margin-top:0px) and has a floating child then the overridden margin doesn't seem to have any effect.  (even using the margin property to set all of the borders (e.g. margin:0px 20px 20px 20px) by itself doesn't seem to work).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. set up a div with the css margin setting and then change the top margin(e.g. margin:20px;margin-top:0px;)
2. set up a div within the second div with the css float property (e.g. float:left)
3. Put some plain text in the child div
Actual Results:  
Text is 20px from the top and 20px from the left

Expected Results:  
Text is 0px from the top and 20px from the left
