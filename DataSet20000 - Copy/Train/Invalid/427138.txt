Encountered this odd bug today. It is not present in other browsers/OSes I've tested (IE, FF2, FF3/Win, Safari). The first instance of a vimeo embedded video on a Tumblr page does not appear in FF3b5. If you create another Vimeo video then the original will appear. If you create another the first two appear, etc. Other video embed services do not seem to be affected. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a video post in Tumblr using Vimeo as your source.
2. Visit the Tumblr site in FF 3b5/Mac

Actual Results:  
The video doesn't show up. Nothing is there. Using another browser, it will be there. Loading the page locally, it will be there.

Expected Results:  
There should have been a video in the post.

I have found these three sites are affected. There are probably others.

(If you view source you will see there is a Vimeo video immediately before the one that displays that is not displaying)
