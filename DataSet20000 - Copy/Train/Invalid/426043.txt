Firefox3b4, Setting value of Browser.tabs.close.buttons as "0" won't disable close button on active tab. This will only disable close buttons on inactive tabs. 
In Fx2 it worked as expected, setting value "0" would hide all close buttons. (I'm closing tabs only by using middle mouse button) 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set value of Browser.tabs.close.buttons as "0" using about:config
2. Open few tabs
3. See close button on active tab
Actual Results:  
Close button on active tab is visible. 

Expected Results:  
All close buttons on all tabs should be hidden.

Tested on default theme (openSUSE10.3 kde icons symlinked to gtk icons for gtk apps, ugly as hell in Fx) and Phoenity Aura 0.2.1
