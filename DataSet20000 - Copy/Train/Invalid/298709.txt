When using a directive of: <!--#include virtual="../inc/topbarExplore.inc" -->,
it comes up blank - Firefox will not load the .inc or even .html file when it's
included as "include virtual" or "include file"

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.insert <!--#include virtual="../inc/topbarExplore.inc" --> in HTML code within
a table
2.save, and refresh (also Ctr F5)
3. file (topbarExplore.inc or tobarExplore.html) will not load within the
existing HMTL page, just appears blank.

Actual Results:  
I have an empty space where the 'topbarExplore.inc or .html' is to appear

Expected Results:  
loaded the .inc or .html file. It works with IE, is it not supposed to also work
with Firefox?
