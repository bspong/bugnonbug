Minefield 4.0b10pre will not save session after browser is closed with multiple tabs

When you have multiple tabs opened in Mozilla Minefield 4.0b10pre and you completely close the browser you never get asked if you want to save your session.  It just completely closes itself out.  So then when you open the browser again. It starts a whole brand new session so you have to back track and find the sites you previously visited.  Now if you open more then one tab and accidentally delete a tab you can restore that tab provided its in the same session and you don't close out the browser.  Please fix this problem...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open more then 1 tab and go to 2 different sites on each of the tabs.  It don't matter what site you go to.
2.Click the X in the upper right hand corner of the screen.  You will not get asked if you want to save your session.
3.Open the browser back up and the tabs you had opened up are gone.  your session was not saved.
Actual Results:  
My session was not saved when I had multiple tabs opened and it went straight to my home page with 1 tab with a new session instead of opening my same session back up with the same tabs so I could finish where I left off being I had multiple tabs opened up.

Expected Results:  
If I have multiple tabs opened up  and I click the X in the upper right hand corner of the screen to close out the whole browser it is supposed to let me know that I have more then 1 tab opened up and ask me if I want to save my session.  That it did not do...
