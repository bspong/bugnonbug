Full page zoom fails to work on gmail.com and it causes it to truncate rendering.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9a8pre) Gecko/2007080416 Minefield/3.0a8pre

When I surf to https://gmail.com if I view it without full page zoom it views fine, when I goto 1x, about half the screen is cut off. If I view it at 2x full page zoom the size of the viewable rendering is cut to about 1/4 page size.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Update minefield
2.Download extension to assist with full page zoom: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=389628#c19
3.Go to gmail.com, login
4.Hit zoom


Expected Results:  
Full screen render with zoom
