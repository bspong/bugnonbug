The Capture Selection or the Capture Page would not work after I upgraded to
v1.04 went back to v1.01.  They show in the right click menu and also from the
memu bar, but nothing happens. 
 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Upgraded from your web site, installed
2.Went to a web page and highlighted a paragraph.
3.right click and choose, capture selection.  Didn't get my Scrap book save box

Actual Results:  
in v1.04 nothing happens. you do not get the scrap book save box

Expected Results:  
should give me the scrap book save box that I use daily. Uninstalled V1.04
reinstalled 1.01 works fine

I looked throug all the bugs and didn't see this one I hope I'm not the only one
having it.
