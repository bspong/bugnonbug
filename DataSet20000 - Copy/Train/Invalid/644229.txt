Firefox 4 doesn't work
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.16 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/10.0.648.151 Safari/534.16
Build Identifier: Firefox 4

After update to Firefox 4 connection to the internet is extremely slow and faulty. I tried Chrome and things worked just fine. I checked Firewall settings already - that's not the problem. RSVP 

Reproducible: Always
