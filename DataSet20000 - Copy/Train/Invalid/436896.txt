shows a most of these reports are at start up and this comment confirms:

     PicLens 1.6.4.3021 extension causing crash at start up (disabled it, starts fine, enable it, fails)

     Just installed and was launching FF3.

     just installed and started for the first time. it prompted me with a bunch of disabled add ons, so i hit the check for updates. found new Aero-fox theme, and cool-iris preview add on. installed them, then on the restart, it crashed before it opened

The first comment indicates the older version has problems which I believe is a known problem.  we should condider blocklisting the old version on firefox 3 installs.

http://www.cooliris.com/site/support/download-all-products.php  seems to indicate that both firefox 3 and firefox 2 versions are now available, but that last comment raises the possibility that the older version might be being served up to firefox 3 users, or there is also compatibility problems with the newer version as well.
