Firefox does not open pages on a MS SharePoint services site (Intranet)

Our company uses MS SharePoint service for our intranet document vault and other items on the intranet. The previous version worked fine. The IT department has just "upgraded" to the latest version of MS SharePoint service. Now if I attempt to open the page I am asked for a username and password. There aren't any, and I can't access the pages anymore with FireFox. Of course IE works fine. I suspect that MS has written some form of non-compliant bug into the latest SP Services to keep FireFox from working.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Try to browse to our intranet Sharepoint site.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
A dialog box opens asking for Username/password. 

Expected Results:  
The page should simply open without requesting any additional information.
