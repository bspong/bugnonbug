plugin container was the worst option for the Firefox browser in 10 years. Unfortunately I have to use with Chrome, until replaced by a smart solution. Hundreds of people also can not use Firefox for the same reason and not inform his decision.
In fact, this problem undermines the productivity of this wonderful tool. I regret that some choices are made without a deeper appreciation of their consequences. Firefox was already very heavy and became even more with this plugin, developers have forgotten that we need to use other programs.
