I've tried searching, and the only result close to mine were either for a different platform, or for image copy in Minefield.

If you copy any text on a website, quit Firefox (Command Q), the information on your clipboard is lost.  A very, very annoying bug.

Happens if you copy, or cut.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Copy any text from a webpage, or even the web site URL.
3. Quit Firefox
4. Open up Textpad (or any other program), and paste the text.
Actual Results:  
Nothing at all shows up.

Expected Results:  
The copied text.

I have tried in Safe Mode, and the issue is still there.
