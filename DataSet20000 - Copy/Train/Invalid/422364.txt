When scrolling down the right hand pane of the linked web page sometimes black lines are left in the scrolled area. More frequent is if you hover your mouse over the links on the left you get an underline, when you move away the line is left. This only happens when the page zoom is greater than 100%. I have not changed my zoom steps and I need to zoom in 2 steps before I see this bug on the left hand pane. Zooming in too far stops the bug from being visible.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to page
2. Zoom in by using ctrl + mousewheel up two notches (ctrl ++ zooms in too far)
3. Hover mouse over links on the left
Actual Results:  
Rendering is incorrect - underlines on the links are left when they should disappear.

Expected Results:  
Page should render the same as zoomed to 100%
