Firefox has startedto use to muc resources of the pc. It uses up 100.000 kb memory and up to 50 percent of the CPU time sometimes, and thats on a pc with a hyperthreaded pentum 4 3.2 Ghz cpu and 2 GB of DDR memory! And in the end firefox + plus the pc stops responding. Now i have also tried this from work and the same thing happens. If you have 2 - 3 tabs open fixe fox uses a extensive  lot of memory plus CPU time and this cannot be a normal thing. In older versions i did not have this issues... Firefox has become a real nasty resoucehog!
