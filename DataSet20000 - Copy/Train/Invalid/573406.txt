Attempting to move a tag to another window creates a new tab instead.

When I attempt to move a tab to another window the tab stays on the source window and a new tab gets created in the destination window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Position the two windows so that the top of the source window is lower on the screen than the destination window
2. Drag a tab from the source window to the destination window
Actual Results:  
The tab stays on the source window and a new tab gets created in the destination window.

Expected Results:  
placed the tab on the destination page and removed it from the source window.

I have 11 windows open all having quite a few tabs. I'm also using the BarTab add-on.
