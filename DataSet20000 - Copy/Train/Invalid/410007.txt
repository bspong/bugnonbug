Firefox 3 beta 1 is a memory hog when opening multiple tabs compared to ver 2.0.0.11 and it dowsn't release it until the last tab is closed

Firefox 3 beta 1 uses 2x as much memory for a 5 tab window (~120,000) as Firefox 2.0.0.11 (~60,000. In Firefox 3, when I close the windows very little memory is released until I close the last one when all of it is released. I opened tabs to the same sites in both versions. All else was the same.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open firefox to gmail mailbox
2. open thesaurus.reference.com in new tab
3. open nytimes.com in new tab
4. open sfgate.com in new tab
5. open speedtest.net in new tab
Actual Results:  
124,000 bytes memory 
Closing 1 tab at a time has almost no effect on memory usage

Expected Results:  
58,000 bytes memory (in ver 2.0.0.11_

used less memory to start with and released it incrementally when shutting down tabs.
