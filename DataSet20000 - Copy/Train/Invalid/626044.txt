Since upgrading to Firefox 4 beta 9 after starting Firefox arrows on back and forward buttons are hidden when using small icons, buttons (borders) are visible. Opening any website causes back arrow to appear, after clicking back button, arrow on forward button appears too. If I open add-ons menager or Customize Toolbar window both arrow appears. Arrows are displayed till restarting firefox. Problem didn't occurs when using big (normal size) icons (so in safe mode also) or Firefox has been started with more then one tab opened.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
Actual Results:  
Arrows on forward and back buttons aren't visible

Expected Results:  
Arrows on forward and back buttons are visible

Problem occurs with all add-ons disabled and with default theme.
