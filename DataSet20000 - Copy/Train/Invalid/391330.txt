Web pages / documents which are not w3c standards compliant are displayed as opposed to the logic behind bug #25537 (according to it, non-compliant pages should be hidden)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. navigate to any page which has at least one html error or non-compliant feature or perhaps uses bad grammar or spelling

Actual Results:  
the page is displayed as if it didn't contain errors

Expected Results:  
if the logic used to rationalize bug #25537 is correct, the page should not be displayed
