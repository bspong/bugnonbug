Asking the user for confirmation when deleting private data
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070725 Firefox/2.0.0.6

At the moment, it is possible to delete private data either on demand (<Ctrl><Shift><Del>) or when Firefox will be terminated. It is also possible to specify what kind of data will be deleted and if the user has to confirm the deletion or not.

However, when the confirmation option is turned on, the user also will be asked for confirmation when closing Firefox. In my opinion, this is inconvenient. The confirmation option should be in effect only for the deletion on demand. Furthermore, it should be possible to choose separately, what data will be deleted when closing Firefox and what data will be deleted when the user demands it. In short, both cases should be handled independently.
