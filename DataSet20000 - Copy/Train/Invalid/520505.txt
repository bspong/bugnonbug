When trying to go to a website, a message saying 'Alert. URL is not valid' is displayed and the page does not load. This happened to all web pages (including mozilla.com). This also happens when I go to my homepage - iGoogle. This only happens when opening Firefox (and going to my homepage) or in Private Browsing.
