When prompted to save a file in Firefox 3.0+ I often hit "Shift+AppleKey+D" to quickly browse to the desktop to save my file. However, in Firefox 3.0 this command makes all Firefox windows unclickable and requires a hard force quit of the program. Shift+Apple+D works fine in Firefox 2.0.

2. Hit shift apple D to save to desktop.
3. Can't click any firefox window.
Actual Results:  
Firefox becomes unresponsive.

Navigated to the desktop folder in the browser window.
