Problem deals with displaying a popup window (left click on icon). This works fine in FF 3.0.12.  However using FF 3.0.13 the link does not work and displays "javascript:(void);" on the status bar and the expected popup window does not occur. The major window has 3 catagories of icons that allow a left click to bring up a popup. Of the 3 catagories, 2 work fine but the 3 results in "javascript:(void);"  The web site (http://suntrust.com)is a secure site and requires use ID and pass word to enter.  Also IE works fine
