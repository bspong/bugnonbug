Lost Bookmarks and some setting after upgarding NoScript to 1.1.6.06 on Firefox 2.0.0.5
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: SP2

When I opened Firefox (2.0.0.5) I got a prompt to upgrade NoScript to 1.1.6.06. Allowed this upgrade and restarted Firefox as requested/prompted. On restart a number of thing have changed. 
1. The Bookmark tool bar is empty, and does not allow me to re-add links.
2. Using a bookmark from the dropdown does nothing. I had to add the bookmark icon from the options, click on it (opens a sidebar with the bookmarks on it) and use these entries.
3. Because I can't use the bookmark toolbar I un-checked it, and promptly lost all my bookmarks.

I then deleted and removed Firefox and Noscript, did a re-install at 2.0.0.3, but got the same results.
Tried a download of 2.0.0.5 from the website and installed, but still the same.
Firefox is now as useable as IE, so don't know what to use (although latest IE looks better)

Questions are :-
a) How can I get the personalised toolbar back for bookmarks ?
b) Why are the bookmarks listed on the dropdown menu not working ?
c) Why does NoScript always cause these type of issues when it is upgraded (happened last upgrade, but I managed to recover OK)
