SIGSEV on load in libgklayout.so
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.1; Linux)
Build Identifier: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firebird/releases/0.6.1/MozillaFirebird-0.6.1-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz

When I opened a page from some google search results in a new tab Firebird crashed, 
and wouldn't start again.  If I try from the console it just returns without any output.  I 
ran MozillaFirebird --debug, ran it, and got this output:

Nothing

I've tried newer builds, and nightly builds all with the same result.  I did update some 
libraries recently, but firebird didn't crash for days afterward.  I have also tried removing
