 No matter what you do, the "Recently Closed Tabs" menu is "locked up", I don't know why this is.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Just look at History>Recently Closed Tabs
Actual Results:  
"Locked up"

Expected Results:  
Allow me to open a recently closed tab.

I have no idea if it's just me or not, nor do I know how to tell.
