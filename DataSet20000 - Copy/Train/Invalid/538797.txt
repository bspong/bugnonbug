CTRL + Reload Click SHOULD Force Refresh; Creates New Tab Instead :-(

Recently Firefox changed the behavior of holding down CTRL while clicking "Reload" to make it open the page in a new tab.  This is incredibly frustrating for everyone who used Firefox up until this point, as the old behavior under those conditions was to force-refresh the page.

While this change may have been deliberate, a "feature" that only a developer feels is a feature, and everyone else feels is a bug, is not a feature, it's a bug.  If you visit the link I included in the URL field, you will see that many other users feel similarly (and there would very likely be many more posts in that thread, if the moderator hadn't closed it!).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Hold down CTRL
2. Click "Reload"
3. Be annoyed
Actual Results:  
New tab is opened

Expected Results:  
Page is force-reloaded (ie. reloaded without relying on the cache)

Please, you guys have taken enough of a beating lately from Chrome, Safari, etc. that you should not be wasting your time alienating the users who got you to the incredible market share you have today.  Don't just ignore everyone who disagrees with you, and instead LISTEN to your users, because they are trying to tell you that this change is unwanted and should be reverted.
