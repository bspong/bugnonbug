Additional label in "Clear Recent History" dialog
Bug 453440 has refactored the "Clear Recent History" dialog (see attachment #346535).
As a localizer, I would like to ask to add one more localizable string there, like this:

_Remove_ [my history for today  v] __

That label should be right after the drop-down. I would really want to add a word "about" there. Meanwhile the en-US version could leave it blank, or add a colon there.

Assigning to Johnathan, because it's a follow-up for his bug.
