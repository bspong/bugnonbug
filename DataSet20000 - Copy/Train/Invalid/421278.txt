I have both FireFox 2 and firefox3 beta3 installed in my system . 
when I closed firefox3 beta3 with multiple tabs open .. it asked me to save the tabs, which I replied with yes and when I ran again it again I launched FF2 by mistake and closed it .. and then I launched FF3 again .. saved tabs were not there .

I guess I know  happened here.. when I launched FF2 it loaded the tabs saved by ff3 and when I closed it the saved Tabs were destroyed and were not available for FF3. 

So It could be a problem for those who still have FF2 installed .

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open some links in multiple tabs in FF3 beta 3. 
2.Close FF3 beta3 and click on yes to save tabs. 
3.open FF2 and the saved tabs will load , 
4. Close FF2 .
5.Open FF3 and the saved tabs are not there.
Actual Results:  
The saved tabs were not present in FF3 beta .

Expected Results:  
1. The tabs saved when FF3 is closed should not be available in FF2 and vice versa .
2. Closing FF2 should not affect saved Tabs of FF3 and vice versa.

I have mentioned Firefox 2 as FF2 and Firefox 3 beta 3 as FF3.
