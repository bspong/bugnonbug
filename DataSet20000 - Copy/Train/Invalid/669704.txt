Multiple Instances of a Single Page in Back Button History
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.2.18) Gecko/20110614 Firefox/3.6.18

Steps to reproduce:

This occurs on many sites, but www.failblog.org is a good example.  Call this "Page 1".

Go to the that site.  Click on any of the "blog" entries to go to the detailed article.  Call this "Page 2"

Click the BACK button.  You should go back to "Page 1", but you don't -> "Page 2" refreshes.

Click and hold the BACK button until the history dropdown displays.  You will see multiple instances "Page 2" there.



Actual results:

The end result is that pressing BACK once will not take you back to the main page.  It will refresh the current page.  In order to actually go back, you must hold down the BACK button, and select the root page in the dropdown, several items down.

I have seen several instances of this in BugZilla, but they are from 2000 and 2005.

I have since downgraded back to 3.6.18, and this issue does NOT appear -> it first appeared in 4.0 when I upgraded.


Expected results:

Clicking BACK should have brought me back to "Page 1".

There should not be multiple instances of "Page 2" in the back button history.

I am on the Mac version.
