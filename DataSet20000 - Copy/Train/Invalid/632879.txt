In the previous beta versions, a "group tabs" button used to appear at the horizontally-opposite side of the tabs (i.e.: at the right side of the tab-bar if using a LTR language). this button doesn't appear in this version (version 4.0beta10).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
open the browser
Actual Results:  
the "group tabs" button doesn't appear in the tabs' bar.

Expected Results:  
seeing a "group tabs" button at the horizontally-opposite side of the tabs
(at the right side of the tab-bar if using a LTR language).

Workaround: get to this function through the "view" menu (the first option), or use a short-cut ( Ctrl + Shift + E ).
