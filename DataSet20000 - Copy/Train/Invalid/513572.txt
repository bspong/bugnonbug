When I awoke this morning and fired up Mozilla, everything had changed. My bookmarks were no longer the way I left them last night, etc.

For some reason you have updated my browser without my permission. 

Why did you do this? You have invaded my own PERSONAL PC without my permission. Would it be acceptable if I did that to you? 

How do I get back to my last version of Mozilla?????
