Gmail logs in after browser close ONLY if "Show my windows and tabs from last time" is selected, despite passwords not being remembered.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0b7) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b7
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0b7) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b7

When Preferences > Startup > When Firefox starts: "Show my windows and tabs from last time" is selected, Firefox does not remove the active Gmail login on close, so one will open a new instance of Firefox and be logged into their Gmail account. This does not happen when "Show my home page" is selected.

I am used to being able to quit Firefox with active logins, and upon repoening Firefox, *not* have my logins made active again. This is a great security feature that I believe was present in 3.6.x, and it's also something Google Chrome does as well. What if someone configures a public computer to "Show my windows and tabs from last time" (e.g., userA), then userB logs into Gmail and closes Firefox because it's always logged him out afterwards. UserA comes back, opens Firefox and finds userB's Gmail account is available for them to browse.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Preferences > Startup > When Firefox starts: "Show my windows and tabs from last time"
2. Don't have Firefox save passwords.
3. Login to Gmail (don't check "Remember Me")
4. Quit Firefox
5. Open Firefox
Actual Results:  
Gmail is opened up and logged in with my email.

Expected Results:  
Gmail is opened up, but displays the login page.

This is all on a new install of Firefox 4 b7 (no add-ons, other than the user-experience/feedback one). Passwords are *not* saved and "remember me" is not checked.
