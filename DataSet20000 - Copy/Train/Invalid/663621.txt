Hello,
when i want to login to some websites (control panels) they are IP based in url and don't have domain name the login button don't work.
such as https://173.208.88.52:8443/vz/cp/panel/plesk/frameset or https://85.17.74.14:2083/ 
Its simple login form and only needs username & password... but after i replace it with a domain name or i use another browser its work perfectly.

Best Regards
