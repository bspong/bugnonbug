A site tries to open a popup when requested and is correctly blocked. Trying to
force the popup to open anyway is not possible.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Go to www.bov.com and click login on the top right of the page. Ffox blocks it
correctly. Now try to tell it not to block it or to show it and try again. It is
not possible.

Perhaps it's because it's going to from bov.com to https://ebanking.bov.com ?
