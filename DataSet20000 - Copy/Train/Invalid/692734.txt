:first-child didn't apply w/ another child blocks before
Created attachment 565461
test-case

I have a block with few childs (different classes):
<div class="parent">
    <div class="some-child">
        Some child
    </div>

    <div class="target-child">
        Should be red
    </div>
</div>

And apply CSS as following:
.parent {
    background:green;
}

    .some-child {
        background:yellow;
    }

    .target-child:first-child {
        background:red;
    }

.target-child still didn't have background.

I'll make demo http://jsfiddle.net/PKgJL/
