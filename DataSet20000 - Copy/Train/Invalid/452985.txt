Cookie deletion adds cookies to blocked cookie list even if they're on unblocked

For the last two days when cookies are deleted they are automatically added to the blocked cookie list causing me to be unable to log in to certain websites. Deleting them from blocked cookie list only work temporarily. I readd them as "allowed" but next time cookies are deleted the "allowed" is changed to blocked again!

And to have to do this for every website visited is ridiculous as every website visited winds up on blocked cookies list when cookies are deleted and unblocking and adding them as allowed is changed back to blocked next time their cookies are deleted.

Help please!!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit gmail then delete cookie. Find it's now on blocked list: google.com, mail.google.com and www.google.com. Remove all and add them as allowed.
2. Close FF.
3. Reopen, go back to gmail, login then try to view inbox.
3. Get message saying "browser is not accepting cookies and find that it's back on blocked list.
Actual Results:  
Just what I said above.

Expected Results:  
Not added anything to my blocked cookie list, just as it has always done. Should have been able to view gmail inbox as usual. Same thing happens with ebay. But like I said, now EVERY site I visit winds up on blocked cookie list when their cookies are deleted which is unacceptable.

I don't use a theme or anything fancy that would eat memory. I have not installed anything new or changed any settings. The only updates have been to Stylish and NoScript addons in the past few days.
