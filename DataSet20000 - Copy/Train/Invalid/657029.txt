Parent-DIV incorrectly assigned child-DIV margin-top value with position "static/relative"

While developing a web page with standard HTML & CSS, setting the parent DIV and child DIV to relative/static (css-position) the parent DIV appears to have been assigned the first child DIV's margin-top value. For example, if you have a parent DIV and a child DIV, and set both to either static/relative position and set the parent-DIV margin-top to 5px and the child DIV margin-top to 100px, the margin-top for the parent-DIV will render as 100px.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. set CSS for the parent DIV to: {position: relative; margin-top: 5px;}
2. set CSS for the first child DIV to {position: relative; margin-top: 100px;} 


Actual Results:  
the top margin for the parent DIV renders as 100px to the top of the browser window, while the child DIV top margin is 0px to the top of the parent DIV. 

Expected Results:  
the top margin for the parent DIV should be 5px to the top of the browser window, while the top margin for the child DIV should be 100px to the top of the parent DIV.

I am not a CSS expert, but this behavior does not appear to be consistent or intuitive.  I tried this with Safari and it has virtually the same result, so it is possible that this behavior conforms to the standard. The HTML & CSS is included below.
