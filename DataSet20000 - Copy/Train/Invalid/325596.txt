When navigating to websites that offer affiliate programs, I have noticed that sites are "seeing" me as someone else's identity.

I fill out my own personal information in the affiliate sign up form, but I then see that I am being recognized as someone else. 

I have cleaned all cookies, used norton anti-virus and ran the latest edition of Webroot spysweeper.  No matter what I do I still see that someone named:

Joseph Vaccone - joein610

Is being credited with either referring me to that affiliate site, or is actualy being recoginzed as me.

This does not happen in other browsers like IE, so it's definitely something happening through Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit website - http://fta.firetrust.com/signup.cgi
2. View Referred by line.
3. Read who you are being referred by.


Actual Results:  
I continue to see that I am being referred by this unknown person.

Expected Results:  
Referred by should be blank.
