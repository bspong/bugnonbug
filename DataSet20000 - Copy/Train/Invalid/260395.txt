Previous versions of firefox have allowed the use of the arrow buttons for
scrolling.  This version simply jumps to the bottom of the page when the down
arrow is depressed, and won't respong to arrow up buttons.  A minor
inconvenience, but it's something that every user expects from a web browser.

this exists on every machine with this version, tested with dell laptops,
desktops and hand built machines.

using the mouse, you can scroll normally.
