I know I'll feel stupid after you guys tell me what I'm doing wrong, but I don't
know where else to look.  After typing keywords into the Firfoxe search window
and pressing "enter", Firefox opens a new tab.  I *don't* want this.  I simply
want the results to be displayed in the *current* window or tab.

My TABBED BROWSING setting are:

LINKS "Load web browser links into a - New Window"

USER INTERFACE "Search from the search bar (checked) - Load this in the foreground"

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type something into the search window in Firefox version 1.4.1 Beta 2
2. Hit "enter"
3. New tab should be created
Actual Results:  
A new tab was created

Expected Results:  
Display results in current window or tab.
