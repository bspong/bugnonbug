Sometimes after select and dragging the TEXT in the box, the box moves
BUT sometimes select and drag on the TEXT, gives a small box outline, which  
looks like a text selection drag highlight, is dragged, and the box doesn't
move until the text highlight is released, when the box suddently moves to
be under the mouse cursor.
This later behaviour suggests that the mouse-down and mouse-move events are 
arriving at the javascript after drag release.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the attached SVG+JavaScript
2. Select the text (e.g. letter 'e') and drag
3. either box moves immediately, or a text selection moves with the cursor, and box moves when the mouse button is released.
Actual Results:  
click down on the text (e.g. letter 'e') and drag
either box moves (what I want) or text selction moves, then box moves on mouse button up

Expected Results:  
clicking down should allow box and its text to be dragged

This is also a bug in Firefox 4b8
