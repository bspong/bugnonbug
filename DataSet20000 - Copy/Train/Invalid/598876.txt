When saving webpage to PDF for future reference, normally user(s) want to use "Printer Friendly" version (without so much AD's) to export to PDF. However, we have experienced some difficulty with the page layout of PDF Download 2.0 makes.

When saving webpage to PDF for future reference, normally user(s) want to use
"Printer Friendly" version (without so much AD's) to export to PDF.
However, we have experienced some difficulty with the page layout
of PDF Download 2.0 makes.
Please try to export the following webpage to PDF, then
you will understand what we are trying to get fixed.

URL is 
http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/sep/15/inside-the-ring-145889960/print/

In these situation, would that be possible to export the web doc. to PDF
in the following way?
1). First, we download the original webpage as single archive as "MHTML"
format, then adjust the page layout.
2). Then, we export this single archive to PDF through PDF Download 2.0.

We doubt that it would work, since the item which we try to export to PDF
is no longer webpage but web archive doc.

Do you offer better version of this type of software which allows user to 
make pre-view (Druckvorschau, auf Deutsch) of PDF layout? 

Please let us know!!!
Thank you!!!
