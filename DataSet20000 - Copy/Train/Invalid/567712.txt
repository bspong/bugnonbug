2 graphic images are part of this page. image002.jpg and image003.jpg. In windows-7 only, firefox uses image002.jpg for both - totally messing up the page (image003.jpg is a background highlight image for the rest of the page outside of the area specifically for image002.jpg).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.just load the site in windows-7
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
image002.jpg was duplicated so as to fill up the entire display. Other text normally displayed was there (I think) but was a mess to find.


call it up in windows-xp or internet explorer for comparison to what it should look like.
