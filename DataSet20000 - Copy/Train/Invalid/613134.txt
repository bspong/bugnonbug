I am running a reasonably high end compter with 4 core AMD processor, 6gb Ram with Windows 7 Ulitimate. Firefox is constantly using way to much memory and with the more it gets used the memory usage increases. I have been using Firefox for many years but the latest version are to say the least are becomming more and more of a browser that I will be looking for a replacement.. I run very few addons or plugins. I think it is time you scrap the current build... go back to the drawing board and find the problem. I know I am not the only one as the web is filled with forums with people having the same issues..

I will admit that I have been using Google Chrome and find it light on resources and faster to load 

Reproducible: Always
