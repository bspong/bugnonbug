prefs.js too big, add ons should use their own files for data storage.

my prefs.js is 500kB

it crashes text editors when searching it

it makes opening firefox take too long

it makes closing firefox take too long

plugins should sqlite or their own json files, storing massive json data sets in prefs should not be allowed.

Reproducible: Always
