Hello Team,

We are not able to see any DHTML banner(expandable flash creative) in Mozilla browser. Kindly let us know why this is not compatible with Mozilla when IE does.

Thanks in advance

FYI, when I tried to preview any expandable advertisements in any site thru Mozilla, it shows Back up gif or normal flash. But thru IE, we are getting the expandable banner.
