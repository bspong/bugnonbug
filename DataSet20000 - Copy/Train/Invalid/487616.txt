Since using Firefox v3.0.8 I cannot add bookmarks either by clicking on the 'star' symbol in the web address box or by using Cntrl-D. The only way I can add a bookmark is by the long-winded way of going to Bookmarks/Organize bookmarks/add new bookmark then copying/pasting the url.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on 'star' symbol in url address box - or
2.use Ctrl-D
3.
Actual Results:  
No bookmark added.

Expected Results:  
Bookmark created.

Also have Delicious installed & active. The above actions do bring up the 'also save to delicious' box.
