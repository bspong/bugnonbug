Vaguely similar to 366977. virtually every time I click on a link to a PDF file, it'll download the file to my hard drive, then proceed to spew forth new blank windows. A rapidly repeating command-period will stop it, eventually, but not usually until 8, 10 or more windows have been generated. 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I'm not sure precisely, but it happens virtually every time I click on a PDF link, whether the link is coded to present the PDF in a browser window, or download to the HD.
2. Sorry I'm not so scientifically oriented that I can create and repeat the experiment. It happens 98% of the time, no matter the nature of the PDF link. 
3.



This has happened in the current build, and in 2.0.0.3 -- but not in the previous version or two. (I upgraded to OSX only in early January.)

I'm using an Intel Mac, OS 10.4.8. But I've been on this system, as I said, since early January, and only w/ FF 2.0.0.3 did this commence.
