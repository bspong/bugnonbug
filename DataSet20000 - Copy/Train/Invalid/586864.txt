right-click on a link menu keeps changing...

With 4.0b3, the right click on a link moved open link in new tab to the first item, and open link in new window to the second item.  This is about the 5th time these two menu items have flip-flopped their positions...  I don't really care which one is first or second, but pick one and stick with it.  Changing it on a fairly regular basis is unacceptable.

Reproducible: Always
