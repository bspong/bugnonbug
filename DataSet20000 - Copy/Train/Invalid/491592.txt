use mozBackgroundRequest for search service requests rather than implementing nsBadCertListener ourselves
We can just set mozBackgroundRequest to true on our XHR object rather than implementing nsIBadCertListener. Not a big deal, since we need the progress listener anyways, but would be good to consolidate code here, and mozBackgroundRequest seems to have other benefits.
