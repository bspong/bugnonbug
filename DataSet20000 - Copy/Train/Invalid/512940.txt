Adding bookmarks crashes Firefox when using system SQLite newer than 3.6.16
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090815 Gentoo Firefox/3.5.2

When you add a new bookmark a window pops up where you can choose a name and location.  If you click the little arrow next to 'Folder' (to display the full folder list) Firefox crashes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the Bookmarks menu and choose Bookmark this page.
2. Click the right-most button on the field named "Folder:"
3. Crash
Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes, and always says "well this is embarrassing" when reloading

Expected Results:  
The list of bookmark folders appears, like previous versions

No crash logging software seems to be installed, and I can't find instructions on how to install 'Breakpad'
