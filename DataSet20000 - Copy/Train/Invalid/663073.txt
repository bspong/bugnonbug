revoke certigna key due to public exposure of private key
http://www.thinq.co.uk/2011/6/9/certigna-publishes-ssl-private-key-mistake/

> A visit to the site's revocation list page - which is fully publicly accessible via a standard web browser - allows anyone and everyone to download the private key and other supposedly secret files, potentially enabling the creation of their own valid Certigna-signed SSL certificates.

The affected certificate is listed in Aurora under Dhimyotis -> Certigna, serial number 00:FE:DC:E3:01:0F:C9:48:FF
