On opening/running firefox system hangs and windows presents with BSOD (blue screen of death)

This bug has seemingly presented itself with subtle variations on numerous occasions, but happens probably less than 10% of the time. Probability of occurrence seems to increase when opening/running firefox after the system has been running for longer periods of time, that is to say, the bug is more likely to occur if firefox isn't started as soon as I boot up.

On opening/running firefox (a completely new instance, no other instances running) firefox window opens, toolbar is drawn, tabs are opened, but before my two home pages even begin to render, my whole computer freezes/hangs, with no input available (the mouse doesn't even respond). Most of the time the computer remains in this state with the HDD led fully lit/blinking super fast. However on other occasions windows presents with the BSOD and prints some memory dump information.

Eg.
STOP: 0x0000009c (0x00000004, 0x8054d5f0, 0xb2000000, 0x00070f0f)

Then I must restart
