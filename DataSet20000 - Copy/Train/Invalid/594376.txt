Website icons appear next to wrong website in bookmarks and RSS feeds.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0b5) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b5

I use a utility app called OnyX. After cleaning the internet cache or any related internet temp files or after a update of the Firefox 4 Beta, the browser will place icons for bookmarked websites and RSS feeds next to the wrong website. For example in my bookmark bar I'll see that Facebook has the icon for Last.fm or my RSS feed for Hipsters United is displaying the icon for Mint.com instead of the default WordPress icon as usual. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Cleaning internet temp files or cache from external app or updating Firefox 4 Beta.

Actual Results:  
Icons are appearing next to the wrong website.

Expected Results:  
Displayed different icons.
