Empty <.autoreg> and <chrome.manifest> files in Zip build

In the top <firefox> directory, of a Zip build/file (at least),
there is an empty <.autoreg> file;

and in the <firefox/extensions/talkback@mozilla.org> directory, an empty <chrome.manifest> file.

I guess they should be removed, == not packaged.
