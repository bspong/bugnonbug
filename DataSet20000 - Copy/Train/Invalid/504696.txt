When PDF files on the computer are opened as links from HTML files (opened from the computer)in Firefox during website development, Adobe Acrobat (my default for PDF files) opens in a separate window (not in Firefox as expected). I expect that this also happens with Adobe Reader. When the files are loaded on the website, they open in Adobe Acrobat in Firefox (with settings in Acrobat.
