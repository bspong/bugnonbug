Mcafee identifies Trojan JS/Wonka inside my Mozilla Profile... Path below
C:\Documents and Settings\xxxxx\Local Settings\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\iyh7who3.default\Cache
The first time the trojan was identified was when I was just doing some searches in google. Though the trojan was quarantined and deleted, later on I found my mcafee firewall was disabled. So I had to do a system restore.. but even after that I see a DOS window suddenly opening while using mozilla (not immediately after I open the browser) and then my firewall is gone...! This I suppose has got something wrong with Mozilla or the mozilla addons. I had deleted the entire mozilla folder inside application data and then made a mozilla install again. I haven't seen the trojan back again till now. Please investigate to see if it is something wrong with Mozilla or its addons..

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. You need to have mcafee virus scan enterprise, mozilla and all addons that I've installed. Can't say if you get the same trojan :-)
2.
3.
