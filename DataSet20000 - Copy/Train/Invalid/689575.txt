Disable keyboard shortcuts while tab animation is active
Build ID (current latest trunk):
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:9.0a1) Gecko/20110926 Firefox/9.0a1

This is an enhancement request in order to improve the tab animation user experience.

WHAT?
When managing tabs (i.e. dragging a tab from tab strip), shortcut keys that could interfere with tab animation should be disabled
-> ctrl+shift+w (close window)
-> ctrl+shift+e (enter panorama)
-> ctrl+shift+k (launch web console)
...
other shortcut keys.

WHY?
This request is based on the following:
1. This behavior was not possible before the landing of the Tab Animation Feature bug 455694 which means it's a regression, if not an intended behavior.
2. The use of keyboard shortcuts can lead to faulty UX (i.e. the ones in bug 689554 and bug 689566
