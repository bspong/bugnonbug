I am using Firefox in Fedora 10. Firefox crashes in many sites and the number of times that Firefox crashes has increased compared to Firefox's previous releases. However, that is not the whole point. I am not seeing a crash report beinig generated. So even if I want to submit bugs again crashes, I am not able to see the crash reports to be submitted. Generally, if an application crashes, something like a bug window comes up and has the options like "Submit the crash report to developers". I see nothing of that kind appearing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try crashing Firefox on sites like Facebook or ICICIBANK.COM
2. Next restart of Firefox only gives the option of "Previous Session" and "Start a new session".
3.
Actual Results:  
No crash reports to be submitted are generated.

Expected Results:  
A crash report, which can be submitted to developers, should be generated.

If there is any option by which I can make this thing enabled or if this bug has already been reported, I am sorry to file a bug once more. But if there is an option to enable this feature, please help me. I have looked in the toolbars etc., but I have not been successful in locating an option.
