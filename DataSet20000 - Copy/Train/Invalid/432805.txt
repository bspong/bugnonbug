I am subscribed to the mentioned URL in Google Reader.  It is a podcast with mp3's (enclosures or something?).

When I browse to it, Firefox's CPU shoots up into the 90%'s and stays there until I browse to another feed.

I've tested this on FF3b5 in safe mode too with same results.

Reproducible: Always
