This is currently the only thing keeping me from switching fully to Firefox from AvantBrowser. Typically I have a LOT of tabs open for my various research projects that I like to come back to the next day, without having to browse through favorites or history to figure out which ones I was reading. Avant has a feature that saves all open tabs, and then when you next open the browser, it gives you a list of what you had open. You can uncheck the ones you don't want, which is also very handy. 

Reproducible: Always
