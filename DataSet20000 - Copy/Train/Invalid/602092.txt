AeroPeek combines multiple instances of Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b6) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b6) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b6

I run two versions of Firefox using a duplicate program folder and the -no-remote flag. This allows me to update them separately and makes Windows 7 show them as two different taskbar items.

When I hover over either one, a combination of tabs from both instances are shown instead of just the tabs from that instance. Really it shouldn't even require a copy of the program folder. Just using -no-remote should give you two different lists when using AeroPeek.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Open Firefox using -no-remote
3. View AeroPeek on the Windows 7 taskbar.
Actual Results:  
Tabs from the two instances are combined and appear in both AeroPeek menus.

Expected Results:  
Only tabs from that instance appear in the corresponding AeroPeek menu.
