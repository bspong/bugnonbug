Spurious Security warning?
https://www.hanes.com/HanesCommerce/en-US/Accounts/Login/?returnURL=https%3a%2f%2fwww.hanes.com%2fHanesCommerce%2fen-US%2fCheckout%2fCheckoutShipping%2f%3fCatalogNavigationBreadCrumbs%3d
has the problem; the page source code has only this form action:

<form name="Login" method="post" action="Login.aspx?NRMODE=Published&amp;NRORIGINALURL=%2fHanesCommerce%2fen-US%2fAccounts%2fLogin%2f%3freturnURL%3dhttps%253a%252f%252fwww%2ehanes%2ecom%252fHanesCommerce%252fen-US%252fAccounts%252fMyAccount%2ehtm&amp;NRNODEGUID=%7b05B43DB9-9A3A-4C66-9BF2-2954AC1D1312%7d&amp;NRCACHEHINT=Guest&amp;returnURL=https%3a%2f%2fwww.hanes.com%2fHanesCommerce%2fen-US%2fCheckout%2fCheckoutShipping%2f%3fCatalogNavigationBreadCrumbs%3d" id="Login">

The page with the form is secure (https://, and the link is relative, so it should be submitting securely, right?  So why is FF2 giving me a warning?

Is FF2 defective, or hanes.com? 

I got this message after entering a (munged) credit card # and clicking to proceed as well! 
The warnings indicate I'm submitting my userid and password and mailing address over an unencrypted connection, and credit card info over an unencrypted connection as well!

Here's Hanes' response and my query:
