after installing latest update the shortcut created brings you to a blank page
and none of the menu items are accessible. the URL box cannot be accessed. Looks
like a normal page otherwise apart from nothing functioning - with the exception
of the "updates available" button! My home page is www.google.co.uk and in the 
bar at the bottom it does show this, but again - nothing on the page. Running in
safe mode and from a safe mode desktop shortcut restores everything and seems to
be perfectly useable.
This was a clean install with the old version removed and the program files
folder deleted before starting the update.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run from the installed desktop shortcut or the start menu by double clicking
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Firefox opened but nothing useable on the page (apart from the updates available
button.

Expected Results:  
opened as expected
