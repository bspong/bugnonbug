Sync notification bar borders don't match recent bottombox changes

Patch

This fixes the border and close button alignment of the sync bar in all Windows themes, and leaves it as a gray infobar per discussion in #ux.

I believe that at least this part should block (although hopefully this bar shouldn't appear very often after bug 600261).
