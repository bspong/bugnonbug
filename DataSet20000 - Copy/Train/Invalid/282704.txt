Some of the HTML tags properties are not implemented in firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

I am an advanced web designer and I have a hard time making websites look alike
under MSIE and Firefox. There are many HTML tag properties which I would like to
use but Firefox does not interpret.

Here are some examples that I would like to use:
1)bordercolordark and bordercolorlight for example in
<TABLE width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"
bordercolordark="#EAEAEA" bordercolorlight="#FFFFFF">
2)the 'color' attribute is not interpreted in:
<hr color=red>


Reproducible: Always
