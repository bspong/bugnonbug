"Load images for originating website only" resets itself to checked state

I noticed that images sometimes display and sometimes not (this was not the case
with FF 9 on the same PC), on different sites and unpredictably. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch the browser, go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria#Regions or
another page whose images are contained on a different server.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
The only system found out so far is that "Load images for originating website
only" is always checked and if unchecked manually, resets itself at the very
latest upon restarting the browser, sometimes also during browsing. Immediately
after the manual uncheck, images load all right. If chosen using View image from
the context menu, they load OK until the self-reset occurs.

Expected Results:  
Images load all the time on all sites (sounds kinda mission statement ;-)

for other people's observations.

The bug was first noticed after a software re-installation and upgrade from XP
to XP SP1. No observation on FF 0.9 behavior under XP SP1 (I upgraded). Not
verified on other OS/machines for lack of such ressource.
