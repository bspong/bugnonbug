Hi,

I am running SAS tutorials that use files on my hard disk with active content.  It uses a bowser for delivery.  When I click on a item I get a very delayed response and when I checked the java console I got the following:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIDOMNSHTMLInputElement.selectionEnd]"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://autocopy/content/autocopyOverlay.js :: autocopyOnMouseUp :: line 396"  data: no]

The tutorial works fine in IE so I think this is a firefox setting problem.  It also seems that somewhere firefox is trying to go to mrsapo.com and getting timed out.  I think this is related to the slow response but can't figure out where to look for mrsapo.com - it was a toolbar but I can't locate it in firefox anymore,

Reproducible: Always
