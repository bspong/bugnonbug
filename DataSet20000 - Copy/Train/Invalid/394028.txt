The checkbox "cookies" in the dialog to delete private data does not remember status when it once has been checked

It is very annoying always having to check this checkbox again everytime i want to delete my personal data. It would be better if it remembered the status it had the last time one deleted personal data. I think in previous versions of Firefox this problem did not exist.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Dialog to delete personal Data (Dont know the accurate name in English versions)
2. Check the Checkbox next to "Cookies" and close the dialog
3. Open the dialog again
Actual Results:  
When you open the dialog again that box is not checked anymore

Expected Results:  
The checkbox should be checked, because it has been checked before and it is very likely that i want to delete my cookies again (because i wanted so before).

This is also true for someone who does not want to delete cookies (If he did not want so last time he seems to prefer to keep his cookies).

I expected Firefox to remeber the status of the checkbox.
