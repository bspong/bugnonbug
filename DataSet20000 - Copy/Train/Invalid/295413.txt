I love firefox exremely for it's technical features but, as all of us know the
important part of the browser is GUI.
in this stage I almost work with firefox but when I using Opera or IE the fresh
user interface of them give me another sence but I should say that I never
discard firefox for this cheap reasons but it is very important for spreading
firefox.
I suggest that design skins and themes that they be too like IE 6 or Opera 8,
exactly like them, then all users can use firefox with great.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open Firefox 1.4 and IE 6 and Opera 8.
2. see these three browser GUI.
3. choose the browser that has fresher and interesting GUI for browsing, I
choose Opera, BUT i always work with FIREFOX !!! ;-)
