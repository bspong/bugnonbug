No fields seem to be wrapped in the element properites window (the one that you get to by right-clicking on something on a page and selecting "properties" from the context menu). This makes it difficult or impossible to view long strings, as you can only (easily) make the window as wide as the screen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a page with a link to a 200-character URL
2. Load the page, right-click on the link and select "properties"


Actual Results:  
The window is not wide enough to see the entire URL--you have to stretch it.

Expected Results:  
It should wrap, or maybe there should be a horizontal scroll bar.
