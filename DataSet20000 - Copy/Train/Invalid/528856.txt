Copy Url & Close Firefox. Paste does not work
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.4) Gecko/20091016 Firefox/3.5.4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When copying the URL from the address bar, then closing the firefox window, then attempting to paste - whether its a text document or Internet Explorer, nothing happens - it is as if Firefox somehow cleared its entries from the clipboard.

I noticed this in Linux a while ago but thaught this was standard behaviour because it happens with other apps too. I don't remeber having this problem with Firefox 2 on Windows though.

BTW This also applies to xp64.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
From Windows XP x86:
1. Open Firefox
2. Type http://www.mozilla.org in the address bar
3. Press enter (if you want)
4. Select all the text in the address bar and copy (ctrl+c)
5. Close Firefox
6. Create and open a text document from your Desktop (use the right-clic k context menu and navigate to "New" -> "Text Document")
7. Paste the copied text (ctrl+p)
Actual Results:  
Nothing - the text copied earlier has gone.

Expected Results:  
The copied text successfully pastes into the new text document.

Note that the copy and paste works OK as long as the Firefox browser has not closed.

I've also tested this with multiple browser windows open - all browser windows have to be closed for the paste to fail.
