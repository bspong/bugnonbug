I found out that you can set the Character Encoding in the View menu to Hebrew to enable you to see Hebrew text as Hebrew and not gibberish. The problem is that whwn I exit Firefox and then re-enter it, the Character Encoding setting has magically changed to either Western or Unicode, and Hebrew text has changed to gibberish again. Why can't the setting stay at the Hebrew setting? On this setting, reading and typing English text is not impaired in the least! 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set Character Encoding to Hebrew (any type).
2.Exit Firefox
3.Re-enter Firefox
4.Character Encoding setting has magically changed to either Western or Unicode
Actual Results:  

Hebrew text appears as gibberish.

Expected Results:  

Hebrew text should have appeared as Hebrew
