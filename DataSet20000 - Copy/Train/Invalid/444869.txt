When I click-'tools', and 'clear private data' the private data does not delete.

When I click-'tools', and 'clear private data' (all boxes are checked) and I click 'clear private data now' nothing is cleared. When I click the down arrow on the Navigation Bar all the sites I visited are still there.  I close Firefox (clear private data pops up and I say yes) but when I reopen Firefox ALL my sites I visited are still showing in the Navigation Bar's down arrow.  My previous version of Firefox, before I upgraded to this one did in fact delete all sites visited and nothing appeared when I clicked the down arrow.  I also checked 'keep my history for at least "0" days but nothing works.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Same as above, click 'clear private data' 
2.click down arrow on Navigation bar
3.All data still there
Actual Results:  
Same thing, ALL data is still there

Expected Results:  
Same thing it did on the previous version of Firefox before the upgrade to Firefox version 3.0 which was actually delete (clear) all private data when told to do so.
