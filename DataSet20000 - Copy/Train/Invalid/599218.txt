Add-on Bar just doesn't look right or sound right.  How about rename it to have more flare and jingle.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Open View->Toolbars->Add-on Bar
Open Menu->Options->Add-on Bar
Actual Results:  
Add-on bar can hold default widgets besides Add-ons and doesn't look right sitting next to its siblings in the menus.

Expected Results:  
Its a toolbar, so lets call it one.

How about "Extras Toolbar"
