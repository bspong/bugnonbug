clear site-specific preferences when clearing browser history
When clearing browser history using the "clear private data" feature, we should also clear site-specific preferences like the text zoom pref (but also any others that we or extension authors add) so that such preferences don't leak information about the sites the user has visited.

Note: the bug for clearing all site-specific settings is bug 380852.  This bug is only about clearing site-specific preferences that are set using the content preferences service.
