Consider using window color instead of menu on the awesome bar results
Over in bug 409974 we are switching URLs to GreyText due to the potential range of Linux themes and background colors.  This attachment shows the problem with the current hard coded color (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=294666)

However, to increase contrast I think we should consider using the window color for the results instead of the menu color.  This isn't completely native, but the two line view to begin with is already a little strange for the platform.  I'm also concerned that using GreyText on a menu background is going to make the URLs look like disabled menu items.
