Bar notifications do not block any site content. They appear above or below the site and in no way impede the use of the site and can be completely ignored unless you are on a very small screen. No user action is required.

Compared to that doorhangers obscure part of the page, sometimes significant. They are as annoying as pop-over flash ads. You have to actually dismiss them to continue working with Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run firefox
2. Log in to a site


Actual Results:  
doorhanger blocks top left part of page eg some of the bugzilla top bar elements

Expected Results:  
usable site
