I own a website and members are not getting email
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011913 Firefox/3.0.6

Members at my website were encouraged by me to switch from IE to Firefox. The site allows them to receive track back emails regarding topics they have interest in. The system works with IE but not Firefox. They are complaining about the problem. I am getting this message:
This is the message we get at the mailserver:
# TRANSACTION FAILED
# 440 - hugelwilhelm@shasta.com R=fail_remote_domains: The mail server could not deliver mail to hugelwilhelm@shasta.com. The account or domain may not exist, they may be blacklisted, or missing the proper dns entries.
This member just switched back to IE and is getting tracking emails. Any thoughts? Thank you.

Reproducible: Always
