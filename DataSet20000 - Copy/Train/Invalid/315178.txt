The following is new to me since testing out 1.5 RC1

I have noticed that the taskbar item for Firefox doesn't *always* match the current tab that Firefox is focused on.

Sometimes it will display another tab's title, or it will display the title of a tab that I have already closed.

This seems to be very consistent for me to reproduce.  I just need to open a handful of tabs and begin switching around.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a new Firefox window
2. Open multiple tabs.
3. Switch tabs, keeping an eye on the windows taskbar

Actual Results:  
Taskbar does not stay in sync with the active Firefox tab

Expected Results:  
Taskbar title should always be the same as the current tab page title.

I am listing this as a Major bug because this is such a bad bug experience wise it can't be left in to the 1.5 release.
