Error message: This application has failed to start because xpcom.dll was not found.

Error message appears after Firefox is open and I am navigating to a page:“This application has failed to start because xpcom.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem." When I click on "OK", the same error message pops up. During this time I am able to navigate.  The only problem is the error message blocks the page.  Also, I can see xpcom.dll in the firefox folder.  Eventually the message goes away.  Have reinstalled several times.  I did not experience this problem with Firefox 2.xx.  I recently upgraded to Firefox 3xx for the second time.  The first time I upgraded I had the same problem and went back to Firefox 2.xx which resolved the issue.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open firefox
2.type a web address
3. go to web address
Actual Results:  
No error message.  This problem is intermittent and does not occur each time I browse.
