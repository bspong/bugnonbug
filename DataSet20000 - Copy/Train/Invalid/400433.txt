Using (ctrl + left click) on a link doesn't add EventListener to newly opened tab before browsing to specified URL

I opened firefox, browse to let's say http://www.google.com, i have my own extension installed which does something like
window.addEventListener("load", function() { alert('hi') );
so if i open a new tab using (ctrl + t) then i see an alert as soon as a new tab is opened.
but if i open a new tab after right clicking on a link on Google's home page & then click 'open link in new tab' then i see that alert only after page has loaded completely. is new tab is navigated to an onload-blocker.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open http://www.google.com in a tab
2.right click on any link & open it in new tab
3.load event for new tab is only fired when url browsed is completely loaded, while when we open new tab simply than a default onload event is fired first
Actual Results:  
no special steps


software should have had same behavior if a new tab is opened using 'ctrl+t + browse to url' OR ('right click on a link & browse to a url'
