bookmarks lost when upgrading Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; fi-FI; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050223 Firefox/1.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; fi-FI; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050223 Firefox/1.0.1

The bookmarks.html got overwrtitten with a new one containing only the Personal
toolbar folder (in finnish "Kirjanmerkkipalkin kirjanmerkkikansio") after
upgrading Firefox. The original version of Firefox was 1.0 Finnish language
version, the upgrade version was 1.0.1 Finnish version.


Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
This is about the sequence I executed

1. Install Firefox 1.0 Finnish language version as root to directory /opt/firefox
2. Use firefox for few months, add some extensions, save bookmarks, change
various settings
3. Stop firefox :)
4. Empty the directory where firefox was installed (in this case /opt/firefox)
5. Run firefox 1.0.1 installer with sudo: "sudo ./firefox-installer" and install
again to /opt/firefox
6. Launch firefox as normal user right after installation dialog disappears,
before installation has launched firefox
7. Choose to start the browser as Default User when the "profile chooser" appears.
8. Close the complaint dialog about profile being in use already and all firefox
windows
9. Restart firefox 

Actual Results:  
Bookmarks and bookmarks toolbar were empty. The bookmarks.html file only
contained the folder for Personal toolbar, but no bookmarks at all. 

Expected Results:  
Bookmarks should have remained untouched after upgrade.

The OS version was SuSE Linux Professional 9.2 with default KDE desktop.

The following Firefox extensions were installed: Adblock v.5 d2 nightly 39, FLST
0.8.1, ReloadEvery 0.5, TabScroller 0.6, LastTab 1.0.5,

Default theme was used.

I'm not sure if the problem is related to the actual upgrade or if launching the
browser right after installation dialog did something nasty. Anyway the
bookmarks are gone, but luckily everything else in the profile seems to be OK
including settings, extensions and home page. I tried to reproduce the bug as
another user but of course I was unable to reproduce it.

The bookmarks.html originally inlcuded links in several directories, few RSS
feeds and couple of bookmarklets.
