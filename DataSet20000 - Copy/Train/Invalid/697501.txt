Steps to reproduce:

To view live streaming a site installed Inbox searchbar on my computer.  It was a load of crap so I uninstalled it.  On IE everything went away.  On firefox, even though I killed it as a search engine (it wasn't listed as an addon, plugin, or anything else) when I type any name in the site address line that isn't associated with ".com" (etc) then the "Inbox" search engine comes up with the thing I typed in.  I have Google as my default search engine.  Inbox is listed no where.  They have figured out how to get around something in your code or it isn't uninstalling correctly for FF.


Actual results:

The Inbox search engine redirects my search criteria to their engine - unauthorized.


Expected results:

Google should have launched with my search criteria
