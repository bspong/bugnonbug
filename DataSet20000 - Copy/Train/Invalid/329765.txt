Overwriting  the Old session for two seperate instances of Firefox/DeerPark
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8b3) Gecko/20050712 Firefox/1.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8b3) Gecko/20050712 Firefox/1.0+

How far is this right? Firefox/Deerpark overwrites the old session whenever we open a new session of the same URL,  objecting the multitasking feature of the website.
Example:
Our website has certain users, once they login with their  Login IDs they will be able to use numerous fetaures that are available on the website.But when they open a new instance of the Browser this session overwrites the session of the old browser and that old browser stops working. This is a serious problem on FireFox. Is there a way that we can overcome this? If so would you please guide us the steps we need to take into consideration while coding.
