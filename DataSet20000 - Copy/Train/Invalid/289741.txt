When using the doctype for html 4.01 (<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML
4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">) the javascript
for moving 2 div's won't work.
http://krijn.net/new/temp.html and http://krijn.net/new/temp2.html have exactly
the same source, but with one difference. the first one has no doctype. The
javascript works fine. At temp2 there is a doctype, and the exact same code
doesn't work.
Tried comments before the doctype, but that didn't fix the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the url's in the details section
2. Press the button at both sites
3. Notice how the code works @ temp, but not @ temp2

Actual Results:  
Without doctype the javascript works, with doctype html 4.01 it doesn't.

Expected Results:  
Moved the two divs

Default theme. Bug in 1.0 / 1.0.1 / 1.0.2 maybe earlier
