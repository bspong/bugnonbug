setTimeout() doesn't work with DIV elements

This is a Javascript problem.
Let's say I have a div element with the id xxx. The following code will not work under the latest version of Firefox:

function first() {
  var el = document.getElementById("xxx");
  second(el);
}

function second(el) {
  setTimeout("second(" + el + ")", 100);
}

The setTimeout() WILL work if the parameters are numbers or text, but it will not work if it's a DIV element. I haven't checked with other objects.

The error message I'm getting is:

missing ] after element list
second([object HTMLDivElement])

I've checked if maybe this is not allowed in Javascript and I cannot pass objects as arguements and for some reason I didn't know it - but it turns out this is possible and should work. A website that I've created more than a year ago (www.taleful.com) used to have 0 errors, and now it has tons of it when I visit the site. Because of this I believe the bug is with the Firefox browser.

Reproducible: Always
