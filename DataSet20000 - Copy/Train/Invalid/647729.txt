I think the tab bar should be shown when only single "pinned" tab is open, when always show tab bar is unchecked in options.

This is normal behavior for norma tabs but when its a pin tab I tink the tab bar should be shown so that you can tell that its a "pinned" app/tab

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a 2nd tab while having always how tab bar unchecked.
2. pin one of the tabs
3. close the non pinned tab
Actual Results:  
tab bar is hidden from view

Expected Results:  
tab bar should remiain with the smaller version of the tab for pinned tabs shown
