<td> elements governed by style with 'display: block' cause incorrect table rendering.

With a table containing <td> elements (within <tr> elements), if the <td>
elements are governed bt a style specified with 'display: block', then the rows
are displayed vertically rather than horizontally. Effectively, each cell is
displayed as a row.
Sample style:
td {
  display: block;
  text-align: center;
}
IE displays the table correctly. Mozilla suffers from the same problem as
Firefox. The table displays the rows correctly if 'display: block' is removed.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a web page using standard HTML containing a table with rows and
multiple columns (each row specified with a <tr> element and each cell specified
by a <td> element).
2. Define a style for 'td' which specifies 'display: block'.
3. Display the web page with Firefox or the Mozilla browser.

Actual Results:  
Each cell (<td> element within <tr> element) is displayed as single row. 

Expected Results:  
All the <td> elements contained with a <tr> element should be displayed as a row.
