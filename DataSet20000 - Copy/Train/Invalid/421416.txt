Consistent search method across Firefox

The following search text boxes should work as the location bar search for consistency:

* about:config search
* Applications search
* Bookmarks sidebar search (I'm almost sure it already does)
* Cookies search
* Downloads search (I'm almost sure it already does)
* Help search (I'm almost sure it already does)
* History sidebar search (I'm almost sure it already does)
* Library search (I'm almost sure it already does)
* Remembered passwords search

Don't know this might be possible here:

* Extension search

The following are just mentioned for completion, but are not included in the proposal because they are not searching _items_.

* Find search
* Quick find search

Reproducible: Always
