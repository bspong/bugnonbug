sorry my english is not that good .so lemme tell this in detail what happend :
I went to this website www.stagevu.com then i started watching a video, this website uses divx web players to show video, the video was still buffering so i minimized the firefox window, and then i opened my online game rappelz (mmorpg) game and start playing it, after sometime i closed the game and then i thought of watching the video that was buffering up.. so i restored the firefox window and then when i clicked on the tab where the video was .... i saw that the video screen part was fully bugged.. and then suddenly firefox crashed or it just got closed suddenly.. 


thier is another one.. and that is .. i use freedownload manager as my download manager , recenltly when i open this website www.tictacvid.com sometimes it gives an error : in which a file of freedownload manager namely : "components.dll" has been corrupted or has a bad image.. or something like that.. and ask u to install freedownload manager again.. 


these are the two problems that i face..

secondly can improve the download manager of firefox?? the download system of google chrome is very fast.. and better compared to firefox...
