I've been seeing this problem where videos in youtube hang after I attempt to maximize them using the flash players full screen button. Sound keeps playing though. and if I hit the maximize button really fast (like before the video has begun playing in normal mode) then the video plays smoothly. Have seen the issue in Google chrome as well.

1.Open youtube

Video and sound should play well.
