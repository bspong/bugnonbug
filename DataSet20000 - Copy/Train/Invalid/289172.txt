I used previous version of Firefox with no problems
After installing 1.0.2 Firefox starts, the computer connects to the service 
provider (broadband), the address of the required URL appears briefly in the 
status bar but then nothing happens and the main window stays blank

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Removed Firefox, re-installed: - no difference
2. Tried new profile - no difference
3.



Expected Results:  
Displayed required URL
