App button and titlebar too tall on Windows 2003 with XP theme
When running Firefox 4.0b8pre (20101112 nightly) on Windows 2003 R2 Service Pack 2, if you use the "XP" Theme that comes with the OS instead of the "Classic" theme, the Minimize/Maximize/Close buttons and, in the most recent nightly, the Firefox button also, are way too tall. Switching to the no application button (turning back on "Menu Bar") seems to fix it. With the "Classic" theme, either works as expected. Pictures attached.
