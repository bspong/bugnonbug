As you see in the site i put, the option HELP doesn't appear when i use Mozilla. Other problem is that bellow the State Bar there's a big space. This space is useless and less tehh visibility over the websites. A detail you can see is that ther'es a orange character "^" in the left-side of the "new" bar  

These problems appeared (a hypotesis) when i installed Complements>Extensions for Mozilla from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/

I used AdBlock, IPExternal, NOScript and the Live PAgeRAnk Extension. I think the extesiones were the problem because when i uninstalled the Mozilla and the i re-installed it the extensiones appeared as they never had erased.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click the Icon Mozilla
2.You can see now the interface with problemes in the Tool Bar and the State Bar
3.Re-installing Mozilla doesn`t work. The problem persist.
Actual Results:  
The problems with the bars were not solved.

Expected Results:  
The software should erase all the extensions and files associated when in UNINSTALL Mozilla, because maybe i can have a VIRUS o something that keeps in my computer.

When I UNINSTALL the extesions, the problem keeps. I unistalled first the Extensions and then The Mozilla but i've never found the solution.
