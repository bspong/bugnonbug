I have a CSS style sheet to define a style for the hover effect on a link (defined as #nav li a:hover{...}) for a navigation menu, which works fine. However, when I change the style of the link dynamically (using javascript) it appears that the inline style that's written overrides the stylesheet definition. When I hover over the link again (after the dynamic change), the link no longer responds to the hover effect, but instead, maintains the inline style.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Define a style sheet for a hover effect (note that the hover pseudo-class works as expected)
2. Use javascript to dynamically change the style of the link that the hover is applied to. (effectively creating an inline style).
3. Mouse over the link once more (hover pseduo-class no longer works)
Actual Results:  
The link retains the inline style.

Expected Results:  
The link utilizes the style defined in the style sheet.
