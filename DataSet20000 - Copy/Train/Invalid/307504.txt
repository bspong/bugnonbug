numerous bugs dealing with padding
I really am not sure if all of these bugs were introduced by the patch for Bug#
303806 but at least a few were.

Please see screenshot for examples and here is my attempt to explain fully.

Bug# 1, not a bug...didn't feel liek editing the picture again
Bug# 2, In tools->options->downloads->browse, text is not vertically centerd in
the 'Folder: input box'
Bug# 2, in the picture I zoomed in to show this one and is kinda hard for me to
explain and everyone understand. type the letter 'L' in an input box, highlight
that letter, the highlight is right against the left side of the L and there
fore blends into the white background of the input boxes.
Bug# 4, tools->options->downloads->browse, icon for desktop is right against the
border for the box. same as with in the bookmarks manager
Bug# 5,Bookmarks manager->move, first '-'icon is too far left so there is no
paddiding between the icon and the focus ring. probably falls in with bug# 4.
