On a number of sites, words are displayed with a gratuitous hyphen, for example on this site the word "Desiderio" is displayed as "Desi- derio".  The source shous this to be "Desi-&#10;derio".  I can't find what "&#10;" is supposed to do in my (ancient) HTML manual; probably it's supposed to be a hint to word breaks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Display the listed URL
2. Look at the display.

Actual Results:  
...
3. See "Desi- derio".

Expected Results:  
...
3. See "Desiderio"

Can anyone tell me what "&#10;" is supposed to do?  Is it part of an HTML standard or is it an extension?
