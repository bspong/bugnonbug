after closing firefox from a page that was lagging and would not let me press "back", a box popped up saying that my "default" user was in use, and i had to create a new user or use a different one.

I was on a xanga website, and it was taking a long time to load, so i tried pressing "back", but it didnt not work, so i closed firefox. when i tried to open it again, a grey box popped up, saying that the user 'default' was already in use, and that i had to create a new user name or switch to a different one. so i created a new user, but now i can't get back to my 'default' user, which has all my preferences in it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. not sure, but go to a website that takes a while to load (i'm pretty sure it's just my computer that is slow, but it did something to firefox)
2. close the window, after trying to press "back" and failing
3. once trying to open firefox, it will say that the 'default' user is in use, so you have to pick a different user.

Actual Results:  
a grey box popped up saying that my 'default' user (the one i use all the time) is  in use, and that i have to switch to a different user or create one.

Expected Results:  
not sure, beacause i don't understand why my user was still in use, after simply closing the browser
