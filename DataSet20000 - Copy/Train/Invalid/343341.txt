Dragging database-stored images to desktop adds 30 corrupting bytes

Images served from a database display properly in Firefox, and are fine when copied to the clipboard or saved as a file. When dragged to the desktop or any folder, 15 bytes are added to each end of the file (the same 15 bytes every time), which corrupts the file:

Added to beginning: 1F 8B 08 00 00 00 00 00 00 03 00 FC 01 03 FE
Added to end:       00 00 00 FF FF 03 00 E7 2C 62 A3 FC 01 00 00 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to an image served from a database via a PHP script.
2. Drag it to the desktop.
3. Try to view/hexedit the file and behold the corruption.

Actual Results:  
Corrupt image when dragged out of browser.

Expected Results:  
Proper image when dragged from browser (as IE handles it).

I'm not in a position to set up a test case very easily, but if the hex data isn't helpful enough I'll see what I can do.
