Images do not display if full URI is specified in src and image is on different server than the page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1

Images do not display if full URI is specified in <img src ..../> and image is in <different> domain / server than the page on which the reference occurs.

Example: <img src="http://www.dieknoop.co.za/dieknoop.gif" /> in http://waterbok.co.za/Tuis/Tuisblad.htm - image does not display.
Image displays when image URI is entered in address bar - eg. http://www.dieknoop.co.za/dieknoop.gif

When image is copied to same domain as page, it displays - eg. <img src="http://waterbok.co.za/imgs/dieknoop.gif" /> in http://waterbok.co.za/Tuis/Tuisblad.htm
Also displays if relative location is used after copying eg. <img src="../imgs/dieknoop.gif" /> - normal condition for local images

Problem also occurs when <base href="   ... /> is used eg.
  <head><base href="http://www.dieknoop.co.za/" />
  <body><img src="dieknoop.gif" />
Image does not display

The exact pages referred to above all work in Internet Explorer

Problem first noticed in Firefox 2.0, still a problem in 2.0.0.1
Unable to test in Firefox 1.5 now, but 90% sure problem did not occur there
