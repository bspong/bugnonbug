The about:config attribute, browser.tabs.tabMinWidth, no longer works. Please fix immediately.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Chang browser.tabs.tabMinWidth to some lower number, like 25
2. Open 20+ tabs, as many power users do
3. Witness the nearly infinite expanse that every 140 pixel tab requires you to traverse to get to the end. 
4. Get frustrated and switch to chrome.
Actual Results:  
Not the desired effect.

Expected Results:  
Tabs should shrink to avoid scrolling.

Apparently this was moved in the bowels of the browser's functionality.
