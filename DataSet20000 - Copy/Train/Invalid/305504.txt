non-breaking space (&nbsp;) is rendered as black diamond with question mark in UTF-8 encoding when pages are dynamically built.

I have seen this problem on two separate sites: 
http://www.enduringreflections.com/catalog.php?id=1
http://ir.tysonfoodsinc.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=65476&p=irol-irhome

where non-breaking spaces are rendered or converted to a black diamond with a
question-mark inside.

The commonalities that the two URLs have is that most of the content on the page
is dynamically generated and placed on the pages.  In the first URL, the pages
are processed through Smarty Templates (PHP).  In the second URL, I'm not sure
how that is done, but it is a third-party data-collection and serving service
called Thomson Financial.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
Rendered the non-breaking space correctly.
