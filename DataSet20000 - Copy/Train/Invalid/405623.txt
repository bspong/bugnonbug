After upgrading to Firefox 2.0.0.10 I'm not able to browse any site
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; FDM)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; it; rv:1.8.1.10) Gecko/20071115 Firefox/2.0.0.10

After the proposed upgrade to the latest version of the Firefox software I was not able to browse any page except for the ones in the local intranet.
My network settings haven't changed so there must be something wrong. The console keeps showing OVERFLOWING  message (only this word) even if there is no activity on the browser (no attempts to contact other web servers)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.install Firefox/2.0.0.10
2. restart the browser
3. browse any page outside of my company's Intranet

Actual Results:  
the browser shows a "Failed connection" message,  the Console shows "OVERFLOWING" message every 3-5 seconds

Expected Results:  
be able to browse normally web pages
