Can't import Firefox bookmarks into Places test build

In order to test bookmarks feture of the new Places build, I would like to use my old store of bookmarks. The Bookamrks Manager seems to be using the interface from the browser in that it lets you import from IE, Netscape, Mozilla or Opera, but not Firefox.

Short of doing copy and paste to the new bookamrks file, there seems to be no way of getting old bookmarks in.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the Places test build via zipfile using new profile.
2. Start browser. Open Bookmarks manager. Open Files > Import...
3. The dialog does not include Firefox bookmarks. Coose Netscape 6,7 or Mozilla 1.

Actual Results:  
The browser imports nothing.

No option to import from file, as has the Bookmarks Manager in Firefox 1 - 1.5.

Expected Results:  
Either import my Firefox bookmarks, or provide an Import from File function.
