Menu's not responding until clicked several times

This happens more with the Bookmarks menu and sometimes with the View menu where
you can click 2-4 times until you get a response(but it has happened with other
menus as well).  Then when you get a response it will cascade through the
commands several times by highlighting the menu tab as many times as you clickd
the menu button until it finally opens on the last clicked command.  This also
seems to happen on links in web pages from time to time needing to be clicked
twice in order to go to the linked page.  The browser indicates that it's going
yet nothing is happening and then clicking the link again will make the page
load as it should.  It's as if there is a delayed command issue somehwhere in
the works.  Plus I've tried a few different mice and there is no difference.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Just through normal browsing every day
2.
3.



Expected Results:  
Opened the menu tab or gone to the clicked upon link on the first command.
