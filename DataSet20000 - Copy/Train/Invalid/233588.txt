"Save link to disk", "save image as" and "save page as" don't work
User-Agent:

I checked this on several sites, all three "save..."-commands (right-click)
don't work, Firefox 0.8 just doesn't react.
I used 0.7 before, where everything was fine (just to indicate that it's not
just me being too stupid)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right-click on page, image or link
2. Choose "Save link to disk", "save image as" or "save page as"
3. Probably it's just my machine...

Actual Results:  
Nothing...

Expected Results:  
Save the page, image or link
