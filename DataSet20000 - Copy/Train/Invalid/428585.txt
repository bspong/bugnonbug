Loading a place URI in an iFrame does not throw an exception
When you set an iFrame src attribute to a place URI, it shows an alert dialog, but it does not throw an exception.

If you perform an XMLHTTPRequest with a place URI, it throws an exception, so you'd expect the same behavior from loading a place URI in an iframe.

The test for this is at: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/toolkit/components/places/tests/mochikit/test_bug_405924.html.  There is a "todo" in there that should be changed to an "ok" and will cause the test to fail until this problem is fixed.
