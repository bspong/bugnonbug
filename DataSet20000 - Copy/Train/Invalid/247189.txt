File does not begin with 'PDF-%' error when trying to load PDF file

The error message above is received when trying to view the file. If the file is
downloaded and opened with Acrobat 6.0, the installed version of Acrobat Reader
on the system it opens just fine. The file also opens just fine in Internet
Explorer 6.0sp2 . This bug happened with multiple pages on the site including
http://www.exceleyecenter.com/why-excel.pdf,
http://www.exceleyecenter.com/testimonials.pdf

While it is trying to open the pages the firefox.exe process goes to 99% CPU and
stays there a while. Acrobat32.exe is running but using little or no CPU.

I looked with a source editor and the file actually begins with the line '%PDF-1.5'

I can reproduce the problem every time with those PDF's but some others such as
http://saas.byu.edu/classschedule/pdf/clsschedEVE20044.pdf work just fine. That
file begins with '%PDF-1.2' incidentally

I noticed the problem using 0.9rc2 and o I upgraded to 0.9 but the problem remains


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.exceleyecenter.com/lasik.pdf or another similar PDF file on
the site
2. Open the link ni Firefox
3. Wait for the error to occur

Actual Results:  
Firefox either pops up a dialog with the error, or locks up the machine a while
until the action is cancelled or ?times out?

Expected Results:  
Opened the PDF file, probably in an Adobe plugin?
