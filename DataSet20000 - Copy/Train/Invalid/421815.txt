Make address bar MRU drop-down list show only items since history was last cleared
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9b5pre) Gecko/2008030904 Minefield/3.0b5pre (like Firefox/2.0.0.13)

I like the "Awesome Bar", but the fact that it is no longer possible to reset the drop-down list to a clean state, after clearing history is rather annoying.  If ever I have visited a site that I also have bookmarked, I am cursed to have it forever competing with newly visited URLs whenever I click the drop-down arrow.

I believe the MRU drop-down should be tied to history alone.  I read somewhere (on one of the bugs) about a counter, and a decision made not to reset it.  It would thus appear to be the reason why my MRU list remains cluttered with items no longer of present interest, though such items rightly remain amongst my bookmarks for future reference.  It would be nice to at least have the option of setting behavior common to all other browsers.

IMPORTANT: Note that what I am referring to here is different from having bookmarked items listed when I type in the address bar.  That I do not mind.  What I am asking for is that when I merely click the address bar drop-down arrow, without having typed anything, that only bookmark entries since last clearing history be listed amongst visited other visited URLs and not every bookmarked URL I have ever visited.

Thanks
