Find bar doesn't seem to allow input of certain keys sometimes, usually 'n' and 's' an 'l', usually around the 2nd and 3rd letters of words, for eg. "find", long", "animal", "follow" etc.  Sometimes, it requires 2 key presses for some letters to show up, again usually on the 2nd or 3rd letter of a word.  Doing this fixes the other problem temporarily as well.

No problems at all with inputting any characters as the first letter of a word.

No problems seen with input on any other applications, or other places within firefox, eg address bar, fields etc.  



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.ctrl+f
2.type "non" or "nnn"
3.
Actual Results:  
Find field doesn't allow input of 2nd "n" in both cases

Expected Results:  
Find field should allow input of all characters.

The problem seems to disappear from time to time.  Additionally, the field requires 2 button presses to make certain letters appear, eg, "r", for eg "arnold" has to be typed "a r r n o l d".  Typing in the 2 "r"s causes the problems with the other keys to be fixed temporarily until you click away from the find bar.
