JavaScript set as homepage leads to document URL spoofing.

Hey, this is "Andrew Hunter". In the past week if you've been reading bugtraq
you will have seen my posts on IE 6 Sp2 URL spoofing.

I was able to recreate the same SPOOF in:
Mozilla(Sorry No Version Number) 
FireFox(Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8a5) Gecko/20041019
Firefox/0.9.1+)
Netscape(Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.4) Gecko/20030624) 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open your browser.
2. Set the homepage to the following:

javascript:document.write("<iframe src='http://www.google.com' width='100%'
height='100%' frameborder='0'></iframe>"), document.close(); 

3. Now navigate to any page you like. Just don't go to google as it won't be
clear that it's being spoofed.

4. Once your site loads up click the home button. The google website will appear
but the address will be spoofed to that of the site you was just on.


Also on FireFox when i loaded the browser google appeared but the address was
about:blank, i'm not sure if this is the same for Mozilla. Netscape when opened
will go to google and display nothing in the address bar.

Actual Results:  
1. Navigated to slashdot.org
2. Clicked home
3. Url said slashdot.org but the webpage was google.com


Expected Results:  
Expected to see googles url in the address bar OR filter javascript form being
entered as a homepage.
