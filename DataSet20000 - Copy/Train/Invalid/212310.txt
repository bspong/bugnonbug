When clicking "Use current pages" to set the location of the home page the
"current" page isn't used, but the page open in the first (leftmost) tab. It
should be the current page, i.e. the page currently active.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up a couple of tabs on different pages
2. Select someone not the leftmost.
3. Try to "Use current pages" when setting home page.
4. The address inserted into the field is the address of the leftmost tab.



Expected Results:  
Should have picked the address of the currently open tab.
