File menus flash when using keyboard commands
Seen using Build identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.9a6) Gecko/2007062911 GranParadiso/3.0a6. I thought I recall seeing a bug, similar, but I can't find it.

STR:

1. Open a new window or tab using the keyboard command
2. Observe the "File" menu item flashes briefly.

This also happens with other menu items, including Cmd-K, etc.
