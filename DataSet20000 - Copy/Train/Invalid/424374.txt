When you right click on save target as/save link as, you get the windows "Save as" windows.

If you want to rename an existing file that appears in the chosen directory, you would press the F2 touch. Most of times, it turns out that pressing F2 does nothing. 

You sometimes have to press it 2/3 times so it works.
Sometimes, it won't work !

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Right click save as
2.press F2 to rename a file, so you dont have 2 files when saving (for instance you get firefox3b3.exe, you want to rename it as firefox3b4.exe, and then use this new name to save the file)



Expected Results:  
F2 does not work all times.
