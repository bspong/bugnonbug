Javascript objects not initializing in Deer Park 2 (but work in DP1 and earlier)

When rendered with Deer Park alpha 1 or earlier, the page in question at
http://cms2.graphtek.com/example.html hides the textarea and replaces it with a
groovy widgets to help author rich text.

Starting with Deer Park alpha 2, the Javascript fails with an error. The suite
of Javascript scripts aren't of my making (they are instances of the "Xinha"
editor: xinha.python-hosting.com), so ability to diagnose exactly what might be
happening isn't going to be amazing, but I think that additional javascripts
which are to be loaded by document.write("<script src='..'></script>") calls
aren't being loaded--or else aren't loaded by the time window.onload fires.

In any event, Javascript which was once working (well, I cooked up the page to
demonstrate a problem I'm having with a non-public page) is now failing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://cms2.graphtek.com/example.html with Firefox 1.0.x or Deer Park
alpha 1 and see it work.
2. Visit http://cms2.graphtek.com/example.heml with Deer Park alpha 2 and see it
fail
3. 1 and 2 can be repeated on Linux and in XP
