Propose for a better wording for "open in [a new window, a new tab]"

I propose to change in the Tabs section so that its easier for the user to select the radio button.
Currently there is written:
New pages should be open in:
- a new window
- a new tab

Maybe 'a new' can be moved up so that its written:
New pages should be open in a new:
- window
- tab

I think this is also more gui guideline confirm because the user scans the first character which are always the same (a new). The only problem which I can see now is that "a new" contains a shortcut for the window radio button.

The same thing applies for other languages such as german too.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select Tools-Option
2. Select tabs
