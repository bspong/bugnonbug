firefox 4 beta version changes on restart
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b10) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b10

I installed Firefox 4 beta in addition to the latest Firefox 3. I am reluctant to uninstall Firefox 3 because while interested in trying out Firefox 4, I am a web developer and need to view an environment that as closely as possible mimics my clients. However, sometimes when I restart my computer and click on a link Firefox 3 opens up, other times Firefox 4 opens up. Generally it seems if 4 is open then a new link will open up in 4 and if 3 is open a new link will open up in 3, but when I first open the browser there's some unpredictability there. It's not a huge thing, since I could just uninstall the beta.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Firefox 4 beta on a computer with Firefox 3
2.Restart
3.Click on a desktop link for Firefox or a link in an email
Actual Results:  
Sometimes 4 opens up sometimes 3

Expected Results:  
If I set firefox 4 to be my default browser, then 4 should open up, if I set firefox 3 to be my default, 3 should open up. I set 3 as my default and did not choose to set 4 as my default.

Just a suggestion, but it would be cool, if you could go to a menu, click profiles and switch between profiles that included different firefox versions (in addition to different extensions enabled (a side effect of this bug is that every time firefox 4 opens up after restart it'll check for compatibility of plugins since when I open up firefox 3 my incompatible plugins are enabled)
