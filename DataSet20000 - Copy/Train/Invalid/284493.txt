firefox crashes when making changes to sprintpcs.com pcs mail address book
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

First time that it crashed, I was able to do a fair amount of editing of my 
sprinpcs pcs mail (online) address book. Now, it seems sufficient to just view 
it.

Not sure how much success you'll have finding someone with a SprintPCS 
account...
