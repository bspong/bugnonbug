location bar styling changes
The star button should be on the left end (or right end in rtl locales) of the location bar.

Also, the favicon in the location bar is redundant, since we already show it on the selected tab, so the favicon should be removed too.

This is backed up by the Firefox 4 mockups. See bug 578025 for images.
