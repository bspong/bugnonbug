if pointing at any of the divs only the progress (arrow w/ hourglass) shows. no other cursors show. a div with "cursor: pointer, default;" or "cursor: hand, default;" shows only the progress cursor.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. browse to page
2. point at elements with cursor css set
3. progress cursor shows for every value of cursor
Actual Results:  
no special set up required.

Expected Results:  
shown a pointer, hand, cross-hair, etc... they all show as progress.

it may just be my system, as i have not found any one else reporting this problem nor a fix for this problem. i have uninstalled and reinstalled fire fox several times.
