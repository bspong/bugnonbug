Hello,
this is the second time I got this problem with Java JRE 6 ! First one was a month or two ago:

I have Java JRE 6 update 20 installed on a Windows 7 64bit ultimate. It was working...much time ago...then i found my browser (firefox, google chrome or IE8) was freezing when I open java application or test pages. I tried uninstalling it, cleaning the system with Revo Uninstaller, or CCleaner or JavaRA and reinstalling with no luck. The other problem is the same that user Mass8 had (http://forums.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=5372196&start=15&tstart=0)
...my java control panel applet is not working and give me this:

I tried disabling UAC, running JRE, starting Win7 in safe mode with network...but browser always freeze. It's not a true freeze, with CPU busy at 100% (cpu stays in idle) but it seems to wait for something. It's not a problem with video card driver on my machine, because I can start java control panel from command prompt...and without the noddraw switch, using this command:
javaw -Xbootclasspath/a:..\lib\deploy.jar -Duser.home="%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%" com.sun.deploy.panel.ControlPanel

This was the description of my first time.....then I replaced my system with an Acronis image...and I used the system for sometimes....and Java was working until 3-4 days ago! So I did another image of the system with all things working.
Then this morning...I tried the java test page.....and surprise! It's not working anymore!
In these days I think I only disabled UAC and Account virtualization....maybe JAVA saves things there...and then when I disabled UAC (Windows7 deleted those folders and files) it can't find there anymore???? Who can help me?
I don't want to restore my image every month!
My system is 100% virus free and from the last image restoration I didn't visit suspicious sites and so on....I have antivirus and antispyware software...all is perfectly CLEAN. Any ideas or things to try? 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
it always happens on my machine...and it's useless to uninstall and reinstall java
