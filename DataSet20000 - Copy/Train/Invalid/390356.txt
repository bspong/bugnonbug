Trunk+Branch: Separator and "Open All in Tabs" not shown with only one ordinary bookmark
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070725 Firefox/2.0.0.6

There is an interesting bug within the bookmarks system in both: 1.8.1 branch:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070725 Firefox/2.0.0.6
and trunk:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a7pre) Gecko/2007073105 Minefield/3.0a7pre ID:2007073105

The interesting thing is that branch is Mork-based while Trunk is Places-based (but probably is was reimplemented the buggy way). Please note that this bug is still on trunk but currently interferred by bug 385813! I'm going to post a more detailed review of bug 385813 shortly, in which I'll reference this bug.

The bug is, that when there's only one simple bookmark in a folder, the "Open All in Tabs" option isn't shown (neither in the menu nor the toolbar).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a folder.
2. Add simple bookmark in it.
Simple means it's a normal bookmark. A separator or a livemark (don't know about microsummaries, I don't have any) don't count (see "Bookmarks Toolbar Folder" on a fresh profile).

Actual Results:  
With one simple item the "Open All in Tabs" option isn't there. It is only shown when I add a second simple bookmark item.


Expected Results:  
The "Open All in Tabs" option should be shown when there's only one simple bookmark. Also the option should probably be shown when the folder contains just a livemark (as the livemark menu got the same option), or when there is a microsummary (probably also when there's just a separator).
