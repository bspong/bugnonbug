Streaming video from Yahoo does not work properly

When accessing streaming video content from the Yahoo site (probably others, too) the audio will play, but no video will be displayed. This is not a plugin issue, as it works fine when accessed from my IE application.

The streaming video used to work fine from Fox 1.0.7, but stopped working when I upgraded to Fox 1.5.

I have Windows Media Player 10 installed on my XP SP2 platform.

I upgraded FF 1.0.7 to FF 1.5RC3, then FF 1.5.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
audio only plays, video is not displayed.

Expected Results:  
both audio and video should be displayed

I have a number of extensaions installed, including 1.0.6.4 and IE View 1.2.7.
