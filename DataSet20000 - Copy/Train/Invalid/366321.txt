browster extension Firefox gets C++ runtime error that indicates buffer overflow
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; Media Center PC 4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: 2.0.0.1

On initializing, the first display page causes a window to pop up indicating a C++ runtime error - buffer overflow which aborts Firefox. This is new as I have been using version 2 for a while. It must be some interference from another program or a windows update. I uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox several times and got the same problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on Firefox 
2.Displays home page
3.First click on a link causes Firefox to abort.
