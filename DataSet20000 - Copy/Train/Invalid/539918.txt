When I download Firefox 3.5.7 and try to install, it says the file is corrupt.

When I download Firefox 3.5.7 and try to install, it says the file is corrupt. I have tried redownloading but to no avail. My Firefox (3.5.6) has also crashed twice in the past two days, something it never did before.

Reproducible: Always
