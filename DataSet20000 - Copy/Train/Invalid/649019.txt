several news videos cause the crash, unable to verify exactly which ones, the submitted url is latest example. Two Firefox windows open, video playing in top window, crash, Firefox closes and says no bug report available.
This just started happening after latest Firefox update.

normal play of video

standard Firefox, no real extras, Windows 2000, AMD processor @ 2.2 ghz, 1.2 gig of memory, DSL connection @ 2.4 to 2.8 meg download. I would attempt it again now, but afraid of loosing data under submission from this form. I wish I was more technical to help you out, but I'm no guru. All I know is that videos played just fine up until about a week ago. Most other video sites play fine.
