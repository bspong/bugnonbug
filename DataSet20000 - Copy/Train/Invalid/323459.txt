IMG height 100% does not work anymore in XHTML 1.0 Transitional
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

The value of the height attribute in images does not work when a XHTML 1.0 Transitional doctype is specified. When this doctype is removed, it works. This problem DID NOT OCCUR with Firefox 1.0.x

I have attached the files (when it works and when it doesn't) to this bug so that you can see by yourself. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. extract the attached zip file
2. view file "showmethisfirefoxbug.htm"
3. view file "showmewhenthisworks.htm"

Actual Results:  
The images on the side of "Useful Links" are not 100%

Expected Results:  
They should be 100%, just like Firefox 1.0.x did

IE doesn't have this problem.
