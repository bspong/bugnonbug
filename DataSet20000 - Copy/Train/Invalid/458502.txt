Open in New Tab menu option is greyed out when IE Tab is used
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Media Center PC 5.0; .NET CLR 3.0.04506; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Firefox 3.0.3

On any page opened via IE Tab 1.5.20080823 the right mouse click menu has Open in New Tab, Cut, Copy and Paste Functions greyed out.  However if Open in New Window is clicked a New Tab is opened instead.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox to any page
2. Open any page with the IE Tab
3. Right click any link to show the menu



The software should have opened the link in a new tab but this was not available.  Clicking on Open in New Window should have opened a new window but instead opens a new tab.

I am also using Coloured Tabs and have not tried it without this option.
