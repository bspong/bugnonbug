Bug appears similar to bug 469491 found by nobody@mozilla.org 

On opening Firefox page several error messages are presented (piled on top of each other). They read "Java Script Application" "onLookup Failed 55 1". The number od identical messages varies from a few to a dozen or so. I do not know the reason for varying numbers of messages --- possibly it is relaated to the number of images on the paage. The message boxes can be closed using their "OK" button or the "X" in the upper right corner. When the boxes have been closed sometimes use of Firefox can proceed, sometimes the program crashes without leaving a crash dump. When Firefox proceeds and another web page is opened, the series of error messages is again encountered. 

On opening, Firefox noted that QuickJava 0,4,2,1 is incompatible with the version of Firefox and was disabled by Firefox. A compatible version of Java was not found.
