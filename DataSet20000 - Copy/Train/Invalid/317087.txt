If a user searches through the list of available download actions and then clears the search, the window scaling will result in the close button only being partially displayed within the window.  This only happens if the columns (extension, file types, action) are short because it is only in this case that the window scales.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Edit > Preferences > Downloads > View & Edit Actions
2. Search through list of actions.
3. Clear keyword search.

Actual Results:  
Close button is only partially displayed within the window.

Expected Results:  
Close button should be completely within the window.
