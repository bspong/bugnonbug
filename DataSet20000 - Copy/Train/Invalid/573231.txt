I installed "Mozilla Developer Preview (1.9.3 Number 5)" to try it with the aero Glass toolbar look but I never see that.  In this official web page (https://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2010/06/14/mozilla-developer-preview-1-9-3-number-5-now-available), you wrote: Aero Glass is now enabled for Windows Vista and Windows 7. When I read the others bug repport, I understand I must see a option in the toolbar to enable and disable the Aero Glass but there are no options at all and no aero glass effect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Alpha 5
Actual Results:  
Look like any old Firefox with no aero.

Expected Results:  
Aero glass effect on the toolbar.
