When tabs on top is enabled and all space on the tab bar has been used up there is a small area between the tab bar and the minimize button that is necessary to drag a maximized window. However, when this area is middle-clicked, no new tab is opened.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable "Tabs on Top" and open many tabs
2. Click the area in the window title bar between tab bar and minimize button
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens

Expected Results:  
A new tab is opened

This problem is related to #649866 because if the "+" tab would not disappear when a "new tab" button is added to the toolbar there would be no need for middle clicking the tab bar.
