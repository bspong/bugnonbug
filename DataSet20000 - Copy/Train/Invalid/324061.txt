When you examine checkboxes in forms using AT-POKE, they have no accessible name associated with them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firefox.  Point it to the attached HTML file
2. Run at-poke and poke Firefox
3. Expand the HTML container in at-poke and look for the checkboxes
4. Look for the accessible names and/or accessible text specialization of the checkboxes

Actual Results:  
1. There's no name or text specialization for the checkbox
2. The text for a set of checkboxes shows up as a single text object (e.g., the sample HTML file has three checkboxes: "Red," "Green," and "Blue."  The accesssible hierarchy shows one text object as "Red Green Blue.")


Expected Results:  
1. Each checkbox should have a the associated text as the accessible name or at least in an accessible text specialization.
