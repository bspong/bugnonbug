After entering a query into a search engine when browsing from search engine results I am sent to a different page. First stop is to http://copy-book.com/

If I write www.google.com into the address bar it will take me to google and the same for any web page. I can perform a search, for example mozilla, and will get appropriate results. When trying to browse from those results the first time I click through it will always take me to http://copy-book.com/ and then onto another,it looks like random, web site. The second time I click on the same it will take me to the correct web site.

2. click on a result
3.

Expected Results:
