Configuration of extentions is inconsistent -- adblock specifically
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050306 Firefox/1.0.1 (Debian package 1.0.1-2)

Specifically, Adblock allows you to click on the Adblock logo in the bottom
right corner of the browser and remove items from display allowing wild cards,
but if you make a mistake you cannot undo the mistake from this locatation, but
instead navigate from the menus to get to the adblock preferences.

There should be a standard, which admittedly may not be followed, to guide
developers of extentions in what the UI standards are for Firefox. This should
include the ability to undo any changes at the same place you made the chage.

1. install Adblock
2. click on Adblock logo
3. block item
4  click on Adblock logo

Actual Results:
