Options are set for "New page should be opened in a New Tab".  Does not work.  Any second bookmark simply overwrites Tab #1 and the original page is closed.  This choice using the manual method (right click) to open a bookmark works fine.   Typing in a new URL overwrites the last Tab instead of opening a new Tab while leaving the on-screen Tab open.  I guess this is OK.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Left click on bookmark opens page in existing Tab #1 and closes existing page.
2. Right click on bookmark, choose "Open in New Tab" correctly launches a Tab#2, #3 etc.



Expected Results:  
Preferences in Tools>Options>Tabs is not taking effect.  Manual method works as intended.

Problem started when I installed the Microsoft Plug-in for Media Player recently distributed.  It corrected many of the display problems with IE.  Yahoo Launchcast still refuses to support Firefox.
