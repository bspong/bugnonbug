After using AIRMILES search, clicking on a heading results in "The Connection was reset" error
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0; Trident/4.0; GTB6.3; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 3.0.30618; .NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Firefox 3.5.6

I use the AIRMILES search process (which uses freecause.com ) and Yahoo search engine.
After getting a list of results, when I click on one of the results it shows "waiting for search.freecause.com", repeats this several times, then gives the "connection was reset" error message.

N.B. The problem first arose immediately after the previous updates to Firefox were installed.  It worked fine before that.

One possible difference with my system is that I was not able to install Windows Vista Service Pack 2.

If I use Firefox to go to the Google website and do a google search. It works fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.enter a phrase in Yahoo search box on the AIRMILES panel
2.hit "enter"
3.click on one of the results
Actual Results:  
Problem loading page
The connection was reset

Expected Results:  
gone to the web page requested
