When I drag an image to the desktop or explorer it's name isn't the same as on the website from whence it came.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Drag an image from any web page to explorer (including the desktop)
Actual Results:  
Image has a different name
- can't quite work it out  gmail images end up called just '.gif' or '.jpg'
Two images from google image search were called 'images.jpg' - even though they weren't called this.

Expected Results:  
Image should have the same filename as it has on the website.
