Plain old links don't work -- work fine in all other browsers
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20060119

The links at the bottom of this page don't work in Firefox 1.5.0.1 on Windows:

http://nodivisions.com/cgi-bin/ajaxuploaddemo/filechucker.cgi

(The links are "Home", "Show Uploads", "Powered by Encodable".)

They are displayed correctly, although they do not change color on mouse-over as they should.  But they are not clickable, and they aren't even selectable (highlightable) with the mouse.  It's very strange; they are displayed, but they seem to act like they aren't there at all.

The same problem exists in Firefox 1.5 on Linux.  But in all the following browsers, the page works fine (i.e. the links work properly):

Mozilla 1.7.12 (Linux and Windows)
Opera
Safari
Internet Explorer

The W3C's validator says the page is valid XHTML and has valid CSS.  And Firefox's Javascript console reports no problems.
