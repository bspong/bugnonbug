Gmail JavaScript confirmation dialog doesn't have titlebar etc. Pls have a look at the screenshot, which will give you details of what I intend to describe. I've just upgraded my Beta to 4.0b12 from a 11, and this has started. The previous versions of Beta are fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login into Gmail
2. Delete a mail
3. Go to Trash, and click on "Empty Trash Now"
Actual Results:  
The above actions will provide you with the JavaScript Delete Confirmation Dialog Box, which does not have a Title Bar, no Borders etc.

Expected Results:  
The JavaScript Delete Confirmation Dialog Box, should be having a Title Bar, Borders etc.

I tried checking the other JavaScript Dialog Boxes, i.e Alert, Prompt etc, and they too suffer from the same symptom.
