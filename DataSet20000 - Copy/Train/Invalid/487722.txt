I usually use Firefox 3 with lots of tabs. After use and leave it in background to use other applications, I have noticed with NETSTAT command and TCPVIEWER from Sysinternals Firefox maintains many connections in ESTABLISHED state. 
The details of Firefox version I use are: 
Build identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.8) Gecko/2009032609 Firefox/3.0.8
		

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use it
2. Wait (a lot of time)
3. use netstat or tcpview
