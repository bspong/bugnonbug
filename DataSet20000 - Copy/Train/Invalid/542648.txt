Firefox DOES NOT DISPLAY advertising ads generated with the Wordpress, theme but Chrome do
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

It seems like Firefox has a problem displaying the advertising ads generated by the Gazette Edition Wordpress theme (from Woo Themes), a premium wordpress theme that can be managed from the Wordpress admin interfase.

The ads work OK in Chrome and IE8, so I'm guessing it's a problem with the Firefox rendering engine or something like that. Just thought you guys should know since I promote using Firefox in that online version for our local newspaper.

I'm not very skilled at PHP but I'm gonna do some research about a hack or something that helps me while the problem is fixed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the URL http://codiceenlinea.com/
2. Look at left sidebar.
3. Do the same first two steps in Chrome or IE.
Actual Results:  
Square advertising spaces on the left sidebar don't show with Firefox.

Expected Results:  
All the ads i set up should show when accessing the URL with Firefox.

I have used other Wordpress theme from Woo Themes before (Fresh News) and it worked OK. But, however, I seem to have the same problem with some other themes besides the one one I'm reporting the problem for (Gazette Edition). The advertising spaces don't show in Firefox but they do in other browsers.
