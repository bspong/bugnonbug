When I want to play a video on the apple website, the emptied one reads not. But I hesitate between WebM and QuickTime because since Firefox 4, when I do a right click on the video, the indication indicating a QuickTime video from the shortcut menu has disappeared.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.install QuickTime if it is not present
2.Open Firefox
3.go to the Apple site and read video
Actual Results:  
Video is still in early loading and playback does not start or directly was a black screen

Expected Results:  
Firefox should read videos on the Apple site

I can read the video on other browsers but with the QuickTime plugin
