Tooltips disappear instantly
Since upgrading to Firefox 5 tooltips disappear instantly.

Starting in safe-mode does not resolve the issue.

The issue appears to be triggered when hovering the mouse over objects in any web page. 

Tooltips on the 'bookmark menu bar' do appear normally _until_ trying to display tooltips on in-page objects; The tooltip disappears almost instantly and after that happens all tool-tips, including bookmark/menu tooltips, appear to be affected.
