Foxfire has all the features a good browser needs and one it doesn't need, it is SLOOOOOW

I spent yesterday trying out foxfire compared to netscape 4.73.  I advise you do
the same.  Foxfire is to slow to be considered an interactive tool.

The installation and configuration features are the best I've seen, but the
speed performance as a browser sucks.  There is a time between 2 and 5 seconds
where interactive response exists, longer than 5 seconds and the system is no
longer interactive and becomes a pain to use.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:



Expected Results:  
To speed foxfire up, you shopuld do the following:
1. Put a second counter on the hourglass and see what the times are from click
to ready for another click.
2. Keep track of the mouse pointer by the millisecond, to know when the mouse is
over an active area.
3. Shorten tracking time to less than a second and response time to less than 4
seconds.
4. report time counts for processing, waiting, and display time.




Foxfire is already better than Mozilla and most of the competitors, but speed
improvement has to be better or it won't work as an interactive browser.
