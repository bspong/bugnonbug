Cannot view message content in Yahoo mail
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.8) Gecko/20061025 Firefox/1.5.0.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.8) Gecko/20061025 Firefox/1.5.0.8

Please forgive me if this is already reported.  Since the new release I have not been able to view content of any message in my yahoo mailbox.  The headers are displayed just fine, but the content <BODY> does not.

I do have some extensions installed, Adblock and Noscript.  All the various components of yahoo mail are allowed to run java within Noscript (even allowed java globally).  This had no effect.

Using IE I can access the messages and content is displayed correctly.

Effect is on both my Home PC and my work laptop, both runing XP professional

If there are any details I can provide to assist, please feel free to contact me.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Using firefox browser, open a yahoo.com mailbox
2. Goto Inbox
3. Open a message

Actual Results:  
Browser opens fine, is able to get to yahoo, inbox opens fine.

Body of message appears blank, total lack of content, no words, no urls, no pictures, totally blank, white area.  Headers are displayed.

Expected Results:  
Self Explanatory, but hey, I was expecting to see the content of the messages as well as the header.  Headers are great, and allow me to see who sent me what and when, but without the actual message, the header is of little value to me.

As I stated in summary area, I am also using Noscript and Adblock, which do not appear to be causing the problem (but I may be wrong).

Thank you for a great product, my apologies if this is already reported (it doesnt appear to be)
