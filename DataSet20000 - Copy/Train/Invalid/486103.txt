When I have an even number of characters in the address bar (example: 
"mo", "mozi", "mozill"), the address bar does not show any listings. As soon as I add a additional character, the listings populate. Spaces count as a character in this example as well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a site you frequently go to
2. Open a new tab
3. Type in the address or any key words from the title of that page
4a. If you put in an odd number of characters, you will see the listing below
4b. If you put in an even number of characters, you will see no listing
Actual Results:  
Nothing listed when there are is even number of characters

Expected Results:  
Something should be listed no matter how many characters I have.
