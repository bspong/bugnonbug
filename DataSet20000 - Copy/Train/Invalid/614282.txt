java applet fails to interface with javascript code using "netscape.javascript.JSObject"
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/7.0.517.44 Safari/534.7

When using Firefox 3.6.11 on a Mac running Mac OS X Snow Leopard OR Leopard, javascript code cannot be invoked by a Java applet using "netscape.javascript.JSObject". This problem doesn't happens on any other Mac OS X versions. This problem also doesn't shows on Windows or GNU/Linux machines.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a HTML doc containing a JavaScript function
2. Instantiate a Java Applet Jar using the <applet> OR <embed> tag in this same HTML
3. try to obtain a "JSObject" by calling "netscape.javascript.JSObject.getWindow(this)" from the java applet
Actual Results:  
netscape.javascript.JSObject.getWindow(this) returns null

Expected Results:  
netscape.javascript.JSObject.getWindow(this) SHOULD return a JSObject.
It SHOULD be possible to use such JSObject's "call" and/or "eval" mehtods to interface with the HTML document's JavaScipt code.

The browser works as expeected on Windows and GNU/Linux.
Previous versions of the browsers also work as expected on Mac OS X Leopard and Snow Leopard.
