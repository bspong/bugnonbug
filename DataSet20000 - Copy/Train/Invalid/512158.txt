FF Repeatedly starts, Crashes W/O User Input

Previously reported this & initially concluded it was caused by Norton 360 update. Uninstalled both programs, reinstalled only Firefox & problem appeared.

I'm getting an error message saying Fiefox has stopped working. My only choice is to click "close program" box. Within 10 seconds of doing this, I get the same message again - its an endless loop. Meanwhile, I can open a separeate instance of Firefox & it works normally.

This behavior starts shortly after system boot, without any attempt to start Fiefox even though FF is not set to run on system start.
