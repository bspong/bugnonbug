Subscriptions view is horked, doesn't update correctly
There are errors and strange behaviors in the subscriptions view.

When you right click on a subscriptions folder, go to "Get Info" and press OK: The folder tries to add itself as an observer again, making it get double update messages which really messes things up. Also, the folders are all reset and are closed.
