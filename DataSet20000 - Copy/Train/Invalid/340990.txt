Consider changing the menu layout for Vista

On Vista Beta2 the new IE7 looks (IMHO) way better than Firefox.
The interface is much cleaner und uncluttered compared to IE6 or Firefox. (you see the Interface by installing IE7 on XP SP2)

Firefox should consider using a more IE Like user experience on Vista
That would mean: massively cleaing out the menu bar and combine the most used items with the other bars (like the Tab bar)

(i dont know if Firefox wants to change its Layout, but IMO it looks really dated compared to IE7 on Vista)

Reproducible: Always
