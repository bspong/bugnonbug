improper handling of "HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect"s

When an uri is sending an "HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect" with an location header pointing at some image (jpeg in my case), Firefox follows this link and updates the uri bar as well as the context menu->properties menu properly. However, when I choose "copy link location" from the context menu, I get the origin uri in my clipboard. This is inconsistent and I assume that the target uri should be associated with this menu item.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Open a page that sends tHTTP headers where $link is some Image/JPEG:

HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect
Location: $link
Actual Results:  
Context menu "copy link location" returns initial uri.

Expected Results:  
Context menu "copy link location" should return $link

This could also affect plugins like bookmark managers that try to copy an uri.
