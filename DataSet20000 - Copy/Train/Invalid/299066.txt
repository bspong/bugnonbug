This is my website and it won't display correctly on Mozilla Firefox although it looks just fine on INternet Explorer and others, i don't know how to make it Mozilla compatable
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: 

In the page at http://www.x-core.us/ in the staff page the text in the top 
menu is hidden and cannot be seen. The text should be higher up. There are 
other alignment problems like this through out the website. Other browsers do 
display this correctly. I am one of the people who run the x-core website but 
we don't know how to go about making it work with Mozilla Firefox. If we could 
get directions on how to go about doing that it would be wonderful!
