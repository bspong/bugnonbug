Firefox suffers from extensive memory leaks over long browsing periods
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

If Firefox is used for a long time, intermittently - say half a day or more - without restarting, it starts to use a very large amount of memory. Closing all open tabs and  clearing the disk cache does not help - the only thing that does is closing the browser entirely, and opening it again.
As I type this, firefox.exe's memory usage is 82.2 MB. It often rises to 130 or even 160 MB.
If Firefox has swelled to a large size, it also has trouble ending the process upon being closed. It often takes several minutes for firefox.exe to start reducing its memory usage and to disappear from the Task Manager process list - even after all Firefox windows are closed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Firefox for several hours, browsing a lot of pages.
2. Check the memory usage in the process list.
3. Try closing Firefox - and keep watching its entry on the process list.
