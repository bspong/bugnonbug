Site fails to detect Flash plugin
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.11) Gecko/20050818

The AlcoholEdu course fails to detect the Flash plugin while using Firefox 1.0.6
or Deer Park. Using Mozilla 1.7.11, Flash is detected and the site functions. I
filed a bug in their Bugzilla equivalent, and received a curt reply that it was
a Firefox bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load site
2. Login

Actual Results:  
Flash was not detected and the site became unusable.

Expected Results:  
The site should have been usable as Flash was installed.
