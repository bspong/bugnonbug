I updated the tab browser as it prompted me, and when I restarted firefox there
is a 1" space just below the status bar that shows browser code: 

%tabprefsDTD;
^
It looks like someome forgot to close bracket some code, or a mistake was made
in typing it out

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the browser and look at the bottom of the browser
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Browser is not affected in a bad way...its just exposed code

Expected Results:  
One should not see code exposed...should be hidden
