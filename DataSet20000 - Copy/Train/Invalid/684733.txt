Firfox 6 freezes up on Ubuntu 11.04
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:6.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.1
Build ID: 20110830092941

Steps to reproduce:

Firefox 6.01 appears to freeze while surfing or downloading. At first I thought it was the networking in Ubuntu 11.04. This is Zorin OS Ubuntu on a HP Netbook.


Actual results:

After trial and error I discovered Opera works fine and exhibits no such problem while doing the same listed above.


Expected results:

It shouldn't freeze up!
