Can not add different borders to multi-rows.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; Maxthon; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; InfoPath.1)

Can not add different borders to multi-rows.

I have created a table, and want every row has a different border.
I don't know how to write the html for Firefox. It's very strange.

Example 1:
<html>
	<body>
		<table style="border-collapse: collapse;">
			<tr style=" border-bottom: dashed rgb(0, 255, 0);">
				<td >
					<div >EMPLOYEENUMBER11</div>
				</td>
				<td >
					<div >EMPLOYEENUMBER12</div>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</body>
</html>
In this example, I can add a border to the row. But if I change the value of the border-collapse, the border will disappear.


Example 2:
<html>
	<body>
		<table style="border-collapse: collapse;">
			<tr style=" border-bottom: dashed rgb(0, 255, 0);">
				<td >
					<div >EMPLOYEENUMBER11</div>
				</td>
				<td >
					<div >EMPLOYEENUMBER12</div>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr style=" border-top: dashed rgb(255, 0, 0);">
				<td >
					<div >EMPLOYEENUMBER21</div>
				</td>
				<td >
					<div >EMPLOYEENUMBER22</div>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</body>
</html>
In this example, the first row's border has covered the border of second row.
If I remove the first row's border, then the second row's border will appear.
If I change the first row's color from "rgb(0, 255, 0)" to "green", then the second row's border will cover the first row's border. It's very strange.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Please see the Details of this bug. I have given the html codes.
Actual Results:  
Please see the Details of this bug.

Expected Results:  
I want every row has different border.

I think:
If the Firefox support row-border, then different row can has different border. 

If the Firefox doesn't support row-border,like IE, then none of rows can has a border. We can add the borders to the cells to make the row looked has a border.

It need to be fixed in Firefox.
