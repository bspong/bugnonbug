ups.  Examples are at www.popuptest.com.  I first relized this when visiting

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.popuptest.com
2. Click on Drop down Popup or Sticky popup
3. Wait for a few Seconds while it loads the pop up(s)

Actual Results:

could probobly work if the page were formatted correctly.

Expected Results:
