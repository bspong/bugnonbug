Form's onSubmit event it is not handled correctly by the browser engine

This URL is using a JavaScript validation based on form's onSubmit event. If the
JavaScript function called on that event returns false, the page should NOT be
submitted, but the Mozilla browser does! To test behaviour, use a IE based
browser, and press the submit button of the page ("Check it!" button). Do the
same with Mozilla. And this is not happening only with this page, I did my own
tests and this behaviour is the same.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use IE based browser and navigate to
http://www.peterbailey.net/fValidate/site.php?page=demo
2.Press the Check it! button and notice behaviour 
3.Use Mozilla and navigate to the same url
4.Press the Check it! button and notice the bad behaviour 

Actual Results:  
Mozilla browser will submit the page, even the onSubmit="return
validateForm(this,1,1,1,0);" function returns a FALSE!


Expected Results:  
of course, it should handle the "false" value returned by the JavaScript
validateForm function.

Imagine that you are on a page that has REQUIRED fields checked/enforced by
JavaScript using onSubmit event of the form! The user will press the "Save"
button and if there's bad development (not checking the values again on the
server side) you might end up with BIG errors (for instance this is the page
where a customer MUST enter his personal information for an on-line purchase).
I think it's pretty ugly.
