As of the update than happened automatically last weekend, there is no way to load a url typed in the location bar, EXCEPT for clicking the green arrow.

I've seen various autocomplete problems, but this seems unrelated (though perhaps connected to the apparent massive backing out of code that happened).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to location field (click, File->Open Location or <ctrl> L>
2. type cnn.com
3. hit enter
- no autocomplete, no load
5. hit down arrow, select a cached url
- no load
6. hit enter
- no load
7. click green arrom
- LOAD





I blogged about this and have already gotten comments confirming the problem, so I'm not crazy.
