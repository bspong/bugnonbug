As per the summary.  When I'm running Microsoft Narrator and I go to type a URL into the location area, Firefox crashes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Microsoft Narrator: Start Menu / All Programs / Accessories / Accessibility / Narrator
2. Run Firefox
3. type something into the location area.

Actual Results:  
Firefox freezes and needs to be shut down with Task Manager.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should let you type in a URL into the location bar without freezing.

I don't believe there is anything partularly noteworthy about my computer.  I'm running Windows XP Professional and a standard copy of Firefox I downloaded off www.mozilla.org version 1.0.7.
