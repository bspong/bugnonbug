about:config crashes OS with adblock and filterset.G updater

Having Adblock extension and filter rules for it updated by filterset.G updater extension causes a problem with firefox UI, or rather, OS resource depletion by it. 

filterset.G updater extension keeps up to date a huge list of blockable url patterns for Adblock extension. 
With it installed, Adblock has a pretty large list of filters. 
All these are stored in a single pref line (in prefs.js). This line is really really very long. 

involing about:config (to edit prefs) in Firefox having this setup causes OS crash. 

What happens is that firefox opens the config UI and tries to create the imensely huge single line with all the filters for Adblock. This puts too much strain on Win98 GUI resources and follows a OS crash, just good for the reset button. The resource meter app shows resources going down to zero.

Happens every time on Win98SE. Not tested however on other OS.
