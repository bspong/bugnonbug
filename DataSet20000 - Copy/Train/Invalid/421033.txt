Error handling multiple same form values array in PHP
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080203 SUSE/2.0.0.12-5.1 Firefox/2.0.0.12
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080203 SUSE/2.0.0.12-5.1 Firefox/2.0.0.12

When handling multiple "same" form values with PHP, Firefox does not properly form the URL. For example, with the simple form script:

<html>
<head><title>Workflow System</title></head>
<body>
<h1>Register for an Account:</h1>
<form action="registration_action.php" method="GET">

Username: <input type="text" name="name" /><br />
Email: <input type="text" name="email" /><br />
Password: <input type="password" name="pword[]" /><br />
Password (again): <input type="password" name="pword[]" /><br />

<input type="submit" value="GO" />
</form>
</body>
</html>

Firefox forms the following URL:

http://localhost/build/registration_action.php?name=Johhie&email=Joh%40home&pword=passw&pword%5B%5D=passw

Note the handling of "pword" above. It should be formed as follows for proper handling:

http://localhost/build/registration_action.php?name=Johhie&email=Joh%40home&pword%5B%5D=passw&pword%5B%5D=passw

I can't explain it? It works fine in konqueror. The example comes from page 3 of IBM's Developer Works:

https://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/os-phptut1/section3.html

Even though I don't know much about array handling, I know enough to know that having two of the major browsers not agreeing on how to handle a beginners example is not a good thing.

The action script that receives this data is:

<?php

   define("PAGE_TITLE", "Workflow Registration");

?>


<html>
<title><?= PAGE_TITLE ?></title>
<body>
    <p>You entered:</p>

<?php
    $form_names = array_keys($_GET);
    $form_values = array_values($_GET);

    foreach ($_GET as $key=>$value) {
       echo "<p>".$key." = " . $value . "</p>"; 
    }

    $passwords = $_GET["pword"];
    echo "First password = ".$passwords[0];
    echo "<br />";
    echo "Second password = ".$passwords[1];

?>
</body>
</html>

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use the form script in the details above
2. Enter data and press go
3. Compare the URL formed by Firefox to the URL formed by Konqueror 

(one of them is wrong -- the action script doesn't work with the Firefox URL, works fine in Konqueror)
Actual Results:  
The first multiple same array value is passed without the [] charachers %5B%5D messing up the URL

Expected Results:  
Both instances of the multiple same array value should be passed with the [] charachers %5B%5D
