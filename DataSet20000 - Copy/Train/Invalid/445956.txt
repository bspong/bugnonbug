for a long time i'm using roboform in firefox and i never liked the fact that in the hebrew languge or other right to left broswser there is barely two button at the end of the toolbar and the rest are hidden and in the english version everything is ok but now i know what the source of the problem the source is that despite the great hebrew translation the core of FF is still from left to right and not from right to left like in the hebrew versions of IE so in the english version all the toolbars are sticiking to the left side 
of the broswe and so they have room to spread but in the hebrew version the broswe and in other right to left versions the toolbars stick to the right and that is why he doesn't have enaf room to bread :) so whats happen is that 90 percent of the toolbar space and i suppose any toolbar not just roboform has that problem display only one or two buttons and then an arrow for all the other button and the rest of the toolbar is left empty as you can see in this pictures i have uploaded here so if you can fix it some how then that would be great and thanks a lot in advance.:)

p.s according to what i see the problem is with FF not the toolbar but if i'm wrong i'm still hopping that you can do something about this problem any way.:)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.install hebrew or arabic firefox recomended on herbrew or arabic os but not absolutley necesery i belive
2.install roboform and roboform addon for firefox 
3.start firefox and that is 
Actual Results:  
the toolbar stick to the right but with out enaf space to display all the buttons so he display only two buttons and arrow for all the rest.


if you need any more information just ask me at aviramof@gmail.com and since it's a big problem that should effect all toolbars in all the right to left browser version i call it a major problem and thanks in advance.:)
