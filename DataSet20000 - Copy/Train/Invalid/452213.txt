following upgrade of firefox today, a much utilised process of dragging image to a waiting application ceases to function, shut down and restart have not made a difference. ironically i can drag the image to the desktop and then drag to the appplication, often image gets hidden whilst lost on desktop, nothing else appears to have changed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. identify image to be utilised from google image search
2. in tag&rename (http://www.softpointer.com/tr.htm) highlight mp3 file right click for edit tag in selected file, select ADD (directory folder opens)
3. from the stored on-line image, right click doesn't work, left click drags a translucent image to the correct location, but no selection rectangle appears and image cannot be left there.
4. dragging the image to microsoft outlook email does work, so its likely to be an issue between firefox and tag&rename (i will write to them as well)
Actual Results:  
no image in tag&rename

Expected Results:  
image copied across successfully
