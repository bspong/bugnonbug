Installing into a directory that doesn't exist doesn't work
Installing into a directory that doesn't exist doesn't work properly.

Steps to reproduce:

1) Run trunk installer
2) Choose "Custom"
3) Type a number after the suggested install location, e.g.

C:\Program Files\Minefield3

NOTE: the directory doesn't exist yet!

4) Finish installation

RESULTS:
The installation directory has a directory structure created, but the files are never installed.
