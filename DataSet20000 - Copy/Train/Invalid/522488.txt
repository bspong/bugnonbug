Tab bar takes a height of three rows when first row is full with tabs (multiple rows in tab bar enabled) [caused by TabMixPlus]
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

If there are too many tabs to fit in one row, then a wrap around occurs and a second row with tabs is created in the tab bar. However, the height of the tab bar provides space for not only two, but three rows of tabs, although only two are necessary. This problem occurs only if there are two rows of tabs, if a third or fourth (...) row is added, then the height of the tab bar matches the number of rows.

Note: I have the addon Tab-Mix-Plus installed, but it seems to be a problem with firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. (Possibly install Tab-Mix-Plus)
2. Open a lot of tabs, such that not all fit in one row (in the tab bar).
3. See for yourself
Actual Results:  
Height of tab bar is wrong (too large, corresponding to three rows of tabs).

Expected Results:  
Tab bar should have the correct height (two rows).
