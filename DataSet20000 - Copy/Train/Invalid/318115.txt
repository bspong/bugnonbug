incorrect margin in table td below an image only when doctype specified

If a page is considered xhtml 1.0 (doctype is in place), below an image in a table a 5px-margin appears at the bottom side of the image between the image and the td cell

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
see the attached source in firefox or deer park

Actual Results:  
There is a 5px-red border below the image

Expected Results:  
If one deletes the line <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"> one can see that the border vanishes and no red is seen any more. This would be the expected result for the source.

I think this could be a bug in gecko??
