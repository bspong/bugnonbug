When I do a search in google and my results come thru this website shows up when I am loading one of my search results www.daytotals.com and it won't let me open any pages or load any pages on google or mozilla. Is there a way I can block this website or bug or page whatever it may be.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I open google search for say cats
2.google shows me search results 
3.I click on say the first one and instead of going to the link of my search result it either goes to this website www.daytotals.com or just won't open and load and it shows up as if it was going thru daytotals.
Actual Results:  
this awful page or whatever it is keeps intruding in my searches and what not www.daytotals.com it shows up when google is trying to load a page or when a page say for instant msn is trying to load it intrudes and it starts loading thru this daytotals site. It won't let me load of open pages.

Expected Results:  
www.daytotals.com keeps showing up in search when I am loading one of my search results. Usually when you search for something on google or any search engine you get your search results and you click on the link and it goes directly to link now it wont load and it goes thru www.daytotals.com

How can I block this website or whatever it is?
