I just discovered that if you hit the "Options" multiple times you get as many options windows. This happens in Firefox 4.0 Beta

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to "Tools"
2. Select "Downloads"
3. Then click "Options" more than once.
Actual Results:  
The "Option" window will appear as many times as you clicked "Options" 

Expected Results:  
The software should display only one instance of the Downloads' option window.
