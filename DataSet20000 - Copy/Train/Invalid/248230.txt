(As there is no Networking category for Firefox, this bug has to be filed here
in General.)
The gopher browsing in Firefox is weak.

It is actually a behavoir carried over from 1.7 (bug 194220).

One of the problems is missing information tag. 
Can the fix from bug 118438 be incorporated into firefox?

(Can this bug be one for general linking of gopher bugs in FF?)
