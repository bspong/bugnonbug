If your create a form field of type text and name it the same as a password field, pressing the down arrow in that field will show you a list of remembered form data for password type fields of the same name from a different page. Example exploit.
* Your daughter has an account on myspace and you want to know the username and password. 
* Form auto-complete must be enabled the last time she logged in.
* You find the field names of the username and password on myspace.
* you create a html document with the following form fields.
<form>
<input type='text' name='myspace-user-field-name' />
<input type='text' name='myspace-pass-field name' />
</form>
* browse to the new html document
* click in to a field and press the down arrow key. Yoou will be given a list of all form data entered in to fields named the same.
* since the password field is a text type it displays the password in plain text.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enable form auto-complete feature
2.Log in and out of any website
3.Create special web page with two form fields that have the same name as the target website but set the type for both fields to TEXT
4.Browse to new page, select a field and press the down arrow
5.You will see a list of all form data for any field with the same name
Actual Results:  
You are shown, in plain text, the form data (including passwords) of any field (from any website) with the same name.

Expected Results:  
Password field data should only be completed if the field type matches the original field. Presumably 'PASSWORD'

I am not sure if you can simulate the same behavior using a script embeded in a web page. If you can, this bug is much worse.
