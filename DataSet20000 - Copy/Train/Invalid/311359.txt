Bug on Firefox 1.5 Beta2 Linux installation
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8b5) Gecko/20051004 Firefox/1.4.1

jim@Jim-ubuntu:~/firefox-installer$ The program 'firefox-bin' received an X
Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)'.
  (Details: serial 1617 error_code 3 request_code 20 minor_code 0)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
