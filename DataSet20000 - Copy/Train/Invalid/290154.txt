For some reason when you press a link which points to a zip file, the Save File
dialog is openend twice (you can select save or cancel and when finished the
dialog appears again).

In the page at http://www.geocities.com/jmordax/testcase.html there are three
links to demostrate the problem. Failing one is the first one. What is different
from the other two ones, is that it points to a different server from the HTML
page one.

After some research, the same test page in other server different from
Geocities.com it doesn't happen. So it seems to be related with Geocities.com
server. So looking for differences, I found that Geocities.com adds some
JavaScript code which could be the problem.

This problem, happens also with Mozilla 1.7.6 and InternetExplorer 6.0 without
WinXP SP2. After installing WinXP SP2 the problem dissapears. Searching the web,
I found this technote from Microsoft which I think can offer some light:
