Phoenix opens a totally different page from the one typed in

I am doing some web testing on my machine named dirt2.  I forgot to start IIS
and attempted to login to my pages using Phoenix/Firebird.  The URL to these
pages on my machine is http://dirt2/custinfo/login.asp.  Instead of showing me a
"Page not found" screen, I am forwarded to
http://havc.org/havc/photos/gallerys/tree_sit_the%20Art_of%20_resistance/pages/Dirt2.htm,
which I am not affiliated with at all.  This happens on all machines using
Phoenix/Firebird in the office and on my machine at home using a totally
different ISP.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Make sure you do not have a local machine named dirt2, or if you do, make
sure it does not have a webserver running.
2.  Type "http://dirt2/custinfo/login.asp" in the address bar.
3.  Press "Enter".

Actual Results:  
I get forwarded to a stranger's page.  The page URL that loads is
http://havc.org/havc/photos/gallerys/tree_sit_the%20Art_of%20_resistance/pages/Dirt2.htm

Expected Results:  
Shown a "Page Not Found" message.

I don't know what is going on in the code, but it looks like either some kind of
web search is occuring, or someone placed a small "Easter Egg" in the code.
