NSIS installer does not work on trunk builds
Is the NSIS installer suposed to be working on the trunk now?

When I do my own builds, a firefox-3.0a1.en-US.win32.installer.exe file is creaded in dist/sea.

However, attemtping to execute it results in a pop-up saying "Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file.  You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item."
