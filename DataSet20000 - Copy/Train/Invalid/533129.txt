If ".com" is not added to URL, the browser goes to the IP's search page.

When I type in the URL of a website without ".com", the browser immediately went to a search for what was typed in the URL bar. This happens even though there is only one suggestion left in the drop-down menu. The past version(s) would go to the site specified without ".com". For example, in the past entering "addictinggames" would lead directly to AddictingGames.com. However, it now leads to a search (the IP's search) for "addictinggames".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a new tab
2. Type in "addictinggames" (or similar for any other site, exclude the ".com")

Actual Results:  
The browser re-directed to an IP search for 'addictinggames'.

Expected Results:  
The browser should re-direct to AddictingGames.com
