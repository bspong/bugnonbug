The Mac version of Mozilla Firefox is not able to display PDF files directly in the browser window due to the lack of an according plugin.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Surf to a Web page with a link to a PDF file;
2. Click on the lik to the PDF file.
Actual Results:  
Mozilla Firefox opens the download dialogue.

Expected Results:  
Mozilla Firefox should display the PDF file in the browser window (actually the default behaviour of the Windows version of Mozilla Firefox).

I assume that Mozilla Firefox on the Mac cannot display PDF files in the browser window due to the lack of a working Universal Binary PDF plugin. The plugin available at http://www.schubert-it.com/pluginpdf/ is working but PowerPC only. Other plugins working with Mozilla Firefox are obviously not available, neither from Adobe (even with Adobe Reader 8.0 installed) nor from Apple (Safari is able to display PDF files in the browser windows).
