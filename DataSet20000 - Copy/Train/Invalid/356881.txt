Data corruption on disk makes firefox folder/files inaccessable, windows initiates disk check on next reboot.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; WOW64; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04320; InfoPath.1)
Build Identifier: 1.6a1

I am running Vista X64 RC1 build 5600 and Firefox X64 1.6a1.  After using FF for a day or two, the firefox shortcut stops working and when I try to access the folder windows reports that the datat is corrupt.  There is no other files on the disk that are also corrupt or any other data corruption issues with my running of vista.  Windows initiates disk chech when I reboot, and repairs or deletes many/all of the firefox files.  Many can be found after the reboot in the C:\found.00x\dir000x.chk folders.

It is strange that the only files that seem to be corrupting are firefox related.  

Also, when disk check completes, windows reports that there was insufficient space for the master file table bitmap architecture to be repaired.

cheers.
