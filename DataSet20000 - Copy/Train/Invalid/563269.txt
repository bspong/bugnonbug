Browser sometimes hangs while attempting to play video.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20100413 Firefox/3.6.4 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Since installing the Firefox 3.6.4 beta, Firefox will hang during attempts to watch videos on sites such as youtube.com (not exclusively). I am running the Flashblock 1.5.13 extension. After clicking on a Flash video to disable Flashblock, I click on the video, so that it will begin to play. As the video begins to load, Firefox will hang. I cannot induce any response from it by clicking on other tabs, menus, and buttons. The only way to close Firefox is through Task Manager.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. visit a website with playable Flash-based videos, such as youtube.com.
2. select a video to watch.
3. click the 'play' button in the Flash window to disable the Flashblock extension for that element, and click the 'play' button on the video.
4. if Firefox does not hang, attempt changing playback options (advance playback, full screen, adjust video volume, etc.).
Actual Results:  
Most often (4 out of 5 attempts), Firefox will hang as soon as the video starts to load. If the video does begin to play without hanging Firefox, attempts to 'fast-forward' or otherwise alter the playback conditions may cause Firefox to hang.

Expected Results:  
The videos should play without causing Firefox to hang.
