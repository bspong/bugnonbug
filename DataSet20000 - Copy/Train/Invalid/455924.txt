Firefox uses 64MB when first started
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1

I open Firefox with all add-ons disabled.  I look at the task manager and see one window of Firefox is running and one tab is opened to the default home page ( http://www.google.com/firefox?client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official )and it is using 64MB of memory already.  Something is not right.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on  Firefox (Safe Mode)
2. Click on Disable Add-ons
3. Click the option to restart Firefox
4. Open Task Manager and see that Firefox is using 64MB or more of memory
Actual Results:  
Firefox using way too much memory

Expected Results:  
I as expecting it to use 30 percent of that amount or less when I disabled all add-ons and restarted the browser
