Three days ago, news links from my My Yahoo home page stopped working.  Clicking on the links does not load the page and Firefox gives up after about a minute or so. 

Troubleshooting steps taken: 

1.Attempted to reproduce problem in Windows Explorer.  Problem does not occur with that browser.

2. Downloaded and installed version of Firefox 1.5.0.6 today.  Problem continues.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to My Yahoo homepage
2.Click on news link
3.

Actual Results:  
Link does not load and browser times out.  In addition, I've noticed the "Y" Yahoo logo on the news content links summary is missing.

Expected Results:  
News story links should load as they have.
