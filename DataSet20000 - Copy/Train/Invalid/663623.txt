Specific links can't be clicked when placed within frames. You can still open them via the context menu with "Open in new tab" or with "Open in new window", but just clicking on them doesn't work. Focusing those links with the tab key and pressing return doesn't work as well.

See http://www.magic-tagger.com/bugzilla/frameset.html for a reproducible minimal W3C validated HTML test case. As far as I can tell, only Firefox 4 is affected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://www.magic-tagger.com/bugzilla/frameset.html
2. Click on the "Not working link"

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
Link opens.

There is no obvious reason why the first link works and the second one doesn't.
