i hibernate my computer and rarely restart it (to its perspective) I noticed many old files for rounds of firefox sessions, mostly flash video files, but also many files wthat were directly opened from the internet.

Firefox should have exit handlers that run even if Firefox crashes unexpectedly that cleans up these files. The only time they should be acceptable to remain is if Firefox was killed with -9 SIGKILL.

Reproducible: Always




i just upgraded to 3.0.7, but was using 3.0.6
