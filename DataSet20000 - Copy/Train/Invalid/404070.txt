After upgrade to 2.0.0.9 from 2.0.0.8 I was searching and used the toolbar next to the address bar I always use google but it came up with a results page on google.co.jp and in Japaneses instead of google.com. I checked the other two computers and the other Vista did the same thing checked my XP machine before the upgrade and it work fine but after upgrade it did the same in Japaneses. It was easy to change the language to English but is this site safe it asked for my Google user name and password which I didn't give but I had no problems with 2.0.0.8 it would already be logged into Google to check mail use docs and calender.
