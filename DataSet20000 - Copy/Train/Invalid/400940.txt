Open Java Console refuses to work under Firefox 2.0.0.8 - switches Java off instead
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071008 Firefox/2.0.0.8

I'm not sure where this should really be filed.  It relates to the Open Java Console add-on, but it could be either a bug in Firefox itself or a compatibility change that the add-on just needs to be updated to.

Under Firefox 2.0.0.7, the Open Java Console add-on worked without trouble.  However, after the automatic upgrade to 2.0.0.8, I cannot get it to work at all.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to reproduce:
1. Have the Open Java Console add-on installed.

2. Have Java enabled.  Confirm this by issuing
    javascript:alert(navigator.javaEnabled())

3. Tools -> Java Console

4. Issue
    javascript:alert(navigator.javaEnabled())
again.

5. Tools -> Java Console again.


Actual results:
2. navigator.javaEnabled() returns true.

3. Nothing visibly happens.  The Java Console doesn't open.

4. navigator.javaEnabled() returns false.  However, under Tools -> Options -> Content, "Enable Java" is still ticked.

5. A message dialog box states "The Java support in the browser has been disabled."

The result is the same if I omit step 2 and/or 4.  If I disable and re-enable Java from Tools -> Options, it returns to the enabled state, and then the same steps produce the same result.

Tried restarting Firefox.  Tried restarting Windows.  Tried uninstalling and reinstalling the add-on (and yes, I did restart Firefox after each step here).  No change.

Expected results:
Opened the Java Console when I told it to, and not disabled Java without me telling it to.
