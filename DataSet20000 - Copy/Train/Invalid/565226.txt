Hi, I have found two instances where mozilla either crashes or hangs windows 7 (Home premium and Ultimate versions):
1. While browsing through emails in mail.yahoo and trying to go to jeevansathi.com from a link that is present in the email.
2. When one goes to "Forwarding and POP/IMAPI" setting under gmail settings and clicks the liink "Configure instruction" under POP Download.

I had to shut down my laptop by pressing the power butten for about 6 seconds.

Please provide a quick fix.

Thanks and regards,
Rajeev Arora
