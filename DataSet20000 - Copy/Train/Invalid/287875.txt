There are really two issues here. One: the add bookmark/rename bookmark/add
folder panels in the add bookmark sheet and manager use one sole tab to say
"info". This one tab does not look good in OS X as it is a 'sole" tab. There are
surely other ways of describing what the window is doing. Tabs are only to be
used when selecting multible panels in one window. and
B) If there is no other way of changing the above, at least overhaul the sole
tab so that it meshes with the current tab interface. The current tabs are
actual buttons centered at the top of an embedded panel. I'll upload a picture.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Look at any "add" or "rename" panel concerning bookmarks.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Uses tabs/uses wrong tab interface

Expected Results:  
Shouldn't use tabs/should use current OS 10.3+ tab interface.
