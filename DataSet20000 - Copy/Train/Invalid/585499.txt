It seems to be that trace monkey doesn't even see the else if checks for the values so long as there are more than 2 values for the values that i've already stated. They seem to be 105-169 and 203-238. I cannot figure out why this is happenign though

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to url and look at the code or code your own with more than 2 options in the if/else if.
2.check to see if it fires off the code if the variable equals 105-169 or 203-238.
3.write an alert or something similar to see if it does go off which it won't.
Actual Results:  
it doesn't work plain and simple.

Expected Results:  
I expect it to actually do the code block that's supposed to be ran to run which it isn't in this case. Switching around the values ie 104's spot for 105 doesn't seem to change it.

It seems to be something within the core bits of trace monkey, it also happens in chromium so it's something deep within the core ideal of the javascript engine.
