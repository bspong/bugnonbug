I was trying to log onto www.stumbleupon.com, which told me I needed the latest
version (1.0.6) which I downloaded. The programme loads OK but when I try to
access any webpage from my home page the programme crashes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Loads OK to home page
2.Attempt to access any webpage
3.Firefox crashes




I have reinstalled an older version of Firefox.
This is a very complicated way of reporting faults, next time I won't bother,
I'll just give up on Mozill (which up to now I have found very useful) and use
another programme!
