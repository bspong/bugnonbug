Changing File|Open file... location on one profile also changes all other profiles (and versions)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1a2pre) Gecko/2008073103 Minefield/3.1a2pre

When having multiple profiles and versions of Firefox (eg Firefox 3.0.1 release and Firefox nightly build), as well as having separate profiles for each release, Firefox uses the same directory when File|Open file... is clicked. 

If the directory is C:\Program Files\Firefox on profile 1, it will be the same on profile 2, even if it is running on a different installation.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new profile (using Run... firefox -P)
2. Open a file with the first profile, using File|Open file...
3. Run 2nd profile and attempt to open file.
4. File location is same as the first profile.
5. Even running separate versions of Firefox has these issues (i.e. Profile 1 with Firefox and Profile 2 with Minefield)


Expected Results:  
For security reasons, shouldn't it be better for each profile to have a separate memory for each profile? It might be something like browser.open.dir, similar to the already implemented browser.download.dir.
Alternatively, could File|Open file... start at the same location (as in Internet Explorer, I believe My Documents is default) and not be affected by Saving a file - I know a few bugs have been filed on that subject.
