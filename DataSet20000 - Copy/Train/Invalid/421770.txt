Iceweasel search bar prepends the phrase "Just Added" to all search strings

Bizarre this one, sure it is probably easy to fix.  I ran automatic updates yesterday (am running Debian etch) but I'm afraid I didn't notice whether iceweasel was updated - anyway since then any search I run from the search bar prepends "Just Added" to the search phrase (regardless of search provider selected).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type something in iceweasel search bar
2. Hit carriage return
3. Observe phrase in search engine query text field
Actual Results:  
Search engine is sent query with Just+Added+ prepending your search string 

Expected Results:  
Searcvh engine is sent search string as typed in search bar
