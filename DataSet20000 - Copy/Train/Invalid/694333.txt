Screenshot showing imported bookmarks and bookmarks toolbar.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:9.0a2) Gecko/20111012 Firefox/9.0a2

Steps to reproduce:

I have separate profiles for the different channels of Firefox.  I tend to use Aurora mostly, so I wanted my bookmarks from my 'default' profile moved over.  In Firefox 7.0.1, I exported my bookmarks as bookmarks.html.  I then fired up Aurora and imported the bookmarks.html.


Actual results:

The bookmarks appear in the Bookmarks dropdown menu, but they do not appear on the Bookmarks Toolbar - even though the 'Bookmarks Toolbar' folder on the Bookmarks dropdown shows it to be properly populated


Expected results:

I expected the Bookmarks Toolbar to be populated with my imported bookmarks contained in the Bookmarks Toolbar.
