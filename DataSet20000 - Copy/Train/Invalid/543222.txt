Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a HTML file in a directory that contains multiple HTML files
2. Change the zoom level
3. Open another HTML file or follow a link
Actual Results:  
Zoom level only remembered for individual pages

Expected Results:  
Zoom level remembered on a (hierarchical) directory basis would be the best solution.

For example, if "C:\openbook\index.html" is zoomed 150%, all other files in this directory (and its subdirectories?!) should be zoomed to the same level.

I hope this isn't by design. If so, is there an addon to circumvent this behavior?
