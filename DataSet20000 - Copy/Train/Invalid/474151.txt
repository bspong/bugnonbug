Video DownloadHelper 4.0.1 - Right-click context menu displays wrong menu items

When staring a new Firefox session, the context menu works as expected.  But very soon the context menu displays the wrong menu items.  For example, on a text box I get “Save Link As…, Send Link…, Copy Link Location”, and there are no “Copy, Cut, Paste” options.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open new Firefox session (context menu works as expected)
2. Navigate to any other site, open new tab, etc.
3. Right-click on any object
Actual Results:  
Context menu items not as expected.  Also menu items don't work at all.

Expected Results:  
Display the correct menu items, and menu items should work.

This problem started when I upgraded to FF 3.0.5
