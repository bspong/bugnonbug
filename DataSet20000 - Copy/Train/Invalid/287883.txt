Doesn't display image through JavaScript with content-type application/xhtml+xml
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2

I noticed the issue on http://jetsmarkskakklub.dk/v2/, where a 'Chart.dk' image
(/counter) isn't displayed in Firefox (and Mozilla, by the way, but works fine
in Opera). Narrowed it down to a problem with any kind of image loaded through
JavaScript, when content-type is set to application/xhtml+xml. Though the
JavaScript Console doesn't display any errors.
Made the following testcase:
