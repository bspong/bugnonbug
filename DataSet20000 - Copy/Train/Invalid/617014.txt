When sitting on a site that uses an automatic page refresh such as nytimes.com or slashdot.org, the processor usage by the process eventually maxes out, leaving the browser nearly unresponsive. If it responds enough to kill the offending tab, processor use immediately drops. This occurs on both Windows XP and Mac OS 10.6 with the current Firefox release, 3.6.12.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit nytimes.com or slashdot.org
2. leave the main page open while reading stories in other tabs
3. processor usage will max out
Actual Results:  
The system process eventually climbs to it's maximum (i.e. 100% of one core).

Expected Results:  
Processor usage should remain low
