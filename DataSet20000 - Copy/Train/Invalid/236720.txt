Popup Blocking breaks in v0.8 "Tabbrowser Extensions" by Shimoda Hiroshi

The URL given is a bookmarklet for http://www.furl.net - it opens a popup on
their site for entering bookmark details.  It has also been referred to at
http://gammatron.novarese.net/2004/03/03.html#a4000168

It seems that once you enable Tabbrowser Extensions, this bookmarklet and
perhaps other click-to-get-a-popup things no longer work.  Disabling the
extension lets that the bookmarket work again.

I installed the extension from http://texturizer.net/firefox/extensions/#tbe
1.10.2004030201 - it's come to my attention that this extension has since been
updated.

I realise that this may seem like an extension bug rather than a Firefox bug,
however I believe that it worked in v0.7, and TBE is a popular extension...
