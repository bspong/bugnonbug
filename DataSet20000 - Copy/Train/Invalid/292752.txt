1.0.3 does not load page and hangs after upgrade from 1.0.2
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705)
Build Identifier: Firefox hangs after 1.0.2 to 1.0.3 upgrade

I upgraded from working 1.0.2 to 1.0.3 and this is what happened:

1. Upgrade appeared to have worked ok.
2. Upon going to Firefox for any website, the page does display, but is empty.
3. The "loading" symbol keeps rotating and the hour glass shows. No change 
even after a long wait (20 minutes?)
4. After closing Firefox (clicking on X in upper right corner), window closes, 
but Taskmanager still shows FF as active
5. Impossible to delete FF on Taskmanager
6. Reboot
7. Remove FF using Control Panel
8. Download FF from Mozilla.org and reinstall
9. Problem persists.
10. Repeat steps 4-7
11. Regretfully moved to Internet Explorer
