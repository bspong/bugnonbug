Microsoft's alleged bugfix KB891711 has stopped both FireFox & Thunderbird from
running. As soon as either program is run it goes to a blue-screen and the only
option is to kill the application. I noticed a process in task manager with this
number & after terminating this task FireFox & Thunderbird run fine. This only
started happening after running latest windows update when this particular
bugfix was installed. This bugfix is supposed to be for all MicroSoft OSes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download & install KB891711 bugfix from MicrSoft
2. Try to run either FireFox or Thunderbird
3.

Actual Results:  
PC went to a blue-screen
