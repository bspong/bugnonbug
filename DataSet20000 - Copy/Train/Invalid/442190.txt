After the update of NoScript version 1.7.1. iGoogle loads with a 100% CPU Spike for a few seconds.

I have been using NoScript since I started using Firefox back when I received my laptop and since then NoScript has given me no problems. I'm not sure if exactly after of sometime after updating NoScript to 1.7.1. it was causing the CPU spikes so I did a test to see for myself. I ran Firefox (Currently Firefox 3) in safe mode then turned off all my addons. I went down the list of addons that would most likely be the culprit and turned them on one by one to see if it caused the CPU spike to no effect. The last addon I was at was NoScript and after turning it back on and restarting firefox it started the lag spike again. So I thought "maybe something happened to it" and uninstalled it/re-installed it. It did the exact same thing. So as of now I'm keeping it uninstalled until further notice and I will no longer browse unsuspecting sites as I depend on NoScript GREATLY...
