cannot use Mozilla file of bookmarks, it ignores
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040616

I tried to copy the bookmarks.html into the two places I found this original
file under defaults\profile and defaults\profile\US. However, it ignores these
bookmarks and uses its own. I rebooted, and checked that my list was still there.
This worked fine with Mozilla 1.7 copying those from Netscape.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. copy other bookmarks into these directories
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
it still used its own default bookmarks

Expected Results:  
used the ones I inserted
