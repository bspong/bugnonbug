Changing the minimum font size in Western also affects the font sizes used to
render Unicode pages.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to the sample Google page which is a Traditional Chinese page in UTF-8
encoding.
2.Open Firefox's Western fonts settings and change the minimum font size to some
big number list 24.
3.OK the preferences change

Actual Results:  
The sample page is rendered with the new minimum font size even thought the page
is in Unicode and there's a different minimum font size setting for Unicode.

Expected Results:  
The sample page should be rendered exact the same as before the minimum font
size change.

This is tested on Mac and Windows versions of Firefox with the same result.
