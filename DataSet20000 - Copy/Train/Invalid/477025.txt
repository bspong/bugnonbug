Firefox crashes after upgrade
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; mk; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011913 Firefox/3.0.6

When I try to open some sites or links from sites FF crashes and it says:
AppName: firefox.exe	 AppVer: 1.9.0.3306	 ModName: msvcr80.dll
ModVer: 8.0.50727.762	 Offset: 0004ef67
This is happening on different sites, so I think it is not a problem with broken page. My internet connection is running all the time without interruption.

Reproducible: Always
