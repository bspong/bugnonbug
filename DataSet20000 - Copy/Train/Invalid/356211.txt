The magnifying glass search button in the search bar does not have any drop-down text when hovered over, nor does the button to chose a different search engine.

Having button-specific drop-down text in the search bar might make the buttons' function a little more obvious to people who aren't as computer savvy.

Also, every other button in the default navigation toolbar has drop-down text.  Im not sure why the search bar was left out.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Hover your mouse pointer over the buttons in the search bar
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
No drop-down text appears when search bar buttons are hovered over

Expected Results:  
The drop-down text for the search engine button could say something like "Choose a search engine..."

and for the magnifying glass button it could simply say "Search".
