The "Subscribe to Live Bookmark" button that was in the bottom status bar is no
longer present.  Go to my blog (http://blog.codedread.com/) or any site that has
a RSS or Atom feed.  The RSS button is still in the address bar to see the RSS
pretty printing and you can still subscribe once you view the RSS, but the
status bar button is missing.

Also, the status bar has an item that just says "test" on it.  What is this item?
