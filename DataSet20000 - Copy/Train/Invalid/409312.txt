Firefox 3.0 Beta 2 no longer passes the ACID2 test (while Beta 1 did)

One thing I liked in Firefox 3.0 Beta 1 was seeing my favourite Browser passing the ACID2 Test. Obviously, this is broken again in Beta 2.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://webstandards.org/files/acid2/test.html
2. Take the ACID2 Test
Actual Results:  
You see the Face's eyes not being rendered correctly.

Expected Results:  
Render the Face correctly (see the reference rendering) as Beta 1 did.

Having a MacBook Pro, running (as you can see in the browser's info line) Mac OS X 10.4.11, using the `Proto` theme (version 0.8).
