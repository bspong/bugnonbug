Custom link styles in CSS (a:hover) when embedded in multiple DIV tags do not accurately track when mousing over

I am developing a site that has custom stlyes for links using the a:link,
a:hover and a:visted styles.  I am using links that are nested several <DIV>
tags deep.  One particular set of links are located at the top and are position
using abolute positioning.  The other set of links are at tbe bottom of the
page.  When I mouse over the bottom links, they seem to work fine.  When I mouse
over he top links, the targeting appears off, only the top few pixels of the
text seems to pick up the over event.  If I remove the links at the end of the
page, the top links work fine.  

I tested this page in several other browsers (IE 6, Netscape and Opera) and they
do not have a problem which lead me to believe it was a bug.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit the page in the link and you will see what I am talking about.  The
links at the top display strange mouseover behavior.




I'm marking this as a major feature that is broken because so many people use
CSS nowadays and customize their links that I think this would be a major problem.
