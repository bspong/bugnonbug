I browse these forums regularly.  whenever someone posts a link it shortens it by putting an ellipse(...) in between the characters after the .com and to the end.  When I activate the link it links me to a page where the ellipse is part of the url; this has never happened before.  This is a pretty minor problem, but it could ruin the forum for a few people so I thought I would bring it out.  the link in question is about half way down the page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to the page
2.click the link (about half way down the page)
3.observe that it opens as "http://i766.photobucket.com/albums/xx304/L...Reach_Terra.jpg"
Actual Results:  
it directed me to a url with the ellipse, making it 404.

Expected Results:  
it should have gone to the correct page.
