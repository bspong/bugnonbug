Poor image quality using mobile broadband - shift+A does not improve roll-over images ??

I have started using mobile broadband so images first come in low quality, which can all be improved by pressing SHIFT+A - however, rollover images from the background of the web page do not increase in quality to a higher resolution so roll-over buttons or image-swap set-ups look really ugly .... is there any way to force highest quality in these pre-loading images?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use mobile broadband
2. Use SHIFT+A to improve image quality
3. Roll your mouse over any dynamic jpg image; like a roll-over button or an image swap map 
Actual Results:  
Underlying images remain very low quality 

Expected Results:  
Ideally, one would hope that on SHIFT+A all images associated with the page would be increased to high quality not just those being shown ....

I searched as many bug reports as I could in various forums - a lot of people have this problem but I could find no offers of a fix - the whole mobile broadband/SHIFT+A (all shown images) or SHIFT+R (a single image) issue is annoying but understandable, however maybe a SHIFT+[some other letter] needs to be created that ups the quality of underlying images .... ??
