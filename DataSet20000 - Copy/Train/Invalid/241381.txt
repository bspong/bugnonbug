Executing the FAQ fix above, does now open the compose window when clicking a
Mailto: link but does *not* transfer the mailto: e-mail address from the link
into the Mzilla compose "To:" field.  I suspect the %1 at the end of the (None)
URL:MailTo Protocol setting is supposed to do this but the TO: field is left blank.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. open firefox browser (after applying FAQ URL:Mailto protocol fix)
2. go to any web page with a mailto: link and click the link.
3. note that mozilla compose window opens with an empty TO: field

Actual Results:  
mozilla compose window opens with ampty TO: field

Expected Results:  
the TO: field should have the e-mail address transferred to it from the
originally clicked mailto: link.
