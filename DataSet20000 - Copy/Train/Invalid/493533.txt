When typing in directly into the address bar the following search terms, 100% halal gijs kerbosch, Firfox does not make any attempt to goto google to search.  No search results are returned and the browser does not make any activitiy at all.

I expect it is becase it starts with a number which would make it similar to an ip address.  

enjoy. :)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. put this text in search bar (with out quotes) "100% halal gijs kerbosch"
2. press enter
3. watch what happens....nothing, not even a blip on the radar screen
Actual Results:  
No movement of browser to access google or change the current page

Expected Results:
