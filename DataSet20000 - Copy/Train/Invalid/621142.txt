When you zoom in on Google Maps using Google Chrome, you can see smooth transititions of the map. The now loaded resolution of the map zooms in and after that rendering of higher resolution tiles starts on top of it. In Firefox 4, the whole process is slower but what is the problem I want to describe here is that during every zoom-in, grey background flashes in and on top of this grey background rendering of higher resolution starts. It is really annoying and makes you feel that the maps are even slower because you can’t see the previous resolution of the map during loading of higher resolution.

The same problem occurs even when zooming out where the resolutions are of course vice versa. Higher resolution, then loading lower resolution over grey backround instead of zoomed-out lower resolution tiles.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Google Maps
2. Zoom in and out
Actual Results:  
Grey background is flashing in during the zooming.

Expected Results:  
The zooming should be smooth as in Google Chrome.
