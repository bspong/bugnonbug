Firefox overruns charset setting of webpage

http://mirror.vtx.ch/lfs/blfs/view/svn/ is displayed with utf-8 encoding, so the
(c) sign is displayed as a question mark (I don't have any utf-8 fonts
installed).  The website-source has:
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="
    text/html; charset=iso-8859-1" />
and the default character encoding is set to western (iso-8859-1), but it's
overrun by firefox. It's impossible to choose the charset in View -> Character
Encoding, it switches back to utf-8 immediately.
It doesn't happen on http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/, which is
exactly the same code.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://mirror.vtx.ch/lfs/blfs/view/svn/
2. Try to change charset to iso-8859-1

Actual Results:  
charset jumps back to utf-8 automatically

Expected Results:  
choose the charset defined in the source code
