If I scroll my mouse quickly (8+ or so 'clicks') Firefox acts as if I have hit the forward or back buttons (a down scroll is like back, an upward scroll like forward).

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
Not really applicable, I have not changed any settings.
Actual Results:  
Scrolling my mouse quickly up or down makes Firefox act as if I have hit the forward or back buttons (a down scroll is like back, an upward scroll like forward).

Expected Results:  
Page should scroll quickly upwards.

The mouse is 'Wireless Optical Mouse 2.0' made by Microsoft. It came as part of the "Wireless Comfort Desktop 2.0A" package.

This bug is similar to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=207665 though I do not use a KVM switch, and I do not have to be moving the mouse for this to occur.

The output from scrolling on the xev window is this:

I only have one extension, refspoof. Also using the standard theme.
