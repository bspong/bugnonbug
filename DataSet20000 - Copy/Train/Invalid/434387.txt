image is not shown correctly when image url is opened

When Firefox opens image url (for ex., from "Open image" popup menu item), cursor changes to waiting style and nothing happens. After Escape button is pressed, image is loaded and shown correctly. When tab is switched and then switched back, Firefox reports that image can't be shown as it contains errors (I can't give exact English version). After that, image could be shown if tab is switched, but constant condition is that error message.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open an image url.
2. Press escape to show it (as Firefox is stuck waiting for something).
3. Switch to other tab and then return. 
Actual Results:  
Error message is shown.

Expected Results:  
Image should be displayed without any problems after its URL is entered in address bar.

I guess it's connected with bug 398475
