New add-on manager causes extension compatibility problems

The new in-tab extension manager has caused many extensions, such as WOT, Greasemonkey, Zotero, and Ubiquity, to stop working. On examination of the Error Console, it seems the Javascript reference to the extension manager is broken, generating errors such as these:

Error: Components.classes['@mozilla.org/extensions/manager;1'] is undefined
Source File: chrome://zotero/content/xpcom/zotero.js
Line: 187

This makes many extensions stop working completely. The reference to the extension manager should be reverted or co-exist with whatever the current reference is.

Reproducible: Always
