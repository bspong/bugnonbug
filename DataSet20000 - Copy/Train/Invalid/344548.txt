Problem parsing links if another object in a page shares the same name/id as the anchor you're linking to

I noticed this while attempting to create a page that used a list of links to browse to different sections of that same page (internal links or "bookmarks").

It's hard to explain without using examples, so I'll illustrate with code:

Say I have a link - <a href="#foo">Bar</a>
An image below the link - <img src="foo.gif" name="foo" id="foo">
And then a named anchor - <a name="foo" id="foo"></a>

I want the link to direct the browser to scroll down to the named anchor.  What ends up happening is the browser is directed to the image instead.  I assume that this will happen with any object in the page that shares the same name/id was the image.  Whichever object the browser encounters first will be where the link is directed to.  Please view the above URL to see the problem in action.

Now, I was unable to find any information on standardization of object names and ids on the web, so perhaps it's just bad form for a designer to name two different objects the same thing.  But testing this in other browsers, I was unable to replicate the problem.  It may be that all the other browsers handle links to objects incorrectly and Firefox is the only one following standards, I don't know.  I was always under the impression that an href could only point to a named anchor or another page, not a specific object within a page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a page with a link, a named image, and an anchor of the same name
2. Click the link.
3. Boom!
