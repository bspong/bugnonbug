When entering private browsing quickly, Firefox eats CPU a lot and loads a page slowly.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091201 Firefox/3.5.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091201 Firefox/3.5.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Throws out the following error in Error Console:

Error: redeclaration of const nsIWebNavigation Source 
File: chrome://browser/content/browser.js
Line: 7

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Copy the URL "http://www.google.com" into your PC's memory (clipboard)
2.Ctrl+Shift+P (tools - start private browsing)
3.Enter (accept button at the dialog)
4.Paste the clipboard contents in the URL-bar and press Enter (quickly)
Actual Results:  
Firefox will stay "connecting to www.google.com..." for about a minute, eating 80~100% of CPU.

Expected Results:  
With my connection, Firefox normally loads this page in 3 seconds or less. Usually not more than 10% of CPU.

I have encountered this issue three or four times in December, couldn't wait that long until the page loads, had to close Firefox. Then, I tried to reproduce it, and reported it here.
