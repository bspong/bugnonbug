Visited link color does not work in Firefox 0.9.2. This occures in all 3 Firefox
installs I have completed so far, on 3 different machines. It doesn't matter
what I select in the link color preferences. Even selecting "always use my
colors" has no effect. Hovers colors are functional. It's only visited colors
that fail.
