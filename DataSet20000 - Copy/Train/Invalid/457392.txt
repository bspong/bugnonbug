Firefox forces itself to be default browser
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; InfoPath.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30)

Before installing Firefox, IE6 was my default browser.  In Outlook, if I clicked on a link in a message, the page loaded in IE6.  After installing Firefox, clicking on the link in the Outlook message loads Firefox instead of IE6.  I've even set the checkbox in IE6 to say that IE6 should check to make sure it is the default.  The only ways that I've found to restore IE6 to the default browser is to uninstall Firefox or to open Windows Explorer -> File Types and change the application for URLs and Secure URLs to be IE6.  Firefox should not force itself to be the default browser.
