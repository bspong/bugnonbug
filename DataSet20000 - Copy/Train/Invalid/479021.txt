I am developing a CSS for my personal web page, and I can't click on the links of the menu. It woorks fine in IE, but it does not work in ff3.

I am attaching the XHTML and CSS files.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the .htm file I am sending to reproduce the bug with FF3.
2.Try to click on the links I marked with a red dotted border.
Actual Results:  
Can't click on the links. The links behave as normal text.

Expected Results:  
Follow the link and open the other page.
