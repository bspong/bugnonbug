Cannot drag URL to subfolders on Bookmarks Toolbar
When dragging a URL to a subfolder on the Bookmarks Toolbar, the subfolder
closes before the icon is dropped.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Turn on the Bookmarks Toolbar
2. Create a folder on the toolbar and add a few links
3. Restart Firefox
4. Go to any page
5. Drag the proxy icon from the location bar to the folder on the Bookmarks
Toolbar, wait for the folder to open and then drop the icon somewhere below the
second bookmark in the folder.
6. Repeat step 5.

Expected result:
In step 6 the folder should behave like in step 5, i.e. it should stay open
until the icon is dropped.

Actual result:
In step 6 the folder closes, when the cursor moves below the first bookmark in
the folder.

This bug prevents the user from adding a bookmark to a specific place in the
folder using drag'n'drop. The only way to add a bookmark to the folder is to
drop the icon on the folder name or on the first bookmark in the folder. This
will add the link as the last or first bookmark in the folder, respectively.

This problems also exists in the suite.

It only experience this problem on Linux. On Windows it works fine.

The are quite a lot of bugs regarding drag'n'drop on the Bookmarks Toolbar, but
I haven't been able to find a bug describing this exact problem.
