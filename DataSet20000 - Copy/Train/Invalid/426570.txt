Quick Locale Switcher (QLS) 1.6.5.1 automatically downloaded for updating an then I installed at 2/04/2008 20:00 (Budapest time) and it made to disappear all my menues up in the window and left in my "Al-in-One Sidebar" as well.
+ down in in the program window of FF red typed error message tells:
<menu id="mCavemanQLS" label="&qls.context.main;" accesskey="L" statustext="&qls.description;" insertbefore=prefSep"> ----------^
When QLS stopped and after FF restarted, menues come beck up and in the AiO Sidebar as well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.QLS switch on = menues go away
2.QLS switgh off = menues come back (After restart FF)
3. and so on
