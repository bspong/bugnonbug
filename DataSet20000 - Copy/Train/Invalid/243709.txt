Firefox mangles tabs in form input variables, particularly:

1) leading tabs
2) trailing tabs
3) consecutive inner tabs (sometimes)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Execute the following source: (the spaces in the input value are tabs, sometimes
paired)
Submit the form.
------------
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
<form method='get'>
<input id='oof' name='boof' type='text' value='	1	3	5		7		' />
</form>
<script type='text/javascript'>
alert("|"+document.getElementById('oof').value+"|");
</script>
</body>
</html>
Actual Results:  
The GET submission, as well as several other aspects of the page, strip leading
and trailing tabs and reduce consecutive tabs to one.

Expected Results:  
Leave the data as-is upon submission.

This is useful for spreadsheet-type applications, where tabs can be used as
separators to create "virtual arrays" with HTML input tags.

Internet Explorer handles this as expected, while Safari mangles it yet worse
than Mozilla does.
