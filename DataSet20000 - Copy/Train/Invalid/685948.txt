Some embedded flash videos are very slow, out of sync and drop frames
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:6.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.1
Build ID: 20110830092941

Steps to reproduce:

Starting with FF4 and later, I'm having troubles playing embedde video on some sites. 
The video looks more like a slide show.
In FF4 and FF5, disabling hardware acceleration and session.restore in about:congif helped. In FF6, it doesn't. I'm using the latest flash plugin which was automatically undated last week.
The changes in about:config
browser.sessionstore.interval;3000000
browser.sessionstore.max_resumed_crashes;0
browser.sessionstore.max_windows_undo;0
browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash;false



Actual results:

I openned this video
http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic/20125-home-alone-3
I have a 10mbit connection and the video is entirely buffered.
but it is almost impossible to watch: too many frames are skipped. On the other hand, other  sites 


Expected results:

The video should run fine, as it does on the same machine under other browsers (both IE7 and Chrome). Moreover, portable FF3.6 runs this video fine on the same machine.
