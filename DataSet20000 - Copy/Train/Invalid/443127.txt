(I'm Italian, sorry for bad english!) This happens only to me: Using FireFox 3 I have a bad web-pages visualization, worst then the one I have with Internet Explorer. The problem is the thing known as Anti-Alias in the graphic world.
I took a screenshot for both web browser in the same page. Here is.
