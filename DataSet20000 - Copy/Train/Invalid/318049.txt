javascript: bookmarklet allows to bypass signed script security protection

By using javascript: pseudo-protocol in bookmarked links one can request extended privileges without signing the page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the provided link <http://www.geocities.com/schools_ring/archives/Bookmarklet.html> (no drive formatting I promise :-) - just eventually reading browser history).

2. Bookmark the only link on the page named "Bookmark this page"

3. Navigate to any local file (file://...)

4. Choose Bookmarks > "Bookmark this page" from your bookmark list
Actual Results:  
Unsigned script originated from a 3rd party site gets localhost security settings and shows the security dialog.

Expected Results:  
javascript: bookmarklet is always kept under Internet security settings.

Also it would be greate to have an equivalent of Microsoft Internet Explorer security alert which appears if you bookmark a link with javascript: ("You are adding a favorite that may not be safe. Do you want to continue?") 

Microsoft did you in this part I guess...
