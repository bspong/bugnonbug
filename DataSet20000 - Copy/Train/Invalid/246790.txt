Please read carefully because below are 2 problems mentioned:

1.
In the bookmarks manager or the bookmarks bar each folder's contect-menu shows
an item "Expand/Collapse", "Manage folder" and "Open in Tabs" in its context
menu. But not the context menu of bookmarks bar folder.
Please add these items for the bookmarks bar folder!

2.
"Expand" is slso shown when right-clicking a folder in the bookmarks bar or in
the bookmarks menu. But it does not work. "Collapse" there is never shown.
Please make "Expand" working here and add "Collaps".
