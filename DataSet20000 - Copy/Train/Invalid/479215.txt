The TXT files on this download page (URL ^) are ordinary small text files containing MD5 sums for the ISO downloads.

This one: puppy-4.1.2-k2.6.25.16-seamonkey.iso.md5.txt can be normally viewed in the browser, or downloaded. But any of the files with 'tar.gz' in the file name (and .txt at the end) leads to an error when trying to view it in the browser:
"The page you are trying to view cannot be shown because it uses an invalid or unsupported form of compression."
Trying to download (right click, save as) results in a similar error message. Of course, there is no "form of compression" here at all. Downloading with Download Accellerator (DAP) goes without a problem and saves a normal text file.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://distro.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/puppylinux/
2. click on puppy-unleashed-core-4.1.2.tar.gz.md5.txt (near the bottom)
3. file won't be displayed, you get error message
4. right-click no the same file and choose "save link as..."
5. file won't be saved, similar error message

Actual Results:  
Errors reproducible with any of the .txt files with 'tar.gz' in the name; normal behavior (view or download) with any of the other .txt files on the page

Expected Results:  
click -> view file in browser (text file)
right click, save link as -> text file saved
