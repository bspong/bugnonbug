this simple pullout menu works ok with html doctype
see http://home.cogeco.ca/jsfloat0.htm  but gives a
javascript parsing error on a css property when the 
doctype is changed to xhtml.  Opera and MSIE continue
to pullout the menu.  Is this a bug or a difference in
interpretation of CSS between implementer groups. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. view the jsfloat.htm document
2. read the javascript console
3. check jsfloat0.htm which is identical except for doctype

Actual Results:  
menu did not put itself away.
javascript consule gave error on property

Expected Results:  
worked as it does in Opera and MSIE
