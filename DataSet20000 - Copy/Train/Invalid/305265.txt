images and html graphics will not load in Firefox, they work fine in IE
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

I have had problems with Mozilla in the past upon encountering a virus,
sometimes it just crashes.  I have difficulty resetting the user profile.  
This time all images and some html graphics are effected.   I did not see a
virus message, no images will load although Java and Java Script are enabled in
the Options file.  I have tried clearing everything and rebooting, and I tried
to download a new version of Firefox and it came up with the same problem. Some
text shows but will not respond to clicks, some text simply does not show, and
no images show.  I may have updated an extension the same night I encountered
the problem for the first time.  The first site I had the problem on was
Epitonic.com. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.select yahoo mail on the toolbar(no Icons will show, just the word: Mail)
2.go to email account (or My Yahoo, or anywhere)
3.Look for images and html graphics

Actual Results:  
no images appear in emails that had images, some links work and others will not

Expected Results:  
If I go to My Yahoo I should see images when I click on a news story, if I go to
Mail I should be able to Mark a message as read.  I can't do either.

I check Get Fuzzy at Comics.com every morning.  The strips are not there now,
there is no box to click to procuce the images, but the other graphics are the
and most are interactive.  
I have to use IE for some things now.
I hate using IE
I hate it
