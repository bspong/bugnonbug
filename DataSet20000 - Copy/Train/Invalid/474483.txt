When restoring from a crash, Firefox should be able to figure out that .parentlock and places.sqlite are broken
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008101315 Ubuntu/8.10 (intrepid) Firefox/3.0.3

My machine crashed, and I had to remove .parentlock to get my browser to restart at all, and then google around, with a broken browser chrome to find that i needed to delete places.sqlite and its related files to get my browser to behave normally.

This is not very helpful. Instead of insisting that there is already more than one copy of Firefox open, give the user some credit and help them continue with their job. Present them with an option that can identify that there are absolutely zero bookmarks and a lock file in place and allow them to easily fix that. Ideally, fix it without the user having to do anything, but at the very least there should be a big button that says "Did your machine or browser crash unexpectedly? Click here to fix your browser and continue" or something.

Reproducible: Always

1. Have your machine crash
2. Try to open Firefox
3. Get told Firefox is already running when its not.
4. Go into Terminal.

8. Delete the places.sqlite* files in .mozilla/firefox/profiles/foo.default/
9. Get back to using Firefox.
