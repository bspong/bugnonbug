Customized window title not restored upon exiting Private Browsing mode
When you exit Private Browsing mode, it reverts to the Firefox default Windows title format.  It should revert to the format being used when private browsing mode was entered.

Steps to reproduce:

1.  Install the Nightly Tester Tools extension.

2.  Verify that the Window title changes to the form "PageTitle - Minefield (Build yyyymmddhhmmss)"

3.  Enter Private Browsing mode - note title format change to "PageTitle - Minefield (Private Browsing)"

4.  Exit Private Browsing mode.

The page title will now be of the form "PageTitle - Minefield".  It should be "PageTitle - Minefield (Build yyyymmddhhmmss)".
