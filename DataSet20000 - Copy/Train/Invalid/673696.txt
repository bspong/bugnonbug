User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.7; rv:5.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0.1
Build ID: 20110707182747

Steps to reproduce:

I installed OS X Lion with Firefox 5.0.1 installed.


Actual results:

With the new scrolling bars in OS X Lion 10.7, embedded videos appear with scrollable bars that cover partly the video. Check on Facebook.
YouTube and Vimeo embeds alike.


Expected results:

There shouldn't be any scrolling bars that cause the content to not appear completely.
