How do I undo a "distracted" firewall setup to block Firefox connection
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: 

This is not a Firefox's bug, rather a cry for help!  I tried to install Mozilla many times since then but...

I looked and looked in the maze of my PC's Internet Options (XP) but was unable to undo an "innocent & disctracted click faster than I could realize"  to block Firefox from accessing the net.  This happened when I last tried (many times) to install Mozilla.  Sounds silly but I couldn't do what seems to be a simple task.  Please help! - A very frustrated Mozilla user.

Keep up your good work!!
