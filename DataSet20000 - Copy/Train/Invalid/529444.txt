Both sage-1.4.3 and sage-1.5a (the latest nightly) don't work with Firefox 3.6
beta 1.

Firefox 3.6 is already at the the Beta stage and should be release very soon.
The roadmap indicates the release THIS month (2009-11)
(https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Roadmap)

Sub-folders under the "Feed Folder" do not work:

- The folders don't have a folder icon. They look like bookmarks and links
instead.

- The folders don't open and close when clicked.

- The icons in the sidebar (below the check- discover feeds buttons) are gone.

Workaround: It is possible to open and close the folders by opening/closing
them in the bookmarks sidebar.They remember the state from there. But, besides
being cumbersome and hard to find, that forces the user to have the feed folder
always open in the bookmarks view, which makes the bookmarks less usable
(crowded).

PS. Firefox 3.6 beta 1 can be downloaded here:

PPS. This might be a good opportunity to use a better default style in Sage. I
suggest using the one attached to bug 17649.


Reproducible: Always
