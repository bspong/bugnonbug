Firefox, either 3.0.14 or 3.5.3 or 3.6 Beta1, causes my system to freeze reproducibly on certain web pages. There is No reaction, I have to hard reset my machine. 

After restart there is no crash report from Firefox.

For example if I want to login to www.paypal.com the system freezes on the screen showing "Loggin in" in a process bar.
Another affected site is eBay. I cannot say which components of the web site cause this problem. This is reproducible.

Sometimes the system freezes also when loading a site. But this is rather random and not that often.

The problem occurs often, but not always. I'm able to login to Paypal one time, but after restart the problems happens again.

Using Internet Explorer 8 I can visit those sites without problems, so I except hardware problems.

On my laptop (Lenovo X61 Tablet) I recently installed Windows 7 Prof. x86 and copied the whole Firefox profile - and it works! I don't have hanging problems on it.

To solve the problem I tried these:

1. Complete reinstall - didn't help
2. New Profile - didn't help
3. Safe Mode - didn't help
4. Deactivating Anti-Virus-Software - didn't help
5. Reinstall of Windows - didn't help
6. Other Firefox Builds

I think the problem has something to do with Windows7 x64 compatibility.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the site
2. Enter login details
3. Crash
Actual Results:
