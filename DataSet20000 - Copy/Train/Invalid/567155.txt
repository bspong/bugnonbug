Firefox stop responding during download of big files. The last time it froze was when I tried to download a 1.7 GB file at 9.0 MB/s. It freezes most of the times at the end of the download, something around 80 to 90%.

Sometimes Firefox stays frozen definitively. Sometimes it "unfreezes". In this last case, the temporary file is removed and the downloaded file remains. In this case, this file has some data (probably the data downloaded before it was frozen), but not all the data.

Firefox has the same behavior when downloading many small files (small, here, is 100 to 300 MB) at 100 KB/s.

Very small files are ok. It seems that big files from very slow servers are ok too.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a 100 Mbps connection.
2. Download a big file. For example http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=696DD665-9F76-4177-A811-39C26D3B3B34&displaylang=en
Actual Results:  
The application (both Firefox window and Downloads window) is frozen and cannot be used for a long time. Downloads are corrupted.

Expected Results:  
Firefox was expected to finish the download.

Did not tried to reproduce this with all add-ons disabled.

Many add-ons are installed, but no add-ons directly related to download process.
