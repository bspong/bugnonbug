While the prior version is running, the new firefox -v3b1- just installed and there is an option "Run Firefox after installation.
I checked the option and it gives me an error message, sounds-like Firefox already running.
I have to uncheck and push the Finish button.
I start the 'Beta' while the 'Prior' running. I got litle surprise, it opens new window of prior version.
I tried to closed all of versions, start the Beta, yes it opens the Beta. :)


All of the prior add-on automatically registered in Beta. :)
Yes, there are some add-on unable run on Beta. It's not big deal right now. :)

Congratulation for all of Mozilla team.
