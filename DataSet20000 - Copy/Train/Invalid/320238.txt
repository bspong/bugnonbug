I shut down firefox during a time when /home was full. Then I reopened firefox. The history (both history sidebar and type-ahead-find history) was empty.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:

Actual Results:  
History was empty

Expected Results:  
It might be impossible to save the new history, but old history should not be deleted.

/home is on NFS
