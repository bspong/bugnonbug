Not any particular website or timing that I can tell - but happens frequently.  Have many tabs open or as few as 5 or 6.  Computer locks up ( nor keyboard or mouse response). have had outlook and/or Excel windows open also but only occurs when using Firefox and only with 4.  Started early to mid last week, power reset only cure, have walked away for up to 20 minutes and still frozen when return.  Last Friday loaded 3.6 and no problems.  Sunday loaded 4 again and within about 1/2 hour system froze; back on 3.6 now since 4 is unusable.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Just happens randomly as few as 10-20 minutes after starting FF4 or as long as several hours.  Computer just locks up (no keyboard or mouse) and I have to "pull the plug".
