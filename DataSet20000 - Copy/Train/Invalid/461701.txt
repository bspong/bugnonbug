I am on Minefield nightly builds and the tineye extension recently stopped working. It was working until about a week ago. I reverted to a stable build to verify that whatever is causing it is due to recent code changes (as I'm not a programmer I don't know what though)

When I try to use the extension it fails to open a new tab with the tineye search like it should.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Firefox stable
2. Tineye extension works
3. Install minefield
4. Tineye extension broken
Actual Results:  
Extension failed to open search in new tab.

Expected Results:  
Extension should open a new tab with tineye search.
