I don't know what you guys/gals were thinking, but the new options interface in 1.5 has suck written all over it.  The 1.4 interface with the left sided colum was a much better design.  If you disagree I have a number of books on GUI design you can reference!

Besides butchering a good UI, you also removed the "clear all" button for the privacy options.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click Tools
2. Click Options
3. Look at the Suck

Actual Results:  
Headache because of someones inane logic.

Expected Results:  
The normal 1.4 options menu, or something a bit more polished.
