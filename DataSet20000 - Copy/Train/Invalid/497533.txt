File upload keeps a lock on the uploaded file after completing the upload
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When a file is uploaded through Firefox with web form, a lock is taken on the uploaded file, and the lock is not released after completing the upload. As a result, if I try to move the file, it fails because the file is locked. I have to close Firefox first, and then moving the file succeeds.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Upload a file through a web form (GMail attachment for example).
2. Wait for upload termination.
3. Move the file into another directory (CTRL+X, CRTL+V)
Actual Results:  
Windows prevents you from moving the file (locked).

Expected Results:  
There should be not lock, the upload has completed already.

I am using the default theme, and a non-custom Windows Vista install.
