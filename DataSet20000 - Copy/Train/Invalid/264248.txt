about:config better documented, and certain values changed to default
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041011 Firefox/0.10

An increase in changing Firefox's about:config section even by basic users has
become increasingly popular, this can be seen by the forums along, and the web
as a whole.  These are done to get Firefox at the same speed and smoothness of
IE, when really this should be the result anyhow.  Unless other better ways to
get the benefits of these changes can be done, I would put to you that the
following is becoming increasingly popular, and a pain for simple users to have
to do, many when Firefox does not run as with these changes, just go back to IE:

browser.turbo.enabled  - true
general.smoothScroll  - true
network.image.imageBehavior  - 0
network.http.max-connections  - 48
network.http.max-connections-per-server  - 16
network.http.pipelining  - true
network.http.pipelining.maxrequests  - 100
network.http.proxy.pipelining  - true


Now create the following (right click add new):

Boolean -- network.http.pipelining.firstrequest -- set to true
Integer -- nglayout.initialpaint.delay -- set to 0


If some or all of these can be added it would have huge benefits and people
would leave Firefox less, and instead promote it's speed and efficiency more. 
These settings really do seem to get the best out of Firefox, and the best
should come a little more by default.  I would at least request that when a user
upgrades or re-installs (keeping profiles etc), that the settings remain the
same, so you don't have to do it all over again AT LEAST.
