When using Walnut theme, the "iconless" items in browser menu and context menus
sometimes are aligned to the left, thus starting in the "icon gutter" area

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. install Walnut theme
2. rerun Firefox
3. open any page
4. right-click anywhere on a page
Actual Results:  
Iconless items start directly in the icon strip

Expected Results:  
Start them as regular items

It doesn't happen in the default and Cats theme
