After upgrading from Skype 3.8 to 4.0 y noticed that phone numbers formatted in international way (e.g. 0032475-484360) are not shown complete as usual both as 0032474-48.... May by a bug in Skype i tot? A day or two later i updated FireFox to 3.07 and no numbers are highlighted anymore? Reinstalled Skype and updated Skype extension for FireFox and IE7 but no luck! In IE 7 numbers are highlighted but indeed shorter than usual as explained above but still not working in FireFox!

So many of my contacts have multiple phone numbers i like to now which one I'm calling.

Hope for a solution son!

Thanks!
