I have written a simple extension which retrieves the selected text and opens a new tab. 
The extension work well when I installed it 3-4 times. But after FF crashed, due to reasons I don't know the gContextMenu.searchSelected() does not return any text. 
The extension runs perfectly with the 1.5 instalation, but in FF 2 beta 1 it just wont work anymore. I am not sure if this is due to some error installing my extension or if there is some other bug causing this. Maybe it is related to the crash I had previously.

Reproducible: Always
