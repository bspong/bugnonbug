Not sure this should be reported as a new bug or not. I found a report from earlier this year but it just said Firefox "bugs" when the person tries to install it using Windows 7. I'm having the same problem. I just installed Win7 today (4/25/2010). My Firefox icon shows a compatibility issue and when I try to load Firefox, I get the instruction that I have to close Firefox in order to finish the install. I have been through this probably 8 times trying to install Firefox and it (Windows) says I have to close Firefox to complete the installation but Firefox is closed. I'm no novice to Firefox and have used it on several Windows operating systems (XP, Millenium, Vista) with no problems getting it reinstalled until now.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to internet using IE since Firefox icon won't work
2.Download Firefox
3.Told to close Firefox to finish the installation though it's closed at that point.
Actual Results:  
Get to the installwizard and told to close Firefox.

Expected Results:  
Couldn't install Firefox. Had to just close everything up after a while and give up.

It should have installed Firefox.
