Attempts to post messages at certain forums time out when using FF3b5 or RC1 in Ubuntu, but attempts to post the same messages at the same forums in the same way always succeed using FF 3b5 in Windows XP. At the forum http://tinyshell.be/aircrackng/forum/, any attempt to post or preview a message of any length times out with no response. At http://www,ubuntuforums.org, I can post or preview messages of about four or five sentences, but 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to www.ubuntuforums.org.
2. Compose a new thread or reply longer than around 100 words.
3. Either submit message or preview post.

or 1. Log in to http://tinyshell.be/aircrackng/forum/.
2. Compose a message of any length.
3. Submit or preview.
Actual Results:  
"Waiting for (the applicable web site)..." is displayed in the status bar for several minutes, until the request times out.

Expected Results:  
Successfully returned the forum's page indicating the message has been posted or displaying the preview.

Had no problems posting messages of any length to the same forums using the same software until a day or two ago. Not sure what else is relevant but ask and I'll tell.
