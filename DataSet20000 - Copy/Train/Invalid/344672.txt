Refresh - page loses formatting
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Firefox/1.5.0.4

I am working on a shopping cart - and building a page (checkout page) on a fly based on the user selections. The first time the checkout page displays in the browser it looks fine, but when I click on the refresh button in the browser the pages loses all of its formatting (css) and knowledge of any javascript functions.  Basically page stops working.

- css and javascript are not part of the page - I am calling a seperate file for the information.
Security error I get from JavaScript Console
"Security Error: Content at wyciwyg://0/file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/mon/Desktop/Menu/topside.htm may not load or link to file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/mon/Desktop/Menu/topside.htm."

topside is the name of the html in one of my frames and not the actual page that loses formatting.  Not sure why the error is talking about topside.htm as there is no problem with that frame after the refresh.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Add items to order
2.Proceed to checkout
3.Refresh 
4. New page that loads is broken - This works fine in IE
