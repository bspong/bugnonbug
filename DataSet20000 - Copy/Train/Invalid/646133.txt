Bookmarks are gone and there is no ability to add a new one after private browsing.

After "Private Browsing" my bookmarks are lost. There are nothing on the panel. I've tried to restore them - no effect. Strange thing, when I export them to JSON, I can see them inside the file. So they are still persist but are not visible/usable. And I can't do anything with bookmarks bar (e.g. add new bookmarks).

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start private browsing.
2. Go to some website.
3. Close private browsing.
