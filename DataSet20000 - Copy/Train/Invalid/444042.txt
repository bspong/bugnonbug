The browser based pgp integration is a godsend for those of us who use it (I doubt we're core users), but it doesn't work. That page is just a clearsigned copy of a key I found online (the one I was looking at when I noticed the new features) inside a <p></p> element.

When I wget it and gpg --verify it, the signature verifies fine (the signing key was 0x36E4BDFF)

As a side note, I'd love to see browser support for pgp-signing a webpage, though I can definitely see this would be a lot of work and break compatibility with standards. Could have sig embedded in HTML comment tags in specified position I suppose. For all four of us who'd use it:-)

Thanks,
Alex

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to above URI
2. Click verify, watch it fail
3. Wget the page and verify on the command line with gpg --verify
4. ???
5. Profit
Actual Results:  
Signature verifies for command line but not Firefox.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have verified the signature as valid.

Assuming we classify pgp-support as relevant, this is not the trivial edge case it may seem. I noticed this bug when I was planning to clearsign a Firefox version of my crypto information page (http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~alexr/secrecy/) that would be linked to from the main one to provide in-browser signature verification. This page would include versions of my public key for easy browser-based import.

This is relevant because I have an old key and a new one, and sign the page with both.
