Using the theme Blue 0.9.8 (or maybe any theme) go to the above URL. Select a
news item listed on left side under the day's date. Read an item. Maybe pick
another. Go to other pages elsewhere on web. Pages now are jumpy as they load,
as you click links or as they refresh (web cams, etc). Restarting the browser
stops the jumping.

I saw other complaints of jumpy pages but I am reporting this because it is so
reproduceable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.See above
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
see above

Expected Results:  
No twitchyness or jumpiness to the page

I am running SpySubtract and AdSubtract to block maleware and popups. This is
partly to block a popup that comes from this same URL that resists basic blocking.
