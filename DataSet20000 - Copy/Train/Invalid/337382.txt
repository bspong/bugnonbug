since I put in your upgrade I am connected to the internet, but my netscape page will not open in foxfire.Ie does open. Foxfire will open in safe mode, but now I don't know how to get out of safe mode and try to open on my homepage, or, how to find all my existing bookmarks. Did "temporarily' disable mean eliminate? when I tried to load the new program it said Socket error 30204.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.click on mozilla foxfire icon
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
now it opens in safe mode about 3 out of 10 times

Expected Results:  
open every time on my homepage

this is further complicated by the fact the I cannot get on the internet at all part of the time and may lose the connection at random times due to my location.
