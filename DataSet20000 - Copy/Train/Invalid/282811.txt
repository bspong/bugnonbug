Every time I go to the eBAy Home Page, I get this "Illegal operation in plugin"
error.  Doesn't matter if I go through the link from my own page, or directly to
"http://www.ebay.com" ... always get the same error.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enter http://www.ebay.com in navigator window
2.Press Enter
3.

Actual Results:  
I get the "Illegal operation in plugin" error.

Expected Results:  
Open the page without an error.  No error is experienced with Netscape or IE.

The eBay home page is the only page where this occurs.  Sometimes, I have
multiple Firefox, Netscape, and IE open when listing on eBay.  I had this
situation last night ... some of the Netscape and Firefox windows had pending
items to be listed.  When I went to go to the eBay home page through Firefox,
every iteration of Firefox crashed.  This has happened a few times in the last
10 days or so.  I don't have the Talkback info ... if there is a way for me to
retrieve it please tell me.  There should be one from 2/17 around 10:30pm eastern.
