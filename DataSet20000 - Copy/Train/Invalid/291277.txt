When you open the .gz file at
http://debian.teleglobe.net/dists/sid/Contents-sh.gz the memory usage of firefox
increases from 40Mb til 240Mb. I have test with other .gz files from
http://debian.teleglobe.net/dists/sid and the memory also grows up excesively.
Contents-sh.qz size is of 5 Mb. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://debian.teleglobe.net/dists/sid/Contents-sh.gz
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
The memory usage of FF grows up from 40 Mb to 240 Mb

Expected Results:  
I don't know how much memory needs FF to open a .gz file, but I suppose that 200
Mb for a file of 5 Mb is excesive
