I saw this minor problem on previous releases, although it seemed worse with FF3.5.  I determined a "fix" for the problem, but that fix didn't seem necessary, so I'm still submitting this bug.

I have modified the toolbar layout to place some bookmarks on the same line as the file menu.  There is sufficient space, but FF decides to put up the ">>" button.

Since there used to be a loading circle icon there, there was a spacer on that line.  By removing that spacer, FF3.5 functions properly.  However, that spacer should have been able to compress down to almost nothing to prevent the ">>" from appearing, IMHO.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Setup:
1. Customize toolbar:
1a. move bookmarks toolbar items to the right of File... area.
1b. add spacer to the right of bookmarks toolbar items.
2. Add just enough bookmarks to bookmark toolbar to almost fill that area, so it comes close to right side of the window.

Then:
1. Open browser.  FF will not show all bookmarks, but will place ">>" button instead.
2. Widen browser so that all bookmarks appears, then unwiden back to original size.  All bookmarks will be present.

"Fix":
1. Customize toolbar again, and remove spacer.
2. FF will behave ok now.
Actual Results:  
Spacer causes bookmarks not to fit.

Expected Results:  
Spacer should compress to almost nothing to prevent bookmarks from overflowing onto ">>"
