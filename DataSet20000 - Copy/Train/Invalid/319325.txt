Builds <= 1.0.7 allow GTK-1.2 with Xft.  FF1.5 does not.

Versions of Firefox in the 1.0.x line had difficulties using the freetype libraries installed with XOrg-6.8.2 (& GTK-1.2).  The fix I received here was to disable freetype and enable Xft, even though the docs said Xft required >GTK-2.  That workaround seems to work fine.  FF1.5 configure errors out with "enable Xft" and GTK-1.2.  Your system requirements still say GTK-1.2 is a minimum requirement.  Does that mean we can't have freetype fonts?

(No, please don't tell me to install GTK-2.  This is a lightweight system on a Pentium-I and I really, really want to keep the overhead to a minimum.  GTK-2 and its dependencies are over twice as big as GTK-1!  Some of us can't afford P-4's or Athlons.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install GTK-1.2, XOrg-6.8.2
2. Set .mozconfig to disable ftreetype, enable xft
3. Try to compile
Actual Results:  
Error message that GTK-2 is required for Xft.

Expected Results:  
Successful compilation as FF1.0.7 does!
