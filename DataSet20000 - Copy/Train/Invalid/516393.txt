It looks bad on presentation and at first glance I thought I had a html error. It was not clear to me if I could expand the window as I had to get the cursor right on the edge. Its important to have a good summary for people with a disability. Although people writing the summaries need to be able to see that its working.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right click on a table with a long summary that is defined in the html attribute
2. select properties in the menu
3. the summary is chopped off
Actual Results:  
I could see all the text however what happens when the summary is longer than a screen size?

Expected Results:  
used word wrapped combined with a scroll bar.
