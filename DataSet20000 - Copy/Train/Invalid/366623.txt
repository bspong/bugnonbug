Elements not closing properly when using <.../>
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

Given the following HTML:

<style>
a { color: red;}
</style>
<a name="test" />Why is this text red?

Firefox does not appear to recognise that the anchor tag is closed.  Actually any A element with just a 'name' and no HREF shouldn't even need closing under pre-XHTML1.0.  But even specifying XHTML 1.0 strict doesn't help here.
The only way to avoid this is to use
<a name="test"></a>

It's not just a problem with A elements, BTW, it happens with everything.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Save above code into file
2. Load into browser



Expected Results:  
Text should not be red.
