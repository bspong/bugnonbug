Using Firefox, when browsing that website, the horizontal scroll bar can be keep scrolled downwards up to infinity. Whenever the horizontal scroll reaches the end of the page (the button touches the "v" button below the scroll bar) and whenever I keep scrolling down, the page appears to 'expand' or appears to be longer (and the scroll button became smaller), and the expansion is an empty white space. However, the page will appear to become smaller and smaller again if I scroll up until it reaches its normal size, then the horizontal scroll returns to normal. Since it's kinda difficult to explain (and maybe to understand my explanation), feel free to contact me if screenshots are needed.
P.S.: This DOES NOT happen to other browser so it must not be a problem with the page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the webpage
2. Scroll down the horizontal scroll bar
3. Keep scrolling the bar down (either by keep moving the mouse cursor, clicking the 'v' (scroll down) button below the scroll bar, or by pressing down arrow key), even after it reaches the end of the page

Actual Results:  
The page appears to expand / to be longer.

Expected Results:  
The scroll bar should stop moving (even if the user keep scrolling down) since the end of the page has been reached.
