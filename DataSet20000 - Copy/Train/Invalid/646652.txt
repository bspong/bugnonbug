Pop up in my software in version 4 of Firefox checks a field not checked before

Version 4.0 checks a text field in a pop up window on a page I generate and indicates that it is invalid. Earlier versions did not do this so I have moved back to version 3.6. You may access the pop up at bobwheeler.com/cuesheets/admin.htm by clicking on the add file field. A text entry into the ride name window will result in an error pop up from Firefox when the OK button at the bottom is clicked. I have checked other browsers. They do not have this problem.

Reproducible: Always
