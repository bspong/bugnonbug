As suggested by Justin Kerk in bug #340315 ...

When I access the following webpage (with JavaScript enabled):

   http://free.grisoft.com/freeweb.php/doc/24/lng/us/tpl/v5

my Linux box become sliggish/slow because CPU usage of X server raise to > than
75%. This bug is common to all browsers using mozilla engine (firefox,
epiphany, etc), it's not related to desktop environment (KDE, Gnome does not
make difference), it's not related to xorg-server version (present in
xorg >= 6.8.2) and it's not Gentoo-specific (got same problem with Gentoo & SuSE).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just click the link


Actual Results:  
Gnome (or KDE) becomes sluggish after clicking on the link when Javascript is enabled. X server CPU usage raise to greater than 75%.

Expected Results:  
Like IE, not loading CPU ressource to 100%.

This is bug is not new for me and probably it was never reported since now. Last year, I had the same bug on the same page with SuSE 10 + KDE & now I have exactly now same problem with Gentoo 2006.0 + Gnome (on the same laptop).
