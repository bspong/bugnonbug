Typing, searching, especially scroll down and grabbing scroll bar, ALL activity is slow. Typing hesitant frequently and stops then starts! Clicks are so slow that you don't know if your mouse is working. 

Insane! Nearly unusable. After using my bookmarks I drop them into Safari (a bad browser in itself) to get a page. Please fix!
