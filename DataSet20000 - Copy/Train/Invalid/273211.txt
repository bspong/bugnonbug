Loading/changing images from local directory using javascript fails - even when enabled
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

I have a thin-client application that allows users to upload images to a server.
 The page that allows them to choose a file from the local computer to upload
has some javascript in it that changes one of the images on the web page to show
the image the user has just selected as a means of verify they selected the
right file.  This worked fine under FireFox 0.9  - but now that I've upgraded to
1.0, it no longer works.

I did notice that I started getting the following error in my javascript console
when I tried changing the image:

Security Error: Content at
http://localhost/index.php?module=Admin&op=website&admin=Images&action=showAddScreen&root=0
may not load or link to
file:///C:%5CDocuments%20and%20Settings%5CPaul%20Kimbrel%5CMy%20Documents%5CMy%20Pictures%5Cjrae_logo.png.

I realize that this is a security precaution of some variety, but is there a way
 that you could allow a user to allow a website access to this sort of
functionality?  Otherwise, my application will have no way of changing the image
dynamically to a local image prior to upload.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Write a javascript program that changes an image on the website to a locally
stored image.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Security violoation mentioned in the "details"

Expected Results:  
This is probably an expected result, but there should be provisions made for
thin client applications that need to point to locally stored files for upload
previews.
