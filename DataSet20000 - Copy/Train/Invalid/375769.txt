"More" IMG's that are the contents of <A> tags are not clickable in correct location.

The page contains 4 clickable IMG tags, each under an A tag. The cursor goes to pointer and allows clicks below the image, but not on the image.  The image is of the word, "More" in red.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Hit the site.
2.Click on one of the "More" images.
3.Or hover the mouse over 'em.

Actual Results:  
Clickable area is below the "More" part of the image.

Expected Results:  
Click to work. :)

DOM inspector has the box model for both IMG and A shifted south almost all off the actual image display location. I don't see any suspicious offsets, floats, etc. in the DOM. Source says the A's are float:right vertical-align:bottom. No odd borders, etc. Hmmm. IE just allows clicks on the area that overlaps the image and the box model location. FF allow clicks on an area of the full image vertical size. GIF files don't contain Y offsets, though, that I know of.
Hmmm.

Ah. The image is a 1x1 black dot. The "more" that's shown on-screen must be the ALT="more" value. Nice that the browsers decide that a 1x1 image isn't good enough, so the ALT text should be shown.

So, the problem is that the box model of the image doesn't include the location of the ALT text. Probably 'cause of the align:bottom and the IMG tag giving the explicit height. Or maybe the problem is that the ALT text isn't aligned at the image itself. (Which would make the site look ugly until they fixed it.)

Anyway, it looks like the box model is shoved down low by the align:bottom, the HEIGHT value clips the top. And dead area is the result.
