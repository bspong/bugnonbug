closed pages memory leak
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a6pre) Gecko/20070615 Minefield/3.0a6pre

both FF 2.0.0.4 and Minefield 20070615 seem to be affected by this problem, so memory usage reported below refers respectively to FF 2.0.0.4 / FF3 20070615.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open FF in safe mode
   (13.8MB/20.9MB)
2. CTRL+T to open a new tab
   (14.2MB/21.3MB)
3. open any URL (eg: maps.google.com)
   (25.9MB/30.2MB)
4. CTRL+W to close the tab
   (23.2MB/28.5MB)
5. clear the cache
   (19.6MB/30.9MB)
Actual Results:  
seems that closing a page doesn't free up memory to something near the starting value (I mean before the page was loaded).
If instead of just open/close maps.google.com you use it a bit you can see that memory consumption grows few megabytes more, about 45MB here, then is pretty stable, but if you close that page the released memory is minimal.

Expected Results:  
when closing a page I expect Firefox to go back to a memory usage near to the value it had before using that page.
