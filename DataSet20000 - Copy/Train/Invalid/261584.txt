Page randomally renders tables incorrectly, causing ugly results

On my site, http://turkeybot.info, Firefox randomally renders the page incorrectly.

How it should be rendering ALL THE TIME: http://turkeybot.info/correct.gif

How it's rendering randomally: http://turkeybot.info/glitch.gif

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://turkeybot.info
2.If the page looks normal, like the 'correct.gif' pic, refresh, possibly
needing to do so several times, until you see the same problem
3.If you ran into a page that looks like 'glitch.gif', you've ran into the
rendering glitch

Actual Results:  
Sometimes, the homepage is rendered incorrectly, and the left column for Flash
games is stretched out, rest of table not rendered.

This is NOT a server error. Want proof? Run into the glitch, then save the html
it outputs. Load it up on Firefox (you might need to refresh it several times to
get it to render correctly), or if Firefox continues to refuse rendering it
correctly (which is shouldn't for more than 4 refreshes), then load it up in IE
and see how it's viewed.

The page is using standards-complaint XHTML 1.1, completely valid, as well as
completely valid CSS, so it is not the site or the server itself causing this error.

Expected Results:  
Rendered the table correctly ALL THE TIME, as shown in 'correct.gif'.
