If you bring up the "allowed sites" for popups dialog and click "remove all sites" the list of allowed sites for popups is not cleared.  Instead, the list of exceptions for cookies is cleared.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Firefox preferences dialog
2. Under the "content" tab, click the exceptions button for blocking pop-up windows
3. Click "remove all sites"

Actual Results:  
The list of the sites might shuffle in order, but none of the sites are removed.  If you then go to the "privacy" tab, then click the "exceptions" button under the cookies section, you'll see that all the site-specific cookie settings are gone.

Expected Results:  
The list of exceptions for pop-ups should be cleared and the settings for cookies should not be touched.
