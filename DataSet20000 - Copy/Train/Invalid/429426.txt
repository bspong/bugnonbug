History and Saved forms won't update.

My history doesn't show sites I visited over the last 9 days. It shows the sites I visited over the 9 days from 29/12/07 till 06/01/08 (dd/mm/yy because I'm Australian). 
Saved forms don't update either. The dropdown menu of things I previously typed (e.g. previous searches on google) shows searches I did ages ago and searches I did in my current session, but not things I searched for yesterday in a different session. I've tried clearing private data. This appears to work for a while, but when I start a new session everything is back again. Other things (e.g. cookies) aren't affected by the bug (clearing private data deletes them properly and permanently)
It doesn't seem to happen when using Firefox on other computers or when a different account uses Firefox on this computer. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firefox
2. Do some browsing/surfing
3. Close Firefox
4. Run Firefox in a new session
Actual Results:  
History (ctrl-h) displays two Subfolders: Today and Older than 6 days.
Today subfolder only show my homepage
Older than six days shows sites I visited between ages. When I google things, the search bar has a dropdown menu of things I've searched for previously. It remembers searches I made over 3 months ago, but won't remember more resent searches after the end of the session. same applies for all other search bars and forms.

Expected Results:  
My history should show, and only show the pages I visited over the last nine days.
Forms should remember what I typed into them in the previous session.
