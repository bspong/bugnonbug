Using eMac, OS 10.4.7. With 1.5.0.5 I did not have this problem. 
After installing 1.5.0.6, I tried to Backup my Home Folder by manual copy to a CD-RW. After BURN began, the Message appered: The operation cannot be completed because one or more required items cannot be found (Error code -43). Could not open the data fork of "<unable to get file path>" (-43).
I ran Cocktail 3.6.5 and Disk Warrior 3.0.3. 2nd attempt to Backup Home Folder gave same results.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.st Try with Sony CD-RW, See Details: ran Cocktain 3.6.5 and Disk Warrior 3.0.3
2.nd Try with same Sony CD-RW, same result
3.rd Try Memorex CD-RW, same result.

Actual Results:  
After BURN began, the Message appered: 
The operation cannot be completed because one or more required items cannot be found (Error code -43). Could not open the data fork of "<unable to get file path>" (-43).

Expected Results:  
Burn of CD-RW should be successful!

How can I get a copy of Firefox 1.5.0.5 to reinstall?
