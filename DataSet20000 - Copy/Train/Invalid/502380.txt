Maybe there's a focus issue too. When I write in a textfield like this one, I must retype characters that should have been typed. So, if I try the sequence: 123456789, I've typed 45678 or so. It happens even when I delete characters. I thought it was SP2 but it is not (I uninistalled SP2). Every other browser or program (OpenOffice etc.) works just fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. simply write and control what you've written
