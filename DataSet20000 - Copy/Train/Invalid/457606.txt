Whenever i do a search of users,communties or topics on orkut ( http://www.orkut.com/Main#UniversalSearch.aspx?searchFor=U ) and click on any profile from list i obtain from the search,the webpage goes back to my home page in Orkut ( http://www.orkut.com/Main#Home.aspx )  rather than taking me to that particular Profile  that i intend to see.I do not have this problem in IE 7.
