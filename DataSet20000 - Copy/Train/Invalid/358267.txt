In all previous versions of Firefox, there was a single "X" for all tabs in the far right of the tab bar.  I have noticed that there is no option to re-enable that functionality.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox
2. Open a couple tabs
3. Notice there is an "X" on each tab, not one for the current tab

Actual Results:  
One "X" per tab

Expected Results:  
Option to have One "X" for the current tab, as in Firefox <2.0
