To be sure this is the same problem, Firefox closes automatically when I hit "send" to reply to an e-mail on myspace.  It does not do this with Internet Explorer.  And it seemed to have just started with the new upgrade of Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open a message in myspace e-mail.
2.  Hit reply to e-mail and type a reply.
3.  Hit "send" reply... Firefox browser closes.

Actual Results:  
Firefox browser closed..

Expected Results:  
Firefox browser to close.

It should have taken me back to my myspace in-box.
