There is an 8 pixels gap between the window's inside edge and the content - be it image or text.

The gap occures on the top and left. I didn't test right and bottom.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a simple webpage/html.
2.Place image or text or both in the body.
3.View it with Mozilla.
Actual Results:  
There will be an 8 pixel gap between the window and the content where the background color shows through. The gap is observable at the top and on the left.

Expected Results:  
I expect no gap/margin/border/padding between the window and the content be it image, text or anything else.

Display the contents right against the window-frame.
