I am a CS major in a Software Systems class.  For the class, I am in a group that is developing a website system that uses Ruby on Rails to communicate with a MySQL database.  Part of what it does is use the Ruby code to pull from the database and add div layers to the site.  I know that there are div layers stored in the database to add to the site, because they load when the page firsts loads.  They will also load when you click go or hit enter in the address bar.  Unfortunately, when you click refresh or F5, the ruby code is not executed and the div layers are not loaded from the database.
I was very surprised when I saw this happen, because I thought that hitting enter on the address bar and clicking refresh did the exact same thing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Unfortunately, the only place I have seen this is on a site that I am building that is no where near going live yet.  Because of this, I can't help you to reproduce the error.
Actual Results:  
The ruby code is not executed when the refresh button is clicked.

Expected Results:  
The ruby should be executed when the refresh button is clicked.

The cause of this problem could be:
     The fault of ruby on rails
     a simple error in the Firefox code
     an error in my own code for my site that I noticed the error on (though I doubt it because of the nature of the error.)
