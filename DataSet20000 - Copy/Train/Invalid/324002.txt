On many occasions I have noticed that a horizontal scrolbar is rendered while there is no content in the scrollable area. I have noticed it mostly in 1024x768 resolution. The sites that show it do so all the time. I suspect that it has to do with css classes. Ms IE vs 6 does not show this behavior.
