When running Firefox 3.0.2 with DownThemAll 1.0.3 and a download dialog box pops up, some of the content in the box gets cut off since the dialog box does not get to expand.  When running in safe mode, there is no issue, which I assume is because there is no extra content/options added to the box.  Since DownThemAll adds one or two extra options to the download dialog box, the Ok and Cancel buttons can either be cut off or missing entirely, depending on the type of file that is being downloaded.

This did not happen in Firefox 3.0.1 and before, since the dialog box would resize itself to fit the content added to it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install DownThemAll! 1.0.3
2. Download a file
3. Observe part or all of the Ok and Cancel buttons being missing from the download dialog box
Actual Results:  
The expected results of partially missing (cut off) Ok and Cancel buttons on the download dialog box.

Expected Results:  
The dialog box to resize to accommodate the added options in the dialog box.
