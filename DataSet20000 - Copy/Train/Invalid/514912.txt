Could someone please create an addon that copies a block of command line codes from a web page, for the installation of a program in Ubuntu, and converts them to a single line of code with && between each line. The result can then be pasted in one go into terminal.

It is usual to have blocks of command lines listed in a code box on a page. They are not separated by && and so each line has to be copied and pasted to the terminal. It would be much more convenient if the whole box could be copied in one go and then pasted into Terminal in a form that would run each line automatically. I have been told this would mean adding && to the end of each line before concatenating them. I propose the addon be activated by a button and work once the code area has been blocked by the mouse.
