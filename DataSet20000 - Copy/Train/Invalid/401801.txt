Crash in gtk_file_info_get_is_folder using GTK File-Open dialog when desktop contents are changed
(I know "file handling" isn't the correct component for this -- please re-file if you know where a GTK File-Open dialog related bug should go)

To reproduce:
 - Move all files/folders off desktop
 - Create two empty files called "a" and "b"
 - In a Firefox window, press <Ctrl+o> for the GTK Open-File dialog
 - On the desktop, rename file "a" to "c"
 ***Crash!***

(if you see the File Open dialog update correctly after the file name change, then you've managed to avoid the crash)

This crash happens very reproducibly on my desktop, but I can't reproduce it on my laptop.  Both are running Ubuntu Gutsy.  It may be a machine-specific problem, but I'm reporting it anyway, in case other people see it as well.

Happens for me in Firefox v3.0a8 and in a current trunk build from today.  Haven't tried earlier builds yet.

I also tried to reproduce the crash in other apps that use the same GTK File-Open dialog, but I wasn't able to.
