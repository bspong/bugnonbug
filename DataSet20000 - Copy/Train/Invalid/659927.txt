UI - Why is it getting smaller?
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.17) Gecko/20110420 Firefox/3.6.17 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Firefox 4+

I am growing very concerned with the direction the Firefox UI is taking.  The recent changes from FF 3.6 to 4.0 have prompted numerous calls from friends and family on how to downgrade or restore previous UI elements.  It has also caused me to disable significant functionality in Firefox 3+ and not upgrade to 4.0.

Rather than provide a laundry list of pros and cons, which never works no matter how well a point is argued, I would instead ask a simple question:

What user experience is being added by increasing screen area and removing UI elements that Fullscreen does not already provide?

I ask as all sorts of changes are being made for the benefit of netbook users and in the interest of companies who want more space to advertise but ease of use issues for average users seem to be ignored in the current (FF4) and planned (URL bar removal) UI changes.


Reproducible: Always
