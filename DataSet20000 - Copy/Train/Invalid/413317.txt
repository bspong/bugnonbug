hello,
i have a big problem with firefox.

i use the add-on session manager to open the last session after a crash or a restart of firefox. since the last update(s) of firefox, this don't work how it should.

after start of firefox or reopen a session, i get all windows opened, but only the first and the last window have contend, all windows between this are complete white, no menue, no symbols, no content.

if i want to close this white window, i get the message, that more then one tab is open, but i can't see them, because i have only a white window.

if i open 3 windows at same time, one window is white.
if i open 4 windows at same time, 2 windows are white.

i think, that i can open 2 windows without problems and will test it.

why does firefox don't display the window content of some windows, if i open some windows at the same time ?

goodby
