When JavaScript code in an add-on creates a user preference (one that did not already exist) and there is a preference observer for an ancestor branch, the preference observer is not notified.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an observer on a preference branch, for example extensions.myext.branch
2. Use setCharPref to create extensions.myext.branch.new
Actual Results:  
Preference observer is not notified.

Expected Results:  
Preference observer should be notified.

If you manually create a preference through about:config the preference observer is notified.

Behaviour should be consistent regardless of how preference is created.
