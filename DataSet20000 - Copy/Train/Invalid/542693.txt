Multi-Row Bookmark Bar Mod. Via "userChrome.css" Edit No Longer Works In 3.6

Couldn't find the bug listed here recently, but here are some references elswhere.  I've had the same patch applied to "userChrome.css" since FF3 Beta:

/* Multi-row bookmarks toolbar for Fx3b5pre*/
#bookmarksBarContent{display:block !important;}
.places-toolbar-items{display:block !important;height: 75px !important;overflow-y:auto !important;}
#bookmarksBarContent toolbarseparator{display:inline !important;}
#bookmarksBarContent .bookmark-item{visibility: visible !important;}
.chevron {height: 0px !important;}
/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

(if the code above is flawed, it got typed over or scrambled by typing this in a tiny box; haven't changed this mod. in over a year - it just stopped working)

Just prior to the Firefox 3.6 upgrade, it's worked fine.  Tried a couple tweaks to no avail.  Three bookmark rows now appear as one, with an "arrow" marker (compressed menu?  Don't know what this is called...) at the end of the first row, that when clicked, expands to show a vertical list of the other two rows of bookmarks.  The other bug, is that these items on the expanded menu while visible, do not highlight on mouseover, and cannot be clicked.  Adding a new plugin "Multirow Bookmarks Toolbar 4.4" restored my three bookmark rows, and of course everything is "clickable", but I'd prefer a low-overhead, userChrome.css solution.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install 3.6.
2. Add code following "/* Multi-row bookmarks toolbar for Fx3b5pre*/" line above to "userChrome.css".
3. Restart browser; if you have a single bookmark row, you win!  But ultimately, we both lose...
Actual Results:  
Since I'm reporting this, please see "Details".

Expected Results:  
Show three bookmark rows (aren't you listening <TextArea(s)>)?
