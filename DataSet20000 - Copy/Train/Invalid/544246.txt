Part of the text is stripped (disappears) but only numbers (?!)

This web page is a list of details about a concert.  To the right of 'Tickets available from' should be a phone number, which has been stripped.

Using the Developers Toolbar in Firefox, the number IS THERE if I 'View Source', but ISN'T THERE if I 'View Generated Source'....

If I put brackets in around the dialling code, i.e. (01305) 770820 it still gets stripped, but if I change the number for some random text, it's all ok.

This does not happen in Safari/Opera/IE8

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open web page.  Text is stripped.
2.
3.


Expected Results:  
Text should not be stripped! :)
