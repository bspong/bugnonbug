Javascript doPostBack Hyperlinks without action
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 Gecko/ LSKA0815 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: 

When clicking on a hyperlink coded like this, nothing happens. 

<a href="javascript:__doPostBack('ctl00$ctl00','')">Choose Databases</a>

The Javascript-Console says "__doPostBack is not defined". Actually, this seems to be true as such a function cannot be found in the source code. However with IE6, there are no problems, hence there must be a solution.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Using EBSCOhost Research Databases (restricted access)
2. No Navigation is possible
3.

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens

Expected Results:  
Behaviour like a standard hyperlink
