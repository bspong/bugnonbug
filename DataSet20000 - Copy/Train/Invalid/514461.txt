Firefox is hanging the system on shut down. I closed the firefox and then i clicked on the shut down button. But the system didn't respond. Then i opened task manager and found that firefox process was still running. I tried to shut down the process manually but then my computer hanged. Then i checked my performance logs and found that firefox was delaying the shut down and hanged the system. I installed latest zone alarm software ( free version, not pro) and i think the problem has popped up after that only. The problem has become frequent now. My system gets completely hanged and i have to reboot the system with the help of the power button.
I have copied some information from event log generated...

This application caused a delay in the system shutdown process:
