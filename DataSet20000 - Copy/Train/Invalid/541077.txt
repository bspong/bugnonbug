'Clear recent history' does not clear awesome bar autocomplete
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Go to Tools -> Clear Recent History, select time range Everything and tick every checkbox, then 'Clear Now'.

Then open a new tab, click in the address bar and type a letter such as 'l'.

Expected behaviour: because the history has been completely wiped, no autocomplete suggestions will be shown by the awesome bar, or at most they will be generic suggestions not based on my browsing history.

Observed behaviour: on typing a letter a list of suggested completions appears, all of them sites I have visited in the past using Firefox.

I flagged this as 'major' because surely clearing the awesome bar autocomplete is the #1 reason for the 'clear recent history' function to exist, and it's not working.

Reproducible: Always
