This is one of my site and some of the graphics are been shown as broken, yet when I view it in IE the graphics are fine. Also, when I open FireFox and I go to a website and need to fill out some form I cannot type into it, but I can paste something in there and delete it, then I am able to type directly into it!

Reproducible: Always
