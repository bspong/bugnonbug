utf-8 specifies an optional BOM (byte order mark) of "EF BB BF".

firefox doesn't know about this BOM and if present, prevents the web page from rendering.

microsoft products put BOMs into every document that is saved as utf-8.
even notepad.  pages edited in notepad and saved as utf-8 encoded do not render in firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. edit file in notepad (tested on xp version of notepad)
2. save as utf-8 encoded
3. open if firefox

Actual Results:  
html not rendered but shown

Expected Results:  
rendered html
