addressbar not working with my theme since last update

After the last Minefield update the addressbar stopped working. I can see the addressbar textfield (standard rectangular field, ignoring the current Theme), but it's always empty, no matter what page I am on, and there is no auto-complete function (and the arrow that should open the address history is missing). No matter what I write in the address bar, nothing happens when I press Enter of the Go button.
Pressing the Go button refreshes the current page, which leads me to the conclusion that the addressbar is actually somewhere under the text field that I am seeing, and that the current address is in there. Pressing the Go button when in a blank tab has no effect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
permanent state
Actual Results:  
addressbar not working

Expected Results:  
normal addressbar functionality

I am using Phoenity 1.5.915 as my current theme. The bug doesn't occur if I switch back to the default theme.
