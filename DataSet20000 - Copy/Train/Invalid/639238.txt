Bookmark All Tabs is missing from Firefox 4.0b11 Firefox 4.0b12 and and 4.0 rc1 nightly-March 5 2011.  I have tried starting firefox in safe-mode and deleting my .firefox directory first and the Bookmark All Tabs is still missing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start firefox
2.Open multiple tabs
3.No Bookmark All Tabs in the Bookmarks menu
Actual Results:  
No Bookmark All Tabs option

Expected Results:  
The Bookmark All Tabs option SHOULD be there.  

This does not seem to be a problem on the Mac OS X version of Firefox 4.0 (b11 or b12)  only the OpenSolaris version.
