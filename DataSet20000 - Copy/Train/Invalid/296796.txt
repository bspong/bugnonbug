JavaScript "complete" property always returns "true"

The JavaScript "complete" property is a boolean value that indicates whether 
the web browser has completed its attempt to load an image. It is a property of
"Image". I am using it to check whether preloaded images are ready for use.

It should return "false" (as it does in IE) if you try to load a non-existing 
file, but it always returns "true" in FireFox. Please try the following code: 

<HTML>
<HEAD>
</HEAD>

<BODY>

<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">
image1=new Image()
image1.src='fakeurl.jpg'
alert(image1.complete)
</SCRIPT>

</BODY>

</HTML>

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. just try the html code I wrote in "details" above. Thanks!
Actual Results:  
returns "true"

Expected Results:  
should return "false"
