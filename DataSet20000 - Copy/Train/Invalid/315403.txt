Firefox worked until I upgraded to 1.0.7.  It will connect to the internet but will not load any websites.  Internet Explorer no longer functions either.  I cannot use the internet on these two computers anymore.

Reproducible: Always

1. Uninstalled Firefox. 
2. Downloaded newest version and Reinstalled Firefox.
3. Does not work.
4. Uninstalled Firefox.
5. Loaded numerous old versions (1.0 thru 1.0.5)from my hard drive.
6. None of the old versions would load sites either.
7. Another similar computer was upgraded to 1.0.7
8. That computer no longer loads any sites.

Actual Results:  
None of the versions I loaded will load any web sites.  I cannot get Internet Explorer to work either.

It should load the sites.
