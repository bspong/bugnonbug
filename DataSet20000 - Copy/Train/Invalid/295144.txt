My Firewall alarms that the build has changed after I restarted my browser. BUT I did not install any component!
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

I got a list of ed2 and torrents sites form off the digss.com site. I was going
to them one by one. I never clicked OK for any pop up boxes. Pop up boxes that
only have OK, I close them from the (X) icon. After I restarted my firefox, my
firewall (Kerio Personal Firewall) warned me that the build of firefox was
changed (the .exe file was modified). I got suspicious. I redownloaded 1.0.4 and
installed it on the same directory as the old one. After the installation, there
were no warnings from the firewall. That means that something changed the build
with no permeation. I’ll include the list of the site I went to in how to
reproduce the bug. Thanks.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
I only include the site a went to not the whole list
