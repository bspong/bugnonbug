When I installed a newer trunk build of fx, I imported my bookmarks and all the other stuff from IE.  After that, when I looked in the bookmarks menu, there was nothing except for the commands.

1.Customize IE.
1a.Get rid of the Mozilla folder in Application Data folder
2.Install fx and import settings from IE
3.Look in bookmarks menu

Actual Results:  
nothing in menu besides commands

Expected Results:  
imported bookmarks appear in menu
