The autocomplete mechanism has accumulated over 60,000 URL addresses in the drop down lists and this monster is growing every day like a cancer and there is absolutely no way to delete them. The computer has slowed down a lot due to memory overload. THERE HAS TO BE A FUNCTION PROVIDED TO DELETE THE PAST BROWSING HISTORY AND TO DELETE THE UNCONTROLLED STORAGE OF URL ADDRESSES BY THE AUTOCOMPLETE MECHANISM OF THE FIREFOX! Internet Explorer has it and it works. It is absolutely necessary that Firefox gets it too!

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Enter amazon.com and click a thousand times on various products, including the lists of 100 bestsellers in each product category, click on product reviews and all the other provided links. All this irrelevant garbage is being stored permanently in your computer memory by the latest release of Firefox!

Expected Results:  
Repeat that exercise for other shopping sites, for Wikipedia, and other sites with clickable links, an watch the cancer growing uncontrollably in the computer memory occupied by Firefox!

Delete all stored URL addresses more than a week old, except the addresses marked as FAVORITES with a gold star!  Make the Autocomplete work only for selected addresses or allow to shut down the silly function altogether!
