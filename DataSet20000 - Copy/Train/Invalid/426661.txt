Awesome bar now a dialog, flies in from offscreen
In FF3b4 and all previous versions of Firefox, the location bar and all other autocomplete widgets appeared as normal drop-down fields, and were treated as such by the window manager.  In FF3b5, autocomplete drop downs have been promoted to some kind of window (dialog, perhaps, but not top level window) which the window manager places with an annoying animation.

The annoying animation is the window manager's problem, but it's Firefox's responsibility to advise the window manager that something is or isn't a real window.  Somewhere between b4 and b5, this advice changed.
