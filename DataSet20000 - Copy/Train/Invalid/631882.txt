about:blank can't be restored by session restore

I have Firefox set to not exit when the last tab is closed, and I typically close all the tabs to get to about:blank and then exit. Sometimes Minefield complains that it can't restore about:blank when I next start it.

This happens only occasionally, but I did not see it before I started using Firefox 4 nightly builds.

A contributing factor might be insufficient time for Firefox to exit before the system exits -- the lack of a disk activity light on this laptop makes it hard for me to tell. Even if that is the case, about:blank should be restorable.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Reduce Firefox to one tab in one window and visit about:blank.
2.Stop Firefox and reboot computer.
3.Start Firefox.
Actual Results:  
Sometimes a session restore error is shown, embarrassed it can't restore about:blank.

Expected Results:  
Show about:blank.
