After displaying search results on eBay I select individual listings. I click the link to the listing, view the listing, then use the Back button in the tool bar to return to search results. After doing this 2 to 3 times Windows 2000 Pro blue screens for less than a second and instantly reboots. Drive check is not initiated, system reboots as if nothing happened.
System runs 24x7 and is usually up for months without problems. Ran  memory check and this did not turn out any defective memory. Had always Notepad and File Explorer open when crash occured, but Firefox was the active application.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open www.ebay.com
2. Search for example for ST32550N in Computer & Networking
3. Click link for a listing, have listing page displayed
4. Click Back button in tool bar
5. Choose different listing, have listing displayed, use Back button in toolbar
6. Repeat step 5 one or two more times

Actual Results:  
Windows 2000 blue screens. Cannot read or write down error message as system instantly reboots.

Expected Results:  
Returns to search result page and does not crash / crash system.

System is SuperMicro Server board with dual PentiumII-333, 512 MB RAM, 70GB 10k SCSI drive
Had memory card reader connected to USB port.
System runs rock solid for weeks and months at a time. Did not experience this crash on any other site, even when using the back button excessively.
