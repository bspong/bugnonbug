I've been using firefox for about 10 mnths now and prefer it to ie7 etc, but have 1 issue that is in all the versions i have used and hence there are some incompatibilities with my website, which is amateur, and built with the html editor in microsoft word 2003. The problem - i made the links with different font colors and didn't underline them - now firefox underlines them automatically, and adds default colours which i cant change affectively, also when i select the "do not underline option",it doesnt work for my site, but corrects all other sites. Also after using firefox it has caused some of my pages in internet explorer, as well as firefox, to show incorrectly and are blurred -  some fonts - not links - have changed in my charts - Charts Page - http://members.westnet.com.au/destuneable7/sita.rep.html .Another problem is associated with HTMLSlideShow - http://members.westnet.com.au/destuneable7/Amanda%27s%20trip%20to%20Australia/default.htm ,which is a Microsoft Power Toy for adding slideshows to web sites - it wont function properly with firefox - it works, but u have to manually move thru the slides, as the play button doesnt appear.
Hope these aren't nuisance problems, as i know u have a lot of work going on at the moment with firefox 3 and u possibly cant account for some programs not functioning correctly, but i thought i might mention it.
Thanking you, Richard
