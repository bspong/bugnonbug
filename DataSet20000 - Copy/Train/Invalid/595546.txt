There's an :invalid pseudoclass which allows to style input fields, but there is now way to style the submit button when some fields in the form are invalid.

I think it should be possible by adding support for :invalid for forms (and even for fieldsets), so one could do something like this:

form:invalid input[type="submit"] { -moz-box-shadow: none; }




Reproducible: Always
