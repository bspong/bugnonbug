By default, in the "Tools \ Option" Menu, in the "Private" Tab the default setting is to keep historic.
I would like to use the "use custom settings for historic" setting.
But when I save (clic OK), if I return to the option pannel, nothing has been saved --> it always the default setting in place

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to Tools \ Option menu (Outil \ options in french)
2.go to the "Private" tab (Vie privée in french)
3.in the lov select "use custom settings for historic" (utiliser paramètres personnalisés pour l'historique in french)
4.clic OK on the bottom
5.go to Tools \ Option menu (Outil \ options in french)
6.go to the "Private" tab (Vie privée in french)
7.the setting is not saved (the default seting "keep historic" is still present)
Actual Results:
