Firefox beta version is wrong
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:7.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0
Build ID: 20110816154714

Steps to reproduce:

Installed latest Firefox beta and checked version. Version was 7.0


Actual results:

Started FF. It prompted for update. But I am unable to install due to other issues. So I tried going to http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html. The website still says latest version if 7.0. 

So what is the update for? Am I upgrading from 7.0 to 7.0? Please change version and update new file to http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html
