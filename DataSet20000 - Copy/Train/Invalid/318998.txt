When tabs are open, and you click either the open one once or a closed one twice, a focus box appears around the page title in the tab.  In addition, if there is a focus box around a tab, clicking on any other tab once transfers the box (in addition to opening the new tab).

I'm using v1.5, and I don't remember focus boxes EVER appearing in tabs in previous versions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

Actual Results:  
The last clicked tab got a focus box.

Expected Results:  
No focus box should have appeared.
