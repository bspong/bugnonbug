Need workarounds for bug 21296 for the mac version of Firefox / All menus are inaccessible in some windows (Download / Theme / Extension Manager, Page Info)
Since there is no upcoming solution for bug 21296 (Can't use Mac menu bar with a
menuless window in front), we should workaround it by adding few menus (mac
only) to the most problematic places, these are:
1. Download Manager
2. Extensions/Theme Manager
3. JavaScript Console
4. Page Info dialog

(The new menus will *replace* the current set).

Taking the download manager (bug 228615) for example, here is a first draft of
what menus should appear:

1.File
---New browser window, Open File.
2. Edit
---Disabled Paste/Cut, copy will copy the current download local file location,
and maybe others.
3. Current Download (or maybe other name). This will also follow Apple HIG
("Never provide a contextual menu command that is not also accessible through
the menu bar"), this menu will contain:
---Pause/Resume
---Open file
---Remove (or this should be in the "Edit" menu)
---Open containg Folder
---More info
4. Help
---Help Contents

In addition, the preferences menu item in the Application Menu should work.

Same principle for extension/theme managers.

I'm requesting blocking1.0mac?, if we pretend to release a mac-focused version,
we shouldn't have this kind of unexpected behavior.
