Although there is no "Sort by [...]" menu options for "Tags", "Location", "Visit Date", "Visit Count", "Keyword", "Description", "Added", or "Last Modified", clicking on those columns or using the "Views" toolbar button does not change the order in which the bookmarks are displayed after the "Places Organizer" has been closed.

I believe this to be a major bug because some users (such as myself) do not use the "Places Organizer" exclusively when navigating to their bookmarks. I typically use the "Bookmarks Toolbar" (and occasionally the "Bookmarks" menu) to navigate to my bookmarks. Having my bookmarks already sorted by name when going through the menus and folders makes finding things __much__ easier.
