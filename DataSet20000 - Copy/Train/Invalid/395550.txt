Whenever you access "http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/" Firefox renders it perfectly, but suddenly exits. It doesn't display any error, and no bug report window is given. Even so, you're given the option to restore last session when starting Firefox again. Restoring it leads to another crash.
Notice the page is very JS intensive.

I was browsing that page properly when Firefox(minefield) asks me to update to latest version (had yesterday's), and restart. I do. When restoring session this page loads and firefox crashes.

Always reproducible.

Only special addon: DownThemAll 1.0b1

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load firefox (latest build 8/9/07 september 8 2007)
2. Browse to or give firefox this address: http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/
3. Crash

Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes, and you're immediatly back to desktop. (exits faster than normally xD).
Doesn't leave process open.

Expected Results:  
Firefox normally renders given page.

Default theme.
Works properly on stable release (2.0.0.6), safari, and ie7.
DTA 1.0b1
Either on a tab or being alone in the window :P

(the one that firefox(minefield-nightly) autoupdates to.)

No windows crash-dialog either.
