1Password does not work at all.

1Password does not work at all; even "launch 1Password" does nothing. Literally, nothing. Yes, I have 1Password installed, and have been using it very successfully for about a year now. Couldn't manage without it!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click in box where username and/or password should be entered
2. click on "fill" from the 1Password toolbar
3. Nothing at all happens.
Actual Results:  
Nothing, no user name, no password. I had to launch 1Password independently, and copy and paste this information.

Expected Results:  
Username and password should be filled in automatically.

I have not added any themes or additional extensions. Only 1Password, which is not working.

This is a feature that I cannot work without; unfortunately, although I really like Panorama, I will have to stop using it until the problems are fixed.
