text wrap fails to follow window width display of HTML based email that exceeds 72 or 80 characters
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

Changing window width has no effect.  Changing default line length (80) to (72) had no effect.  However, print preview of content is properly formatted and window properly resizes display to compensate for variation in width.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Display HTML based email on SBC Yahoo! Mail
2.Cannot read entire line with using scroll bar (horizontal)
3.Print preview properly shows text lines wrapped at window boundary

Actual Results:  
see above

Expected Results:  
Same email displayed under IE or Yahoo Browser works as expected.
