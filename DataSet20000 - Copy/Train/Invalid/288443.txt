Firefox refuses https connection when application is not located in /Applications or ~/Desktop
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2

I created a folder an the same level as /Applications; I call this folder
Internet and it contains all manner of Internet applications (browsers, FTP
programs, etc).  If I put Firefox 1.0.x in this folder, Firefox works fine
_except_ it will not open any https URL (Connection refused... message pops up).
 However, if I put Firefox in /Applications or ~/Desktop, there is no problem
connecting to https sites.

No amount of fiddling with network or firewall settings will get Firefox to open
an https URL when it is in my Internet folder.  I have not tested it by putting
it elsewhere (I'm happy to have it work in /Applications).

This behavior does not occur with Mozilla 1.7.6

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Put Firefox in a folder at same level as /Application
