Clicking a PDF link goes into an infinite loop opening blank windows
When clicking on the "Front Page" link from this web page:
  http://www.elijahsrestaurant.com/elijahs_restaurant_menu.html
Firefox will open blank window after blank window until I force quit.

Afterwards, the downloads folder contains the actual PDF (page1.pdf) as well as tons of files with names like "+Lcr3QHg.pdf.part".
