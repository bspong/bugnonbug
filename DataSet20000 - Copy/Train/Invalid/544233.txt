Hi,

After opening the side http://www.abnamro.co.in/India/index.htm , when i select the Netbanking from "Internet Banking begin" drop down box from top right of the page, the window of Netbanking is not pop up.

I had tried by deselect the "Block up window options" in Edit->Preferences->Content but on effect, similarly i had tried by Allowing the name of site in the "Block up window" but no help.

Pls, check into the issue.

Thanks,
Deepak
