Hello!

I am the main developer of the realtime 3D plug-in for the web called TurnTool.
We have about 250.000 downloads of our plug-in each month.

Last week we upgrade to FireFox 3.0.6 and discovered that our TurnTool plug-in stopped working just after updating to FireFox 3.0.6. The only way to solve the problem was to disable the plug-in called 'Google Toolbar for FireFox'.

You need the TurnTool Viewer to reproduce the problem.
First install the TurnTool plug-in using this xpi. http://www.turntool.com/ViewerInstall.xpi

This page is only 23 lines long so it should be simple to see that is going on.

If the plug-in called 'Google Toolbar for Firefox' is disable then TurnTool 3D will be shown as expected. This is not the case if the 'Google Toolbar for Firefox' is enabled.

What makes to problem even weirder is that if the TurnTool Viewer is inserted into the HTML page using document.write then it works regardless of whether the Google Toolbar for Firefox is enabled.

Here is an example of this.

I hope you can find a solution to this problem or tell me what changes are necessary in the TurnTool PlugIn.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. First install the TurnTool plug-in using this xpi. http://www.turntool.com/ViewerInstall.xpi
2. Make sure that you have the Plugin called 'Google Toolbar for Firefox'
3. Open this very simple HTML page using the TurnTool plugin. http://studio.turntool.com/FireFox3.0.6_Problem/TTV2_DHTML/


Expected Results:  
Expected Results is to see the TurnTool Viewer working as it does for all previous versions of FireFox until 3.0.6.

We have supported FireFox since version 1.0 and we have always until now been able to resolve problems ourselves when new versions of FireFox were released.
