When trying to go directly to the above address, I am prompted to open an "application/octet stream"

Our biz cards have individual web page addresses for our performers (www.partymagic.info/deebest).  In Safari (on my Mac) or in Internet Explorer on my PC, I can key this url in and get right to the page.  In Firefox (the latest build), when I key this in, a small window pops up asking me to "Open deebest" which is an application/octet stream from http://www.partymagic.info  What should Firefox do with this file?"
Any ideas on how to fix this?

1.type in the url:  http://www.partymagic.info/deebest
2.Hit Enter
