SSTabRestored is not sent if a tab fails to load

Steps to reproduce:

Bug 614089 says SSTabRestored should be fired for each tab, but if a tab has to connect to the site for updating, and fails to load because of various reasons like no network connection, SSTabRestored is not sent. I'm not sure whether this is intended.
