The new version has really messed up the Sage RSS reader.  The main problem is when a website is unavailable for any reason, the reader "sticks" trying to access that site and won't move on.  This means I can't read any sites in the RSS list lower than the site that is down. 

In addition, the new posts don't light up after clicking "check feeds" until I mouse over them. Why is that? Also, the option to only show new feeds (ie feeds I haven't already read) is gone - now I see the whole list including sites that haven't updated.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.From within Sage, click "check feeds"
2.
3.
Actual Results:

Expected Results:

Why did I upgrade?  It was working fine before.
