Whenever I browse Firefox 3.6.8 for 20-30 mins, it gets crashed. I hardly open 3-4 tabs. This happens not just 1-2 times, but every time.
Same version Firefox is working perfectly fine on my desktop. I recently installed it on my laptop with following configuration:

Processor: Core i3
RAM: 3GB
OS: WinXP

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox with 2-3 tabs of web pages.
2. Firefox crashes in 20-30 mins
Actual Results:  
Displays the following error dialog:

"Firefox.exe: Microsoft encountered a problem with firefox.exe and needs to be closed."

Expected Results:  
Firefox shouldn't crash
