Location bar auto-complete does not list active tabs unless show history is checked.

Location bar auto complete has the option to show either history, bookmarks, both or none.
If you don't have history checked, active tabs will not be listed in the auto complete.

I want to show bookmarks and active tabs but not history. This is not possible.

(Also, is there any way to prioritize tabs in the auto complete so they always come above bookmarks?)

Reproducible: Always
