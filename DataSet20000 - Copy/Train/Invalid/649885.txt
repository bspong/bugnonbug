'Open New Windows In A New Tab instead' is not working when the popup is invoked by Flash

I surf a lot of porn sites. And some of them invoke a popup if you click the play button of their Flash player. Even though I have FF set to 'Open New Window In A New Tab', this isn't working if a window is invoked by a Flash object. For example, if I want to watch porn clip on tnaflix.com and click the Play button, then a popup window of livejasmin.com comes up. But it doesn't open in a new tab. It opens in a new window, even though I've set the above mentioned option. This is very annoying.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set option 'Open new windows in a new tab instead'
2. Go to tnaflix.com
2. Choose a porn clip
3. Click the Play button of that porn clip
4. A popup window comes up which doesn't open in a new tab
Actual Results:  
Instead of opening in a new tab (as set in the preferences), the window opens in a new browser window.

Expected Results:  
The popup window should open in a tab, not in a window.

It happens when you click Flash objects that invoke a popup window.
