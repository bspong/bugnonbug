Mouse wheel doesn't work correctly on some pages

The mouse wheel doesn't work as expected on some websites with firebird latest
builds (see examples above). It only works if I actually press the middle button
and scroll while pressing it. 

Mouse wheel works just fine on other pages, eg. cnn.com ; spiegel.de ; news.com

I was unable to find a pattern here.

This seems to be a firebird only problem, the latest nightly of the suite works
just fine regarding the mouse wheel.

My configuration: RedHat 9, Gnome (XD2), stantard not cordless logitech mouse
with mousewheel.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open firebird
2. go to wired.com ; mozdev org or slashdot.org or

3.Watch your mousewheel doing nothing while you move it

Actual Results:  
Not scrolling the page.

Expected Results:  
Scrolling up and down smoothly.
