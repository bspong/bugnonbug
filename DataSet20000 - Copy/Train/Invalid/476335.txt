I was searching through the Firefox webpage and got to the Features page, and it says that there is a 'Find as you type' feature that i didnt know about.
I tried it and it didnt work.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click anywhere on the page.
2.Start to type a word to find on the page.
3.Nothing happens.
Actual Results:  
Nothing. That is the problem. Its supposed to find the text that i am typing. But it is not.

Expected Results:  
I expect it to find, highlight and move the cursor to the first instance of the word i am typing.

I would also like to say, that if anyone else is having a problem, maybe you should take the feature off of the page until it is fixed. That way noone reads that page and gets angry that features arent working properly. Just a thought.
