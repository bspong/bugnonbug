If a object tag includes a SVG files the offsetWidth and offsetHeight will be 0 when DOMContentLoaded fires even if the object tag has a set width / height.

If the same values are read when onload fires the values are set.

All other "modern" browsers has these values on DOMContentLoaded. FF is the only one returning 0 as value.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a document with a object tag including a svg file. Set a width on the object tag.
2. Create a function which reads out offsetWidth of the object tag.
3. Fire the function created in step 2 at DOMContentLoaded. 
Actual Results:  
The value are 0 and not the actual value of the object tag.

Expected Results:  
The object tag to have a correct value.
