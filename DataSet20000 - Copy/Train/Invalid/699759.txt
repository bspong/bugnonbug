User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0 Iceweasel/5.0
Build ID: 20110620095416

Steps to reproduce:

We checked our browser enviroment to check some certificates and saw that the Diginotar certificates where back in Firefox 7 where as in Firefox 3.6 they where gone.


Actual results:

We have upgraded our Ubuntu to 11.04 and since then the Diginotar certs where back. Where as they where gone in the Ubuntu 9.04 release of Firefox 3.6


Expected results:

The Firefox browser shouldnt allow any use of Diginotar certificates at all.
