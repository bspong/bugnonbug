if i turn my computer on, all features for firefox 3 and all supported extentions work as per usual. however, if i restart firefox and try to open it again, i am unable to acess certain menues, such as bookmarks, tools, history (they do not open anything/all bookmarks are gone).also, my bookmarks toolbar menue appears blank and the back/forwards buttons stop working (pressing backspace or CTRL+ -> or <- doesn't work either). lastly, the saved password feature doesn't fill in the fields after this happens. once i restart my system, however, the first time i start Firefox, everything works properly.
