When I move the cursor over any menu item, it becomes highlighted.
This should only happen when the ALT key has been pressed, indicating
that the menu is now active and navigable using the keyboard.

Hitting ALT twice after this bug clears the highlight, although as
soon as the mouse moves again, the highlight reappears.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move cursor over any menu item, say Help.

Actual Results:  
Menu item is now highlighted.

Expected Results:  
Menu item should not be highlighted.
