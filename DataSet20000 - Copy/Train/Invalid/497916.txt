Can't focus XUL elements
Created attachment 382974
testcase - focus on vbox

With Minefield (I'm on Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko/20090612 Minefield/3.6a1pre), focus on XUL elements is spotty. 

The attached testcase focuses the red vbox from code in the onload handler, then alerts the active element (should be 'vbox' but is 'window'). Also when you click on the red vbox, it alerts the active element (should be 'vbox' but is 'window'). And to show it's not just activeElement, a keypress handler is added to the vbox (clicking on the vbox and pressing a key should bring up an alert, but it does not). All of this works in builds prior to 06/11.
