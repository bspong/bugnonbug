Firefox 4 search in bing, and this sucks ! I do not see no settings to correct that in the settings. So it`s like a virus or spam, because we can not get ride of it.

And changing the keyword.URL it`s not a solution , we need something in the settings. Why ?

1 .I do not want to void my warranty 

"This might void your warranty!"

 Changing these advanced settings can be harmful to the stability, security, and performance of this application.You should only continue if you are sure of what your doing."

"I'll be careful I promise!"

2 . I will not be careful, and i will be tempted to change other settings, and this will make me a liar .



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clean install firefox 4.
2. Search using the Left upper bar
3. And you see the Bing Virus.



The solution is to go to about:config 

In the Filter box, Type in keyword.URL
Under Preference Name, keyworld.URL should pop up.  Right-Click it and Select Modify.

Replace the text with the following:

http://www.google.com/webhp?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8.

But this it`s a stupid fix, leaving the normal user affected with this viruses .
