Skype extension breaks Firefox 3.0 restarting

Firefox 3.0 (and now 3.0.1) does not start properly each time after the application has been closed.  During the restart, I do not get to my normal home page nor do I have access to my "Bookmarks".  The only way to get Firefox to restart properly is to reboot the computer.  Did not have this problem with Firefox 2.x.  Running Windows XP Home Version 2002 with Service Pack 2 and all subsequent MicroSoft updates installed on Dell Latitude D630 operating with 1.7GHzlock speed and 1GB RAM.  Also use Norton 360 2.0 for firewall and anti-virus.  Any suggestions?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox after booting computer.
2. Do whatever is wanted on Internet.  Can have multiple Firefox windows open or just one single window.
3. Close Firefox (all that are open).
4. Restart Firefox.
5. Encounter problem: no home page; no access to "Bookmarks".
5. Reboot computer to get Firefox to restart properly
Actual Results:  
Firefox does not open properly.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should open properly to my home page and give me access to my Bookmarks
