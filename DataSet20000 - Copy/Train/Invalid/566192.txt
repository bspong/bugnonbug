Firefox stopped working after upgrading to v3.6.4. It starts up and opens a blank tab, but doesn't load my home page, but has the correct URL. Using bookmarks doesn't work either. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on Firefox Icon
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Window opens with blank page and correct URL in Location bar.  There is no error page about can not locate.  Tab is labeled (Untitled).

Expected Results:  
Window opens with correct web page and correct URL in Location bar.

I also installed the latest versions of Opera and Chrome on this 64-bit Vista computer.  Opera, Chrome and IE8 all work normally. 

If I don't hear from someone later today I intend to download and install 3.6.3 which was working fine.  Let me know if you need any forensics before I trash it.
