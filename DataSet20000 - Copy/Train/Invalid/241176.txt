I hope this is a bug/oversight and not a new "feature."  In Firebird 0.7, cookie
acceptance criteria settings were independent of each other (i.e. any
combination of "Enable Cookies From Originating Website Only", "For This Session
Only", and "Ask Before Accepting" could be used).  In Firefox 0.8, "Enable
Cookies From Originating Website Only" is independent, but I must now choose
between "Accept For This Session Only" and "Ask Before Accepting."  I *ALWAYS*
have both of these last two options enabled when browsing with Firebird.  I now
have to choose between expanding my cookie whitelist and blacklist on-the-fly
and automatically modifying persistent cookies into session cookies.  IMHO, this
is a giant step backwards in user friendliness.  Does anyone else think so?
