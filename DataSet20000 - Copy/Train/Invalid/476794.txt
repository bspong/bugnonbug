I realize from browsing the previous bug reports that this is not the place for those who are having firewall issues, and sincerely apologize if this is the case.  However, I believe I have some understanding of how my firewall works, and am fairly convinced that it is not the problem.  Initially I suspected a firewall error, and spent some time ensuring that Firefox was allowed to pass through the firewall.

In case it might be a compatibility issue, firewall software is Symantec Endpoint Protection ver 11.0.4000.2295, with Network Threat Protection definitions from January 28, 2009 r3.  Thank you for your time
