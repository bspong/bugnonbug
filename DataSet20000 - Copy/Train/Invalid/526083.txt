This bug or whatever it is has been hapening whenever Firefox decides it's time for an update or an update add-on has been updated AND my laptop has just woken u from sleep and usually the only solution is restart the computer, not re-start firefox.  Control/ALT/Del will not bring up the task manager and I loose all my work.

Problem is, I never know when it's going to happen and I guess crash dumps can't be generated because it's a new version.  I also have no idea how to track/debug it.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Actual Results:  
hangs and ctrl/alt/del won't bring up the task manager.

Expected Results:  
At least ctrl/alt/del should work.
