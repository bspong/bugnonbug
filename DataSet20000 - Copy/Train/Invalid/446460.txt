I started something on this on Bug 446098, but figured that it should have it's own bug.

Why, in the About Box on Firefox and Thunderbird, do we have "Cancel", and "OK"? Cancel is used to revoke all changes and exit, while OK is used to apply all changes and exit. There are no possible changes you CAN make in the About Box, so having two buttons only confuses people. I think that only having "OK" (which is typical) would be the best option. There is really no need for cancel, unless there were changes you need to not apply in that window, which there are not.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click Help > About
2.Look at the buttons.
3.
Actual Results:  
There are both "Cancel" and "OK".

Expected Results:  
There should only be "OK".
