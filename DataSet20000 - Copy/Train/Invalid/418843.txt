I was sorting the bookmarks and I dragged a bookmark into a folder in the bookmarks list. Then, without closing the bookmarks list, I dragged that same bookmark in order to arrange it. After that, the bookmarks list just wouldn't close. I deselected the Bookmarks menu, still the list remained. I could not minimize Firefox either, the desktop would just flash for a moment and return to Firefox. A screenshot depicting the problem is attached. More screenshots are available.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.First you need to have a bookmark in the bookmarks list (not kept in any folder)
2.Also, there has to be at least a folder created in the bookmarks, and it should have several bookmarks in it
3.Drag the bookmark into the folder
4.Now don't close the bookmarks list or move the cursor to any other location, just re-arrange that same bookmark in that same folder
5.Now click on any other menu
Actual Results:  
The bookmarks list remains open and on top of Firefox and any other programs.

Expected Results:  
The bookmarks list should have closed.
