Browser Link clash with Firefox and Internet Explorer 7.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.5) Gecko/20070713 Firefox/2.0.0.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.5) Gecko/20070713 Firefox/2.0.0.5

When I click on a link, Firefox opens My Documents and displays a dialog looking for an *.exe file with a messsage 'locate link browser'.However, the browser does start but one needs to close the dailog box. I am running version 2.0.0.5. which is the latest version.

I can fixed the problem by changing settings in Folder Options as follows:
    * Open My Computer or Windows Explorer
* Open Tools>Folder Options..., File Types tab
    * Scroll down to (NONE) URL:HyperText Transfer Protocol and select it
    * Click Advanced and then, with open selected, click Edit
    * Clear the checkbox for "Use DDE" (the dialog should then hide the lower part)
    * Click OK for that dialog and the next one. Windows will update the registry.
    * Repeat for the HTTPS protocol (next in list) and/or Close when you are done.

Every time I run Internet Explorer 7 then I have the problem again and have to fix the Folder options as described above.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Internet Explorer 7.
2. Run Firefox.
3.
Actual Results:  
When step 2 is run you will experience the problem with the Firefox browser link.
