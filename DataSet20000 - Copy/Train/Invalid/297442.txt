Firefox hangs up if close the "import bookmarks for IE" dialog for a new user without selecting an option
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.4

When I set up a new user on my XP box, they simply "closed" the window that 
offers to import IE bookmarks, instaed of selecting "Yes" or "No".  Firefox  
still hang on restart after logoff (the only thing which resets the 
hang....task manager does no good) for that user only.  all other users remain 
unafected.  Firefox Safe mode does not help either.  

I would like to know hwo to get firefox settings reset for that user!



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Add new user to WinXP system 
2.Logon and start firefox as new user
3.Click "(window.close) X", do not select yes or no

Actual Results:  
Firefox goes into some kind of hang state immune to "Task Manager" end now!  
Logging off works until that user tries to use Firefox again at which point it 
hangs immediately.

Expected Results:  
Just close the window gracefully...assume default no import!

Does not CRASH, but it does HANG and use a lot of systme resources doing it!
