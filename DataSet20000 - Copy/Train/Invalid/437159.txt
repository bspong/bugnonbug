FF 3.0 RC1.  Bookmarks placed into a folder in the Toolbar cannot be opened by clicking on them.  Right-clicking a bookmark closes the drop-down list of bookmarks in the folder.  Only way to open these bookmarks is by clicking on the folder and using the arrow keys to scroll to the bookmark, then press enter key.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a folder for bookmarks within the "Bookmarks Toolbar"
2. Right click or left click on a bookmark
3. Drop-down menu closes without redirecting to bookmark.
Actual Results:  
Nothing.

Expected Results:  
Should redirect to the bookmark.  Other bookmarks placed as stand-alone entries in Bookmarks Toolbar work as expected.
