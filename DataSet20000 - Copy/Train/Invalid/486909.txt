I was previously able to stream from the CBC site, http://www.cbc.ca/listen/, but I am no longer able to.  I believe it worked when I used Windows Media Player 9 but I had version 10 installed and I upgraded it to version 11.  Neither version works on Firefox.  It works fine on IE7.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.cbc.ca/listen/
2. Select a stream from the map.
3. Select "High bandwidth stream" from popup window.
Actual Results:  
The popup window hangs displaying "Video is loading..."  The streams on this page are all audio streams, not video.

Expected Results:  
Audio stream should play.
