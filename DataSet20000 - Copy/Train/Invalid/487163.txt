"Next" button on Yahoo search results adds on to first ten search results rather than go to another page

I have this weird action that occurs in yahoo search results. Whenever I click on "Next Page," instead of going to the next page, the next batch of results are added to the previous results on a single page. I would like to turn this feature off because it interferes with my Firefox Autopager add-on. Even with Autopager disabled, it still happens. This does not seem to happen in IE8 though.

I'm using a Dell desktop PC with XP installed.
