The online store at the attached URL and Firefox 1.0.7 got along just fine and then I upgraded to v1.5 and now when I log-in to the online store my keyboard no longer works.  I tried re-downloading the plug-in for Firefox but still no luck.  My keyboard works fine on the front-end of www.sanmar.com, but while the web-client plug-in is being utilized by Firefox the keyboard function is completely gone except for the tab, ctrl and enter keys.  All of the alpha-numeric and punctuation keys are nonfunctional.  Thanks!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the web client plug-in for Firefox from the link under 'First Time Users' in Step 2 on http://shop.sanmar.com/ while using Firefox 1.0.7 and go into the log-in screen under 'Returning Customers', you don't need a log-in, but you SHOULD be able to see the log in screen and type in the empty fields.

2. Upgrade to Firefox v1.5 then re-visit the log-in screen under 'Returning Customers' at http://shop.sanmar.com/.

3.  Attempt to type in the empty fields in the log-in screen.  The ability to produce letters and numbers with the keyboard is gone.

Actual Results:  
The keyboard function was gone after the browser started utilizing the plug-in.

Expected Results:  
The keyboard should be functional.

We believe that the file 'orfcexec.dll' in the plug-in software is what the browser is not utilizing or seeing even though it's in the install and the plug-in works without fail with FF v 1.0.7.  There is no connection to Win XP or 2000 or different themes with this issue as we have recreated this error on different machines.  Thanks!
