Problem entering extended characters
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.2; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50215; InfoPath.1)

When entering a character such as ALT+0176 ( " º " -- degree symbol commonly used for temperature) with the numlock enabled, firefox will instead navigate usually to the last page, behaving as if the numlock was turned off.  This can be repeated at any website in any user-input text field.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go visit a few webpages so the browser's back button has something to go to
2. Enable numlock if it is not enabled by default
3. Press a desired extended character, which is done by holding down the <ALT> key and typing in its four or five digit code in decimal (windows does reproduce unicode characters but it is of very limited use and doesn't work in all text fields)
4.  Browser should change page and fail to allow entry of character
Actual Results:  
Jumps back a page.

Expected Results:  
Typed in the user input like this: °
