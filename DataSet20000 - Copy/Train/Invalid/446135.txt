I have a bookmark - http://www.digitalhome.ca/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=11. When I click, the address becomes - http://www.digitalhome.caforum/forumdisplay.php?f=11 in the address box.

Note the first forward slash after - http://www.digitalhome.ca is missing.

I have a second forum with this website and it exhibits the same actions.

I have a third and it does not.

I checked the properties of all and the forward slash is present on all properties.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click bookmark
2.address box shows missing forward slash
3.
Actual Results:  
error message window displays about url not found

Expected Results:  
displayed the web page

This happened on two bookmarks only. I have a third forum with this site and it works OK. I checked the properties for both the failed bookmarks and all was OK.

I deleted both bookmarks and reloaded them.

The problem has corrected itself. The bookmark address is copied identically to the address box.

I have around a hundred or so bookmarks and these are the only two so far that are affected.
