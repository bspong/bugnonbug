When a page loads and the cursor is set to appear in the login box, firefox hangs / freezes and requires me to preform a force reboot. The entire system locks up completely and doesn't respond.

When viewing certain web pages, specifically when you visit:

flickr.com
yahoo.com
help.asmallorange.com
paypal.com

Or any site in general that has the cursor automatically start flashing in the login / password box, Firefox locks up immediately after loading the page. I have noticed it mainly on the above sites but the thing is common is that any site that has the cursor appear in a login box Firefox tends to crash - completely. My entire system locks up, CTRL+ALT+DEL does not work, nothing works, except a force reboot.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit one of the following sites: paypal.com, yahoo.com, help.asmallorange.com, ebay.com, flickr.com, or any site you know after it loads a cursor appears in the login box.

2. Firefox should freeze / hang / lock up immediately after the page loads. It happens 90% of the time, but keep checking those sites and it should lock up.
Actual Results:  
1) The mouse will be come unresponsive
2) CTRL+ALT+DEL will not work, keyboard is unresponsive
3) Entire system lockup, results in a force reboot

Expected Results:  
You should be able to type into the login box with a lockup, and proceed normally.

This bug is not effected by themes or extensions, I am running a clean installation. It also happens on the latest build of Firefox Beta 3, although I will have to re-confirm that.

If you run a Google search "firefox lockups or firefox freezing" you will see similar reports on forums about it. Happens in XP and all versions of Vista.
