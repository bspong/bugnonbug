My Internet Security software keeps identifying spyware associated with the following Mozilla file;

c:\program files\mozilla firefox\plugins\npsaidetect.dll

spyware is identified as - Adware.180Solutions.U

I would be very unhappy to learn that this spyware is inserted intentionally by the designers at Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Occurs the first time I visit any site after starting Firefox
2.
3.



Expected Results:  
My internet security software advises of the presence of spyware at confirms that the spyware has been disabled.

I consider this to be a serious breach of my privacy, and if intentionally inserted by Mozilla, I will be very disapointed and shall post my displeasure.
