On HP servers with ILO2 is java applet for remote console (local screen of the server).
On Firefox3 working perfect, on previous beta versions of Firefox4 working (slower, but still usable). But on Firefox4 RC1 is loading of this applet very slow with high CPU usage and it is unresponsive.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open ILO2 web inerface
2. Click on "Remote Console" in menu of ILO2
3. Click on "Remote Console - Access the system KVM from a Java applet-based console requiring the availability of a JVM"
Actual Results:  
New window is opened, own process (visible in Activity Monitor) of Java applet is started which eats about 100% of cpu and same amount of memory as whole FF4. Firefox4 became unresponsive. After few minutes in window is showed java applet with message "Connecting..." and finished with message "Offline". After that, Firefox still eating more than 50% of cpu and console not working.

Expected Results:  
Same as in latest Firefox3:
New windows is opened, Java Applet correctly started within few seconds, eating < 10% of cpu and everything works flawless = remote console working.

I know reproducing of this can be very difficult, but I have no public ILO2 console accessible.
Java used in this test is the same for FF3 and FF4 (just changing Firefox).
