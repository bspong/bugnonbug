Can't load three DIVs in the same line
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla Firefox 3.0

In other browsers the page loads perfect, but in the Firefox the page loads wrong. This page has three div float:inline and the browser loads like Two in the left(the second onde down) and one in the right(and this down too!).
The correct is: |[DIV]-[ D I V ]-[DIV]|

Firefox loads: |[DIV]-----------------|
_______________|[ D I V ]-------------|
_______________|_________________[DIV]|


*I tried everything and nothing can fix this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type URL
2.Loads the site
3.Firefoz loads wrong
Actual Results:  
The Divs of CSS loads in the worng way, the first one is OK but the second downs and tird loads wrong too.

Expected Results:  
Loads the three Divs inline

In all broser that I load my blog everything is OK: IE, Opera & Google Chrome, i've already put a message in my home page. "This site loads better in IE, Opera & Google Chrome". What hapend with Firefox, cant work with CSS?
I tried all possible thing that i can, different ways with float, creat a table, resize the DIVs. Nothing work!
