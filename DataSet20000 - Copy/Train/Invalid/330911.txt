Firefox killed my computer.  I can longer use computer without wiping the hard drive and reinstalling everything.  I go to start the computer, it loads the desktop image but nothing else before it shows a blue error screen.

The error that I get everytime I start the computer up is:

0028:C026064F in VXD VMM (06) 0000164F


I do not know what this error is for nor can I find any answers on-line for this error.  I love using firefox but if it killed my computer, how safe is firefox for computers.  My operating system by the way is Windows 95 and I've been using firefox for about a year now without any mishaps till now.  I apologize for this inconveniance but I do hope that the problem is found and I can repair my computer without losing all my data that is saved on it.

Thank you
