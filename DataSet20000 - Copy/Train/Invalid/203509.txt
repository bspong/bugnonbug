build instructions do not work - need manual ./configure step

http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/README.html gives instructions for
a build from CVS.

In fact, 'gmake -f client.mk build' does not initially work. The Makefile is not
created from Makefile.in in at least the browser directory is not created by
this step.

I ran './configure  --enable-crypto --disable-tests --disable-debug
--disable-mailnews --disable-composer --enable-optimize=-O2 --disable-ldap
--disable-mailnews
--enable-extensions=default,-inspector,-irc,-venkman,-content-packs,-help
--enable-plaintext-editor-only' first. The went back to 'make ... build' and
things seem to work.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get fresh CVS checkout (make ... checkout)
2. make ... build
3. make dies because there is no makefile in browser

Actual Results:  
make dies because there is no makefile in browser


Expected Results:  
There should be a make file in browser

this was tested for firebird only. I have not tested mozilla.
