Text size changes apply to other windows with the same URL

Steps to reproduce:

Created a new tab. Dragged it out to the desktop. I now have a separate window. I copied the URL from one of the tabs on window1 to the new window. I have now 2 windows showing the same page. I used the Zoom Feature on one of the windows.


Actual results:

The text resized on both of the windows.


Expected results:

The text should have only resized for the window I was working on.
