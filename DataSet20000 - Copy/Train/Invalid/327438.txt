When a cached image changes on a server Firefox does not detect it
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

When Firefox has a image from a visited site stored in its disk cache and this image is updated on the server, Firefox does not detect it (I've been waiting for several weeks). Internet Explorer 6 dected it immediately. Opera has no problems either. In Firefox, I've been waiting for weeks for the image to change. In vain. The change is still undetected.

The only way to work around that in FF is to hit F5. Firefox should check the timestamp of a cached image at least once per session. 

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Updated image is not detected (the cached version was used instead).
