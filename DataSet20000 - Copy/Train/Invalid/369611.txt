With the recent version of Firefox (2.0.0.1) the right scrolling marquee no longer displays.  Looking at my page, the friends section has 4 marquees in a square.  The Up, Down, and Left work correctly, but the top marquee (right) doesn't.  This correctly displays in IE.  There are other sites with the same code for their friends list that the right marquee no longer displays too.

Reproducible: Always
