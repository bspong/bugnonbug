When launching Firefox normally, favicons will load properly. If firefox is not loaded, and an external link is opened (start -> run -> type in an address), favicons will not load in the bookmark toolbar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure that Firefox is not currently running and is the default browser
2. Click Start -> Run, then type in any address
3. Click OK
4. Firefox will open
Actual Results:  
Favicons will not be shown on the bookmarks toolbar. The icons will not be loaded and a blank area will be shown instead.

Expected Results:  
Favicons should be displayed.
