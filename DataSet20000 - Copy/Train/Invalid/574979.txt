When an instance of Plugin Container for Adobe Flash is launched, it breaks Aero transparency layer (AeroBuddy addon)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; es-AR; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20100611 mod_dsm/4.20 Firefox/3.6.4

I use AeroBuddy, an addon that allows Firefox 3.x to use Aero transparency layers on the UI.
In my case, it worked absolutely fine until last update, 3.6.4.
When I attempted to load a site which used the newly added Plugin Container (e.g. a site with Adobe Flash), the UI would get screwed up as soon as the Plugin Container was launched.
However, it only seems to affect the window which hosts the webpage using the plugin. All other windows seem to remain OK, as far as I've tested.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install AeroBuddy, available at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/63130/
2. Restart your Firefox, then see e.g. Google's webpage. Notice all the Firefox UI has Aero transparency, as seen on my first screenshot.
3. Now go to any site that uses Flash, such as http://www.disneylatino.com or even Gmail, when you use the extended e-mail attachment options (which use Flash, BTW).
Actual Results:  
All UI was utterly screwed: scrambled text on title bar, wrong transparency on status bar, etc.

Expected Results:  
Nothing. Adobe Flash should not interfere with the UI at ALL.

My addon/theme setup is as follows:
*AeroBuddy 1.05 (URL Above)
*Strata40 (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/14284/)
*StrataBuddy 0.6.2 (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/14762/)
