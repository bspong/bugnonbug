While the bookmarks manager allows you to view bookmarks sorted, say by name, it does not change the order of the bookmarks when you export them.

The order of the exported bookmarks should be the same as the order presented by the Bookmarks Manager.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Setup in Bookmarks Manager: View -> Sorted by Name
2.Add a few bookmarks in reverse alphabetical order under a bookmark folder
3.Add a few bookmark folders, named in reverse alphabetical order under a folder
4.Export the bookmarks
5.View the exported bookmarks file

Actual Results:  
While the Bookmarks Manager will show the bookmarks and folders sorted by name, the resulting exported bookmarks file will not be sorted by name.


Expected Results:  
The exported bookmarks file will be written by the Bookmarks Manager in the order that it displays the bookmarks.
