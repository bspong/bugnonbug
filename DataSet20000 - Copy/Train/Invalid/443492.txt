While using LimeWire FREE (probably happens with Retail version,too)the screen will flash as LimeWire starts up. This always makes my browser theme default to, I guess, IE blue (from black).

Well, I'm currently on LimeWire 4.18.3, the icons for the plugins/add-ons I was using (IE Tab, AD Block Plus, & No Script) are no longer showing on the browser. Even after PC restarts.

Also, can't install add-ons/plugins. I repeatedly get an error as reported already by others.

Plus, since Firefox2, I could never easily surf IGN.com. I'm sure it has nothing to do with your browser, but that's exactly why (and really only why) I had IE Tab.

***After thinking a few minutes before posting this
   Did not happen until after Vista Service Pack 1. Probably important. I did lose my Volume and Battery icons after Vista SP1.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download LimeWire
2.Start it up a few times.
3.Lemme know if it happens to you.
Repeat above with Vista Service Pack 1 and w/out.
