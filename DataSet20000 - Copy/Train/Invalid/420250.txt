Bugzilla assums PC platform when "Macintosh" is present in Build Identifier
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9b4pre) Gecko/2008022804 Minefield/3.0b4pre
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9b4pre) Gecko/2008022804 Minefield/3.0b4pre

Possibly change the bugzilla form to recognize that the hardware is Macintosh when "Macintosh" is present in the Build Identifier. Saves bug submitters an extra step and keeps Macintosh bugs correctly identified with Mac hardware rather than PC hardware (unless you're using PC to mean any Intel-compatible hardware).
