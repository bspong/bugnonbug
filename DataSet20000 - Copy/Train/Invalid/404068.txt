The user profile path mentioned in the above URL is not valid in Leopard on my box
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko/20071025 Firefox/2.0.0.9
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko/20071025 Firefox/2.0.0.9

in document: http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_folder_-_Firefox
under the "1.5 Mac" section it states: 

"Profile folders are contained in ~/Library/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/ or ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/ ." 

This directory structure is not available in my installation of Leopard.
I do not have a ~/Library/Mozilla dir. I do have a ~/Library/Application Support dir however it only has Mozilla as a sub dir (which does not have a Profiles dir within) and does not contain a Firefox dir.

After searching my box I could not find a Profiles dir anywhere. 

My goal is to find and replace the profile with one from a backup of a box that no longer works.

I am guessing I am either missing something or this information is stored elsewhere in Leopard?

Thanks for your help.
