Steps to reproduce:

trying out firefox 7.0.1 on linux ubuntu 8.04


Actual results:

right click, get the menu , firefox hangs and causes a freeze in window manager (kde 3)
had to open a text window (alt-ctrl-f1) to manually kill firefox process, this freed up the window manager
brutal show stopper with my configuration
(298502 report similar hang but according to bug report no menu appeared)


Expected results:

being able to click on open in new tab and get my new tab
