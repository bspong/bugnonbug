Firefox only loads in Windows safe mode, not even Firefox safe mode (caused by MSMpEng.exe / Windows Defender monopolizing RAM)

a live chat client reported that he could not load firefox unless he was in windows safe mode.  We tried clean install, complete new install with removal of profiles folder after uninstalling in windows through add/remove programs.  The client ran 5 malware and one antivirus scan in both windows safe mode and regular boot.  When trying to get into firefox.exe -safe-mode from either windows safe mode or normal windows reboot the client got error report that the file was not found.  

Eventually it was determined that "(01:52) Bill: Well, blow me down.  That was the conflict, even though, as far as I was concerned, it was never "on" but, clearly, it must have been doing something in background.  Just prior, when I was in safe, I saw a process that was hogging an enormous amount of memory and contributing chatter - MSMpEng.exe - crappy bit defender which, again, I didn't know was in play.  I removed it too.  It was using something like 29,000 whatevers in safe.  Thks, Brett.  Gold Star.  I'm very grateful.  Bill"  It appears that Windows Defender was the culprit.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
It seems that to reproduce this you would have to be running winXP with windows defender messed up using insane amount of ram



Though the client didnt specifically state the cure, he hints in the last sentence in the live chat session that killing windows defender in task manager allowed Firefox to load and start running correctly
