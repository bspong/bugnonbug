Lost passwords and private mode not working after upgrading

We're installing Firefox 3.6.2, using an Admin-Domain-User, silently (unattended) on every XP Workstation.

The installation has been done with: 

Firefox Setup 3.6.2.exe -ms

We had on most systems Firefox 2.0.0.20 and on one Firefox 3.5.8.

The script installs the software, the user is not bothered. After the installation Firefox seems to run. BUT 

all saved passwords are gone,  

the password-manager is empty and the "show password" button is blank (no letters on it). 

All prior visited sites with an unknown cert are again unknown, 

passwords can't be saved (no question from firefox), 

the private mode doesn't work. If you click on it, nothing happens (no dialog and no "stop private mode" in the menu).

I tried several hints to restore passwords (found here: http://kb.mozillazine.org/Password_Manager ). Nothing worked.

Workaround:

Uninstall Firefox by hand and install it again by hand (with dialogs) and all works as it should.

In my opinion there's a bug in the silent unattended install/update installer program.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Update with Firefox Setup 3.6.2.exe -ms
2.Look into Password-Manager

Actual Results:  
Passwords lost
Doesn't save new passwords
Private Mode not working


Expected Results:  
Update should take over all data from a prior Firefox installation
