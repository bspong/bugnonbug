When reloading pages on several tabs in a rapid succession,
windows freezes. No mouse movement, no keyboard input possible.
Task manager shows 100% CPU use on 2 out of 4 cores.
You have to reboot. The system is totally dead.

But system is still running as task manager keeps updating
the permormance tab and keeps showing the cpu usage being update.

That may mean this is a serious security issue.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
To reproduce the problem, I'd have to provide you the login/passwd
info. I'd be willing to do that provided it is guaranteed to remain
confidential.

Actual Results:  
When you refresh pages in rapid succession before some page
has been fully loaded, what you get is total freeze of the box.

Expected Results:  
All these pages should complete loading without problems.
