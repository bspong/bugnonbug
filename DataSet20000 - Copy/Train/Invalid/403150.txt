Do not use an image in place of a preview image in the preview pane
In the bookmarks organizer, we shouldn't use a image that says "preview" for the following reasons:

-the font doesn't match the OS
-the font stretches when resized
-this will be impossible to localize

See bug# 393514 for a mockup.
