font size inconsistencies with Google Search field
Created attachment 551251
snapshot showing the problem when selecting the word

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0 Iceweasel/5.0
Build ID: 20110730084237

Steps to reproduce:

I typed text in the Google search field on http://www.google.fr/ e.g. abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.


Actual results:

The text appeared in big characters. When I click somewhere in the field, the caret doesn't appear at the correct position (I suppose Firefox considered that the text was displayed in normal font size and took the corresponding position). When I selected the whole word, the selection appears with normal font size. See snapshot.


Expected results:

The font size should always be the same, possible the normal size.
