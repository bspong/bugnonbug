Last week or so, the add bookmarks star wouldn't work - no dialog box, all pages bookmarked went to "recently bookmarked" folder and I had to edit properties and put in folders manually. Tried resetting my localstore.rdf, with no luck. Yesterday, when poking around I realized that when I was switched to Charter internet, they automatically installed some add-ons that I hadn't realized were there. Uninstalled add-ons, now add bookmark works. Thought I'd pass it on for future reference.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Clicked star
2.Nothing happens
3.Remove auto-installed add-ons, everything works. Yay!
