I downloaded Ubuntu Hardy Heron a few weeks ago. It came with Fire Fox 3. Since then I have updated or installed files and apps suggested by several forums but still cannot view most flash sites. YouTube and a couple others work erratically. Tried saving the flash file on my computer but could not play it using any player. Downloaded Macromedia Flash Player 9 and 10 and installed (removed one before loading other) but it didn't show up anywhere. Went to flash site and found that it says it doesn't work on Linux. 
I have tried Gnash SWF, Swfdec player,Movie Player, MPlayer movie player, VLC player all with no success.
When I go to the site the flash item is shown as a gray box with a circled "play" arrow. When I click on the arrow the "Loading Player" animation shows but does not play. When I right click on the player and go to "Properties", it gives me the flash info:
 http://admin.brightcove.com/viewer/federated_f8.swf?flashId=flashObj0&servicesURL=http%3A%2F%2Fservices.brightcove.com%2Fservices&viewerSecureGatewayURL=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.brightcove.com%2Fservices%2Famfgateway&cdnURL=http%3A%2F%2Fadmin.brightcove.com&autoStart=false&preloadBackColor=%23FFFFFF&continuousPlay=false&playerId=1579840116&width=790&height=620&externalAds=false&sendReports=false&buildNumber=348&ranNum=583298
but even saving the content to desktop will not let me play it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to site with flash player
2.Click on play
3.Wait
Actual Results:  
Player loaded the content but would not play it.

Expected Results:  
To watch a flash video.

Used Ubuntu 7.10 with FF2.? for several months before upgrading to Ubuntu 8.04 and FF3 and had no problem. 
This seems to involve The Ubuntu, Firefox and Macromedia people as it seems all were released without all the bugs of each taken care of. Not criticising as there is a ton of coding in each.
Thank you
