window appears to hang on browsing to nonexistent url in full screen mode
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7

If you are in full screen mode, and you type in a url that doesn't exist, then
the alert doesn't get focused properly, and it is impossible to find the alert
and close it, thus hanging the current window

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.boot firebird
2.go to full screen mode
3.type in http://foo.bar (for example)


Actual Results:  
I couldn't use that browser window at all, it had 'hanged', from the users point
of view

Expected Results:  
Showed the alert to user, and focus it properly so they can access it. 

Additionally, it would be nice if the prompts used a seperate thread, so even if
it did get lost, you would be able to continute.
