On this page there are several large (2016x1460px) JPEGs that do not display.
However, when navigating to their URLs directly the image is displayed. In Page
Info, in order to see the large image in the preview pane below you must select
the item in the list box, then select another item, and finally select the first
item. The first time you select the first item with width and height of the
image are reported as 0x0px

This problem also exists in the August 5th Deer Park nightly on Windows 2000.

Reproducible: Always
