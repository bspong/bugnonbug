Hi folks, I recently upgraded to 2.0 on Windows XP and Linux (Debian). On both operating systems I have the problem that Firefox shows a great delay when I change, open or close tabs. It just stops working for ca. two to five seconds until it reacts again to user input. This happens with only two open tabs as well as more then ten or more.

Thx and cheers, Markus

Reproducible: Always
