It's pretty simple - firefox prints roughly half the text and stops with a bar at the bottom of the screen. This has a fixed (relative?) position so I think that must be the problem. See the url. The page won't stay up forever (it's a job vacancy) but I'll include a tarbal of the page captured with Scrapbook (gives same result, I've tested). 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open url
2. go to print preview or print to a PS or PDF file or to paper.
