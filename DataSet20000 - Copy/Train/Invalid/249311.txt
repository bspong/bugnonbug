File > Send Page... does not use default mail application
FF 0.9.1. 

I have set Mozilla Mail 1.7 as my default mail application on Windows XP. I can
right click a file in Windows Explorer and choose to mail it, and it will launch
Mozilla Mail to do that.

When I have FF running and select File > Send Page... (or whatever the exact
wording was), it launches Outlook Express. Obviously I would have expected it to
launch Mozilla Mail.
