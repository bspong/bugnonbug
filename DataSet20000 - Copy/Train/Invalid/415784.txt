hh.exe (Microsoft Windows Help) loads IE instead of FF

When clicking a link in hh.exe (Microsoft Windows Help) an Internet Explorer window is opened while FireFox is the default browser. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any .chm file with http links in it.
2. Click any http link.

Actual Results:  
IE window opens. Even if FF is the default browser.

Expected Results:  
FireFox should handle all http links. It should open link in it's own window.

I used ProcessMonitor from SysInternals to track down this issue.

hh.exe looks in registry for:
key - HKCU\Software\Classes\FirefoxURL\shell
value - HKCU\Software\Classes\FirefoxURL\ShellFolder

I didn't manage to give it a magic value that will make it happy.
But I guess, you can do it )
