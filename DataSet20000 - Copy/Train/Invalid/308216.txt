UTF-16 Character encoding displays a garbage page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050912 Firefox/1.4

When looking at any page with the UTF-16 character encoding garbage symbols are
displayed - is this because of broken functionality or is this a feature? I
assume this is a bug, because Firefox should warn if the current encoding will
display garbage output in my opinion.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto View -> Encoding -> UTF-16
2.
3.
