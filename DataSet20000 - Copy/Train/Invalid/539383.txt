IE Tab Produces Black Page in FireFox 3.6 RC1
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100105 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Whenever I go to a website that requires me to use IE Tab 1.5.20090525(latest version), I get a totally black window in FireFox 3.6. The tab shows that it is still loading while in the lower left corner of the bottom bar of FireFox it says "Done." This happens with every website with which I use IE Tab. I can switch the rendering engine back to FireFox and the site comes up fine in FF. But switching back to IE8 turns the window black again. IE Tab worked just fine in FF 3.57.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just switch the rendering engine to Internet Explorer -- that's all it takes
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Windows turns black, tab says it's "loading", bottom bar of FireFox says "Done."

Expected Results:  
The screen should have shown the webpage in IE within FireFox.

This is happening on both Windows XP computers on which I've installed FF 3.6 RC1. It happens with any website you try to use with IE from within FireFox 3.6.

When I switch back from the blacked out IE view to FF, I get this message in the Error Console which may or may not have something to do with all this (it's beyond pay grade):
