Firefox 1.5 B2 is missing default vendor and vendorSub useragent and app.version preferences
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050921 Firefox/1.0.7 (mmoy CE 1.0.7 Release K8B-X36)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050921 Firefox/1.0.7 (mmoy CE 1.0.7 Release K8B-X36)

After Firefox 1.5 Beta 2 is installed, the following preferences no longer exist
in the defaults/pref/firefox.js file:
app.version
app.extensions.version
general.useragent.vendor
general.useragent.vendorSub

This means checking the navigator.vendor and navigator.vendorSub strings via
javascript (or via preference) results in them being null.  In prior versions
navigator.vendor and navigator.vendorSub returned "Firefox" and the browsers
version respectively.

In addition some extensions check the app.version string to check what version
of Firefox they are running in.  This is now null as well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  In the location bar enter "javascript:alert(navigator.vendor)"
2.  In the location bar enter "javascript:alert(navigator.vendorSub)"

Actual Results:  
1. An empty alert box pops up.
2. An empty alert box pops up.

Expected Results:  
1. An alert box with the word "Firefox" should pop up.
2. An alert box with "1.4.1" (for Firefox 1.5 B2) should pop up.
