CTRL+T or the New Tab button opens a blank search page instead of my homepage. i have add-ons installed which allow user specified URL to load when opening a new tab. This worked perfectly with prior version of Firefox, stopped working after updated version installed. The new tab also opens at the end of tab row, instead of next to current tab, which was the previous behavior.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click CTRL+T
2. Click 'New Tab' button
3.
Actual Results:  
Blank page loads in new tab. New tab opens at end of row of tabs.

Expected Results:  
New tab should open next to current tab, with user's homepage loading instead of blank tab.

Bug occurs in every theme.
