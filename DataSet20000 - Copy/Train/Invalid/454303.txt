With Mozilla Firefox 3 the web sites, browsers and mail accounts take too long to load and open
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.16) Gecko/20080702 Firefox/2.0.0.16

When using Mozilla Firefox 3 the web sites, mail programs and browsers take too long to load and open which is keeping me from updating to the latest version of Mozilla Firefox. I currently have Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.16 and that problem does not exist with Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.16. Right now with this version of 2.0.0.16 the web sites, browsers and mail programs open nice and quickly and I need you to fix that problem with Mozilla Firefox 3 so I can update to the latest version.
