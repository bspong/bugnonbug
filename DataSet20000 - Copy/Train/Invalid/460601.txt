Hi, my girlfriend (sitting next to me) got a Windows XP SP3 (me too).
When I go on a specified website, displaying a <table> inside a <div>, her firefox is ignoring all <br> in the <td>.

Example code:
<div>
<table>
<tr><td> Hi <br> bye</td></tr>
</table>
</table>

:At her firefox, it is displayed as:
Hi bye

:At my firefox, it is displayed as:
Hi
bye


Why is firefox reacting such different?

IE7 and Opera is displaying everything fine on both pc's.
I told a few friends also to visit the site end tell me their results, 
one of ten got the same weird stuff, that the <br> is ignored.

please fix that.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. use my code listed at "Details".
2. Look with 5-6 different firefox 3.0.3 on the site
3. Feel the difference.





I checked the website with the w3 validator, the site is CSS 2.1 and HTML 4.01 validated.
