After update from Fx 3.1b2 to 3.1b3 it was shown that scroll on pages with many images become slower. Redraw of image after scrolling take rather long time and is visible by eye actually. This was observed with and without SmoothScroll. Previously (in Fx 3.1b2) this problem was not observed.

Reproducible: Always
