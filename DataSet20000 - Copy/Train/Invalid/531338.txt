Firefox doesn't warn to close tabs, always saves tabs without asking

Since I upgraded to 3.6b1, I have noticed my tabs have acted strangely.  I tried downgrading to 3.5, but the behavior didn't change.

I have browser.tabs.warnOnClose = true, but Firefox will not warn me about tabs I have open when I quit Firefox.  It does, however, always save my current session tabs, and then reopens them when I launch Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open multiple tabs
2. Select Firefox -> Quit Firefox (on Mac) or Command-Q.

Actual Results:  
Firefox closes all tabs and windows and saves the tabs for the next use of Firefox

Expected Results:  
Firefox would prompt whether to save the tabs or not.

I have no special themes, and only a few add-ons.
