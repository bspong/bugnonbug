Zooming fails in add-ons page.  See steps to reproduce for problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the Yellowpipe Lynx Viewer Tool 1.2.1 add-on page (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1944).
2. Click on the image on the right.
3. Click on one of the images.
4. Right-click on the image to zoom in.  Repeat once more or more depending on screen resolution, until bottom part of image doesn't appear.  Note: The image is not centered vertically.
5. Scroll down (I did through the mouse wheel.).  Keep scrolling for image.

I'm not sure if this is a Firefox bug or a website issue.
Actual Results:  
Image should always appear.  Netflix solves this by scrolling the image until the bottom appears, once the bottom appears, it stops scrolling.  When you move back up, the image scrolls until the top is seen and then doesn't scroll anymore.

Anyone who has a NetFlix account can see it in the preview popup every time you add a movie to your queue.

Expected Results:  
Couldn't see bottom part of images.
