Address Bar won't work when window maximized on a 1280 x 1024 resolution
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2

Everytime I open Firefox maximised in my resolution (1280 x 1024), I can't seem
to type an address. You can select whatever you want but not delete it or type. 

This gets solved by clicking the circle link to mozilla.org; located at the
almost-top right side of the window

and

opening Firefox in a "Restore" size... smaller, of course. I didn't see this
problems when working with 1024 x 768 resolution

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set your screen resolution to 1280 x 1024 and 32 bit color
2. Open firefox maximized

Actual Results:  
I could not type a new URL or keyword on the address bar

Expected Results:  
Let me type whatever I want to type

I have the following start page.

This problem is corrected when you resize the window to "not-maximized"; or open
it in that state from the beginning.
