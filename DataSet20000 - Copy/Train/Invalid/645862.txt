I'm not sure if this is either a Firefox thing or a NSIS thing or a Windows thing. But the Firefox icon does not propagate to the Start Menu recent items list.

I thought that maybe it was a bad install and did a clean reinstall but nothing. It does not show up in the recent programs list no matter how many times that Firefox is started.

Its easily worked around by either pinning the shortcut or having it on the desktop but it will not show up in the Start Menu.

Some reported that it worked for them, but there was not enough consensus.

Reproducible: Always
