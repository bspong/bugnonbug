Locking up internet connection.
Many web pages will not finish loading. When this happens it locks my whole
internet connection so I can no longer access any web pages. The only way I have
found to fix it is to shut my machine down and start it up again. It seem to
have something to do with Windows Event Receiver. The one page name I can give
you is swggalixy.com. but there have been many others. I am no longer going to
use firefox untill this problem is fixed and if you wait too long I will simply
uninstall it.
