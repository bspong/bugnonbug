search in addressbar using keywords not functioning

My keyword.URL and keyword.enabled are both the default values. When I enter multiple words in the addressbar, Firefox won't send me to the I'm Feeling Lucky page for those words, but instead shows the alert 'The URL is not valid and cannot be loaded'.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure keyword.URL and keyword.enabled are set to their default values
2. Enter any multiple words in the addressbar (multiple else Firefox will try to put .com behind it and that naturally works if the URL exists)

Actual Results:  
The alert 'The URL is not valid and cannot be loaded' is shown.

Expected Results:  
Navigated to the I'm Feeling Lucky page for the keywords I entered.

The only other example of someone with the same problem I could fine is here: hxxp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=289948

It's my problem exactly and while the workaround suggested there works (of course), it's still a workaround as it doesn't solve the problem.

It worked fine for me with FF1.5, but stopped functioning when I did a clean install of FF2.
