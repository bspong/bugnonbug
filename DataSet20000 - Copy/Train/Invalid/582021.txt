Download manager shouldn't close if there are popup windows left open
Currently, the download manager closes itself automatically (if there are no downloads in progress) following the "browser-lastwindow-close-granted" notification, which fires when the last non-popup navigator:browser is closed. This means that popup windows may still be open but they aren't taken into consideration.


Comment from Gavin on bug 544356, about "browser-lastwindow-close-granted" notification:
