I can no longer access livejournal since Firefox upgrade to 2.0.0.4 today.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20070515 Firefox/2.0.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20070515 Firefox/2.0.0.4

Firefox just hangs endlessly and finally comes up with a blank screen.  I can get into LJ no problem with IE.  Have tried rebooting several times and this will get me to my LJ sign on screen, but no further.  Once I enter my password and hit return, once again, the endless hang.  I have no problem accessing any other site I've tried, bookmarked or otherwise.  So strange.  It appears to be something between my computer, this upgrade and LJ???

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.type in www.livejournal.com
2.or
3.press the #3 "favorite" key on my keyboard which has this in memory
Actual Results:  
long hang, eventual blank screen.

Expected Results:  
instantaneous connect to livejournal site.

All the other "favorite" keys work just as they always have; only the livejournal key has stopped working.  As well, Firefox will not connect when I type the URL in and bypass the favorite key.  I have no problem connecting when I use IE.
