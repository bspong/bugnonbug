A Pop Up that precedes every application

The example below is for Firefox.

firefox.exe - Bad Image

The application on DLL C:\WINDOWS\System32\d3dhhdo.dll is not a valid windows image. Please check this against your installation diskette.  

The same pop up appears prior to opening any application (app), with the "app.exe Bad Image" on top left corner of the message. Please let me know what is the fix for this problem.
