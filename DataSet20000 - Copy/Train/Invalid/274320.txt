been opened, even if the last tab opened has subsequently been closed.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open first web page in first tab
2. Open second web page in a new tab
3. Go to first tab - Browser's title bar will still have the title of second tab
4. Close the second tab - Browser's title bar will still have the title of the
second tab even though the second tab has been closed!

Actual Results:  
Browser is still working, but the title bar displays the wrong title for the
active tab.

Expected Results:  
The title bar should display the CURRENT active tab's webpage title.
