When opening a new tab using appl-T or with a link, the addition of a second tab causes the screen to go blank.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a window and load a page.
2. Open another tab in that window. 
3.
Actual Results:  
What *appears* to be happening is that the tabs are being squished over to the left side of the tab bar, since I do get the "change tab" arrows there, and can pull up a listing of the tabs I have open.  It does not seem to matter which webpages I have open.

Expected Results:  
I was expecting normal tab behavior -- i.e., that it would open the tab bar at the top of the screen and then display all my tabs with their contents.

Selecting a different tab does not cause it to display.  Dragging the horizontal scroll bar does not change the width of the screen.  I had this problem with both this version and the last one, although not the one before that.
