I started to notice this the other day over on http://www.openfilm.com/ when I would play any of their videos, Firefox 3.1b3pre would use 100% CPU. I came across another site that is exhibiting this same issue and you can see it for yourself by playing this video: http://www.viddler.com/explore/cstricklin/videos/1?secreturl=108342989.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox 3.1b3pre
2. Visit http://www.viddler.com/explore/cstricklin/videos/1?secreturl=108342989

Actual Results:  
Firefox 3.1b3pre uses 100% of the CPU.

Expected Results:  
Firefox 3.1b3pre should not be using 100% of the CPU to play a video.

I have the latest versions of Flash installed.
