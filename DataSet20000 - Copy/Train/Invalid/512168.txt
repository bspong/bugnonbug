When doing a Tools -> Clear Recent History and selecting Everything, Firefox also clears out the list of sites that I have added to exceptions in my "accept cookies from list."  Older versions of Firefox (the 3.0 series) did not do this.  It is annoying because I want to clear the cookies set by those sites, but not remove those sites as exceptions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Tools -> Options -> Privacy uncheck "Accept cookies from sites"
2. Click Exceptions, add one or more sites to list.  Confirm/Close all open dialogs.
3. Tools -> Clear Recent History -> Everything -> Clear Now
4. Observe as the Exceptions list just created is clear.
Actual Results:  
Removed my exceptions.

Expected Results:  
Keep exceptions, but delete the cookies.
