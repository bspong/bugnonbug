I'm an experimenting web developer, so this might be hard to explain, but I'll try.  

I used Apache webserver's .htaccess file to set its DirectoryIndex (usually set to a list like: index.html index.htm) to a reverse-order of a number sequence, wanting it to serve up the most recent version of a directory's HTML page which I was starting to name with just single characters, e.g.: F E D C B A 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 index.html index.htm .  

I recall finding the expected behavior, but I did not do a thorough test.  

Later I noticed (probably) an Apache bug when I requested http://evolvethis.com/N888/ by typing in the Firefox address bar, the .htaccess technique caused Apache to serve-up /N888/A/75/ instead of /N888/index.html as "A" was the first entry in the DirectoryIndex list that matched a result from the requested directory (I say bug because A rather than /A/ was in the list), but then Apache must have launched it's directory display routine over again to display the /N888/A/ directory and similarly found /N888/A/75/ before /N888/A/index.html (I was using 272 levels, FF->00->0).  The Firefox address bar changed to show: http://evolvethis.com/N888/A/75/ and I received the highest number-named page in the /N888/A/75/ directory.  

OK, so what does this have to do with Firefox?  

I removed EVERYTHING from the virtual-hosted webserver, .htaccess file included.   
I changed the DNS name servers back to the Registrar.  Then when I was checking to see if the change had propagated to my local DNS server yet, I observed that 1)it had not, and 2) when I typed http://evolvethis.com/N888/ into Firefox's address bar, it redirected/changed to http://evolvethis.com/N888/A/75/ !!

I tried Internet Explorer, which I had not yet used since the .htaccess file experiment, and received only the empty Apache server directory listing of http://evolvethis.com/ as expected.  Next I went back to Firefox and used the "clear private data" tool, feeling that it must have retained some cache information or something to cause this behavior.  I think I tried "reload" but it had no effect.  Anyway, right after I used the "clear private data" tool, the address bar behaved correctly.  

Perhaps this is related to the auto-complete functionality of the Firefox address bar?  Does it remember if a requested URL results in another and attempt to ask for it directly?  

For me it is critical because I need solid address bar functionality, no matter how crazy an experimental webserver.  

Ntriple8, NOT JUST FROM THE STREET, FROM THE INTER-STATE /N888/A/96/
