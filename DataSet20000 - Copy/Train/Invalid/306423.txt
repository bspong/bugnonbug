Reloads last visited pages when launched

Whenever I start Firefox on my machine it reloads the last visited websites I
had been too.  I believe this had something to do with some registry settings
since the symptoms don't exist on the admionistrator account.  Furthermore,
uninstalling  Firefox doesn't remove everything (if it removes anything at all)
it writes on the Windows Registry, making this problem carried on on upgrades. I
uninstalled my prev version (1.04) before installing 1.06.  Infact I still have
my bookmarks.  I used to try manually deleting every Firefox related key on the
registry before reinstalling.  I believe I missed one.  Maybe a "clean"
uninstall or an option to delete settings created by the user could  solve this.

Thank You,
even with this bug, iexplore still sucks :)
