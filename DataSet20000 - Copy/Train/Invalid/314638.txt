I am registered at an IT online shop. I can login normaly using IE but I can not login using Firefox. All I get using Firefox is a message, that I have logged in but after I get kicked back to the site, I am back in the login page and not logged. With IE I get back and I am logged.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the site
2. Register a user
3. Try to login to the online shop

Actual Results:  
Login impossible

Expected Results:  
I should be logged in

I would welcome any assistance if there is a way to solve it
