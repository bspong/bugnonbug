%s doesnt consider the site's search format spaces

the %s variable is very useful, however if you use it to replace a multiple word variable it will replace spaces with %20. usually this is fine, but some sites do not recognize %20 as a space

example of a compatible site:

(in bookmarks)
location: http://www.google.com/search?&q=%s
keyword: google

(into address bar)
search: google 123 456
result: http://www.google.com/search?&q=123%20456


example of an uncompatible site:
(in bookmarks)
location: http://search.ebay.com/%s
keyword: ebay

(into address bar)
search: ebay 123 456
actual result: http://search.ebay.com/123%20456
expected result: http://search.ebay.com/123-456


i hope this illustrates the issue, i think a very simple solution would be to allow the user to define how spaces are handled. ie, instead of only having %s for the variable, the user could use (%s-) where whatever comes after the %s inside of the parentheses is used to separate words. 

for example, if a site separated words with an underscore or a period, the user could type in:
location: sitename.com/search=(%s_)
keyword: sitename

search: sitename 123 456
result: sitename.com/search=123_456
----------
location: sitename.com/search=(%s.)
keyword: sitename

search: sitename 123 456
result: sitename.com/search=123.456

and of course you could keep the default %s to equal %20 since that seems to work for most sites i go to

thank you for your time
