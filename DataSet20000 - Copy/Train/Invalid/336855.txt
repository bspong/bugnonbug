Linux GTK File Save As dialog needs to be expanded to show file system every time

The default behaviour of the file save as dialog on Linux is to open fully collapsed. Whereas it should be opening in the default location but with the file chooser widget open ready for the user to navigate.

Only people that dump everything in the default location would find this useful behaviour

This may be a bug with the GTKFileChooser but I think at least in Firefox there should be an option to allow the File Save As dialog to launch with the "Browse for other folders" fully expanded.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Click File ==> "Save Page As..."



Expected Results:  
File Save As dialog opens with the "Browse for other folders" twisty expanded and showing subfolders.

Some gentoo users have a work-around but this requires a source code hack and a recompile - http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-362497-highlight-.html
