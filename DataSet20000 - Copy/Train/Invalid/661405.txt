javascript error if reloading while timer is active

I reported it first at jQuery, but they believe it is rather a Firefox problem. 

If I reload a page while it's doing an animation, I get a javascript error right after the reload: "attempt to run compile-and-go script on a cleared scope". This could be because the javascript timers are not all aborted in time. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to my jsFiddle at http://jsfiddle.net/7nPTw/4/ (and have an error catcher open; I use Firebug). 
2. Click the red square. Then click the button. 
3. Marvel at the error report (even though you're looking at a brand new page)

Actual Results:  
The page was refreshed, all new and fresh, but we get a javascript error due to the 'previous' page. 

Expected Results:  
The previous page and its javascript should in no way influence the errors in the reloaded page.
