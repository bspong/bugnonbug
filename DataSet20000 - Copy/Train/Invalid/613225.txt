I'm developing a java application on Eclipse, deploying locally and testing it with Firefox. I've built a form and when uploading some files, the tomcat server returns a HTTP 400 Bad Request error. I've messed around with the server for plenty of time, then tried uploading with Chromium and magically, it works.

I'll attach a copy of the source code for the form, a copy of the request and response from Firebug (the http 400 response) and the file I've tried uploading.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to localhost:8080/mywebsite
2. Fill in the form, and supply the "buggy" file.
3. Profit!
Actual Results:  
HTTP 400 Bad Request error.

Expected Results:  
The website, beautiful and colorful.
