I need JRE1.5 for Business Objects XI (BOXI) V2. Firefox 3.6 has JRE1.5 listed in its plugins, but says plugin unavailable when loading BOXI reports and begins to download latest JRE runtime environment which is incompatible with this BOXI version.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start BOXI
2. Open BOXI report
3. Plugin unavailable! even though JRE1.5 listed in Plugins.
