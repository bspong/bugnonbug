Casalemedia ads that are pop-ups are not getting blocked by firefox. All the
pop-up windows doesn't open as I want to except for Casalemedia ads. It is the
same thing in Firefox 1.1 and 1.2, I'm not sure Firefox 1.0 I forgot. As also of
the images that are from Casalmedia, I tried to block them but not all do get
blocked and they keep repearing on the next times.
