Need command line argument for launching firefox with last set of tabs

New feature needed to allow launching firefox with all windows and tabs loaded.

On launch, firefox prompts with a dialog whether to load new, or with the previous windows and tabs.

I'd like to launch firefox in ~/.xprofile to bring it up automatically with all the windows and tabs pre-loaded. Currently it requires hitting one of the buttons on the dialog. I'd like command line option to specify which of the two options to select.
