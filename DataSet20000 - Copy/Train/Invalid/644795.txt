Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Make a web page that opens a second page and writes static html to it
2.The code that writes to this second page must contain a javascript that gets executed when the user presses the button.
3.The button must perform the window.print().(not necesary but shows how bad this makes everything)
Actual Results:  
The browser displays the buttons as its still downloading. It doesnt stop until I press the stop button. 

*Up next shows that this states of "loading" does more than iritate.
This causes that the print action to fail. (when the user presses the button described before)


Expected Results:  
Should open the new page and load the page, and display as finished and loaded page. Thus making the javascript in this page work.

This process works on chrome, opera and ie....
