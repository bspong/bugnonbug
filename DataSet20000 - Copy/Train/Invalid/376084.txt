Now and again, FF goes into one of these spasms whereby entering a url into the address bar and pressing enter doesn't do anything. The same applies when i click the 'go' button.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enter URL
2.Press Enter or click 'go' button.
Actual Results:  
No response whatsoever. Its as if i haven't pressed enter or clicked the go button.

Expected Results:  
Loaded the URL.
