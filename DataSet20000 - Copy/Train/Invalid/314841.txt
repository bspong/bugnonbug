There are a few things that stop me from switching from Safari to Firefox and I thought that I should enumerate them as it seems that I am not the only one with these feelings from feedback so I'll go ahead and list them out for you:

A) Native spell checking like unto Safari's, not the way extensions are currently doing it.  It must be like Safari and tap into the User's customized dictionary.
B) Image drag and drop needs to be such that it drags like Safari's, not an outline of a box, there is something that makes this detract very much from Firefox.
C) widgets and buttons should use Mac OS X native widgets to carry over the feel and experience.
D) All cocoa keybindings should be functional, ie ctr-a-> beginning of line, ctr-e-> end of line, etc.
E) Details should be fixed, such as the lower right corner the widget for resizing the window has a white border around it, it should not be when other themes such as Iridium are applied.  It appears that the UI is simply not sized properly there.  I see issues like this in other parts of the UI as well.
F) Use information from Address Book such as the user's email address, physical address, phone, name, etc. to fill in fields.
G) Build in a function to save browsing sessions upon crashes or closes without an extension.
H) A controversial function, but other developers are looking at doing this with gecko and webkit so you could be one up on it if you would implement it; that is to integrate a webkit rendering of pages as well right into Firefox such that a user can right click on a page and select to render as KHTML or WebKit.  This would be handy for developers especially and would not be overly difficult to implement.
