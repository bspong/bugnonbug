my friend was cursing when his page didn't look right in Mozilla/FireFox
he was claiming that his "top style" program verified his site, and that it
sucked that this worked in IE but didn't work in Mozilla...

I don't really know what it means to have an indented hyperlink...
perhaps "A" elements should inherit most of their stuff from <DIV> or <P> elements?

So, here is a code snippet of all relative parts...
.navlink{
	color: White;
	font-size: x-small;
	font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
	text-decoration: none;
	font-weight: bold;
	text-indent: 6px;
}

<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" >
<tr>
	<td><a class="navlink" href="Whitepapers.php">White Papers</a></td>
</tr>
</table>


Reproducible: Always
