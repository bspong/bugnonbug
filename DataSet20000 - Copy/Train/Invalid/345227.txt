javascript which works in html4 doesn't work in xhtml
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20060718 Minefield/3.0a1

i converted some website from valid html4 to valid xhtml1. later i recognized that a javascript which was in the document didn't worked anymore. as soon as i changed the doctype back to html4 it worked again.
the javascript uses an onclick event to implement some sort of "tab"-feature.
both versions (html and xhtml) work correctly in opera 9 and ie 6 but not in firefox 1.5 to minefield (earlier versions were not tested)
