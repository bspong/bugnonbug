My Mozilla Firefox will only work on safe mode. When I open it not in safe mode,
I can't click anything except the minimize, maximize, and close buttons, right
clicking the work area, and the update button. I can't click the menu or any of
the navigation buttons. When I try to update it encounters a problem and the
detail is "Show Image". Most probably that would be the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open browser and problem is encountered right there and then.
Actual Results:  
The problem is encountered. I can't click on anything except for the
afformentioned buttons.

Expected Results:  
I can click on anywhere on the browser.
