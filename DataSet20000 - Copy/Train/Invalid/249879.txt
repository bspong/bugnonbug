Build Identifier: 

My website, www.somethingfunny.ws, uses a stylesheet with a .php extension. Firefox apparently does 
not think .php files can be stylesheets. My site loads without the styles.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a page with a non-.css stylesheet extension, such as www.somethingfunny.ws
2. Notice how the stylesheet does not load at all
3. Email me at Jake@SomethingFunny.ws
Actual Results:  
1. I visited www.somethingfunny.ws
2. I noticed how the stylesheet does not load, at all
3. I got an email from myself

Expected Results:  
Firefox should recognize stylesheets that do not end in .css.
