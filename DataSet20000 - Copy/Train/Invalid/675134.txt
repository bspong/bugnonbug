A Long Term Support Version

Actual results:

Mozilla is going to release a new version every 6 weeks. Firefox 4 is being EOL'ed.


Expected results:

Could firefox build a long term support (LTS) version?

I have an idea of mirroring the Ubuntu LTS strategy for Firefox. That is, maybe every 4th (or 6th, or whatever) Firefox release could get the Long Term Support stamp, which would mean that it would receive security updates until the next Firefox LTS release happens.
