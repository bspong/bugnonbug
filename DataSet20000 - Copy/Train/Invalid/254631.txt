Customer ratings for amazon.com items don't render properly in Firefox, and
never have. The star ratings appear dimmed or partially opaque, along with
horizontal lines running through the ratings. It is very difficult to determine
what the customer rating is for many items, especially those with half-stars in
any part of their rating. Compare this rendering to that of Safari and it's
obvious there's a problem.
