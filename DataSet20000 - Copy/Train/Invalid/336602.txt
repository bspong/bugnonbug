Since Firefox upgraded itself to 1.5.0.3, uploading a file to a PHP-powered website often triggers the "unresponsive script" message box, even when there's absolutely no JavaScript on the page that appears.

The file is uploaded correctly. The animated rotating icon in the tab works normally up to the point where the file has completed uploading. It then freezes for a few seconds. Then the error message appears.

Clicking "Stop script" makes the response page appear normally. Clicking "continue" only leads to the same message box another few seconds later.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
"Unresponsive script" message box appears inappropriate. There is no script on the page.

Expected Results:  
Response page should appear as usual.
