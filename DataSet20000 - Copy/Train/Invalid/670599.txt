[Hang] in xul!DEBUG_CheckWrapperThreadSafety with FF 8.0a1
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:8.0a1) Gecko/20110710 Firefox/8.0a1
Build ID: 20110710030756

Steps to reproduce:

When using FF 8.0a1 (Nightly) I get a hang.

I believe it is in xul!DEBUG_CheckWrapperThreadSafety .


FF will rarely give up a fraction of a second (after a minute or two of freezing) with which I am able to shutdown properly.


Enclosing a WinDbg Log which (hopefully) shows where it was stuck and an annotated  Screenshot of "Windows Task Manager" showing the pinning of ONE Core of a two Core Processor.




Expected results:

Share timeslices without hogging.
