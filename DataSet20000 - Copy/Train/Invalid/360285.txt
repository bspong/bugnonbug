Regular Expression incorrectly fails identical test the second time.

I can't figure out how this could get past the testing but when load the following page, I get alerted true then false, the correct should be true, true.

			var reIsId =/^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9:,_-]*$/g;
			alert(reIsId.test('fdate')) // true
			alert(reIsId.test('fdate')) // false!!!!
		</script>
	</body>
</html>

There is no way that identical tests should return different values. I've used combinations of multiple objects with the same expression and the behaviour is very strange. I have no idea why this is behaving the way that it does. 

In my use its in the if statement of a function using only the bare regular expression (ie /^.*$/g.test("...")) and the problem still occurs where alerting in this fashion does not. I suspect that is becuase the function creates only one instance of the regular expression and reuses it. 

I've tested this problem against FF2 on my mac AND on a PC with the same results
