Large number of days for the history to be remembered causes history to be cleared [1.5.0.x branch]
Having your history set to be remembered for 136678387 days or higher causes the browser to clear the history. Having it set to 136678386 days or lower does not cause this issue.

Every time you restart the browser the history will be cleared, history is only held onto durring the session.

Tested with the 1.5.0.1 en-US release, reproduciable everytime.
