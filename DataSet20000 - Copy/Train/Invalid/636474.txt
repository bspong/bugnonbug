Does each addon have a repository? I wish I could modify the code of an addon and have the addon author decide if my code will be used. Do you think we're going to exchange codes by e-mail? Say the author is the lead developer. Make it optional with default out. Beta test it, see the feedback and change it. Plase, make it!
