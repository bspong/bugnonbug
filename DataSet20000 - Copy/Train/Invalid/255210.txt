Vertical scrollbar not displayed even though not all content visible
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3

My site includes footnote information in a pop-up window (no chrome, but
resizeable and scrollbar enabled). If the content exceeds the default size of
the window, one would expect a vertical scrollbar to appear. Such is the case
with IE6 and the latest Mozilla on WinXP. In Firefox, however, the vertical
scrollbar only appears if the content in the window doesn't fit both vertically
and horizontally.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a page called test.htm and add the following javascript:

<script type="text/javascript">
function firefoxGoneBad() {
   window.open('test2.htm', 'ftnote', 'width=500,height=100%,scrollbars,resizable');
}
</script>

2. Add a link

<a href="javascript: void 0" onclick="firefoxGoneBad()">Dude, where's my
scrollbar?</a>

3. Create a another page called test2.htm like so:
<html>
<head>
<title></title>
</head>
<body>
<p>If you resize vertically nothing happens...</p>
<p>But resize horizontally and the scrollbars appear...</p>
</body>
</html>


4. Enjoy! Repeat as necessary.

Actual Results:  
If I resize the window vertically, no scrollbar appears. The scrollbar only
appears once the window is smaller horizontally than the content.

Expected Results:  
Display scrollbars whenever content is not visible.

Nothing special about the set-up. The bug was reported by a co-worker, so I ran
a default install and the problem was immediately visible.
