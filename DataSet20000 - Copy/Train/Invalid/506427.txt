Checking "Automatically start in a private browsing session" should disable also the cookie section
When you enable "Automatically start in a private browsing session" in preferences, all controls should be disabled, including those related to cookies.

Now, if you check that option, all controls are disabled except for "Accept cookies from sites" and "Accept third-party cookies", which are enabled and also checked (and this is wrong, as for bug 495579 the browser switch immediately to private mode).
