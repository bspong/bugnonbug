Firefox restart consumes 100% of CPU  for an hour or more.

I restarted Firefox today, and it reloaded the 67+ windows with 400+ tabs.  Under normal conditions I expect the restart to take 15+ minutes (because lord knows, the developers don't care about efficiency -- or the concept that the pages might be prioritized based on the one which is the forefront window on your desktop).  Firefox has now consumed 1 hour and 11 minutes of CPU time.  And it may finally be starting to behave normally.  So it may "get er done".  But its not anything I'd write home about being a positive experience.

The most interesting question is whether the startup process was delayed by an hour or more due to interactions with NoScript and vendors attempting to shove music down ones throat?  I will be attaching the transcript from the console to this and I would like people who understand this to explain what is going on.  But I would also like to comment that given the typical windows user (or even Linux user) who may not have access to the console logs -- are clueless about what Firefox may or may not be doing on their machine. 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Restart a complex firefox session, measure the real time and CPU time it takes.

Actual Results:  
It can take an hour or more and various shuffling of windows to get a functional Firefox.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should come up immediately.  Any new firefox window should have top priority.  It should not take an hour or more to produce a "functional" Firefox.  The reason I'm filing this bug report using Epiphany is because I do not know whether Firefox is usable or trustable.
