In FF3.x, cookie acceptance dialog appears for each cookie from a site, even when box is checked to repeat action for all cookies from the site.  This occurs for "ask me" option per cookie.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.select accept cookies options, "ask me every time"
2.browse to site with multiple cookies not already stored or rejected
3.check dialog box to repeat choice for multiple cookies from the site
Actual Results:  
"ask me" dialog appears for every cookie from a base site, i.e. "site.com", "sub.site.com", "other.site.com", etc.


When selectively accepting or denying cookies from a site, dozens of dialogs may appear, despite the choice to reject all cookies.
