The "Get Add-ons" "Learn More" link should at least cause the new Tab created by clicking "Learn More" to be "on top" (if not focus to it) so give feedback that clicking "Learn More" actually worked and to present you with the info that it provides.

It is unlikely that the user would click "Learn More" if the did not wish to do so thus there is little purpose keeping the newly created Tab 'not on top' (end of the list if using Tab Mix Plus) were it is 'hidden' from the user. Surely after having clicked on "Learn More" the next thing you would want to do is goto the Tab.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Menu: [Tools][Add-ons] on "Add-ons Pane" [Get Add-ons], and search for anything.
2. Click on one of the 'Search Results' to expand it and click "Learn More".
3. Did the click work ?, click again, hmmm. 

Now if you manually focus to the new Tab (I have TMP installed with "multi-line-Tabs" enabled) you would have two Tabs opened.

If clicking "Learn More" causes the Tab to be "on top" (yet under the "Add-ons Pane") you could at least see part of the information that was not obscured by the "Add-ons Pane" (thus clicking from one result to the next, and each "Learn More" to each "Learn More" for 'quick details') _WITHOUT_ actually focusing the Tab, yet having it "on Top", (yet under the "Add-ons Pane" is likely the most desirable mode of operation.

Alternately, put the newly created Tab fully "on top" (above everything, even the "Add-ons Pane") and let the user chase back to the "Add-ons Pane" if they are fickle about their quest for knowledge. I feel this is a lesser desirable mode of operation yet might be "the more expected" mode of operation (more conformist to "standard HMI", yet less helpful in this circumstance).


Actual Results:  

After clicking "Learn More" it is not obvious that your click was accepted nor is the effort of clicking rewarded in any visible manner. With Tab Mix Plus multi-row-Tabs you need to scroll down to the end of your 'tab list' to get to the newly created Tab.


Expected Results:

This is for "the exit" as opposed to bug 580537 which is for "the entrance".
