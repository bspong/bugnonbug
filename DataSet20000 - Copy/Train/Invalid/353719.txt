When assigning a mailto: URL to location.href, FireFox 1.5 doesn't resolve numeric character references if - and only if - that assignment is performed within a function which itself is being called by the <body> onload event handler.

This is a bug which is quite hard to track...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
<html>
 <script><!--
  function setURL()
  {
   location.href="mailto:a&#x62;c@example.com";
  }
 --></script>
 <body onload="setURL();">
 </body>
</html>
Actual Results:  
mailto:a

Expected Results:  
mailto:abc@example.com
