First tab hidden
Created attachment 547064
Screenshot. First window (left) is normal. Second window (right) first tab is missing.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:7.0a2) Gecko/20110718 Firefox/7.0a2
Build ID: 20110718182054

Steps to reproduce:

I had two browser windows open.

Installed an add-on and restarted Firefox as requested.




Actual results:

In the second window the first tab is missing even though the page loads. You can only access it via ALT+1 or the "List all tabs" drop down.

The new tab button is on the far left, not the far right.


Expected results:

Tabs should display, new tab button should be on far right.
