After installing the latest Vista Updates, my firefox was yellow colored. It look like, that everthing of firefox is overlayed with a yellow filter, so that all look, uhm, yellow. The adressbar, the search bar, even the website view. this is really annoying.

I don't know if it is an Windows or Firefox problem so i'm submitting the issue here.
