Extreme memory clogging for very simple HTML

See STR.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Apache webserver with the following PHP script:

    echo '<table><tr>';
    while (true) {
        echo '<td></td>';
        flush();
    }

2. Open that page in Firefox.
3. Open Task Manager and see the memory usage run into the gigabytes in no time.
Actual Results:  
Firefox becomes unresponsive and unusable. Excessive memory allocation means the rest of the operating system becomes similarly unresponsive. It becomes impossible to stop Firefox from allocating more and more except by killing it.

Expected Results:  
Firefox must not ever become this unresponsive for small HTML input. This is the 21st century; a few megabytes of '<td></td>' count as a small document.
