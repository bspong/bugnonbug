Since downloading & installing upgrade 1.0.6, cannot open any web pages.  Error message "cannot find . . ."
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)
Build Identifier: 

My home page will not open; none of my bookmarked pages open; cannot open a 
link from an e-mail.  NO web pages will open, e.g. "www.nytimes.com could not 
be found.  Please check the name and try again".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Sign on with ISP
2. Click on Firefox icon
3.

Actual Results:  
Home page did not open.  Instead got message "www.nytimes.com could not be 
found.  Please check the name and try again."  No matter which page I try to 
open, I get the same response.

Expected Results:  
Opened the desired web page.

Shutting down and restarting has no effect.  Re-running Firefox Setup 1.0.6 has 
no effect.  I also did a virus check on Firefox; no problem.
