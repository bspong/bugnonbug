My 3rd party password manager (Verisoft Access Manager) always registers one website (my gmail login) as the currently open page eg it will detect a username password field the currently open tab but always fills in my gmail login details instead. This problem did not occur in any version of Firefox 2

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any URL in firefox 3.0 with a username password field on a computer running Verisoft Access Manager
Actual Results:  
On my gmail account the correct details are inserted. On any other page the gmail logon details are also inserted

Expected Results:  
If logon details for the website are stored they should be inserted into the relevant fields

This may affect other 3rd party password managers
