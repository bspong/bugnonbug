Customize Google has usually worked well for me. But since I upgraded to Windows XP professional, it doesn't work like it should. If I enter any words in the Google search box, none of the usual multiple choices appear.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Type letters into search box
3.Get frustrated because no choices appear
Actual Results:  
No multiple choices

Expected Results:  
Multiple choices should have appeared

I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling Customize Google, but same result.
