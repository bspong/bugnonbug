firefox appears in processes but will not open a browser
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

I try to open Firefox and my system seems to work but doesn't open a browser window.  In task manager > processes firefox.exe is listed and using around 17000k, but cannot find any way to use the brower.  Tried reinstalling, did nothing.  Just installed an old version I had on my computer, Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4, and it seems to be working fine.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on icon or link to open firefox
2.Wait
3.It never opens, but appears open in processes

Actual Results:  
Can't do it right now, as I have the old version running, but tried multiple times with the same result.  

Expected Results:  
A brower opens and works as it had before

I ran a complete virus scan with AVG, full system scan with Ad-aware, and a system check with norton,restarted and reinstalled multiple times. Everything seemed to come out okay and it didn't work, so I tried installing the old version.  I had the dictionary extension and the tabbed browsing options extension installed recently, but it worked fine after doing that.  I said critical, because it just won't work
