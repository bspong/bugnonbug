I have installed New version of firefox 4.0 and find that under main menu, view submenu - Reload option is missing. However, function F5 - reloads the page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install V4.0 of Firefox
2.load any webpage - use Function key F5 - Can see the page been re-drawn or presented with new information.  
3.Navigate to View with alt+v - don't find reload or refresh with F5.
i'm not sure is this intended behaviour


Expected Results:  
On view panel expect to see Refresh F5 option
