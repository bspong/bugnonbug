Tab bar left scroller arrow shows when only two pages exists, having enough space for both.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Make sure you have "Always show tab bar" disabled (default).

1. Open a new tab.
Actual Results:  
The left arrow scroller shows up (disabled).

Expected Results:  
No scroller to see; since there is (almost always) space. Obviously, this would change in certain occasions (when there is no space).
