CSS not generating
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/418 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/417.9.2
Build Identifier: 1.5.0.2

Auto update to version 1.5.0.2, indications showed that first attempt failed.  It downloaded the update, installed and requested to be restarted.  Restarted but failed and reverted back to previous version.  Restarted Firefox and it auto updated again.  This time it updated ok.

However, CSS is not generating when viewing website.  Do have screen dump to demonstrate from a duel monitor of firefox on the left not generating CSS, to IE on the right generating ok (don't hate me for using IE pls).

Have uninstalled Firefox, cleared everything possible from the operating system in relation to FIrefox.  Installed version 1.5.0.2 from website, but issue continues.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Auto update or installation performed
2. Re/started Firefox
3. CSS not generating

Actual Results:  
Websites with CSS not generating correctly.

Expected Results:  
CSS to generate and display website as per norm.

Can send screen dump for visual description, otherwise, please request any files required for me to send so this matter can be troubleshooted.
