For instance, in the above URL, Beneath the "Here’s my shiny engine" bit there should be some images, which are referenced from Photobucket, such as: http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y39/kiwidubstar/shinyengine.jpg

The same page appears fine in IE7.

I've only encountered the problem since the last FireFox update. I'm yet to do a rollback to test an earlier version.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit URL as described
2.View message from DUBSTAR which begins with "Here's my shiny new engine"
3.
