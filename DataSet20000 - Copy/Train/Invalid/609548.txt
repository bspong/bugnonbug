multiple tabs detected while it is multiple windows

I have two ff windows opened with one tab each. When I close one, the popup "Do you want Firefox to save your tabs and windows for the next time it starts?" appears, if I click "save and quit" only the window I wanted to close is save and close (as expected). 

The problem is that the popup should not appear and the window should be closed.

I don't know if it is because now tabs are like new windows but regroup in one and in my case having 2 windows opened is detected as having two tabs...
