maps broken on whereis.com (Firefox disallows external src attribute for form input element?)
If you try to get a street map of a location on Whereis.com, the resulting map
is not shown.  All that you can see if the text "Click to centre screen" on a
white background where the GIF image should appear.

I made a small test case at <http://endbracket.net/michael/whereis>.  It seems
that the image is displayed if the image src attribute begins with
http://endbracket.net/michael, but not if it begins with
http://pn4.whereis.com.au.  In this case, the alt text is shown if it exists. 
If no alt text exists either, a broken image icon is shown.

I presume the image in the test case is a temporary image that will be removed
soon.  To reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.whereis.com
2. Enter values for the mandatory fields
  (example: Suburb=Melbourne, State=VIC)
3. Click search
