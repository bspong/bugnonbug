As originally reported on GNOME's Bugzilla
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=512300):

> in the attached testcase*, when the page is loaded, we get the 
> first google link, then red, then green followed by blue, and 
> lastly by the bottom google link. (note that none of the radio
> btns are selected).
>
> when we select one, then tabbing around, we can not focus on the
> other two alternatives. i.e. google link, (selected colour), 
> second google link.
> 
> Expected results:
> user should be able to tab across to alternatives.
> 
> Does this happen every time?
> yes
