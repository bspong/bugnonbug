Locationbar text is unselectable if you use a theme other than the default.

I am using the nightlies update channel and this bug appeared somewhere after the update from build 2006090903 to 2006091104 still occurs in 2006091203.

If you select a theme other than the default (was using the Office Silver v2.0 which is compatible with fx 2.0b2 without issues till the update) once you restart to activate the new theme, you cannot select the text in the location bar. Instead, the cursor is placed in the start of it just before and over the icon of the URL. So, when you start typing you type over the old text and pressing enter or the go button has no result.

Opening a new tab and trying still has the same effect. Things go back to normal once you switch to default theme and restart.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install a 2.0b2 nightly newer than build 2006090903
2. Choose a theme other than default (install one if you have none first).
3. Restart fx to activate theme.
4. Try typing in the location bar and pressing enter or clicking the go button.
5. (Optional) opening a new tab and try again
6. Disable theme by choosing to use the default.
7. Restart to activate default theme.
8. Try to type in the location bar. Everything should be back to normal.

Actual Results:  
I explain this in the steps above, but here it is again....

When you try to type on the location bar, instead of the existing text to be selected and typed over, the cursor is placed over and before the URL icon and text is typed overlaying the old one (not replacing it). Pressing the go button or the enter key on the keyboard has no effect.

Expected Results:  
Existing text (url) should be selected and typed over as normal. When enter is pressed or the go button. The browser should take you to the web page as usual.
