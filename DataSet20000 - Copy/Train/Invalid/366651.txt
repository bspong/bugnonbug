redirections: meta refresh does not work any more

Since I installed the current version of Firefox, code like this

<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; URL=error.php">

is ignored.

The problem is reproducable - but only on Mac (using OS X 10.4.8). 
When I try the same URLs with Firefox or IE6/7 on Win32 or even with IE 5.x on Mac anything works fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try the given URL. That's all.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
No results. Nothing happens. Browser works fine afterwards.

Expected Results:  
Should be redirected to given URL

By viewing the page information dialog, I can see the correct refresh tag in the "meta" section.
