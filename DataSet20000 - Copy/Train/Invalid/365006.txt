Cannot Shut Down Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: Firefox 2.0

When I finish browsing and shut down Firefox, by clicking on the "X" in the top right corner of the screen, the Firefox browser screen closes normally.  However, if I examine the Windows Task Manager, I notice that the Firefox.exe process is still running in the background.  If I click "End Process," nothing happens; Firefox.exe continues to run in the background.  How can I get Firefox.exe to shut down whenever I close the browser screen?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
