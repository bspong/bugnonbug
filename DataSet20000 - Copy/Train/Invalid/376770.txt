CSS property "background-position" displays background image incorrectly using y percentage value.

Firefox incorrectly displays the y position of a background image in the CSS property "background-position: __% __%", at the very least, when used in the "body" html tag.

Example at the W3schools website shows:

<style type="text/css">
body
{ 
background-image: url('smiley.gif');
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-position: 30% 20%; 
}
</style>

The smiley image correctly displays 30% from the left side of the test page window, but is cut off the top of the page with any positive y position value.  Strangely, making the value negative (-20%) makes the image move downward from the top of the page.  A value of 0% aligns it with the top.  This also displays the same way as a stand alone page (open the frame in its own window to see).

Also, adding some text or other stuff into the body of the page causes the image to align to the top.

IE (6 even) correctly displays the image 20% of the page height from the top of the page.  The CSS is correct... the site is run by the W3C.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the W3 test page at http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_background-position_percent

2. Look at it in IE or other browser.
3. Mess with html code in the text box and click the button to see the y% is always incorrect.
Actual Results:  
Image position from the top of the page is incorrect.

Expected Results:  
Image position to be whatever percent from the top of the page you enter in the CSS code.

Using default theme and no special add ons... plain old Firefox 2.0.0.3 (Latest).  Works correctly in Internet Explorer 6 SP2.
