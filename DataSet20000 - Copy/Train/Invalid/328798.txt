Firefox Crashes when loading gmail after logging in.

After logging in to gmail with one of my accounts, it said "Loading..." as it always does, then after a pause, Firefox crashed and produced "Firefox needs to close" or something similar like that with the options "Send error report" and "Don't send error report.d" This has been happening repeatedly and is a very large annoyance. I believe it has something to do with the extensions "Gmail Notifier," although I was not sure so I decided to do this anyway. I have 2 gmail accounts and it happened to both. I tried to disable the extension, but it still happened. Only after uninstalling the extension did it stop, although it is possible it will happen again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load Firefox after crash.
2. Go to gmail
3. Login
4. Crashed
Actual Results:  
After I tried again, the same results happened until I uninstalled the extension "Gmail Notifier"

Expected Results:  
Not crash.
