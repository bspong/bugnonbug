Elements that have some but not all borders with border-style: none and a -moz-border-radius are misrendered.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Style a DIV with "border: thin solid red; border-left: none; -moz-border-radius: 0.5em;"
Actual Results:  
Random portions of the DIV are colored red, depending on size and visibility of the entire DIV.

Expected Results:  
A nicely curved border, except for the bits which aren't there.

This may be a 64-bit only problem.
