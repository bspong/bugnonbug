Since I've installed Firefox3 over Firefox 2.0.0.14 I have severe problems with my USB mouse (Logitech Optical Mouse). The mouse freezes randomly while browsing in firefox. This happens on arbitrary occasions and various websites (moving mouse over content or tabbar), but very reproducable when i visit the Times archive (see url).

In this case the cursor stucks on its location and image representation (pointer, hand open, pointed or closed). No input from the mouse is recognized anymore. The mouse is still powered. However, I am able to use my laptops touchpad without problems. The mouse keeps freezed if i switch to other applications via alt+tab or close all firefox instances. The only way to bring the mouse back ist to unplug and plug it in again. CPU is never over 10% in this situations.

I tried various ways to fix this: I deleted my profile, uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox3, installed latest mouse drivers, disabled flash plug-in, no effect! This happens only in Firefox3, i don't see this behaviour in any other application.

My way to fix it is now back to Firefox 2.0.0.14 where everything is working fine.

I know this is a very specific bug, maybe very hard to track and therefore probably a WONTFIX. Please advise me how to give more information on this issue.
