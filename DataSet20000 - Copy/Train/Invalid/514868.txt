Google Reader is Extremely Slow

About 3 days ago, Google Reader started running ridiculously slow with Firefox. I've tried uninstalling Google Gears and other add-ins, but nothing has sped it back up to normal. When I click on a new blog to read on the left-hand side, it takes 30-60 seconds to load the new blog, and then the titles start to appear one at a time, every 5 seconds or so. The entire page with 40+ titles used to load in about 2 seconds, and now it takes minutes!

I checked the page in IE, and it's running fine there, so it's not a problem with the Google servers, as it is unique to Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Navigate to Google Reader
2.Click on a blog that has at least a few posts to display 
3.Watch how slow it loads (up to 60 seconds)
Actual Results:  
The page responds very slowly.

Expected Results:  
The page should load in 2-3 seconds instead of minutes.
