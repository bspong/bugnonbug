Used private browsing yesterday in 3.5.something - used update feature under help menu and successfully upgraded to 3.6.  Now private browsing is unavailable/greyed out under the Tools menu and the keyboard commands don't work. 

I went to about:config, searched on private and found that this entry:  wser.privatebrowsing.autostart    had been changed to "true".  On a lark, I changed it to 'false' - restarted firefox, and now private browsing is working fine.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Upgrade firefox using menu item under Help
2.  Restart browser
3.  Try private browsing
Actual Results:  
Private browsing was unavailable as described

Expected Results:  
Kept the feature available as it was before the upgrade
