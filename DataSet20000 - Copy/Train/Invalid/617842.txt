faulty display of text which passes W3C validation
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.12) Gecko/20101026 Firefox/3.6.12 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.12) Gecko/20101026 Firefox/3.6.12 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I cut-and-paste the following into a local file on my Desktop:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<meta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text/html;charset=UTF-8">
<TITLE>arf</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<UL>
<LI>8am to 5pm 650-456-7890</LI>
<LI>8am to 5pm 650-456-7890</LI>
</UL>
</BODY>
</HTML>

I then open that file:/// in Firefox 3.6.12 and instead of seeing:
    * 8am to 5pm 650-456-7890
    * 8am to 5pm 650-456-7890
I see:
    * 8am to 5pm
    * 8am to 5pm 650-456-7890

If I display the same page in IE 8.0.6001.18702, I get the correct display.

If I change the two <LI> lines to:

<LI>8am to 5pm 65&#x200B;0-456-789&#x200B;0</LI>
<LI>8am to 5pm 65&#x200B;0-456-789&#x200B;0</LI>

I get the correct display.

I validated using the direct entry through the W3C Markup Validator and it passes. I posted problem to W3C List Manager which suggested I check different browsers and hence was able to isolate Firefox.

I looked in existing bug list searching for "text not display" and didn't spot it in the first hundred of so as the search produced way too many to go through all.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Cut-and-paste example from details into file via vim
2. View in Firefox and display is wrong
3. View in IE8 and display is right
Actual Results:  
    * 8am to 5pm
    * 8am to 5pm 650-456-7890

Expected Results:  
    * 8am to 5pm 650-456-7890
    * 8am to 5pm 650-456-7890

I can't think of anything else, please let me know if there is something I can provide which would help.
