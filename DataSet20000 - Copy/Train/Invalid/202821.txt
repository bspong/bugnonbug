i had been catching up on my userfriendly reading, a few months worth.  after
view about 3 months worth, i had winxp pop up and tell me i had exhausted my
swap file space, and looking at the memory usage, it was up over 500MB. 
eventually, i found that exiting phoenix dropped the memory usage back down to
<150MB.  i then tried the same thing again, and found exactly the same problem,
over 500MB after a couple months worth of viewing.

just in case its important:  from the userfriendly homepage, i would click on
the cartoon image to take me to the slightly larger version, then continually
click on the 'next cartoon' button.
