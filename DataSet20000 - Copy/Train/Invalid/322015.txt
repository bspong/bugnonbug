DownThemAll wont apply link description to file name. when downloading from ffmp3.org theres about 230 mp3's, i tryed to set file description to be added the the file name, but it comes back with errors.

a nice improvment for DownThemAll would be a file number filter ex. if there are files named c2001.mp3 - c2230.mp3 and you only want to download files c2100.mp3 through c2230.mp3, just something easyer than unchecking the 100 files you dont want manualy. maybe a drop down menu with all files on the page that have been filtered, have one dropdown menu for file sequence Start and another for the file number that you want to stop at.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.downthemall/preferences/renaming set this tag for renaming *name*_*text*.*ext* that should add the file description after the file name like this c2001_Genesis 1:1-18.mp3
2.goto ffmp3.org use the drop down menu to get to Chuck Smith\Chuck Smith - Through The Bible mp3 files, select the whole page
3.try to down them all and you will get a error

Actual Results:  
after closing the error it started downloading them with just the original file names

Expected Results:  
the tag for renaming *name*_*text*.*ext* that should add the file description after the file name like this c2001_Genesis 1:1-18.mp3
(c2001.mp3 original file name) (description that shows up in the filter, file select window was "Genesis 1:1-18"
