Selecting a bookmarked page will display the correct page in the current tab, but the url of that page is not shown in the location bar. The behavior is most recognizable when done in a new, empty tab.
After selecting a different tab and then returning to the original tab will display the correct url in the location bar.

2. Select any previous bookmarked page.
3. Look at location bar whether correct url is displayed.
Actual Results:  
The previous url (or nothing, when started with an empty tab) is displayed at the location bar.

Expected Results:  
To see the correct url of the selected page.
