Steps to reproduce:

I tried downloading swf videos from allthingsd.com and could not do it. I went to page info -> media and found swf embed but could not download it


Actual results:

It seems they have one layer additional layer of security, the swf i downloaded was around 500 kbs and video was 1 hour long


Expected results:

I should be able to save the embed video to local drive and save it as I want to view on my local device when I dont have bandwidth
