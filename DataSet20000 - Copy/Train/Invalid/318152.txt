I just installed version 1.5 and the "Open a new window" button on the navigation toolbar does not work. When you click on it nothing happens. The "Open a new tab" button works just fine. This problem was present in the release candidates also.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the Firefox browser
2.Click on the "Open a new window" button in the navigation toolbar
3.Wait...wait...wait....wait...nothing happens

Actual Results:  
There are no results since nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
There should have been a new window oppened up

I am using the default theme and no special set-ups. This function worked fine in version 1.0.7 and previous versions.
