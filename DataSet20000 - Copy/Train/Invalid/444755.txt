MoveTabTo() and selected status of moved tab
Right now addons Tabs Open Relative 0.3.3 https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1956 and ColoUnREaDTabs 2.0.3 https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3645 incompatible, and I have reasons to think that this is tabbrowser bug.

The source of problem is in MoveTabTo function (used by Tabs Open Relative to place a new tab on correct place) that perform undesired SELECT to dragged tab, so EVERY new open tab became selected as by user dragged it byself.

Right now there is NO description of this function, so it simple strange behaviour, why moving of tab should provide selection? 

I see at source following code:

          var i;
          for (i = 0; i < this.mTabContainer.childNodes.length; i++) {
            this.mTabContainer.childNodes[i]._tPos = i;
            this.mTabContainer.childNodes[i]._selected = false;
          }
          this.mCurrentTab._selected = true;

That means, that moving tab would be selected even if it was not previously selected.
