Text fields (URL bar and web search) sometimes stop accepting input

Apologies for the vague "sometimes", but I haven't been able to pinpoint when this happens. Occasionally, one of the text fields in the browser (either the URL bar or web search) will have focus, and I'll be entering text. For no reason that I can tell, they will stop accepting my input.

They'll still appear exactly the same as they did (still have the focus, still selected), but they can't be typed in until I click once in the browser window. They'll still have the focus, but typing works.
