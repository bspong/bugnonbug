Undo Close Tab (and Recently Closed Tabs) doesn't restore form data
Reproducible: Always

Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to a page that has a form on it (such as this one).
2. Enter some data into the form.
3. Close the tab.
4. Undo closing the tab.

Expected Results: When the tab is reopened, the form data is still there.
Actual Results: When the tab is reopened, the form data is gone.

I just hit this with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a3pre) Gecko/20070211 Minefield/3.0a3pre. I suppose I should be lucky that I was able to reopen the tab at all, but I would expect not to lose data on the tab.
