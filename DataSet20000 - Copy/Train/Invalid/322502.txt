will not open files/documents on local (mounted) drives that it would open in prior versions

the link (on a wiki page) points to a file on a mounted drive
when I click the link, get a brief (1 sec) pause, then nothing

other users at work did not have this problem - they were on a prior version (1.0.7 I think)
they upgraded to 1.5 and are now experiencing the same problem


Reproducible: Always
