Hi. I've been using FF for a long time. When I updated my home computer to FF v4, I can open Firefox, but after about 6 seconds it freeze (no matter how many tabs, current page beeing viewed etc). I can scroll the window up and down, but can't flip through the tabs, move the window or close it. When clicking anywhere in the browswer nothing happens and you get a windows sound. Kinda like: ding, ding, ding.. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install v4 from latest v3.6
2. Double click to open browswer from the taskbar
3. Wait 6-7 seconds for it to freeze
Actual Results:  
It freezes

Expected Results:  
Let me browse
