I have two tabs that keep opening when I start my Mozilla Firefox browser, they won't go away.. why?
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1

I have noticed recently that I am having huge issues with Mozilla Firefox. Okay, here's the story. I click the icon to open my browser and two tabs keep showing up one for my homepage Yahoo Canada and the other for Yahoo mail saying invalid password I have entered, I did not set my yahoo mail to open in a tab with my browser! When I go to tools>options>main in Firefox my homepage is set to http://ca.yahoo.com/, exactly as shown, there is nothing separating it or anything to have it opened a second tab. I have cleared cookies, cache, etc, Restarted, Did a virus scan, uninstalled and reinstalled Mozilla Firefox from the original website and still no luck finding the cause, it was fine yesterday and now all messed up and annoying. Please if you can help me, that would be greatly appreciated:) Thank you. I have also tried tools --> Options window under the Main tab, there's a frame labeled as Start up and below it written, 'When Firefox starts' then a field to choose multiple options (drop-down list). From that drop-down list, select 'Show a blank page' and clear the homepage field below that. it didn't help!
