Hello.  I can no longer use Firefox for watching hulu.com videos because it is totally choppy.  Can't be my internet connection because it works fine in Safari.  I have tried clearing my profile, and this helps for a time, but I use Firefox a ton because I am a web developer, and I shouldn't have to clear my profile every week because I want to watch Hulu.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a clogged profile
2. Go to hulu.com
3. go to a video page
Actual Results:  
See choppy/laggy video

Expected Results:  
normal video
