Attached is the test page used. It was extracted from failblog.org and is typical of their page content (with all extraneous stuff removed). Note that the fact that there are two objects on the page seems to be important. Refreshing this page with ctrl-f5 hits the problem every time on my system. With the original failblog.org page it is more variable (probably because the content varies) and also occurs when clicking on refresh tab.

Also attached is configuration information on plugins and extensions.
