Why do tracking sites like "edge.quantserv.com", "pixel.quantserv.com", and "google-analytics" freeze my Firefox?

If I click on a site that uses those "services", I can forget about the page ever loading. If I pop open sysinternals, I can watch the Private Bytes History ratchet upward 1 - 2 Mb per second, yet the page never finishes loading. Eventually, the Private Bytes usage hits a breaking point, usually 350 - 500 Mb, and it drops down to around 200 and holds there. The CPU usage also spikes up to the upper 90's and stays there.

I have started doing IP lookups of those DNS's and blocking them, but that doesn't always work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open website containing "quantserv" or "google-analytics"
2.Wait... wait... wait some more
3.
Actual Results:  
Page never loads entirely, CPU usage stays in the upper 90's

Expected Results:  
Page load.
