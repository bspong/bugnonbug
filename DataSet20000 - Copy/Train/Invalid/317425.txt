I logged into my home page at google.  I have Motley Fool and Slashdot listed with 9 entries for Slashdot and 6 for Motley fool.  When I right click on either the Slashdot or Motley fool title to open the link in a new tab, the link is launched into the current tab.
Also, if I control and click to launch the link in a new tab, it opens in the same tab.  This feature works normally on this page and others, just not the google home page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Sign into your Google Home Page
2. Right Click on Slashdot feed on the 'Slashdot' title
3.

Actual Results:  
Link is opened in the current tab and the right click menu is shown.  Only the right click menu should be shown.

Expected Results:  
Just the right click menu should be shown.

The Control-Right Click on the Slashdot title does not always load the page in a new tab.  Quite often, but not always, it loads it in the current tab.
