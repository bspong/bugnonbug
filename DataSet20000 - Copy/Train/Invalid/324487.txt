firefox cannot connect to https site

I am trying to connect to author information for the Macromolecules journal.  The link (given above) can be found at http://pubs.acs.org/journals/mamobx/index.html, the link titled "info for authors".

When I try to access that link using Firefox 1.5, firefox refuses, saying "Firefox and paragon.acs.org cannot communicate securely because they
have no common encryption algorithms".

I first contact the journal help service. They replied with the inevitable bullshit about "we only support MSIE and Netscape Navigator".  Sure enough, I tried accessing the link from Mozilla Browser (v1.7.12), and it works fine from there.

It's on that basis that I'm submitting this bug against firefox (and not NSS), because if the link works for mozilla 1.7 but not for firefox 1.5, then it feels to me this must be some bug introduced into the new version of firefox.

I'm not certain it's related, but mozilla reports that the site's encryption is low-grade (RC4-40 40 bit). Has something been lost in low-grade encryption support in firefox 1.5?
