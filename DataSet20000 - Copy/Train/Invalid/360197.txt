javascript bookmarks (bookmarklets) seem to run with the security (privilegemanager) context of code on the current page

It seems that bookmarks, which are local, run with the same security context as the currently-loaded page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0. open the error console
1. create a javascript bookmark (bookmarklet) for conkeror: javascript:netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege(%22UniversalFileRead%22); window.openDialog('chrome://conkeror/content/');
2. open a window or tab for google.com
3. select the bookmarklet from step 1
Actual Results:  
on the error console: Error: uncaught exception: A script from "http://www.google.com" was denied UniversalFileRead privileges.

Expected Results:  
since the bookmarklet is on the local filesystem, it should run with some sort of file:// context. This should result in a privilegemanager prompt to grant the requested privilege.

Workaround: open a file:// URL before trying the bookmarklet (it still won't work, but that's another problem - I don't think I've figured out the right priv for openDialog(), if there is one).

I don't think this is an exploitable problem.
