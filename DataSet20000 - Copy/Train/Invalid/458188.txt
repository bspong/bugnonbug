Problem recognizing file types (perhaps in private secure servers)

It is my school's file hosting page. You cannot access, but firefox does not seem to recognize .ppt , .doc or any other file types inside, showing application/unknown, resulting in me having find deep in my PC to open powerpoint, word, etc. I hope this problem can be solved, since it occurs mostly in protected websites. It works in others.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Double click on any file
2. It just prompts you what program to use, for example with .ppt files, which 
   should not happen since it should be recognized already
3. 
Actual Results:  
You are prompted for which application to use.

Expected Results:  
Know which application to use and set it as default.

Sorry this is a school system. It reproduces everytime but I cannot help.
The most I can do is to send screenshots to help.
