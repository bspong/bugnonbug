The pref setting layout.word_select.stop_at_punctuation does not work in the location bar, double-clicking on a piece of text will not select between two punctuation characters but it selects everything in the location bar. However, this works fine in the search bar and everywhere else.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter a URL or just type anything in the location bar that has punctuation characters (dots, commas, dashes, etc).
2. Double-click on text within two bits of punctuation to select.
Actual Results:  
Everything in the location bar is selected

Expected Results:  
Only text that is within punctuation characters should be selected
