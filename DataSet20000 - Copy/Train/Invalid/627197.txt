Search bar made nearly useless by search suggestions when placed in the add-on toolbar
Steps to repro -
 1. Enable add-on bar  (View->Toolbars->Add On Bar->check)
 2. Customize layout so that search bar is in add-on bar at the bottom of the screen
 3. Type something in the search bar that can be autocompleted as you type

Result - Search suggestions pop up, obscuring what you are trying to type

Expected Result - Search suggestions pop up above the search bar, so that you can still see what you're typing

BTW, the Awesome Bar behaves properly at the bottom of the screen. It's just the search bar that's broken.
