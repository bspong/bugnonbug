the address bar auto fill feature will show sensitive information from secure websites such as email subject lines and urls. 

This could compromise CC numbers, confirmation codes, extra marital affairs, etc.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. log into gmail (or any secure website) and open an email message
2. log out and go to another page
3. start typing gmail into the address bar - your email subject lines will be revealed along with the url.
Actual Results:  
sensitive information from secure sites (in this case, email subject lines) is revealed in the address bar drop down list of previously visited websites.

Expected Results:  
secure website addresses should not be shown in this list. especially links from within the sites.

I haven't tried to log into my bank account online yet, but I'm assuming that some information that I wouldn't want others to know might be revealed in that drop down list if I do.
