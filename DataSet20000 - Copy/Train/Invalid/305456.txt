Tools>Options>Tabbed Browsing>Tabbrowser Preferences>Links>Load links in "New
Tab"/Load external links in "New Tab" does not cause a new tab to open when
links are clicked. (Ctrl-click on link does open new tab, as does right-click
open link in new tab.) I was also unable to cause left-click open link in new
tab without Tabbrowser Preferences on some previous builds.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on link
2.Current page changes to new page.
3.

Actual Results:  
No new tab is started.

Expected Results:  
Opened a new tab, and loaded the linked page into that tab. (Preferably in a
background tab.)
