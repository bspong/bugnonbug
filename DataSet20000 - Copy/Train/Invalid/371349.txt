When I try to open media from a link it forces a download instead.

When I try to open a link to a file such as an avi or mp3 (see link and click the "click here" link for the mp3) instead of opening a new tab firefox opens the download file manager.  It still gives me the option of whether to download, DTA, TDTA, or open with program, but FF absolutely will not let me open the file in new tab or window.  I have looked at the file association menu under the tools/options/downloads/manage file types and it has mp3 on there as both an audio file and core media player file but they both say to open with the vlc media plug in.  When I try to remove the core file part it refuses to allow removal.  I only have a few active media changing extensions, are there any that cause this kind of thing?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.click the link to the file
2.or try right clicking and open in new window.
3.or try open in external application (ietab).
4.or try middle clicking.
Actual Results:  
the "what should fire fox do with this file" dialog box opens up.

Expected Results:  
New or blank tab with a media bar and the mp3 starts playing and downloading.
