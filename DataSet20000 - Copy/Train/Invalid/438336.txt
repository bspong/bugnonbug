Flash callback works with some firefoxes, but not all.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9b5) Gecko/2008043010 Fedora/3.0-0.60.beta5.fc9 Firefox/3.0b5

The website linked above displays events that occur in the flash object. Failure is indicated by "No event!" being displayed. Success is any other text. You'll see it change if you interact with the flash application.

It used to work for me with firefox 2. It stopped working after upgrading to firefox 3. I tested another firefox 3 on linux and that doesn't work either. I've had other people test on firefox 2 and it works for most (windows, mac, and linux), but I have one report of it not working on linux.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit url
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Sometimes communication from flash to javascript works and sometimes it does not.

Expected Results:  
Communication should always work which is indicated by text other than "No event!" being displayed.
