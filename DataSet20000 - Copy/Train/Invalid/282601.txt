My Ebay login page won't submit form info; back and forward buttons don't work after that
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041217
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

When I click on My ebay at www.ebay.com (top of the page), it takes me to the
login page properly, but then the browser starts to misbehave. The form won't
submit if you click on 'Sign In Securely'. The Back and Forward buttons stop
working as well, so you have to select a bookmark or click a URL in the page to
leave that page. Also, when you leave that page that way, the Back button won't
take you back to that page, and the History you may have saved in the
Back/Forward buttons (accessible with the downward arrows) doesn't store
properly as well.

This problem occured whether or not I had the Passwords Saved checked or not.

Essentially, I can't use Ebay with Firefox anymore. :( This problem started
recently, so I'm not sure if it's totally browser-related. However, the My Ebay
form works as expected in Mozilla 1.7.5 (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT
5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041217), as well as IE6. I have an alternative
Linux build running Firefox (same 20041107 date on the build) and there are no
problems there.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.ebay.com
2. Click on "My ebay" in the top of the page.
3. Try and log in with any id/password combo. Also try to use the Back button.

Actual Results:  
The form cannot be submitted, and the Back/Forward buttons stop working properly.

Expected Results:  
Normal functionality with the My ebay web site. Specifically, I'd like to be
able to use the log in page for My Ebay.
