suggestion: option to change bookmark (on personal toolbar) button behaviour

I would prefer to have the option to have a bookmarks button on the personal
toolbar to bring up the menu in the way it does with Mozilla, rather than the
IE-a-like default way it's done in Firebird.

The bookmarks menu on the personal toolbar was a major reason why I moved from
IE in the first place :)
