While going through the session store test cases in litmus (test case 4275), it looks like you can restore to the wrong session, to the restored session prior to to starting new session after abnormal exit.

Steps to reproduce:
1. add this to your prefs.js file: user_pref("browser.sessionstore.interval", 1);
2. Start the browser and load the latest headlines in all tabs
3. kill -9 the process corresponding to your Firefox instance
4. Relaunch it. When the dialog to restore session comes up, select Start New Session.
5. kill -9 it too.
6. Relaunch it. When the dialog comes up, choose Restore Session.

Expected: Browser should launch and open the default Start page (assuming this is a clean profile where no home page customizations have been done).

Actual: You rever to the session in step 2, with the latest headlines open in all tabs.

It looks like upon relaunching the browser with a new session in step 4 the sessionstore files are not being deleted.
