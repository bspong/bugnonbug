Mar.31/06 , I  started my pc and opened Firefox. Instead of going to my homepage, it went to firefox. It said I had most up to date and I wont see this again. I closed browser and reopened it, it again went to firefox and not my homepage. I noticed all my favs were missing, I went to the options, I set the homepage as well as a few other options like history and cookies etc. The BUG is , it wont let me click OK to close the options window, therefore it wont accept any of my preferred options as i have to CANCEL to close the window. I uninstalled and deleted all from the registy, reinstalled , same problem. All this trouble after I believe installing that crappy windows defender the day before. I uninstalled windows defender. still it did not fix problem with Firefox.
