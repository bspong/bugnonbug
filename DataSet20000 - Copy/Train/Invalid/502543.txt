I have reinstalled my system fully (a few times in the past day) and still have a problem where Firefox 3.5 will not load YouTube or some of Google's services.

I also have a loading issue with CNN.com (will load a little but then stop loading), Photobucket and DailyMotion.

When downgrading to Firefox 3.0.11, the issues aren't present and all the sites listed above work fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I go to load one of the sites listed above.
Actual Results:  
Sites won't load or they will briefly load and then stop.

Expected Results:  
Sites should load each and every time.

I use the following extensions.

AdBlock Plus 1.0.2
Auto Copy 0.8
DownThemAll! 1.1.4
Facebook Toolbar 1.4
Fox Clocks 2.5.33
IE Tab 1.5.20090525
McAfee SiteAdvisor 2.9
NoScript 1.9.5
Personas For Firefox 1.2.1
Web Search Pro 2.8.2.2

I have also moved Firefox to a new location, disabled the extensions and addons, as well as creating a new profile but the same result comes up.
