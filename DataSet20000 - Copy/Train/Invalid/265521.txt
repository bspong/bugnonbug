Thanks for your reading this minor complaint.

In IE you can resize the favorites sidebar box by 
left clicking on the boundry of the favorites sidebar
with the web page and dragging it to the left.

One thing I noticed in Firefox is that when resizing to
the left ( making it less wide ), it stops abruptly.

My suggestion would be to collapse it all the way over
to the left if desired. Similiar to the Help screen
sidebar, but it stops at 6 characters wide.

IE used to go to 1 character wide if desired. This would
leave more room for the web page to be displayed. 

I beleive the user should be able to go as far as he/she
would want to when making sidebars less wide.

Thanks for reading my suggestion. Im a new user
and really like Firefox.

Thanks for making a alternative to IE.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. click on the bookmarks toolbar icon
2. locate the mouse pointer to the column between
   the main web page and the bookmark sidebar.
3. left click and keep depressed and drag the colum to the
   left as far as it goes.
4. it stops collapsing way to early and wont
    go any more to the left.

Actual Results:  
It stops collapsing the bookmark sidebar
to early.

Expected Results:  
It should go all the way over perhaps
to the folder icon or the plus sign icon 
if the user desires, thus mimimizing the
width of the bookmark sidebar.

Using default theme.
