Unknown problems with "Bookmarks"--and the "Display Page"

Problem 1.  After installing FireFox 2.0.0.7--I imported previous FireFox bookmarks.  However, NOW--"Bookmarks" only work, when clicking on "Organize Bookmarks."  Otherwise, when I click on Bookmarks, the only window that comes up is "Bookmarks...Organize." Clicking on anything else, brings up a list of INACTIVE BOOKMARKS--which when clicked on, do NOT respond.  However, going to "Organize Bookmarks"--brings up a complicated VERY OVERDONE BOX of all kinds of bookmarks--(shades of Microsoft!)  Clicking on THESE ONLY BOOKMARKS, BRINGS UP THE URL ONE NEEDS! VERY ANNOYING AND OVERDONE!

Problem 2:  The HEADER and FOOTER are BOTH EQUAL IN SIZE--AND CREATE AN ANNOYING "LETTERBOX" type SCREEN!  The TOP toolbar has all the usual things that most toolbars have--but the BOTTOM/FOOTER takes up almost the EXACT AMOUNT OF SPACE--AND does nothing but block 1 1/2 inches of viewer space, which shows URL's clicked on BUT the little 'PROGRESSION BARS' STAY ON AT ALL TIMES--AS IN, HOW EVER LONG ONE IS LOGGED ON!  ALL the above also affects my home page--MyWay.com.  

The FireFox problems described are ONLY associated with FireFox--MyWay.com--also mail.com.  When I exit FireFox and MyWay, my display returns to normal--as in the "START"  bar, is the bottom "footer." Suggestions!??!?    

Reproducible: Always

3.
Actual Results:  
See Details above.

Expected Results:  
Had A useless "letterbox type screen" as a "footer" on ALL FireFox and MyWay pages.  Get the useless 1 1/2 inch bottom footer off the screen!

Have a CLEAN INSTALLATION!  FURTHER,ABANDON TYPICAL MICROSOFT OVER-OVER-OVER-OVER DONE TACTICS TO RUN A BROWSER! HINTS: FireFox USED to be "USER FREIINDLY!"  In the past year, it's getting more and more like MICROSOFT!  AS IN BECOMING 'KLUTZY'--OVERDONE--FULL OF USELESS 'OPTIONS'!?!?!  

SIDEBAR:  I REST MY CASE!  When I started using FireFox a few years ago, it worked flawlessly!  NO LONGER!!!  THESE NEVER-ENDING WAY-WAY OVERDONE DETAILS WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY, IF PROGRAMMERS STOPPED PUTTING STUFF 'OVER THE CURB' BEFORE IT WAS FUNCTIONAL!  CAN ANYONE SPELL 'BETA'!??!?
