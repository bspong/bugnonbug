Memory use grows substantially with time, when viewing articles in www.globes.co.il - a major Israeli financial site.

Seems to me that this behavior/bug is at least since the FireFox 1.5 release. I have 512MB of memory which is adequate at the start, but due to the memory growth, it is all exhausted, and starts swapping to disk, making FireFox hang for a long time.

It might be a memory leak, I don't know how to check it.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.globes.co.il .(If it asks you what language, I have chosen Hebrew, but I believe that the bug will show also in the english version, since it seems to me that it is related to the heavy graphics)
2. open many articles in multiple tabs, about 20 (to make the memory growth be more rapid)
3. Note the memory use as reported by task manager after all pages finished loading
4. leave it open for several hours to a day.
5. Note again the memory use, this time it will be several 100MBs higher than before.


Actual Results:  
substantial memory use growth as reported by task manager

Expected Results:  
Have more or less the same memory use as after loading initially all the tabs/pages.
