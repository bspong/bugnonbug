- open a text editor (I have used window's notepad)
- enter TABULATOR and some chars
- select all
- copy it to the clipboard
- open a webpage with a form
- paste the clipboard into a input or textarea type input field:

The tabulator is pasted! But it's not allowed to enter tabulator chars into form
input and textarea fields.

This problem also happens when pasting some text that was copied from a webpage.

(Maybe it's also possible to enter other not allowed (non printable) chars. I
don't know.)
