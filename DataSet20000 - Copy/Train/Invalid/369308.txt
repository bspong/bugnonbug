pages never finish loading after SSL warning dialog
Since Firefox 2, there are several problems with dialog boxes not being modal.

The latest one occurs when starting Firefox with several pages in the session to restore.

As soon as I get a dialog box (the one that seems to trigger it is a warning about the site's name not matching the certificate's name), all pages stop loading.  Even after clicking OK on the dialog box, several tabs (presumably any that haven't yet loaded before the SSL warning dialog) never finish loading.  They sit there perpetually with the tab's title showing "Loading".

I am also using an authenticating proxy.
