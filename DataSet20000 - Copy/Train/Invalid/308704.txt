Hello everyone,

just recently switched to the Firefox 1.5 beta. After using it for a while i
noticed that the button on my Logitech mouse which configured to act like the
back button does not work. Logitech Mouse Driver Version is 9.79. I didn't
update the driver or did anything super special to my system since the change to
Firefox 1.5 beta. Clicking on the Back button in the toolbars work as expected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to any website
2. click a link
3. press the button on your mouse configured to act as back button

Actual Results:  
nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
same as clicking on back button in toolbar.
