My 2Wire modem kept resetting ever few minutes.  My ISP provder thought it was a bad modem and sent a new one. it was not the problem.  Many folks thought it was an apple update to its op system that was causing the problem. it too was not.  ISP sent a TECH to check our lines in our house and it too was not the problem. After uninstalling everything firefox(app, plists, bookmarks, settings, all files in os x library associated with ffox) and then clean installing FFox my 2Wire modem problems disappeared.

Reproducible: Always
