I reckon these things have been completely forgotten since FF3 betas were released :P
I like to have more customizable toolbar buttons. You know - left click -> customize. Because Firefox just keeps adding more features, but they are hidden away in "Tools" or other menus.

There should be included toolbar buttons at least for:
- Private Browsing
- Clearing Private Data
- Options window
- View Source / Page Info
- "The Big" Bookmark Organizer
- Full Screen
- Work Offline
