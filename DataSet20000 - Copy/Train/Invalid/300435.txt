The test harness at the below Url demonstrates this.

You wil notice that the second two boxes are blank.

These boxes are...
box3Obj.appendChild(document.createTextNode('Rèsumè'));
box4Obj.appendChild(document.createTextNode('R#232;sum#232;'));

proper spelling of certain words.  Not the most serious of issues by any means,
but it does prevent us from meeting our requirements.
