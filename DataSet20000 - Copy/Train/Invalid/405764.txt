Increased risk of wireless freezing when using beta on Vista
So, this is going to be a really bad initial filing sorry for this, but I wanted to get it filed in time to try and troubleshoot it, as it's taken me a few weeks to convince myself it *is* related to trunk.  Here goes:

When I'm using trunk, at least once a day, and sometimes while I'm in the middle of something, my connection will show as "connected with limited access."  The wireless network list won't refresh, if I disconnect from the server, the list is empty.  I have to reboot to connect again.

Been using branch (2.0.0.9) for about 3 days now and it hasn't happened once, haven't applied any OS updates or driver updates, drivers should be up to date, did that for another issue, but I'll double check.

I wish I could remember when this started happening, I believe in Sept or Oct. I'll work on seeing if I can get a regression range.

Anything I can log that might be illuminating, or other info that will help?  Hopefully this is just me.
