Client param makes Google searches use google.es in Catalan Firefox
«firefox…» value client parameter in Google searchplugin turns Google searches in Catalan Firefox browser (in Spanish state) under google.es domain. 

If instead of «firefox» any other value is tried, let's says «mozilla-firefox», there is not such redirection.

This was already commented in a previous bug 269062.

Many users who use Catalan software, would prefer not being imposed that redirection, so this behaviour should be changed in the Google side.
