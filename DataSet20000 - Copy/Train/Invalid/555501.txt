Using Firefox 3.6 my internet access from the browser was excellent. I updated to 3.6.2 and the pages can sit for ever trying to load, my gmail chat active status can not keep me logged in for more than a few seconds. Web Radio links drop and not even finish uploading the buffer. Even Google searches would not load up. It was as if the program could not access the network. Skype and Live Messenger were operating fine at 100%. To test what the problem could have been, I used other browser, Chrome, and everything worked great. I tested my connection to my network, all good. Reloaded 3.6 and all is back to working fine, web radio is up 100%, my gmail account working well, pages loading quickly...
Love you guys, I'm a loyal Firefox User
