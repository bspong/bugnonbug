need to fix state for close button when mouse hovered over background tab, but mouse not hovering over close button
need new state for close button in hovered background tab

I broke this with my recent landing for bug #350139

according to beltzner, there are 5 states we need to show for the close button

1) selected tab, mouse not hovering over close button
2) selected tab, mouse hovering over close button
3) background tab, mouse not hovering over close button (or tab)
4) hovered over background tab, mouse not hovering over close button
5) hovered over background tab, mouse hovering over close button

on winstripe, 1,2,3,5 are ok, but I broke #4.

I'm going to make sure pinstripe is ok, too.
