After succesfully installed the latest calling ID toolbar version 1.6.0.67
it doesnt appear at all in mozilla firefox latest version 3.0.1
While in internet explorer v7.0 works great i cannot make it appear or either enter in the toolbar options inside mozilla add on menu.
I try to disable and then enable again the calling id toolbar add on but nothing happens at all.
I have the mozilla default settings and i dont have other add ons installed.

The calling ID toolbar was working great with mozilla 2.xx versions.

So plz help to solve this problem

thanks
