Problems after firefox update and/or installation of Norton 360 including: new windows, right click menu, tools menu, process not closing upon exit, etc.

Since these occurences, I've been unable to open only a single window with firefox and not any additional ones - though tabs are okay - regardless of whether I try the firefox shortcut, typing ctrl+n, using the file menu, right-clicking on a link, etc.

When right clicking on a link or using the "Tools" menu, the menu only shows approximately 3 options and the rest are blank and unseeable, therefore unable to click on.

After closing the firefox main window - which is only one because of the previous problems - it cannot be opened again without going into task manager and ending the process there because the process has not closed on its own and is 'still runnning'


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Try opening a new window.
2.Click "Tools" and look at the menu.
3.Close firefox and try opening it again.
Actual Results:  
Same thing as always.

Expected Results:  
Opened new windows, shown the drop down list under "tools" and when right-clicking, closed the firefox process when closing the firefox browsing window
