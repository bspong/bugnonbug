I had this before. Thhe places thing. Apparently fixed?!? Funny. According to bock access trace Firefox writes to places.sqlite-journal every few minutes. Even more, it now writes also to sessionstore-3.js as well as _CACHE_001_ and others when idle.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Install a current copy of Firefox
Actual Results:  
Messig disk. No way to do an idle spin down. No way to reduce power consumption.

Expected Results:  
Reasonably behaviour when idle. Allows user to spin down disk.

Im going to close this bug report as WONTFIX according to prior experience with the bug handling at Mozilla foundation. Would somebody please scrap my account. I' m tired of having bugs around for years.
