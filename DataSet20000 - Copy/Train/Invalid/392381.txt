100% CPU for some time when clicking History menu and then at every new page load

This is a problem I've had in the recent months, but not forever:

Sometimes when I click the History menu, Firefox freezes for 15-30 seconds eating 100% CPU. After this, it freezes 5-15 seconds every time I load a page(!) that I haven't visited before.

I rarely reboot my laptop and had a feeling that the problem only happened in long (days) Firefox sessions and perhaps after having the PC in hibernation overnight (I've had other hibernation problems earlier), but today I had it happen again efter just restarting Firefox + hibernation (10 seconds) + wake up + click History menu. And then I found the same problem on my other PC, which is never in hibernation.

I'm running Firefox in Safe Mode now, and still experience the same problem.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox and use it for some time
2. Click History menu, and it takes 15-30 seconds to open @ 100% CPU
3. Visit new (unvisited) webpages, and they take 5-15 seconds to load @ 100% CPU
Actual Results:  
Firefox freezes and consumes 100% CPU for a while (as described above), then acts like normal

Expected Results:  
No freeze
