in firefox 4, icons on the add-on bar ignored the text+icons mode and only displayed the icon or text if you chose text only

In Firefox 5, aurora and trunk the icon display shows as it did in firefox 4 until the next time you change the button display mode, which then it shows the icon + text.  This is problematic for icons that can be placed either on the button bar or add-on bar and expect the text to be disabled on the addon bar.

With a fresh profile you're insta-screwed as it will take on the icon+text mode the moment you set it as such.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a profile in firefox 4.0.1 
2. set the button view to icon + text
3. place icons on the addon-bar
4. Migrate the profile to firefox 5b or later
5. icons on add-on bar include text the next time you change this setting

if you create a new profile it will show the text on add-on bar items regardles.

Actual Results:  
buttons that can be placed on either the button bar or addon bar all of a sudden display text when they did not previously

Expected Results:  
Add-on bar buttons remain as icons only regardless of the button display setting.
