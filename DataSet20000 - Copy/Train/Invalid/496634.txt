The inbuilt Mozilla search via Ctrl + F, does not effectively give desired results. Sometimes I can see the word on the screen but when I search, it is not found. Other times, for instance searching for "Figure" the search will highlight F and I but as I get to G, it will turn red say not found.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Ctrl + F
2. Search for something you know exists
3.
Actual Results:  
The word I know exists on the page, does not appear in Mozilla's result

Expected Results:  
Found the word being searched
