significant slowdown (rare crashes) on autocomplete address bar, gets worse while running, autocomplete not working

This bug was *not* experienced in the 0.8 build! 

On recent 0.9 builds, the autocomplete function for the address bar is causing a
massive slowdown after using the browser for a longer time (about 10-15 minutes
surfing on different sites).

I can observe the Menu- and addressbar flashing while I type in addresses and
the letters lag behind my typing, sometimes omitting several typed chars. When I
type too fast, sometimes (unfortunately not reproducable) firefox crashes
alltogether.

Switching off "auto complete" does *not* solve the problem! 



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start firefox 0.9.x under Linux 2.6.x
2. Surf the web for at least 10 minutes, typing in different URLs
3. Watch the bug unfold.

Actual Results:  
Address bar and Menus "flash" while I type addresses, letters lag behind my
typing, no addresses get completed!

Expected Results:  
Address bar and Menus should stay solid, letters should appear as fast as I can
type and addresses should give me the auto-complete dropdown list.

Theme is Qute 2.1.2 ... will try default ... sorry :)
