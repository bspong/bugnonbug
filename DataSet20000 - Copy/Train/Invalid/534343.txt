I dont know if this is big issue for you but it is causing problems for me.
When I add roboform toolbar it automatically drops to 3rd or 4th row. (if 1st one is menu 2nd address bar and 3rd are links then it comes to 4th row. Now the thing is that it CAN NOT be move d from there! when i move mouse there is nothing to catch !
