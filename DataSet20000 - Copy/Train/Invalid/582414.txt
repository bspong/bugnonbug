Mozilla mobile has amnesia.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; InfoPath.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I carry a flash drive with mobile on it.

Anytime I start Mobile on a new computer, it insists on trying to import IE bookmarks from the host computer.  It also resets my home page to

http://www.google.com/firefox?client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official

-------

I have a file HTM page that I open on the flash drive.  With MY bokmarks.
I set that as my HOME PAGE  file:///E:/OPERA6.HTM

I think "SET IT ONCE AND LEAVE IT ALONE.

But that doesn't happen. . .Mozilla REJECTS what I want.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Mozilla. . .it goes to original settings
2.Attempt to reset home page.
3.notice settings have been lost the next time Mobile is used on a new computer.


Expected Results:  
leave my choices in place.
