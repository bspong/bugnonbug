In <TD> tag, usage of VALIGN="CENTER" does not give desired results

The following tag should display two buttons centered in a table-cell. In IE this looks just fine, but FireFox aligns the buttons to the top of the cell. (Horizontally they are centered, but not vertically!) It looks like valid HTML code to me!

<td ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="CENTER"><p><input type="button" value="Wijzigen" name="button_edit" onclick="javascript:location.href='filminputform.asp?id=204&mode=edit'"></P>    <P><input type="button" value="Verwijderen" name="button_delete" onclick="javascript:location.href='filminputform.asp?id=204&mode=delete'"></P></td>  

The supplied URL to this page will not display the buttons, as the buttons are only displayed to the mamager of the database and allow changing information.

For full reference here is the code for one complete table row including the buttons (just cut and paste to an empty html file to view the problem):

<table border=2>
  <tr valign=top>
    <td width="120"><img src=".\thumbs\001_-_an_unearthly_child.jpg"></td>
    <td><p><b>Doctor Who - 001 - An Uneartly Child</b><br>
    <em>1963 - Series/Sci-Fi - 100 min.</em></p>

    <table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>
      <tr><td><small>Regisseur:&nbsp;</small></td><td><small>Waris Hussein</small></td></tr>
      <tr><td><small>Schrijvers:&nbsp;</small></td><td><small>Anthony Coburn, C.E. Webber</small></td></tr>
