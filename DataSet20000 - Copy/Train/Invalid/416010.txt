On search, default to collapsed advanced search area
Created attachment 301763
this is the area I'm referring to

On searching, at the moment, the advanced search rows/fields appear automatically.  The advanced search capabilities are great to have, but, as _advanced_ options, they should probably be hidden by default.  The context selection bar ("Search: Selected Folder, All Bookmarks, etc.") should definitely appear by default.  See attached image for clarification.
