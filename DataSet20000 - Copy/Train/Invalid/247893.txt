Go menu uses global history instead of session history

The GO menu (session history list?) is not the same in Firefox as it is in
Netscape Navigator (7.1 and prior).  It wasn't "broke", so why did you "fix
it"?? :-(  I am accustomed to, for example, going to the salon.com premium
log-in page, which will take me to the home page after the log-in is processed.
 There, I select an article to read.  Suppose that it is displayed over 5
sequential web pages.  Do _you_ want to hit the "Back" button 5 times to return
to the homepage??  _I_ don't.  Instead, I just use the GO list to choose the
home page, of course.  BUT with Firefox, the history list is like the one in
I.E., namely, it contains an entry for a page only once regardless of how many
times the page was accessed.  (So, it is not really a "history" or "log" of the
actual order in which pages were selected and displayed.)  The consequence is
that after I have selected and read only a few articles, the salon.com homepage
is no longer on the GO list.  In summary, I really like the way that it is
implemented in Netscape Navigator 7.1 -- indeed, the usefulness of the GO
feature is the principal reason that I have preferred Netscape Navigator 7.1
instead of Internet Explorer!!  Why do you want the Firefox GO feature to
function like the lousy "history" feature of Internet Explorer 6.x ??
