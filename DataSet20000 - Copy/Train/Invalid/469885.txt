I don't like the new functionality where typeahead find searches page titles, so I'm trying to disable it. Two about:config entries seem relevant.

accessibility.typeaheadfind.linksOnly
accessibility.typeaheadfind.startLinksOnly

Neither seem to have the desired effect.

If they are no longer used, they might need to be removed from about:config?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.set accessibility.typeaheadfind.linksOnly or accessibility.typeaheadfind.startLinksOnly true
2. Enter a string in the location field
3. Observe search behavior
Actual Results:  
page titles are found

Expected Results:  
only matching links are found
