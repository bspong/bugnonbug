Bug 347930 changed or broke the 'browser.tabs.autoHide' pref
The landing of the patches in bug 347930 changed or broke the 'browser.tabs.autoHide' preference.  I had the preference set to true so that the tabbar would hide when only one tab was open.  After updating to the 03/17/2010 nightly this no longer happened and after investigating the preference, the preference had been toggled.

This preference should not be toggled so that users upgrading to the next firefox release do not have the preference reset unwillingly.
