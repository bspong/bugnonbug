When I press open a new tab, Current/Latest Tab's address is kept in newly opened Tab's Address bar. I suppose it should show an empty address bar with cursor focused on it.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any web page
2. press Ctrl+T to open a new Tab
3. Verify the Address bar and its content
Actual Results:  
It shows the last seen page's address in new tab.

Expected Results:  
Should show an empty address bar with cursor on it.
