Make of Firefox + Sunbird build fails
I was following the directions at http://gemal.dk/mozilla/build.html because 
Mozilla's did not work for me. I had gotten very far and had begun the build 
using "make -f client.mk build_all". After a few hours, it stopped. I checked 
the error log and this is the last 10 lines or so:

I have not attempted to reproduce it yet, for it will most likely take many 
hours, but I will start that now. I'm not sure what other information is 
needed, but I will be glad to produce anything needed.
