Yes is too easy to press on prompts on some malicious sites
A lot of malicious sites have scripts, etc that bring up popup windows. It's too
easy to press "Yes" on these windows. I suggest making people click a checkbox
that says "I understand these warnings, blah blah". Only a hidden pref should
turn that checkbox off, otherwise it'll be unchecked by default.

My assumption is that applets can do harm to the system since they run locally.

It's way too easy to press "Yes" on the popup asking if you trust Integrated
Search Technologies.
