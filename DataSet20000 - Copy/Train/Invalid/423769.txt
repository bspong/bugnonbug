I am unable in Minefield to "restore" bookmarks from a bookmarks.html file.

Previously I could "restore" bookmarks from my fx2 bookmarks.html file.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Places Library
2. Select Import and Backup > Restore... > Choose File...
3. Choose a functioning bookmarks.html file.
Actual Results:  
File is chosen, but after that nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
Fx3 should delete current Places bookmarks and replace them from the chosen file.

This is either a regression or a change in function.
