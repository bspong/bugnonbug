database stored url path to pdf file on local intranet will not open file, Explorer 7 works and Explorer 8 requires trusted site established for local server
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I believe the path of url is affected with latest release of firefox.  Example in address bar is http://lamoka/user//\\lamoka\user\manuals\test.pdf

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Create web page with database storing url path to local pdf file.  Click on link to pdf through firefox on local intranet file.


pdf file should have opened in tab.  Worked on previous revision.
