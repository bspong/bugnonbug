At the page http://raz0.zalon.dk/team60.html you can see some odd characters
displayed. They appear if you use "View page source" too. As this is my own
page, I know for a fact that they are *not* present in the real (local)
document. Furthermore they do not appear in Internet Explorer. I tested this on
the Firefox as mentioned in the "Build Identifier" above and on the stable 0.8
on my brothers computer (running Windows 98).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up http://raz0.zalon.dk/team60.html or www.team60.dk
2. See for yourself. :)

Actual Results:  
Odd characters are displayed in the beginning of the document.

Expected Results:  
It shouldn't have displayed these characters.
