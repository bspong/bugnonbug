embedded Google Map fails to display correctly
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_4_11; en) AppleWebKit/525.27.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.2.1 Safari/525.27.1

Map created in Google Maps and embedded in another web page by copy-paste of the code snippet provided by Google Maps displays with image-placeholders for the controls and either some or no map tiles rendered (or shown as tiles with too-high zoom). The same embedded map on the same web page displays correctly in Camino/Opera/Safari on Mac, IE6 on Win XP and IE7 on Vista.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open maps.google.com on any location
2. click the "Link" URL, from the popup panel, copy the code below the "Paste HTML to embed in a website"
3. paste copied code into a web page
4. open page in Firefox 3
Actual Results:  
The embedded Google Map didn't display in Firefox: gray background with tiles marked "We are sorry but we don't have maps at this zoom level for this region. Try zooming out for a broader look.", some map controls render correctly, others show as image-placeholders. The same page displays correctly in Safari, Camino, Opera, etc.

Expected Results:  
Properly rendered Google Map

Unlikely it's a Firefox add-on, as the same problem was reported to me by an associate who runs plain-vanilla Firefox (also on Mac OS X).
