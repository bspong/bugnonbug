this appears after a 1/3 of a second or so

My original problem was that i could not launch new tabs in ff3.6. After a bit of research it seems that asktoolbar was causing the problem for most people. However after trying every possible method of removing it I still cannot even tell if its installed. I checked for a rootkit but GREM found nothing,
