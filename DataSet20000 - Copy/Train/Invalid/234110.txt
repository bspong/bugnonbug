In trunk builds post 20040210, setting the history to 0 no longer disables
autocomplete or the history dropdown as in previous versions.  If this is
intentional, then there needs to be an option to disable the autocomplete and
dropdown.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set history to 0
2. Type an URL in the Location Bar
3.

Actual Results:  
If another URL is input in the Location Bar, autocomplete will be activated.

Expected Results:  
If history is set to 0, autocomplete should not be active.
