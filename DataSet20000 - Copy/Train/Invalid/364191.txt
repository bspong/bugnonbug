You are victims of "i think i know better than the user" mentality. I ABSOLUTELY DETEST the cut and paste feature you've enabled onto the ctrl button. For instance; when I want to cut and paste, i want to select the text and be pressing ctrl and hovering over the C button at the same time. I can't in Firefoxe cause I either end up selecting the entire @#$*# word or a box appears around the entire object!!!! What the hell is up with that? Do you know how irritating it is to put up with that crap. YOU DON"T KNOW BETTER. We experienced this shit once already when microsoft decided to come out with new fangled select and cut and paste options which half the time auto-select a whole )*^*(^& phrase or sentence when I don't want the damn thing to. FIX that ctrl button issue already!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.select some text in the browser while holding ctrl and watch as the firefox gods randomly select shit that you didn't intend to.
2.
3.



Expected Results:  
when i select something while holding ctrl I don't want anything to happen except selecting the text that i'm selecting with the mouse.
