That is a problem if both URLs are wide enough. As a result both are unreadable. I will enclose an attachment which illustrates the issues.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a web page.
2. Move the pointer on a link.
3. Take a look to your location bar.
Actual Results:  
see attachment

Expected Results:  
The location bar should show as much of the target link as possible.
