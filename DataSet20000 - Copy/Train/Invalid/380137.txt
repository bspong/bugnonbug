My host decided it was a good idea to suddenly server .css files as text/plain, therefor my website was suddenly plain HTML. Firefox ignores text/plain files and does not try and parse these as CSS files, but I linked my stylesheets like so:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" type="text/css" />
Where I set the MIME type to "text/css", I would assume that Firefox still tries to parse the plain text file as CSS, because I specified it to be. This should be the fallback for when CSS files are served wrong.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a HTML page with a linked stylesheet, like so:
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" type="text/css" />
2. Serve a CSS file as text/plain
3. Open the HTML page
Actual Results:  
The HTML page remains without CSS styling

Expected Results:  
Since I specified the file to be text/css, it should be parsed as such and my HTML page should have the CSS styles applied.
