Saving Web pages or files with wrong date

I'm trying Firefox 4.0 Beta 2 (both Windows and Ubuntu Linux 10.04) and I noticed that when you save a Web page or a file, it is saved with the date when it was uploaded by the author on his website, and not when I downloaded myself.
For example, if the Web page or the file has been uploaded to the server that the original author July 21, 2009 and we are at July 24, 2010, the Web page or file is downloaded with the data dating back to July 21, 2009 and not the current date of July 24, 2010.
Is possible to ensure that when you download a Web page or a file, Firefox 4.0 Beta 2 you save the date of when I've downloaded and not the date of the upload's original?
Thank you.

Reproducible: Always




Same problem on both Windows XP and Ubuntu Linux 10.04
