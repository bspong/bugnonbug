Firefox won't follow redirects in frames if the 'spons' fragment is present in the URL.

I have a frameset with one frame redirecting to a new url which contains the Response parameter, firefox doesn't follow this redirect, it shows the html body of the 302 response.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. construct a frameset with one frame pointing to this php script:
<?php header('Location: spons.html'); echo "stuck here";?>
2. call the frameset html
Actual Results:  
frame output is "stuck here" instead of the contents of spons.html

Expected Results:  
frame shows contents of 'spons.html'

I'd like to do SAML2 front-channel communication in one frame which involves redirect-bouncing to one host. SAML2 specs require that the SAMLResponse GET parameter is present in the answer, this redirect does not happen in current firefox version. Opera and Safari works as expected.
