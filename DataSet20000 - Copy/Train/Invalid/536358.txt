Bookmarks: cant delete or edit
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; SiteKiosk 7.1 Build 267)

when you have a lot of bookmarks and folders as well, with a long list (more than 50). List goes down till the end of you monitor panel.
To delete, edit, rename and so on works fine in the above part of the bookmark-list. But in the end of the list you can do nothing. Firefox ignore my commands to edit the bookmark direct on the list. 
Fortunately it works, when you want to edit the bookmarkt through the menu bar (German's name: "Lesezeichen verwalten" works).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. build a lot of bookmarks, so that a long list is created.
2. Try to edit the bookmarks near to the end of your monitor panel
3.



I noticed this problem also in the version before (3.5.5). 
Versions under 3.5.5 worked fine.

I have windows 7, 64-bit
