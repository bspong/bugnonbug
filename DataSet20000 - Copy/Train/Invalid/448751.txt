Firefox allows extensions to steal UI keybindings

After installing some extensions, some keybindings might not work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Install Brief 1.2 from http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4578
Restart Firefox and point Brief to your RSS feeds bookmark folder
Close Brief's tab and go to any other page
Press cmd+M
Actual Results:  
Window does not minimize

Expected Results:  
Window should minimize

It turns out that Brief steals this keystroke to mark feeds as read. I've filed a bug with them as well, since they should respect Firefox's application keystrokes, but Firefox should also not allow extensions to steal them.
