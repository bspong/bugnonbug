When FF3 updated itself to Beta 3, the forward and back buttons from my customized toolbars were missing. I eventually found it in the default "Navigation Toolbar" (which I have hidden) so I tried to use "Customize..." menu item of the toolbar's right click menu to bring it back, but none of the widgets that are already on the toolbar can be moved around. Items can be dropped in from the window that pops up however.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. From FF2 (I've never had a need to customize the toolbar in FF3 Beta 1 or 2 so I'm not sure if it would work or not) and customize the toolbars as follows:
 - Move all items from the Navigation Toolbar onto the Menu Toolbar
 - Hide the Navigation Toolbar
2. Upgrade to FF3 Beta 3 (My first install of FF3 was Beta 1, so you may have to go through those steps as well?)
3. Note how the Back and Forward buttons are gone from the custom menu.
4. Show the Navigation Toolbar, and try to customize the toolbars again.
Actual Results:  
You can't drag any of the buttons that are already present on the Toolbars around. 
Items can be dragged from the "Customize Toolbar" window and unto the toolbars however.

Expected Results:  
Items should be draggable even if they are already on the toolbar (similar to how FF2 worked)

Using the default theme.
