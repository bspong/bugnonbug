It looks like theres something that Session Saver is attempting to do that keeps
the Tabs in the tab Bar hidden. They are still there and when you click in
diffrent areas where the tabs are then you can switch between tabs, but there is
no visual of the tabs, just the background of the tab bar.

I recently upgraded to Deerpark A1 from FF 1.0.4 with all my extentions. When I
first started I was told that some of my extentions will be disabled as they
will not work with DP. I think that Session Saver should be added to the list of
disabled ext. untill this can be worked out as it is a bit wonky to not see your
tabs. 

If this is something that I should also bring up with the extention creator
please let me know. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install session saver ( the latest version at this time is ".2 * Nightly 28" )
2. close browser to load extention
3. restart browser

Actual Results:  
Tabs in Tab bar are not visable

Expected Results:  
Visable tabs

I dont know if this is an OSX only issue. I have only tried this on my powerbook
OSX 10.3.9. I guess this could also be an issue with my existing FF profile. I
have not tried a fresh install (with out a existing profile). If this is
nessassary please let me know.
