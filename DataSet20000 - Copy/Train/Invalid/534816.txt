Installed FF3.5.5 again. This issue had happened a few times since December 4th. I cannot load some pages. The last time it I lost my history tabs (previous sessions) and was also unable to open 'Preferences' (see screenshot). I had set my preference to "Show my windows and tabs from the last time". 

This time I could load my email (see screenshot) and it appears that the tabs are still loading even after a few minutes (see screenshot). A resource problem?

Now I am back on FF3.0.11 and everything is working.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch FF3.5.5
2. Sometimes no sessions (blank) with a message "Embarassing.." and have to restore session.
3. Hit the restore session button. Sometimes it works. Most of the time not.
4. Click on "Preferences". Blank.
5. Shutdown. Re-install previous browser.
Actual Results:  
No tabs. Blank. And no preferences.

Expected Results:  
Load last sessions.

This happened after December 4th. Any significance?
