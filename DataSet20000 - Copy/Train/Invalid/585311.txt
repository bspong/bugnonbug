Visiting facebook crashes firefox and X-server (locks up keyboard, and gnome)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 Firefox/3.6.8

It seems that when part of the page is loaded, screen locks up along with the keyboard. OS still runs, and I can remotely login to reboot. X uses 100% CPU at this time. Sometimes it just throws me out of X and the login screen appears.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit facebook pages
2.Just wait
3.Observe X crashing, or login screen appearing
Actual Results:  
Have to reboot. I tried this on two linux boxes running CentOs 5.4, and In both cases the video drivers are i810, and in both cases X crashed. It is interesting to note that seamonkey does not crashe on these same pages that cause crashes in firefox and X.

Expected Results:  
Firefox crash should not result in X crashing.
