High cpu use since version 3.6.4

Showing cpu use

I am seeing 50% flat cpu use on my core 2 duo (one of the two cores i guess at 100%) since installing 3.6.4 (also 3.6.6 which is what i am using, windows xp) after browsing a few tabs with flash content. I notice this after scrolling on a site slows down. I have 2 gigs of ram.

My guess is that the cause involves the new process scheme developed for 3.6.4/3.6.6 to isolate plugins, since i am sure this didn't happen in 3.6.3

The intranet's homepage (i am at work) has 6 flash animations (i know) but they are fairly simple. When i close it, cpu goes down. When i open it back again, cpu stays down. After a while of browsing some pages in tabs, cpu goes back to 50%.

I don't know if this is caused by some pages or if this is just time-related.

Sites that i frequently visit are:
docs.google.com
noticias24.com
slashdot.org

This is random, i can't reproduce it at will, but it happens everyday, so my guess is that this is a combination of flash use in sites and time.

Tried to search for existing bugs before posting, but didn't find one that exactly describes this situation.

Also, i am using adblock plus but I don't think it is causing this problem.

Please dupe or comment as necessary.
