Some tabs are not shown [caused by openSUSE Firefox extensions 1.0.1]
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0

I can cycle through all tabs with ctrl-tab, but they all are not shown in the tab list. The add-new-tab plus button is shown on the left even though I moved it right in the panel customization.

I use tabs grouping.

Reproducible: Always
