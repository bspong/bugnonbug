Specific Web Page Segfaults, Crashes X Session
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052912 Firefox/3.0

Accessing the URL attached causes my entire X session to crash/die fairly consistently  (50% - 75%) of the time.  This has been tested on two different Fedora 8 installations on two separate computers.  Crashing does not occur on other platforms.  This problem has existed on at least the previous RC1, beta5.  I will investigate earlier versions.  Since it entirely crashes my entire X session (full log out, etc), I'm not sure I can get any crash data etc.  Advice on how to capture crash info would help.  

On first computer (floyd) regular X session running KDE.  Nvidia drivers for display. On second computer (chilliwack), VNC session running X, running KDE. 

Relevent /var/log/messages section attached from both systems (not much there, just the seg fault) will be attached
