I have one main form, and 1 or more forms inside the main form.

I've checked out the html sintax and it is perfect.
Bug:
the first child form is rendered without <form>....</form>
all the next child forms are rendered ok and functionality is also ok.
i've tested the same code in Chrome and IE, and in IE all child forms work fine, in Chrome and Firefox the bug happents.

So this bug must be a core or geko related bug, since bothe firefox and chrome are built on the same engine.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
when i submit the form (press the submit button) of the first child form, the main form gets submited not the actual from

Expected Results:  
the child form to be submited
