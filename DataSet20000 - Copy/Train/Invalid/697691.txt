Actual results:

The :not(.edit) selector is ignored and then all ".editable" elements are removed from the screen
You have the full expected result in the top part of the "Result"

Using *:not(.edit) will not change the result.
Using div:not(.edit) will let only the sons and not all descendants (sons of sons ...) to be displayed on the screen.


Expected results:

The :not(.edit) CSS selector should hold the ".editable" elements from being removed from the screen
You have the full expected result in the bottom part of the "Result"
