Drag and drop from external apps to firefox does not work correctly, dragging a link from a email viewed in thunderbird into tab bar of firefox tries to load a double url, in address bar it enters the same link text twice which causes a lot of problems. 
 
I'm using latest firefox 3.5 and thunderbird 2.0.0.22 (20090605) 
 
This is a regression, this worked properly in firefox 3.0. 
 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open firefox
2. open a email with link in thunderbird
3. drag the link from thunderbird email into firefox tabs bar
Actual Results:  
url of the link that firefox opens is repeated twice, which causes a lot of problems.

Expected Results:  
the link should load properly in the new tab.

i'm running two separate firefox processes with separate profiles if that affects anything.
