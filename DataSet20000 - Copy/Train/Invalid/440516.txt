First of all, please don't mind the picture that describes it.
When i browse some forums, with pictures that are uploaded to imageshack for example, my statusbar reads the URL of the current topic, instead of the URL of that image ( e.g: forum.mozilla.org/viewtopic.php?t=1111 is being displayed instead of http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/image.jpg ).

When I move the cursor away from the image, then put it back on, the image URL is being displayed correctly as it should.
