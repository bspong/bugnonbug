Bookmarks cannot be dragged in this version of minefield because of a piece of code preventing the drag and drop code from executing.  The same piece of code makes the following issues.
--
There are 2 pictures used for toolbar buttons and toolbar drop down buttons
Currently:
onmouseover: 1
onmouseout: none
onmousedownandmousecursoronbutton: 2
onmousedownandmousecursoroutsidebutton: none
onmouseupandmouseonmenu: 1
onmouseupandmousenotonmenu: none
onblur : none
--
It would be better if it were: (like the text-menus)
onmouseover: 1
onmouseout: none
onmousedownandmousecursoronbutton: 2
onmousedownandmousecursoroutsidebutton: 2 AND ghostlike button following cursor
onmouseup: 2
onblur: none
--
Also when pointing to a child menu of a button or the menu toolbar just above or under a separator, then pointing to separator will NOT unhighlight or close the menu.
------------------------------
the drop down menu for back and forward and for the search provider does not have an onmouseover and onmousedown.  A drop down menu is missing for the search component, like in Firefox 2.0 win.  Firefox 2.0 Mac had a drop down menu for the search component.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Play with the toolbar buttons.
