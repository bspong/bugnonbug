When closing Gran Paradiso (3a3), firefox-bin is still running in the background.  Opening and then closing GP more than four or so times runs the CPU usage up to 100%, and I am forced to killall the process.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Gran Paradiso 3.0a3.
2.Close it.  Check processes - firefox-bin should appear on the list, using anywhere between 6 and 100% of CPU.
3.Rinse, lather, and repeat several times.
