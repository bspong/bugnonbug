We have a GPO that set some privacy otpions for Firefox.
This GPO is modifying  privacy.item.X entries.
If i'm not wrong, in Firefox 3.5, these items was renamed into privacy.cpd.X

Can you confirm that the match beetween the old entries privacy.item.X match the new entries privacy.cpd.X ? (IE : privacy.item.cookies == privacy.cpd.cookies ) ?

Thanks !

Reproducible: Always
