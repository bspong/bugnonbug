This site ceased asking the required security questions approximately 4 days ago before allowing access to account. Customers are allowed to login with no security questions being asked and a correct security answer being given before access is granted. When testing this same site on the Safari browser, the security questions are asked and only when the correct security answer is given is the account access granted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit link and enter account number, then password.
2. Account access is immediately granted with no security question being asked awaiting an answer.
Actual Results:  
Account access is immediately granted with no security question being asked awaiting an answer.

Expected Results:  
A series of security questions that the account holder has created should be randomly asked and the site must then await the proper answer before access is granted.

Began within the last week; does not happen on the Safari browser for Mac OS X Tiger as tested tonight.
