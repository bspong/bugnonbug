If you launch firefox/bon echo, click on the Mozilla Firefox folder on the Bookmarks Toolbar, and rightclick a bookmark you seem to get the context menu for the webpage or an item on the webpage. Not 100 percent reproducible, but if I keep trying in Bon Echo, however, I can get this to occur. Also occurs with bookmarks pulldown menu (see additional info)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.launch bon echo
2.click Mozilla Firefox folder on bookmarks toolbar
3.rightclick any bookmark 
4.try again a couple times if first time it works properly (see additional info)
Actual Results:  
You get the wrong context menu. Often it is for the page that you are viewing, but what you are really getting is the context menu for the item on the page that lies underneath the bookmark that you rightclicked. So if you can position a hyperlink under the item, you will get the hyperlinks context menu.

Expected Results:  
bookmark context menu

This can also happen to bookmarks in the Bookmarks pulldown menu. It appears to happen especially for any bookmark in a toolbar folder or bookmark menu that overlays an item on the current webpage.

Don't know if this is related to the fact that when I use a context menu for a hotlink on a webpage I often get, after clicking on a choice, a new context menu that appears to be associated with the item on the webpage under the selection I made on the first context menu.

The problem sometimes goes away, sometimes persists for an entire browsing session. On my own Firefox setup, it appears to be getting worse. These two effects are relatively recent, and very frustrating for a habitual rightclicker.
