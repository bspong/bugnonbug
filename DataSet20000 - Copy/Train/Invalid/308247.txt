Navigational Toolbar may become corrupted when migrating from 1.0 to 1.5 B1
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050720 Firefox/1.0.6 (mmoy CE 1.0.6 K8B-X34)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050720 Firefox/1.0.6 (mmoy CE 1.0.6 K8B-X34)

I migrated my profile from Firefox 1.0 to Firefox 1.5 B1 and sometimes after I
do so the navigational toolbar will always display the default Navigational
toolbar and the back and forward buttons will always be disabled.

I tracked the problem down to migrating over certain extensions.  When these
extensions are disabled the problem goes away.  Also if the problem extensions
are reinstalled (without uninstalling) the problem goes away.  The problem seems
to be triggered by any javascript that tries to access
"document.getElementById("content")" while the browser window is loading.  Even
though the returned element is valid, it seems to cause the navigation toolbar's
scripts to stop executing leaving it in a disabled state.

The strange thing is that the problem extensions do not always cause this to
occur when migrating over.  I tried creating a new 1.0 profile and installing an
extension I've seen cause the problem and then migrated over to 1.5 and didn't
have any problems at all.  

I have a work in progress extension that I'm developing which seems to trigger
the problem so I'll attach it (it is not finished nor polished but it works).

I'm going to see if I can create a small profile that always exhibits the
problem.  If so I'll upload it.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Take a "well used" 1.0 profile and modify the navigation toolbar (add or
remove items).
2. Run Firefox 1.5 B1 with the profile and let it convert over.
3. Look at the navigation toolbar

Actual Results:  
The navigation toolbar sometimes will not load correctly and display the default
toolbar.

Expected Results:  
The navigation toolbar should always display correctly.

A workaround is to find the problem extensions and reinstall them in Firefox 1.5 b1.
