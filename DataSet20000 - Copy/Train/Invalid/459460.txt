Intruder can access Firefox and add "exceptions" sites allowing installation of add-ons
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3
Build Identifier: Firefox/3.0.3

This page tries to download of a phony antivirus program that is, in fact, a trojan. Even if your PC's anti-virus software stops this intrusion (mine did), it manages to introduce into Firefox a list of porn-site "exceptions" to "Warn me when sites try to install addons" on Tools/Options/Security tab. The list can be deleted manually.
