To replicate, goto google, and search for anything.  Move the mouse to the
blank, white area to the right of the search results.  Hold shift and then
double click.  That search result will become blank.  I have removed extensions,
and the problem still persists.

2. Perform a search
3. Shift+double click in the blank space to the right of the search results

Actual Results:  
The result that the cursor was next to will become blank.

Expected Results:  
Nothing.
