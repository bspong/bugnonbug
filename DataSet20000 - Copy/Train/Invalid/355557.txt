Test Firefox with Vista's new Parental Control Feature
This is really a QA tracking bug.

Vista includes a new operating system wide feature for parental controls. I've included a link in this bug report that gives a brief overview.

We should be sure to test Firefox using the parental controls. Here's one particular case to look for:

If the parental controls see Firefox trying to load a URL that gets blocked, Firefox receives an http 450 error code and some HTML generated by the parental control. See the first image on this page: http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/03/01/541701.aspx

to see what the parental control error message looks like. Notice the "Ask an Administrator for permissions". In IE, this launches a parental control escalation dialog provided by Vista. We need to make sure that link does the right thing for Firefox too.
