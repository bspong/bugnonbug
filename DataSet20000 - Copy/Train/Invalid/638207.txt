I installed faviconizetab (add on)
when i make a tab smaller, so you only see the favicon, and you close that tab (right mouse button: close tab) the tabs on the right do not move to the left replacing the empty space.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install addon faviconizetab
2. settings in addon: doubleclick tab to faviconize
3. open 3 tabs
4. faviconize 2nd tab (double click on tab)

Actual Results:  
result: tab is closed, but third tab did not move to the left (collapse?)

Expected Results:  
it was expected the third tab in step 3, moved to the left
