Randomly, images will refuse to load on pages, showing only alt text at best

The odd thing about this is that it doesn't seem to have a pattern. It just happens every now and then. Either pages won't load images, showing only ALT values from the <img> tag, or pages time out before loading. What also happens is that the page appears, without images, just alt texts, and then give's a time-out.

I have read and used this article, but it did not help the situation. After finishing reading it, all is at default. All pipelines are false, all mentioned integer values are on their standard number(meaning doesn't appear in bold text).

TThis error only started happening once I started using the FF3 beta's, and now on RC1 and RC2

Also, The Build Indentifier says 2.0.0.14, why is this, I'm working on firefox 3.0 RC2 right now...

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go site(lolcatz is just one example, any site with a large amount of pics will do.)
2.watch it happen
Actual Results:  
The site loaded, but thumbnail images didn't, simply displayed ALT values form the HTML <img> tag.

15 minutes after going there, the page is now still loading(mozilla circle spinning around)

Expected Results:  
What should happen is simple: the images should load...
I'm thinking this is an FF3 problem, since it started happening when I started using FF3... 2.0.0.14 gives no such problem whatsoever.
