On platforms where the menu bar is hidden until the menu is focused, placing the location bar on the menu bar is possible (and if I may say so, a very nice option, since it allows you to place the navigation buttons on the tab bar and effectively browse with only the tab bar visible).

However, focusing the location bar with Command+L will not have the desired effect:
The location bar gets focused, but remains hidden. The Awesomebar results however are not.

If any element on the menu bar is focused, the menu bar should be unhidden and remain in this state until the focus shifts away.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Hide menu bar, so that it only shows with "Alt"
2. Customize / Place the location bar on the menu bar
3. Focus the location bar with Command+L
4. Press Down
Actual Results:  
The location bar remains hidden, however the Awesomebar results become visible

Expected Results:  
The location bar should become visible (by unhiding the menu bar),
