URL does not update when switching between tabs

If you switch between tabs, usually from the right to the left, the URL displayed in the location bar does not update. eg, switching from tab 2 to tab 1, tab 2's URL stays in the location bar. It seems to work going from tab 1 to any other tab, but not any other way.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open google.com in a tab
2. Open mozilla.org in a second tab and select it
3. After mozilla.org has loaded, switch to the first tab (with Google in it)

Actual Results:  
URL from second tab (mozilla.org) stays in location bar despite the active tab being google.com

Expected Results:  
Displayed google.com in the location bar
