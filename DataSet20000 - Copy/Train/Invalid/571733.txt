If a security issue or web page hangs up Firefox and the only way to safely exit the situation is by killing the Firefox process when Firefox is restarted the startup option should be respected. If the option is set to "Show my Homepage" that is what should happen not restoring the tabs and website that forced the killing of the Firefox process. If the option is set to "Show my windows and tabs from last time" then do the restore with the tabs listed so the offending tab and website can be eliminated so as to avoid the security issue or web page that hangs Firefox.
