I keep getting pop-up adds from applebe's (sp?).  doesn't matter what website
I'm on.  This has been going on for 2-3 weeks.
I mostly use: http://www.instaweather.com/KING/default.asp?cid=90&id=PACSC&obs=full
http://mail2web.com/cgi-bin/list.asp?pe=0&mp=I&mps=0&lid=0&lp=20&mt=32000&ld=-1&ed=02SH1E%2FnBj%2FLLruYOdhveYkjhYq9%2FAg8iLvuxGUGJEwm3x5Ai%2Bwb29e1p%2FU%2BeBcybokiObvg0Faz%0D%0AL5xQStXmlGPFMn7DN56mR3sWsgtVvWDIyfY%3D

and it pop's up on any of these.  I rarely use other websites.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just logging on and looking at a site and if on long enough then it pops up
and keeps popping up.  This is the only pop-up I'm getting and have never heard
of the business before.  I have no pop-ups allowed except for u.washington.edu,
which I haven't been on and is only to get to needed windows - like email from
the university.  The only other allowed pop-up is Hallmark - which I've not been
to in ages either.

3.

Actual Results:  
after a while the applebe pop-up shows up, sometimes several times.

Expected Results:  
Blocked the pop-up
