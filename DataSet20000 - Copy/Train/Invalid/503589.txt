hi! Sorry to say that but, is the worst update in the last two years.
Please, where can i get the previous version?

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.load page like 10+ eBay pages ans some Fakku (3-4)
2.minimize and get it full screen
3.reload the crashed firefox and your fucking pages are sadly gone for good...  :(
Actual Results:  
Happend 50-80%  Youre eBay page are gone and the naked girls too!!!   :)

Expected Results:  
at least restore the pages where there was! so i can finish my work... ON EBAY!   :0 

A nice waiting feature: when you install a update, it should have a "GO-BACK" to previous version in case of similar event.
