Not sure if the issue is with you or HP, seems like the 2 were updated at same time. I have included a link to picture of what the problem is. Since I have had previous problems with Firefox and Web printing, I figured I better take the time to send this bug to HP and Mozilla. I don't know what else to say about this except that it came up like this the next time I started the computer. I have no idea how to get rid of this except to uninstall HP web. I'd rather not, because I like web printing.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
Not sure. Maybe a single icon on taskbar.
