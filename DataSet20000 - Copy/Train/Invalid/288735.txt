Cursor Should Default To URL Bar Upon New Window Opening
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2

One of the very few annoyances with Firefox is that, when I open a new browser
(or launch the first one), it does not put the cursor in the URL bar (assuming
that the URL bar is enabled).  How many users actually know that they can do
this by pressing Ctrl+L?  This problem results in lots of wasted mouse
movements, which amount to poor ergonomics.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
As described above.
Actual Results:  
No cursor anywhere.

Expected Results:  
Put the cursor, by default, in the URL bar (assuming that it's visible).  At
least, default to the URL bar but have a preference setting that allows the user
to opt for the cursor in the search bar instead.
