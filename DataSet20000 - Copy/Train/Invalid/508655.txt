Computer freezes when displaying a small PDF popup window

My computer completely froze twice while displaying a PDF document in a window that was not full-screen. With the URI I gave, Chase had called up a new instance of Firefox to display the document. The new instance opened in a small window (roughly 1/4 of full screen), displayed the first page (?) of the doc, and the computer froze. The most recent time it did this I left the 'pooter for over an hour and there was no change. There was some disk activity, but with Vista that can mean anything or nothing. While attempting to verify the repeatability of this issue, a site called up a new instance, and it happened to be full screen. The box did not freeze.
I have not yet verified that Chase works right with explorer or Chrome. Chase is the site that I have had good repeatability with [bad grammer? Do you deduct points?]

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a website that offers a PDF document view and calls up a new Instance (as opposed to a new tab) to display it.
2.Open a new instance of Firefox and size it so it is not full screen. Close this instance. Doing this improves the likelihood that a new instance will not be full screen.
3.Return to the first instance of Firefox, and select the link that calls up the new instance.
Actual Results:  
Total freeze. Reset required to thaw.

Expected Results:  
Normal operation of my computenmachinen without requiring CPR.

Compaq Presario F700 laptop. 2.5GB ram, 135GB drive. Windows Vista (yuck!) SP1.
I am running Process Explorer, but since the 'pooter was locked up, it was unhelpful.
I have crash minidump enabled, but this issue does not seem to create one.

I am conversant in debugging, C++, Java, etc. Please let me know what more I can do to help.
