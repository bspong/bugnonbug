When I open the firefox browser it displays incorrectly. The first page and all
other pages look like the are alligned to the right and I can't scroll to the
right. Tried going tru the reported bugs but whatever is on the right I can't
see it. Also there's this bit of code on the bottom like in the footer:
<menuitem label="&ff.main.options.label;"
accesskey="&ff.main.options.accesskey;" default="true... can't see more coz it's
on the right side. Tried loading other pages and they all show up alligned to
the right (yahoo.com, nu.nl, gratiz.nl) in fact this is the only site that
alligns left. Tried opening the browser again, tried a reboot, stopped all
processes, but problem keeps occurring.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Close browser window
2.End all processes related to FF
3.Open browser again

Actual Results:  
Problem was still there.

Expected Results:  
Display a correctly alligned startup screen with the google search option and no
code on the bottom of the page.
