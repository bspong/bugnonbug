can't remove bookmark from menu and keep it in unfiled bookmarks in library

Currently, I can only delete bookmark from library. But if it is in bookmarks menu, sometimes I need just to remove it from menu, not from whole library. I must open bookmark in Firefox, and then double click the star and then I finally get the dialog from where I can remove bookmark only from menu. And library should exist exactly to keep me away from trouble like this.

This should be possible

Reproducible: Always
