Privacy setting "When using the location bar, suggest: History" shows both History and Bookmarks in results
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0

Steps to reproduce:

I set the Privacy settings to "When using the location bar, suggest: History" and cleared all browser history, then started typing in the Location bar.


Actual results:

The Location bar incorrectly suggests items from bookmarks, behaving exactly as if "History and Bookmarks" was selected.


Expected results:

No suggestions should have been displayed.
