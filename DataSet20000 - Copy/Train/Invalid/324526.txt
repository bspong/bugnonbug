When accessing any web site that requires multiple case types (capital letters and small letters) you are unable to use both in the same field.  Now days many passwords require both small and capital letters so you cannot login to any site with multiple case letters. After you try to type multiple cases you can no longer type in that field.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open www.google.com
2.type a small letter in the seach field, then a capital letter
3.now you can no longer type anything in the field 

Actual Results:  
you are stuck not being able to do anything until you refresh the page

Expected Results:  
we need to be able to use multiple cases to type password in FireFox

We are running OSX 10.2.8 and FireFox 1.5
