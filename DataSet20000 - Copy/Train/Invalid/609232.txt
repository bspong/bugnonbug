A display bug when switching between several multiple desktop configuration.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b8pre) Gecko/20101102 Firefox/4.0b8pre
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b8pre) Gecko/20101102 Firefox/4.0b8pre

When I change the configuration of multiple desktop (set one more display for example), the Firefox windows doesn't display anything and I need to restart to correct this.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Open NVidia Control Panel
3. Set up another multiple displays mode (add or remove a display is the same).
Actual Results:  
Firefox seems to be not responding (like an infinite loop in a software).

Expected Results:  
The software should be displayed correctly after the multiple desktop modification.

My video card is a GeForce 8600GT and I use NVidia drivers 197.13 on XP SP3.
And I use the lastest Minefield release at November 3rd.
Maybe the problem come from the graphical acceleration. I don't know if it's possible to disable it in order to test.
