After Google toolbar is installed, every time you uninstall an extension an restart Firefox, the "Welcome to the Google Toolbar" window pops up, asking you if you want to view the privacy policy, enable enhanced features, etc. When I ran Firefox in Safe Mode, this wasn't a problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the Google toolbar (http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/toolbar/index.html)
2. Restart Firefox. When you do, you should see the window I was talking about. Click whatever you want.
3. Uninstall an extension of your choice, EXCEPT the Google toolbar.
4. Restart Firefox. The same window should appear

Actual Results:  
The same thing I stated in the problem.

Expected Results:  
Just restarted and gone to the homepage, without showing the window.
