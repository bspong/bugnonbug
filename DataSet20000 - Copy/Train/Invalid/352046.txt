I have created several quick access links on the Bookmark toolbar. But when I click on them, they open in a split wdindow, showing the original webpage (Google) as well as the new web page. How can I get the browser to open the new page in full screen?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on any quick-access link to a web page
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
New web page opens in a vertically split window, with the original web page on the right and the new web page on the left.

Expected Results:  
I want the new web page to open fully (full screen).

I looked through all the possible places I could think of to see if I could select the "full screen" option, but could not find it anywhere.
