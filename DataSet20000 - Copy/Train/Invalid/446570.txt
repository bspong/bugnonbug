while loading a page a message states that  I have to install  Java Plug-in 1.6 (already installed)

It's a error impossible for you to replicate: I'm a lawyer in Portugal and the website (https://citius.tribunaisnet.mj.pt/habilus/myhabilus) used to send cases to the court via Internet (after logging in) displays a message stating that I have to install Java Plug in 1.6- wich is already installed. Running FF 3 in safe mode allows the site to load the file transfer plug-in and to upload files to the court servers. Previous FF 2.XX versions did not have this problem, allowing to normally load the applet without need to run in safe mode.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load https://citius.tribunaisnet.mj.pt/habilus/myhabilus/login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fhabilus%2fmyhabilus%2fMenuEntElectr.aspx
2.type user name and password (wich I cannot provide)
3.try to send an attachment via the Java applet
Actual Results:  
a messagem stating that I need to install Java plugin 1.6 apears in the window were the file transfer java applet should appear. If runing FF 3 in safe mode, the applet loads noramlly, allowing file transfer.

Expected Results:  
the file transferinf java applet should load, allowing the selection of files to upload to the court's server.

older 2.xxx firefox browsers allow the page and applet no load without a glitch. FF 3 safe mode also allows the applet to load
