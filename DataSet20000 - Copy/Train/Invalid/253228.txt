Switching tabs does not always switch focus

I can't believe nobody's reported this, but I've had a long search through the
bugs and can't find it.

When you switch tabs, either by clicking on a different tab or pressing
control+PageUp/PageDown or control+tab/control+shift+tab, the input focus
remains with the last open tab, meaning that if you want to use the keyboard to
(e.g.) scroll through the page displayed, you must first click on the firefox
window to focus the current tab.

In fact, you can continue filling out form elements in the old tab.  I'm writing
this paragraph while looking at an entirely different web site.

But, this doesn't _always_ happen -- for instance, whenever I switch back to the
tab I have this form open in, it always sets the focus correctly.  In fact, of
the tabs I have open, all but one of them is now working correctly, although
when I started writing this bug only this one was, so the problem seems transient.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open two different sites in two tabs.  Pages without form fields seem to be
the worst.
2.  Switch between tabs using the keyboard interface
3.  Use the up & down keys to try to scroll the window

Actual Results:  
The content of the tab that was open before step 2 scrolls

Expected Results:  
The content of the tab open after step 2 should scroll
