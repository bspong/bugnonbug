Navigation Toolbar reverts to default with non-relative profiles
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050908 Firefox/1.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050908 Firefox/1.4

I created a profile in Firefox 1.5 B1 and moved it to another directory on my
drive.  I checked to make sure there were no hard references anywhere in the
profile.  To be sure I deleted the localstore.rdf and XUL.mfl files.

I loaded up Firefox 1.5 B1 and everything appeared to be working until I tried
to modify the Navigation Toolbar.  Any changes will stick in the current browser
window, but opening another window or closing and reopening the browser results
in the Navigation Toolbar returning to its default state.  You can even end up
with multiple location drop down boxes if you move the location drop down box to
another toolbar and open a new browser window.

When I moved the profile back to the default Profiles directory and changed the
profile.ini back to a relative profile, then the Navigation toolbar displayed 
as I set it up.  This means that the localstore.rdf file is being set correctly,
but for some reason it is being ignored when read in on a non-relative profile.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create new profile and move it out of the default location
2. Modify the profiles.ini file to point to the new location and change the
IsRelative line to "0"
3. Open browser with that profile and attempt to modify Navigation toolbar.


Actual Results:  
Navigation toolbar reverts to default state even though localstore.rdf file was
changed.

Expected Results:  
Navigation toolbar should display as set.
