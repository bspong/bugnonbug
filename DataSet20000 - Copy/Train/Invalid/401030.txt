I closed Firefox with three tabs, and then opened it again. Firefox showed three tabs that were titled "Loading...", but I waited a few minutes and they never loaded. When I went to History > Restore from last session, I got the error "Unable to read from file, this is unrecoverable."

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open three tabs.
2. X out Firefox.
3. Open Firefox.
Actual Results:  
Firefox showed three tabs that said "Loading..."

Expected Results:  
Firefox should restore my tabs.
