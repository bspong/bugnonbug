I w asatchedthe automatic update to Firefox 3.0.6 took place; immediately after the update, the browser returns "Failed to connect  Firefox can't establish a connection to the server..."  To add insult to injury, Internet Explorer and Opera are now inflicted with the same problem.  None of my browsers can connect.  However, non-browser programs such as Skype, Echolink, Ham Radio Deluxe connect without problems.  Using Windows Xp firewall and AVG anti-virus basic (no firewall).  Where should I start to look???  What did you do????

Reproducible: Always
