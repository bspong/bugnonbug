Yahoo tool bar keeps saying:
Loading toolbar options...
but options are never opened.  I mostly miss the Mail option, but no options appear at all.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox browser
2.Look at Yahoo toolbar
3.
Actual Results:  
No toolbar options ever show up

Expected Results:  
It should have shown Toolbar options like:
Bookmarks   Settings   Finance   Mail   My Yahoo!   Answers   Games

The problem started occurring after a recent Firefox update, probably some time between Dec. 1-6, 2008.  I Googled "loading toolbar problems" and it seems this bug has occurred from time to time over the years with Firefox updates (there was a posting back in 2004).
