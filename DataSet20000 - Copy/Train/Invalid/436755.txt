This did NOT happen in FF2 or FF3b5. Whenever one moves forward or backwards in the history the scroll (only experienced vertical, haven't tried horizontal) position is reset at 0.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit any site
2. Scroll
3. Jump one back in history and then forward again
Actual Results:  
Whenever one moves forward or backwards in the history the scroll (only experienced vertical, haven't tried horizontal) position is reset at 0.

Expected Results:  
It should preserve the position just as it did before!
