I am getting popups. But I have my settings in Firefox set to "Block Popup Windows".
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

This just started happening about 3 days ago. Firefox and Mozilla have always
kept popups away..until now. Suddenly I get a dozen a day. Ads mostly. Has
someone figured out a way to defeat your popup stopper?
