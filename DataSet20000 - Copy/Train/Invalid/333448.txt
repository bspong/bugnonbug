I am developing a web application that uploads images to a server via the new Flash upload components in Flash 8 in conjunction with a PHP
back-end, inserts the image name and description into a MySQL database,
and then resizes and stores the resized images for screen resolution
via the GD imaging library.

The entire application works fine in IE but there is a flaw in Firefox.
The PHP pages that rename and insert the image name data into the MySQL
database cannot seem to access the session variables unless the page is directly viewed; just what I am trying to avoid by having a back-end.  These pages are
pure PHP they have no HTML so they should not be subject to browser
compatibility problems.  Moreover, I am not using cookies for my session.

The actual structure of the app is as follows:

SWF uploader (Using the deconcept embed and passing the following page
filenames and locations to the SWF.)

1. PHP back-end uploader -- Once the file is uploaded the filename and
description are inserted into a php SESSION variable.
2. PHP MySQL inserter -- Inserts the SESSION data into the MySQL
database
3. PHP image processor -- Resizes the stored full resolution image to
create and store a low-resolution thumbnail and a screen-optimized, 640
X 480, image.

In my debugging I have noticed that the PHP back-end uploader will
in-fact upload the file, however, it will not append some crucial
session data to the file name, namely MM_Username.  Moreover, it will
indeed write the filename data to the session variable, however, it
will not insert the session data into the MySQL database.  Furthermore,
it will access the PHP page that resizes and processes.

Once again, the whole combination works perfectly fine in IE.  At first
I thought it was a problem with the firefox and the deconcept embed,
but the SWF is certainly getting the data from the embed as it
successfully uploads the files and processes them, it just doesn't
insert them into the MySQL database?

The code for the PHP-backend uploader is as follows:

[CODE]

<?php require_once('Connections/siteData.php'); ?>
<?php
if (!isset($_SESSION)) {
  session_start();

}

?>
<?php
//path to storage
$storage = 'images';

//path name of file for storage
$uploadfile = "$storage/". basename(
$_SESSION['MM_Username']."_".$_FILES['Filedata']['name'] );

//if the file is moved successfully
if ( move_uploaded_file( $_FILES['Filedata']['tmp_name'] , $uploadfile
) ) {
 //populated session array to be passed to SQL
 $_SESSION['upFile'][] = basename(
$_SESSION['MM_Username']."_".$_FILES['Filedata']['name'] );
 echo( '1 ' . $_FILES['Filedata']['name']);

//file failed to move

}else{
 echo( '0');
}

?>

[/CODE]

The code for the MySQL inserter:

[CODE]

<?php require_once('Connections/siteData.php'); ?>
<?php
if (!isset($_SESSION)) {
  session_start();

}

?>
<?php
// galleryInsert Recordset
mysql_select_db($database_siteData, $siteData);
$query_galleryInsert = "SELECT * FROM gallery";
$galleryInsert = mysql_query($query_galleryInsert, $siteData) or
die(mysql_error());
$row_galleryInsert = mysql_fetch_assoc($galleryInsert);
$totalRows_galleryInsert = mysql_num_rows($galleryInsert);
?>
<?php
// Instantiate Date Variable
$date = date ( 'D M j' );

// Populate fileArray with uploaded files values
$fileArray = $_SESSION['upFile'];

// Insert image data SQL
foreach($fileArray as $key => $value) {
 $caption = '<A href=\"images/'.$value.'\"
target=\"_blank\"><U>'.($_GET['upname']).'</U></A>';
 $ins_str = "INSERT INTO gallery VALUES
(NULL,'".$value."','".($_GET['upname'])."',
'".$_SESSION['MM_Username']."','".$date."','".$caption."', -1,
0,'".$_SESSION['sessionID']."', 0, 0)";
 if (!mysql_query ($ins_str)) {
  $r_string = '&errorcode=3&msg='.$msg;
 } else {
  // pass back id of inserted record
  $r_string = '&errorcode=0&id='.$id.'&';
 }

}

// Destroy $_SESSION['upFile'] array
unset($_SESSION['upFile']);
?>
<?php
mysql_free_result($galleryInsert);
?>

[/CODE]

In regard to the session, it is valid.  If I run "print
$_SESSION['MM_Username'];" it outputs the correct username.

In case you are wondering, I use multiple <?php ?> tags in each page in order to more effeciantly structure the PHP for my editor, Dreamweaver 8.  As far as functionality goes, someone preveoiusly raised that as a concern so I changed all of the pages to a single <?php ?> tag per page.  However, this had no effect on the functionality within FireFox.

Thanks.
