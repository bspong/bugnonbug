Site's SSL is revoked.  Error Code: sec_error_revoked_certificate
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080409 Camino/1.6 (like Firefox/2.0.0.14)

So far all beta versions of Firefox 3 (including the most recent nightly build) revoke the SSL cert at onlinewellnessassociation.com.  The SSL works fine in older versions of FF as well as IE6 through IE8 (although the same issue does seem to happen with Opera).  The cert is through GoDaddy.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to https://www.onlinewellnessassociation.com
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Site's Certificate is revoked.  Page does not load.

Expected Results:  
Site's Certificate should be accepted.  Page should load.

It looks like this is related to OCSP and perhaps bug 110161.  View forum thread I started re this: http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=652485
