Ok i just installed the resent firefox update (2.0.0.13) yesterday evening and then for some reason it removed my internet browser functions completely. I can use programs that need the internet to run such as limewire, but firefox and IE comes up to an error screen no matter what url i put it. I at first was thinking maybe it might of been something clashing with the drivers for my eithernet card so i reinstalled that and yet the same error so i tried to reinstall my dsl modem and same error.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just opening IE or FF
Actual Results:  
I get an invalid url screen
