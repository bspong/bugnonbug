Impossible to add live bookmark for feeds with wrong mime type and XSLT-styled feeds

Starting from the landing of bug 303848, adding a live bookmark is almost
impossible for some sites.

STR:
1. open http://www.haayal.co.il/
2. Click on the feed icon (in the url bar)

-> a download dialog.

I'm assuming it returns the wrong mimetype (I haven't checked). Still, we didn't
have this issue with the old live bookmark UI.
