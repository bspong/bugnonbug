Browser window looses edges when dropping a tab if the window is in fullscreen mode [tab animation]
Build ID

Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox on a clean profile and have only one tab available
2. Maximize the browser window and grab and drag the tab out of the tab strip
3. Without dropping the tab hit the F11 key to go fullscreen
4. When the animation to go fullscreen is visible, release the tab

Expected results:
In step 4 the fullscreen browser window with on tab should be visible

Actual results:
In step 4 the browser windows looses it's edges and only the content is displayed.

*Notes:
