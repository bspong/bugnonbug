I just downloaded Firefox 3. I had IE. Flash Player wd not run so I did everything required. I uninstalled it. Downloaded the version for Firefox. The download manager says I successfully downloaded it but I cannot find it. It is not running (not installed even?). this is driving me crazy. I like to see videos (You Tube, Facebook, news stories).  Is there a solution?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Uninstall
2.  Download
3. Where is it?
Actual Results:  
Nothing!  It is not to be found.  I have gone to My Computer, trying to find it.  I cannot find it.

Expected Results:  
Downloaded AND installed Flash Player.

I would love some help with this, please.
