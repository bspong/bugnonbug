When pasting multiline input into a textbox, newlines are converted to spaces such that multiline input becomes one line

Prior to FF3, pasting multiline input into a textbox would paste only the first line & the rest would be silently dropped. While the change may be useful for some use cases (<kbrosnan> i think that was changed to deal with stuff like pasting addresses into a maping service) it is not for others, and certainly is not consistent behaviour, which should be a major goal. Please change this back, or offer an preference for those preferring one method of dealing with this over another (yes, I know preferences are a pain, that's why you should just change it back :D )

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Copy multiple lines of text from any source
2. Paste said input into a textbox
Actual Results:  
Notice that all the lines are strung together with spaces replacing newlines such that your previously-multiline input is now only one horrid horrid line.

Expected Results:  
As in previous versions of Firefox, only the first line of text should be pasted & the rest silently dropped.
