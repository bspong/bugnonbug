Application hangs seemingly at random. Sometimes when clicking link, sometimes when scrolling, sometimes when loading page, sometimes when typing in a forum. Has crashed when loading external pages and also internal ones (e.g. router). No pattern. Sometimes crashes 2X in 2 minutes, other times OK for an hour or two, rarely longer. Without question this is due to the new version (I was on 1.5 before) as it started 30 minutes after I'd downloaded it and I've never had this before. PC itself is very stable with no event log errors apart from these and no resident viruses or malware etc. Fully patched, XP SP 2, 2x4400 CPU, 4Gb RAM.

Event Log: Hanging application firefox.exe, version 1.8.20061.1023, hang module hungapp, version 0.0.0.0, hang address 0x00000000.
