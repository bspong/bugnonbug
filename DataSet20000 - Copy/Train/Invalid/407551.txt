When I hover my mouse over a Table Row with a title, it's supposed to popup a little white box that shows the title attribute. This stopped happening with Firefox 3. The link I provided is just an example, though it happens anywhere.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Hover mouse over a thread subject
2. A little white box pops up
Actual Results:  
The box is empty

Expected Results:  
The box has the title of the <td> in it. This this case it would be the first few lines of the thread's content

This does not happen on my Mac's Firefox 3.
