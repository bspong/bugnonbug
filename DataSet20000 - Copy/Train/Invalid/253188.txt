Back and Forward button drop-down menus cause WinStripe theme to jump
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.8

I am running Firefox 0.9.2 (even though the build identifier mentions Firefox 0.8).

I customized the toolbars in my install by moving each element of the navigation
toolbar up to the right of the program menus (back, forward, refresh, stop and
home buttons). The address bar is then positioned to the right of the five
buttons. I am showing the icons only (no text), and using small icons. The
Navigation toolbar itself has been hidden, as has the bookmarks toolbar.

When I click the drop-down arrow for both the forward and back buttons, the
bottom of the toolbar shifts down slightly (one or two pixels). Both buttons
also shift slightly to the right when the drop-down menu appears. Closing the
menu causes the bottom of the toolbar to shift back up to its original position,
and the buttons shift back to the left.

Reproducible: Didn't try
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move each element of the navigation toolbar to the right of the program menus.
2. Hide the navigation toolbar.
3. Open the drop down menus on either the back or forward buttons.
