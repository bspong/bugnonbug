Unable to log in to Xythos web interface - No OK button

The OK button does not appear in the Xythos login interface. Consequently the user cannot log in. Typing one's password plus <Enter> does not work either. It seems like the code for the OK button and its function are not loading in the Firefox 4 Beta. The page functions correctly in Firefox 3, IE9 and Chrome.

Reproducible: Always
