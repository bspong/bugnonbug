Random silent crashes after running Firefox for a few hours

Starting a week or so ago, Firefox began a nasty habit of crashing when I leave it running with 10 or 15 tabs for more than a few hours. Worse, though Windows sometimes picks it up and offers to submit a crash report, the built-in Crash Reporter never runs. Apparently an unhandled exception or something? Of course, the next time I start Firefox, it offers to restore my session, and I always do, and then it goes a few more hours and crashes again (or I close it preemptively).

I suspect an addon, but I've disabled all the ones I think might cause it, unless some recent update has done this.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a lot of tabs (this step may be optional)
2. Wait two to six hours
Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes, silently or with only the standard Windows crash report (e.g. Mozilla Crash Reporter doesn't show up or notice).

Expected Results:  
Stayed running.

Several DLLs seem implicated, but I'm not sure any of them is really the cause.

From Windows crash reports:
NPSWF32.dll (v9.0.124.0)
MOZCRT19.dll (v8.0.0.0) (twice)
