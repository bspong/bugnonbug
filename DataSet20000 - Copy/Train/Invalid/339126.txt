infected with virus/trojan while browsing with firefox

In the hope of safer browsing, I was visiting as an example, some sites returned by Google. I was also running a trial ver. F-Prot antivirus, including it's real-time protector. 

Firefox ain't so safe as it seems, or they found some ways to specifically exploit it. Even though I'm using the latest. Or the exploit works by fooling the fox and calling up some IE routing which is then penetrated fully. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to Google. search for "crack". 
2.visit the first 10 results. maybe browse a little in them, do a search ...
3.

Actual Results:  
I can't be very sure, because I am not eager to repeat the process. 
I got infected with 2 known virus/trojan, detected and stopped by F-Prot, and also got infected with 3 others that were not detected by it and got them stuck in the registry startup, had to reboot in dos mode, scan with antivirus (deleted a few infections) and delete some of the files it didn't find and clean up the registry. 

This win98 is fresh install, so i'm sure it was infected just now. 
 


I suspect either Firefox has some security hole that these scripts exploited, or it could be fooled into launching, without asking, IE, which then in turn was like swiss cheese. 

Sorry I can't provide more info, but I am not eager to get infected again, and maybe be unable to contain it next time. 

I'll submit the files that got onto my hdd (those that were left after the antivirus found and deleted some)
