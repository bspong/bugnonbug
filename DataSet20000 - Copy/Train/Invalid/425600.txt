Selecting a word document (e.g. Legacy Act Fact sheet on page at http://www.greatlakes.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?pid=336&srcid=335) does not launch Word automatically. Instead, Firefox loses the extension of the file and states it is a "application/octet-stream" and prompts for the application to use to open the file.

Using Internet Explorer instead of Firefox and the document opens the file using  Word automatically.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.greatlakes.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?pid=336&srcid=335
2. Click on Legacy Act Fact Sheet on right side.
3.
Actual Results:  
Firefox loses the extension of the file and states it is a "application/octet-stream" and prompts for the application to use to open the file.

Expected Results:  
File should open Word automatically
