Cannot open any dialog from Options -> General
Mozilla/5.0 (OS/2; U; Warp 4.5; en-US; rv:1.8.1b1) Gecko/20060805 BonEcho/2.0b1

When trying to open any dialog from the "XXX..." buttons on the General pane of the Options dialog, this does not work. In a debug build I get 

   JavaScript error: chrome://browser/content/preferences/general.js,
      line 134: invalid property id
   ReferenceError: gGeneralPane is not defined

This is because OS/2 does not define HAVE_SHELL_SERVICE and that means that there are two commas before chooseFeedReader() in general.js.
