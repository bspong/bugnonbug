First run migrator disregards normal notion of Cancel
Cancel at this point means "no, don't start Firefox", not "don't migrate
anything, but start with a clean profile". If you want, as I'm sure you do, an
option for a clean profile add a button for that instead of changing the meaning
of Cancel. (Some text explaining what the heck it's doing wouldn't /hurt/ either...)
