Middle clicking on the text links on that page will open them in a new tab while middle-clicking on the images will open them over the current page, which gets darkened (like Mozilla Addons does).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Middle click on the before or after images.
Actual Results:  
Image opens over the current page.

Expected Results:  
Image opens in a new tab.

This only happens on middle-click and not on right-click->Open in New Tab, and doesn't happen on similar sites, like Mozilla Addons.
