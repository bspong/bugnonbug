Every time I start any version/build of Firefox 4.0 (release or beta) I receive a JavaScript Application error "TypeError: Components.Classes [TvtPwmComponent_CID] is undefined".  On the same machine I never received this error using Firefox 3x.  Clicking OK bypasses the dialog box and allows Firefox to open.  Once opened it appears to work properly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run Firefox 4.x
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Same as Details window description above.

Expected Results:  
s/w should run without returning a JavaScript Application error.
