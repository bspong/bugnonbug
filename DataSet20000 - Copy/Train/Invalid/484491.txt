While attempting to print shipping label, got this notice from Firefox:

/Users/dwain/Desktop/com.usps.cns.web.pdf-2.LabelGenerationServlet could not be opened, because an unknown error occurred.

Safari Version 3.2.1 (5525.27.1) successfully printed the pdf.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an account at usps.com 
2. Create a shipment using the online usps.com website
3. On Print Shipping Labels page, select "Print Sample Label" or "Print and Pay"
4. Observe the appearance of the warning notice
Actual Results:  
Repeated attempts to print the label led to same results. I finally switched to Safari to print successfully.

Expected Results:  
Bring up Adobe Reader's print dialogue

I've also experienced frequent firefox crashes while attempting to print shipping labels at fedex.com using their online shipping manager tool. Safari printed the documents successfully. This implies the problem is with firefox, not with usps.com or fedex.com web design.

The inability to rely on firefox is resulting in using safari for important shipping activity. Major headache, time waster and bummer.
