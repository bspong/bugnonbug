Running the Remember The Milk (RTM) module on the netvibes home page. When I go to the netvibes page, the RTM module does not display correctly. Becuase it is a calendar, this makes it unusable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to netvibes.com and register.
2. Go to rememberthemilk.com and register.
3. Go to "services" then to "netvibes module". You must be logged in to netvibes for this step.
4. Add the module to netvibes.
5. Add three days worth of events to the RTM module.
6. Observe how the weird border of the module makes it unusable.
Actual Results:  
the weird border of the module makes it unusable.

Expected Results:  
Clean border shows full week of events. Safari browser displays normally. Chrome and Opera also fail to display correctly.
