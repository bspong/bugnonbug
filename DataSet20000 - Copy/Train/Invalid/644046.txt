about:buildconfig tag incorrect for FF 4.0 (final release)
Build config source tag links to http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-2.0/rev/6be9e31d01b4 which is a bug relating to "further change to handling of bad certificates"

To reproduce - install FF 4.0 (final release), go to about:buildconfig
Under the source heading, click on the "built from" link
It takes to a fix for certificates, it should probably take you somewhere else ..?
