Ask me to add or set defult user i did and my bookmarks disappear. I can't use this sofeware if your upgrades make my bookmarks disappear. and how come you guys don't have any phones people can call you on to complain! too hi tech for ya?

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1.turn on Mozillia
2.new pop up asking to assign a use (present user is default)
3.hit ok page appears like I'm a new customer and my old bookmarks are gone!
Actual Results:  
The best way to reproduce the problem would be to follow your instructions! there was no need for a pop up telling me to do something different than before ! it was fine before! 

Expected Results:  
It gave me a new Mozilla clean and fresh without my bookmarks which I would have preferred to keep over a new mozilla

NOTHING...NOT A THING! it was fine the way it was but your guys are always looking for a new and improved angle to hustle something I don't want and did not request!
