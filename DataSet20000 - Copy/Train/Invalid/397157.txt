Recent update disables another program on my computer

I have replicated this problem several times by uninstalling and reinstalling both Firefox and the other program. The program is a parental monitoring program called Spector version 3.1. It works fine under the older versions of Firefox, but the update released on approximately 20Sep2007 disables the software. Reinstalling the software enables it to function properly until the first time a Firefox window is opened.

Actual Results:  
Tired of playing with it. I'm unstalling recent upgrade and reverting to the only version I have backed up at home (Firefox 2.0.0.4).


I paid $99.00 for this monitoring software. I'm not willing not lose it's functionality to use Mozilla. If I can't make it work with the most recent version I will stay with the old version or (heaven forbid) go back to another browser.
