Google freezes when search result link is selected (Skype add-on)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When using Google and I select a search result the browser goes on and on without opening the selected link. If I copy/paste the URL from the Google page into the address bar, it functions correctly.

If I disable the Skype add-on, the problem does not occur any longer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enable Skype add-on
2.Search Google
3.Click Google search result link
Actual Results:  
Google appears to start loading the selected page but goes on endlessly w/o loading the page.

Expected Results:  
Browser opens selected page

I have disabled the Skype add-on, problem goes away. This is a FYI, I have solved my problem as I really do not want or need the Skype add-on in my browser.
