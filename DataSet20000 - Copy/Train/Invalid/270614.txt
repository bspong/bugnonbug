Ctrl-w does not currently close properties windows. This is especially bad as
they don't have special close button and can only be closed using system UI
(window manager decorations).

Ctrl-w should really close any UI window, but properties are especially hard to
close without this shortcut for people that tend to work without titlebars.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right click on a hyperlink.
2. Select "Properties"
3. Try to close the window without clicking on window manager buttons.
