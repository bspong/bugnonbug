Windows 7 has many new improvements regarding the taskbar. I suggest the following two improvements:

Internet Explorer 8 allows previews of each tab in the preview thumbnails. Firefox should also support this.

The taskbar has the capability of showing a progress bar. This could definitely be used with the downloads manager.

Reproducible: Always
