Multiple inline-block elements render with false right and bottom margins even though padding and margins have been set to 0px. The right margin can be removed by coding the elements all on the same line, however the vertical margin always show.
eg. <div style="display: inline-block ... "></div><div></div>

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Simply view the sample for right margins
2.Adjust the browser size so the elements become stacked to see the false bottom margin.


Expected Results:  
The elements should render with the sides touching and when stacked with the bottoms and tops touching.
