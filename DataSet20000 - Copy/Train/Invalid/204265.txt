I have the AdBlock and Nuke Images extensions installed. In recent builds (not
sure exactly when it happened), I've noticed that their entries are not always
showing up in the context menus when I right-click on images. I'm pretty sure
they're installed correctly as AdBlock still removes ads.  I have the 2003-3-20
build installed in a different folder and the context items for the extensions
show up just fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the Nuke Image or AdBlock extensions
2. Go to a webpage with graphics
3. Right click on a graphic

Actual Results:  
I don't see the context menu entries "Remove this image" or "AdBlock".

Expected Results:  
Show the context menu entries that the extensions enable.
