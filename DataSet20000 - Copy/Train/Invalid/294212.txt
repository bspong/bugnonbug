When a META refresh tag appears in the body of an HTML document, and points to a
URL containing an image, the image is loaded, even if "Load images" is unchecked
in Options.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:




In the instance in question with which I discovered this, a malicious user had
injected an META refresh tag as the body of an ad appearing on a freebie
giveaway site. Because the site was not properly filtering their input, the
browser was redirected to a picture of a donkey (Could have been worse ;-) ). In
trying to track down the cause of this behavior, I disabled "Load Images", but
to no avail. The redirect took place anyway, which is to be expected, but the
image should not have loaded.
