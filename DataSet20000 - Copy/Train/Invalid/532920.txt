32-bit Firefox build can't resolve hostnames on 64-bit Ubuntu
I'm not sure what's going on here, but when I run a 32-bit trunk Firefox on my 64-bit Ubuntu system I can't resolve any hostnames. I'm positive this used to work. It's possible I'm missing some 32-bit library, but the browser starts, so I wouldn't expect whatever it is to be fatal. I thought maybe it was the shell service, but if I take a 64-bit build and remove components/libmozgnome.so, I can still access the web.
