Certain elements in the flash movie do not display

In the page at http://www.voltaj.ro/ some elements inside the flash object do
not get displayed at all. 

In other browsers, the elements are displayed properly at the url above. 
In FireFox, while testing on the local network, the elements are displayed
properly. This happens only when the site is on the web. 

In the flash movie I load xml content serval times at once outputed by the same
file (constructor.php) located on the webserver.

After you go to http://www.voltaj.ro/ you will note in the status bar that the
browser keeps loading information and never finishes loading 

In addition, I've added a message in flash so that it gives out a javascript
alert box. By clicking the OK button inside the alert box serval times, the
flash movie missing elements get displayed one by one.

This problem puzzles me, because everything works on the local server but not on
the web.
