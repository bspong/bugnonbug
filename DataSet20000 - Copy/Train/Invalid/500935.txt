Dragging tabs to the scrapbook extension sidebar opens a new window at the address of the dragged tab instead of Scrapbook starting the capture of the page.

This is the same behaviour of previous releases of Firefox when dragging tabs to the bookmarks sidebar, see:

Dragging tab to bookmarks sidebar should bookmark not tear it (3.1b2)
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=468553

Drag to tear off tabs should allow dropping a tab on the bookmark toolbar  
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=465332

both fixed for bookmarks.

I tried various 3.1/3.5 releases; Scrapbook sidebar worked correctly up to 3.1beta1, from 3.1beta2 tabs dragged to the scrapbook sidebar opens in new window instead of being captured.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install latest Scrapbook extension, either Scrapbook (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/427) or Scrapbook+ (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/8186)

2. Open Scrapbook in the sidebar

3. Drag a tab to Scrapbook sidebar
Actual Results:  
A new window is opened at the address of the dragged tab

Expected Results:  
Scrapbook starts the capture of the page
