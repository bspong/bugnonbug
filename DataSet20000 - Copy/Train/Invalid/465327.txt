controller should be this.controller in SafeCache 0.9
i found this while randomly testing mxr's addons index on konigsberg (which is not for general use, contact me if you want to test it out).

108  switch(this.controller.getCookieBehavior()) {
122  SSC_dump(controller.getCookieBehavior()

mxr won't guarantee version information

http://mxr-test.konigsberg.mozilla.org/addons/source/1474/install.rdf?mark=9
shows it's version 0.9

note that i also don't guarantee url stability. eventually i believe that the urls will include the addon names in them.
