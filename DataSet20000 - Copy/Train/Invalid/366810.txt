no matter how low i set the remember pages option to, even if i uncheck the option so that it should not remember pages visited, it shows links in red.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.visit a page from a list of pages (click on a link)
2.close the browser
3.view the link again - it's still red, even if remember pages option is not selected.
Actual Results:  
links are still red.  i cannot get it to NOT remember links/pages visited.

Expected Results:  
links should be blue after the number of days selected or blue always if the option is not selected.

the software should have followed the choice made in options/history for remember pages for __ days.
