Places tree should not remove GROUP_BY_FOLDER in applyFilter()
applyFilter() removed the GROUP_BY_FOLDER query option, because it doesn't really make sense when searching, and the backend errors out with it set.  The problem is that after using applyFilter, there is no way to go back to the original state of the tree, short of seting the 'place' property again.

Ideally, the backend would not choke with it set (bug 369657), and applyFilter wouldn't need to strip out the option.
