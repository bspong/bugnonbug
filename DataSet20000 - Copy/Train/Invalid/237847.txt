after installing extensions, program locks at  "Tools > Options"

I downloaded and installed extensions.  After restarting Firefox found that the
program locked everytime I navigated in the menus to "Tools > Options".  I am
then forced to abort using the task manager.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  start Firefox
2.  navigate to "Tools > Options"
3.

Actual Results:  
Program Locks

Expected Results:  
Program shouldn't lock -- it should execute the "Options" routines

I admit that I acted like a real dummy -- I installed 8 extensions before I
closed the program and restarted and tested.  The extentions installed are:
Add Bookmark Here 	v0.3
Add Bookmark Here 	v0.3.1
Amico Desktop     	v0.3
Autohide  	  	v0.8.6.1
Blanklast 	  	v0.3
Bookmark Backup   	v0.2
Bookmark Links Checker  v0.5.1
Calendar for Windows	v20040109
