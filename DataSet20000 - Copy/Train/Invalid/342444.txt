Comments: I started the browser 30 minutes ago and already my memory usage has gone form 69K to 91K and counting up. Eventually PC starts to utilize virtual memory thrashing hard drive to compensate for increasing usage of memory by Firefox.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox
2. Just keep waiting and the memory moves up, with or without usage.
3. PC performance drops signifantly as memory is consumed and hard drive thrashes as virtural memory kicks in to compensate.
