caused a fatal error while rendering this experiment. It Turned windows to basic and flashed a few times crashing my graphic card driver and never came back from that state hanging windows until I forcibly held the shut down button.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to the site
2.click launch experiment
3.render it
Actual Results:  
all in the details

Expected Results:  
run it without hangs or glitches

Could have happened due to my configurations at "about:config" or my blacklisted x3100 graphic card. All the reason to run webgl as a separate process and so the tabs and components of firefox
