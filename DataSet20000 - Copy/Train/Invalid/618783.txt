When resuming a paused download, it says: Cannot read source file

For example i launched a download of more than 100 MB. I decided to pause the download. The download pauses but wheni try to resume immediately or after a while, a dialog box opens and says that C:\Documents and Settings\Bilal pc\Desktop\MX.vs.ATV.Reflex.Update.1-SKIDROW.part2.rar.part could not be saved, because the source file could not be read.
Try again later, or contact the server administrator

MY INTERNET CONNECTION WAS ON ALL THE WAY!
