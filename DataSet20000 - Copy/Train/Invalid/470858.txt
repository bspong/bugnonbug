after mozilla updated recently I now have a file missing that affects the bios..
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; Win64; x64; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; SLCC1; Media Center PC 5.0; .NET CLR 3.0.04506)

Recently Mozilla updated on my computer, it was causing the browser to crash. I tried to reboot my computer to see if that would clear things up. The computer screen remains black with only the words NTDL(might be wrong order of those letters)file missing press any key to start but the same message keeps repeating after you press a key. I found some information online using another computer that said the missing file has to do with the bios and the order the computer boots up. I need help with repairing the problem caused by the updated version of Mozilla. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.boot up computer
2.press any key
3.nothing
Actual Results:  
blank screen, no boot up at all

Expected Results:  
nothing changed
