Addon can block addons updates checking
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:8.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/8.0

Steps to reproduce:

Try to check for addons updates in Addons Manager


Actual results:

The message "The addons are updating" (or similar, I've the Catalan translation) is showed and never hides. No addons are updated.


Expected results:

Checking of addons updates must finish. If I disable the "Lab Kits 3" addon (or enter in safe mode) all goes fine. I think it's a Firebug bug. An addon problem can't block all the addons updates.
