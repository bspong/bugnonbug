I was unable to change any incorrectly spelled words in Gmail.  Gmail's spellcheck works, in as much as options for the misspelled words are provided, but a change can not be effected.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type text in to a message in gmail.
2.Assuming spelling mistakes, use the spellcheck.
3.Options will be displayed but will not be used to replace the incorrect spelling.
Actual Results:  
As above

Expected Results:  
Words spelled incorrectly should be changed according to users preference.
