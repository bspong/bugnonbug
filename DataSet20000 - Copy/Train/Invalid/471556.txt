I had Firefox on my PC @ home and it "disappeared". I uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox apparently successfully except that when I click on the file to open nothing happens. In addition to the fact that I prefer Firefox my son needs it to do math Homework as his site doesn't operate with Explorer. 
Please advise on how to proceed.
