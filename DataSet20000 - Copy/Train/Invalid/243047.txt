Firefox  fails to start after using custom installation on XP SP1
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

After installing Firefox 0.8 using custom installation to folder C:\Program
Files\Mozilla\Firefox choosing the option to include "Developer Tools" (the
"Additional Browsing Enhancements" option was greyed out and therefore
unavailable), Firefox failed to start both under the automatic start option at
the end of the install and independently even after a reboot. At the first
attempt (after each clean re-install) the folder "chrome" was created under
Phoenix\*** in "Documents and Settings". Chrome was empty. When I uninstalled
Firefox beween each installation attempt, I also deleted the "Phoenix" folder.
Allowing the installer to use the "Standard" install produced a working
installation at the first attempt.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run installer
2.Choose Custom setup option
3.Select/create installation folder C:\Program Files\Mozilla\Firefox
4.Choose additional components:- Developer Tools
5.Complete installation and leave "Start Firefox" ticked

Actual Results:  
Firefox fails to start and display browser window, but did create the "chrome"
folder.
Does not show up in "Windows Task Manager" as a running application.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have started up and displayed a browser window.
