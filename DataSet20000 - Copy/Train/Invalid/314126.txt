when opening Firefox, I always get a Quicktime icon with a question mark inside,which indicates it is broken, when it is not.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7

I have the latest version of FireFox and Quicktime installed. Quicktime v.7.0 works just fine on my computer. Firefox v 1.0.7 works just fine on my system, a Dell Inspiron 8200 with 1G RAM. WinXP Home, Nvidia 64MB 440 Go (latest drivers), PCMCIA Dell 802.11g LAN card, Comcast broadband connection. 

Most of the time when I open the URL I use as my home page (MSNBC.com) with Firefox, the two ads just under the MSNBC top of the page blink on and off until the page fully loads. Then, on every page I subsequently open, somewhere on the page a Quicktime icon with a question mark appears. I notice when I use the IE browser I keep for backup, this doesn't occur. 

I don't know how to fix this and I don't know why it is happening. Can you explain this to me and help me get rid of this problem? Is there anything more I can tell you that I have not so far?

Many thanks, and much obliged,

Actual Results:  
I have not been able to artificially reproduce this "always happening" occurence because I am not that proffecient.


There doesn't appear to be any functional loss as a result. I am totally stymied as to why this is happening. This has only started happening since I successfully installed the latest version of Quicktime (Version 7)a few weeks ago. I have never had any problems with FireFox working on my Dell Inspiron 8200 laptop.
