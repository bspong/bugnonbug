Negotiate auth performed while using private mode browsing

While debugging a problem with a single-sign-on system I switched to private mode to test a case when no cookie is present and without kerberos negotiate auth, but negotiate auth still sent the credentials. This isn't a very common scenario, but I still think in private browsing mode negotiate auth should not sent credentials.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a webpage the browser is configured to perform auth via negotiate auth to see if it is generally working
2. Switch on private mode
3. Go to the same webpage, is still working but shouldn't


Expected Results:  
Authenticated with negotiate auth

No authentication credentials should be sent
