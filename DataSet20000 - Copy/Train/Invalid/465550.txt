Googlebar Lite 4.6.8 search histories missing under Firefox 3.0.4

When FF updates to version 3.0.4, most of my Googlebar Lite search histories disappear.  In addition, new searches are not stored in the 4.6.8 pull down menu.  The stored history in Firefox is not affected.

When I reinstall FF 3.0.3 - all of the missing Googlebar Lite are restored and new searches are also saved.

It appears that this is a bug in FF 3.0.4.
