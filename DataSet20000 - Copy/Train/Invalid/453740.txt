Firefox trips windows vista performance logger warning as 'using too much memory' even when only one tab is open
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1

After starting Firefox, With previous session restore on, Firefox memory usage is consistantly pushing the 80mb mark with 3+tabs open.
Currently running 9 tabs at a memory cost of 103,560k (Private working set)
Have logs of this occuring from windows Vista performance logs. Memory usage spikes during downloads (no browsing) and during browsing (heavily switching tabs)

Excessive memory usage leads to eventual crashing if firefox is left open across many sessions (I use hibernate rather than shutting down and losing open tabs)



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Open 3+ tabs, for maximum effect, run about 10 tabs
3.Check memory usage in WTM (Windows Task Manager)
Actual Results:  
Decribed above, Program is using too much memory

Expected Results:  
Memory usage should not exceed 100,000kb.
