Do not want Mozilla Firefox as default browser.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

I accidentally replied yes to the question about making Mozilla Firefox my default browser. There is no option to change this under Tools/Options/General. I have an extremely important and personal reason for not wanting Firefox as my default browser. Could you please make an option to change back to your previous default browser? If there is a way to fix this problem already in existence, would you please email me with instructions on how to do this. My email address is life2share@comcast.net. I would really appreciate help with this matter. I unloaded Firefox and restarted my computer. I then re-downloaded the browser software and for some reason Firefox remembered what was previously downloaded. There is no option to fix this. Can you please help me?

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
There should be an option to change back to a different/previous default browser.

I believe I have included all information above.
