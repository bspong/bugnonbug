DOM xmlns call-template missing attributes

This is rather difficult to explain, but it feels like firefox fails to add _any_ attributes to tags built in a <xsl:call-template/> call iff there is an xmlns present in the html tag...

I have provided two examples.  Sorry in advance if I'm simply failing to understand something.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the URL above and try both with_bugs and sans_bugs
2. The .xml files contain no real thrills, but simply invoke some .xsl
3. The only difference between the .xsl documents (besides colors and text) is the  xmlns attribute on the html of the buggy .xsl ...

Actual Results:  
Any tags built in the call-template context will have NO attributes desipte using xsl:attribute or building the attributes by hand.  The javascript divtag.id.match(/something/) will fail stating the node has no attributes!

Expected Results:  
The tags should have attributes.  The javascript divtag.id.match(/something/) shouldn't generate a js error even if you fail to set the tag id.
