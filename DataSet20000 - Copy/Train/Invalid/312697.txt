Momentary freeze switching or closing tabs

Since FF v1.0.5 I have encountered lots of momentary freezes while switching
between tabs.  I normally have anywhere from 2 to 16 tabs open in one window,
usually with just html text (no java or other superfluous webapp).  After the
window has been open for an hour or so of active surfing, I'll notice a
momentary freeze (usually about 10-15 seconds) before my command is obeyed
(command = Ctrl+PgUp or Ctrl+w).  I notice it after I've been reading a page for
a while.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open multiple tabs (anything more than 4 should do the trick)
	*I should note that the pages I surf tend force me to scroll just a bit.
2. "Study" one of those tabs for a while (5 mins? 10 mins?).  Scrolling is okay.
3. Somehow lose focus of that tab (close or switch).  I do it by keyboard,
Ctrl+PgUp or Ctrl+w.
Actual Results:  
Firefox freezes momentarily, on the order of 10 to 15 seconds.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should respond immediately.

This bug might possibly be related to one of these:

303854 ("freeze if I close a tab just before favicon appears")
308220 ("can't close window/tab with "command+w" or with the "x" on tab when
going to a site that is blocked using adblock with the site blocking option set")
296505 ("cannot close tabs after browsing Xforms pages")
