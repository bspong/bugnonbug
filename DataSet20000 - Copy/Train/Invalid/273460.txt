the Mozilla Firefox browser ignores text fonts from CSS files
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

on all pages in www.twsjewellery the text on the top right and left side are
formatted from a CSS file. I have tried on several ocassions to acces this page
from the Firefox browser but it dosen't format the text according to the CCS
instructions, it leaves it unformatted. I tried duplicateing the problem in IE6
but it worked fine. since I dicided 1 month ago to support Mozilla and not use
IE6 I thought it might be usefull for you to know about this problem so you can
make sure it dosen't happen in other sites. I came across another problem in
yahoo chat. Firefox dosent load the voice in the chat rooms which is sad for me
as i enjoy using voice in these rooms and I try to avoid using IE as a symbol of
support for Mozilla! I appriciate the time you took to read this and for all the
good work you guys do! please send me feedback about these problems if you can.
Thanks
