The native GTK+ file open dialog is horribly slow.  It takes tens of seconds to navigate into a directory with many files.  The only way to make Firefox usable is to set ui.allow_platform_file_picker to false.

I recommend:

1) Setting ui.allow_platform_file_picker to false for 3.0-release (at least on Linux)

2) Filing a bug with the GTK+ maintainers to fix their stupid file browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Choose "File : Open"
2. Navigate to a directory with lots of files (/usr/bin, for example)
3. Sit and wait.  And wait.  And make coffee.  And wait some more.
Actual Results:  
Slowness

Expected Results:  
Quick opening of directory
