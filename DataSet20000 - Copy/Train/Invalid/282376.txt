When I accidentally clicked on "Latest Headlines" with my mouse wheel, ALL of
them opened, in new tabs.  But if I am looking at 2 sites in 2 tabs, for
example, the first 2 headlines will take over those tabs clearing what I was
looking at.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Hover over "Latest Headlines"
3.Click the mouse wheel (push it down)

Actual Results:  
All the "Latest Headlines" loaded, and the first number depending on how many
tabs I had open loaded into those tabs, clearing the page I was originally
looking at.  The other headlines all loaded into new tabs, so I saw
approximately 30 new tabs all downloading pages at once, which slowed my
connection down a little bit and it was irritating to have to close them all.

Expected Results:  
The mouse wheel clicking should not have loaded all of the headlines.  Only the
left and right mouse buttons should activate that menu.
