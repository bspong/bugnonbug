Firefox 3.6 unresponsive and unusable after leaving open and running java for long periods caused by yahoo toolbar with message "A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding..."
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7

I have searched the bugs already listed and there are some similarities but not anything that appears the same as what I see in 3.6.

Loading and using it is fine as start up. I use primarily Yahoo Mail and Facebook  applications/games which are all fairly java heavy.

The issues occur when I leave the browser running for any length of time, it will throw a script unresposive message and then the rainbow busy cursor starts and I then have to force quit Firefox.

I have reverted to 3.5 which does not exhibit these issues.

I am just a user so any additonal information I need to provide, plesase let me know?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start browser
2.Go into Facebook, start Mousehunt, click to invoke a hunt, (java script?), leave browser running for 2 to 4 hours. (page refresh happens regularly) Get script error.
3.Firefox unresponsive and unrecoverable after waiting long period after either clicking both options (Continue or stop)
Actual Results:  
Starting browser again it is responsive and works but seems slower (Page loads etc) than intial start after booting iMac.

Expected Results:  
A usable browser, having to continually force quit and restart is unacceptable, this makes 3.6 unusable for me.
