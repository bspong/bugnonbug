Alert: 421 There are too many connections from your internet address.

When visiting the cited URL, an alert containing the summary text 
pops up 11 times.  Examining the protocol stream with Ethereal does not
reveal anything unusual (text dump of trace attached).  A number of
theme icons are missing, but the number missing doesn't exactly match the
number of times the dialog popped up (it's usually one or 2 more than the
number of alerts).

The system I'm running on is RH8.0 on a LAN behind another RH8.0
system acting as a router and NAT firewall.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the themes page on texurizer.net
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Themes page displays with some preview icons missing,
multiple alert popups.

Expected Results:  
Themes page displays with all icons, no popup alert.

Does Firebird need to limit the number of simultaneous connections
it attempts?  

I'm really curious about where the dialogs originate, since I didn't
see any "421" http errors in the data stream. AFAICT 421 isn't an 
official http error code.
