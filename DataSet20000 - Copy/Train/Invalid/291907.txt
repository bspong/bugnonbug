I went to http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/ in order to download 
firefox. The default link to download was a swedish version of 1.0.3. The link 
to that file was: http://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-
1.0.3&os=win&lang=sv-SE

I downloaded it nicely, but when I try to install it, a very small pop-up 
dialog says: Unspecified error. The name in the top of the dialog is 7-zip.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download http://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-1.0.3&os=win&lang=sv-
SE
2. Install it
3. Get the error

Actual Results:  
A very small pop-up dialog says: Unspecified error. The name in the top of the 
dialog is 7-zip.

Expected Results:  
Started the installer.

Tested the english verison, and that worked fine. Installer started. I'll use 
that for know.
