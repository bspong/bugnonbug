FF1.5b2/MacOSX:  Applets print out blank
Firefox 1.5b2, Mac OSX 10.4.2/8C46, I have tested both Java 1.4.2
and 1.5 using the 1.5 Java Preferences app.  I have the equivalent
of Java 1.5 dp3 installed here.

Go to this URL: http://www.brainjar.com/java/games/asteroids/

and try to print this page out, the applet prints out blank.
The printer lays out space for the applet, but nothing shows up.

This works for Safari.
