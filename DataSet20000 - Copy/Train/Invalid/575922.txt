Linux only! The Sun Java plugin stopped working with Firefox 3.6.x. It still works for example with Firefox 3.5
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.6) Gecko/20100625 Firefox/3.6.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.6) Gecko/20100625 Firefox/3.6.6

I noticed after updating recently with my working copy of Firefox that the Java plugin stopped working (it doesn't appear in add-ons) and Firefox asks one if one wants to install a missing plug-in when one visits a website containing an applet.

I used a clean test setup and installed locally:

Firefox 3.0.13
Firefox 3.5.3
Firefox 3.6.6

Then I installed the most recent Java plugin (jre-6u20-linux-i586.bin) manually and run my test.

Example applet: http://www.chartle.net/create

Result: only for Firefox 3.6.6 the plugin does not work anymore.

On Windows there is no problem with Firefox 3.6.6 and the Java plugin. OSX not tested yet.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.chartle.net/create with Firefox 3.6.6 and installed Java plug-in
2. Applet does not work
3. Does work though with older versions of Firefox (3.x and 3.5.3)
