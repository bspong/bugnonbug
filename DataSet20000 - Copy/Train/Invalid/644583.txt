All Navigation icons disappear when toolbar is set to "text" only

When customizing your toolbar in Firefox 3 and "text only" is chosen, Bookmarks icons were disabled but Navigation icons remained unchanged.
Now all the icons are disabled and only texts are shown.

It was nice to have all the Navigation icons while text only is displayed in the Bookmarks bar.

Cheers.
