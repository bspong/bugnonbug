Redirect cache should be deleted if language settings are changed

I'm working on a website that uses the index page to redirect the user to the correct index page in his browsers language. 

I tried to test it by changing the language preferences but have always been redirected to the same language page. After some debugging I found out that this is a Firefox "problem".

It's good to cache the redirect, but the cache should be deleted in this case. There are many pages which use a redirect to show the correct language, and if the user changes his language settings he wants to influence this behavior. So the cache should be deleted (best automatically, at least there should be the option).

I tested several 3xx status codes, but the behavior is always the same - also with 307 (*temporary* redirect), which IMHO should not be cached.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a website with language redirect
2. Change language settings to another preferred language the website offers
3. Visit the website again
4. Delete cache
5. Visit the website again
Actual Results:  
Visit 1: Language one
Visit 2: Still language one
Visit 3: Language two

Expected Results:  
Visit 1: Language one
Visit 2: Language two
Visit 3: Language two
