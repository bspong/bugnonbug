I am unable to modify browser.bookmarks.file using about:config.  If I reset it or modify its value it always reverts to its previous version when I restart Firefox.  

This value is not currently the default.  I have changed the drive letter of one of my drives and I want to change the drive letter for my bookmarks so that Firefox can find them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. about:config
2. modify browser.bookmarks.file
3. exit Firefox
4. restart Firefox
5. about:config

Actual Results:  
browser.bookmarks.file has reverted to previous value

Expected Results:  
browser.bookmarks.file should keep the value manually specified when editing in about:config.
