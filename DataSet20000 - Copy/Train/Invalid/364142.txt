The table summarizing costs at the end of the article won't
print when printing the entire page. Selecting just the table
and attempting to print selection also doesn't work. In fact
it prints the ad at the top right instead.

Selecting the table in IE and printing the selection works.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open the url as reported
2. scroll to the end of the article
3. select the table of costs
4. print selection
Actual Results:  
1. printing full article resulted in the table missing
2. printing the table as a selection resulted in the banner ad and the righthand sidebar ad being printed

Expected Results:  
Print the table at the end of the report if the full article is printed
Print the table if it is selected and print selection is used
