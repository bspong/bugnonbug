If I drag a tab to the trash to close it, the tab tears away instead.

The Trash on the Dock must be reasonably consistent across applications.  In this case, I dragged a tab from a multi-tabbed window to the Trash to close the tab, but it didn't close.  The tab tears away to another window.  The UI is misleading because if I hover the tab over the Trash before concluding the dragging action, the Trash dims as if it will accept the action.  When I discovered this inconsistency, it seemed that all my other tabs had been closed instead of the one I desired to close.  After some confusion, I refound the other tabs in the old window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open two or more tabs.
2. Drag one of the tabs to the Trash located on the dock.
Actual Results:  
It appears that all the other tabs have been closed, except for the one that I want to close.  In fact, none of the tabs closed.

Expected Results:  
The tab should close.
