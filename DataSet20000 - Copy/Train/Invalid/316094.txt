AT ALL ATTEMPTS TO OPEN Internet explorer error message - properties:
"res://C:\WINDOWS\system32\shdoclc.dll/dnserror.htm#http://www.microsoft.com/"
Tried to re-download IE and was blocked - message says IE already on computer.
Also all firefox bookmarks were lost - was able to re-import the ones from internet explorer and it was around this time that I noticed IE wasn't functioning 
or could not be opened - always brings up the message "This page cannot be displayed"

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on desktop icon for IE {internet explorer}
2.Right click on page opened with firefox and click option "open {or show} with internet explorer" same "this page cannot be displayed"
3.



Expected Results:  
Internet explorer ahould operate as it is on the computer and was never altered 
- It was there when I first installed firefox.
