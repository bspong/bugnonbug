When I click the home icon to load the homepage tabs, I get all my open tabs PLUS my homepage tabs, even though I has originally set Overwite open tabs.
It happens at random.

I set the home page and then go to Tools, Options, Tabbed browsing, Features, and check Overwrite open tabs, all is well until sometime later when the computer has been rebooted (I can't determine how many reboots before the problem occurs). When I go back and check my settings I find that the Overwite Open Tabs has been unchecked.



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set Tools, Options, Tabbed Browsing, Features, check Overwite Open Tabs
2.Set home page with 4 open tabs
3.open one or two more tabs then check HOME icon to reload the home page
Actual Results:  
Randomly the Home Tabs would NOT Overwrite and the check was no longer there.

Expected Results:  
Only the home tabs should load but I am sometimes finding that the home tabs PLUS 
the current open tabs are loaded.
