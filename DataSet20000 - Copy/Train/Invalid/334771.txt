Need to know when Places Popup is open

Currently, when placesPopup.xul is open, there seems to be no way for a theme to detect it. As a themer, I want to apply a distinct image to the icon for the bookmarksBarShowPlaces button (actually the "search Places" button).

Open and checked are listed as "false" in the DOM Inspector. Ditto placesPopup.xul. So far, a number of themers have tried to find an indicator and failed.

We need to have something set as a flag (e.g. - #bookmarksBarShowPlaces set to open="true") so we can skin that condition.

Reproducible: Always
