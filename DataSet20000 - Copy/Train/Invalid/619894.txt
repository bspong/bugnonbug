shopping for portable USB external HD and tried to access specifications document. FF4b7 totally locked-up/hung.  All I could do is take a screenshot.  Restarted browser, restored, and tried again -- same result.  Although PDF document did eventually open -- no idea which instance of FF actually caused okular to display document.

Reproducible: Always
