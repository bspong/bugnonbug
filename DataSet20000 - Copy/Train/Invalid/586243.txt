tabs on top does nothing in KDE
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0b4pre) Gecko/20100810 Minefield/4.0b4pre
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0b4pre) Gecko/20100810 Minefield/4.0b4pre

Selecting "tabs on top" from the menu does not make the tabs go on top.
Also had the same issue with 4.0b3pre.
App tabs however work fine (if a little small in Linux)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. right click on the menu or view->toolbars
2. click "tabs on top"
Actual Results:  
Tabs do not move.

Expected Results:  
Tabs should go on top.

Running Kubuntu Lucid 10.04 with kde 4.4.5, firefox from either ppa or mozilla's ftp daily builds.
I have marked this bug as major, as tabs on top is a major part of the new interface, and is completely broken in KDE (haven't tried in Gnome)
