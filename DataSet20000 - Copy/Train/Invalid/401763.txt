I tried different keyboards, different mouse, different videocard, memory tested DRAM memory sticks, checked processor temperature.

Freezing happened once after boot up. Every other time i had it while on the internet. It froze after 1 hour, after 3 hours after 7 hours of running, and back to 2 hours of use.

Just having the computer on for 5 days without accessing anything it worked fine
