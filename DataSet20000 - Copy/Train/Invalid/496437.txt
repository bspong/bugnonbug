This morning I upgraded to OSX 10.5.7 (plus quicktime, itunes, and airport, none of which should be related to firefox basic functionality).  Upon the restart of firefox, the Location bar was missing, as were the standard paging keys (back, forward, home, refresh).  This was immediately after the upgrade, and I performed no other operations other than starting firefox.  Just in case it was related to themes, I changed the theme back to the default.  On restart, the bar and the buttons were still missing.  I do not see any other problems. I am able to function, more or less, using function keys and Open Location, but this is extremely annoying.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start firefox
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
no location bar, no forward/back page buttons, no refresh button, no stop button, no home button

Expected Results:  
these items should have been there, as they always had been before the upgrade of OSX

bug occurs with default theme and with Walnut theme
