Cannot reinstall Firefox: 3.0.13 is not supported on Mac 10.3.9
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; es-ES; rv:1.9.0.13) Gecko/2009073022 Firefox/3.0.13

My Firefox was working fine until 2 days ago. I deleted the icon on the desktop, since it asn't responding when i clicked on it and proceeded to download a new copy of the software. Now, at the end of the download it keeps on giving me the following error messages: 'Mounting failed', 'corrupt image'. I don't know why this is happening?
Please help.

Reproducible: Always




I am using a PowerMac G4 (Mac OX version 10.3.9)
