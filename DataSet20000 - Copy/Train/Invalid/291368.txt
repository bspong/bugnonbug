The Greasemonkey extension allows scripts to be written, which "hijack"
functionality on pages, enabling malicious code to redirect unsuspecting users
to pages which can collect their data (such as logins/passwords).

You can conduct "carrot spoofing" by creating a Greasemonkey script which does
something useful and helpful on the surface, but behind the scenes, does mischief.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a Greasemonkey script which does something useful like changing the
fonts/colors of a financial services site you use
2. Add in a few lines of javascript which replace the innerhtml of the Login
button with a command which redirects them to a site which collects their member
login and password.
3. Redirect them to a page which shows that the site they thought they were
logging into, is down. They will never be the wiser for your exploit PLUS they
will always think the site is down, whenever they use Firefox.
4. Put the script out there as an "enhancement" for the site in question, and
wait to collect the data.
Actual Results:  
I was able to redirect myself to another bogus page, which did the above, and
redirected to a bogus site-down page.

Expected Results:  
It should have kept an "unsigned" script from hijacking the actual html of my
web page for critical functionality.
