Wrong version of program is uninstalled.

During the beta phase I have been running two versions of Firefox. One official, the last one being Firefox 1.07 and the beta. I have now installed version 1.5 and everything seems ok.

So, I decided to delete version 1.07, as it is not needed any longer. This version was however not available in the control panel's add/remove program utility. 

I then went to the program directory (in my case C:/program/Mozilla Firefox 1.07/uninstall/UninstallFirfox.exe) to run the uninstallation from this place.

The program started and asked me if I wanted to uninstall Firefox ver. 1.5. I clicked "yes" not thinking much about it, but the uninstallation program did actually delete version 1.5, which I kept in the default directory (C:/program/Mozilla Firefox). Not really what I intended to do. 

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Version 1.5 in the default location is uninstalled.

Expected Results:  
Version 1.07 in non-default location should have been uninstalled.
