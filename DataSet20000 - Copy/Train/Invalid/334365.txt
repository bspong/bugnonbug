Whenever a site is visited, the spyware goes through the links in firefox. While searching for information on the various search engines the spyware links firefox as the channel or route the spyware gets recorded. When I run a spyware removal program, it picks up the link and shows the spyware in a folder on my computer and it shows it going through firefox to implant tracking cookies. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to any search engine and do a search on whatever subject picked
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
The results show firefox link and shows the links into my folders. One of the links is going through (Data miner)and linking up with companies putting sypware on my system for montioring. 

Expected Results:  
When I use the spyware remover it recovers the spyware for deletion. My system is restored to its normal processes. Each time I run firefox, I can expect the spyware to return, due to the pattern I get. This problem is solved by another browser and it eliminates all traces of spyware. The spyware goes through different links established by the site itself and the implanting of the spyware goes through their site and bypasses your browser.

I would like to see a spyware remover installed with the browser to eliminate any spyware going through the browser to obtain information to the sites I visit. It would be great to have the spyware remover be activated by clicking on the menu bar button so the user call scan for the spyware and remove it. That would be a huge help. I clear my visited websites when I suppect the spyware continues to load to track personal information.
