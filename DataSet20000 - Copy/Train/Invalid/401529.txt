Building mobile-browser (moblin project) in Feisty (Ubuntu 7.04) with command "sudo pdebuild --use-pdebuild-internal" fails & gives error:command not found for dh_testdir, dh_testroot, dh_clean & other dh_-related commands.

Build Identifier: 

I am building mozilla in chroot environment using commands pdebuild, pbuilder (package-building tools) with sudo & appropriate options. These package-builder tools use chroot intensively, so I cannot do away with chroot. I downloaded all modules from http://www.moblin.org/repos/ for building mobile linux modules(there are 10-12 C/C++ modules, all I successfully built & installed), except mozilla, which fails at the starting phase itself. This is due to chroot being used. All other modules also use chroot, but they do not fail due to this. I am confused as to how only mozilla fails when there seems to be no difference at all in the way the building takes place.

The error captured is :--

dpkg-buildpackage: source package is mozilla
dpkg-buildpackage: source version is 19990716.M8-3
dpkg-buildpackage: source changed by Brent A. Fulgham <bfulgham@debian.org>
dpkg-buildpackage: host architecture i386
dpkg-buildpackage: source version without epoch 19990716.M8-3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
I am not using ./configure & such commands, as it will take me lot of time to install packages manually. and also ./configure fails due to gtk+-2.0 & other packages not present. 
  Please use sudo with all package-building commands, as well as for download & installs.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the package(takes quite some time).. the command is:-->
git clone http://moblin.org/repos/projects/mobile-browser.git
you can also download other moblin ( C/C++ ) modules to see them succeeding in their respective builds. It downloads from the CVS repositories.
2. ln -s ./build/package/debian ./debian to create soft-link
3. sudo pdebuild --use-pdebuild-internal , it should do all the build process (i.e unpacking, installing packages, configure, running makefiles, etc) till creating the final executable (.exe, or .so)
Actual Results:  
 fakeroot debian/rules clean
dh_testdir
make: dh_testdir: Command not found
make: *** [clean] Error 127
Copying back the cached apt archive contents
 -> unmounting /home/persist/moblin filesystem
 -> unmounting dev/pts filesystem
 -> unmounting proc filesystem
 -> cleaning the build env
    -> removing directory /var/cache/pbuilder/build//10107 and its subdirectories


Expected Results:  
The build should go on, as with the other modules, and it should locate dh_testdir command in chroot environments.

Please provide me a workaround or check if I am missing anything, as I tried hard to find any hacks/workarounds, but I have to use chroot,.
