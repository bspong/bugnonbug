Using PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege only halfway works in an included (external) JS file like <script src="somefile.js"></script>

When using
netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege("UniversalPreferencesWrite");
in an external JS file, the grant window pops up and allows you to grant the
request but will not allow security to execute the line following the
UniversalPreferencesWrite request. I have a window.open (with a modal=1) that
will not open unless i remove it from the external JS file aand put it in the
main HTML script block.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set user_pref("signed.applets.codebase_principal_support", true); in prefs.js
2. Create a blank html page with a script block in the HEAD.
<html><head><script src="somefile.js"></script></head><body></body></html>
3. In "somefile.js" put the following:
netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege("UniversalPreferencesWrite");
window.open("somefile.htm","Test","height=200,width=200,modal=1");
alert('done');
4. Put all files in the same dir and open the main html file.



Actual Results:  
Open the html file and grant permission and you will see that window.open DOES
NOT open but you DO see the alert. Since i saw the popup asking for permission,
I assume my code will work after i grant but it does not.

Expected Results:  
You should get a popup to grant permission and then see the modal window open
and once the modal window is closed, then you should see the alert.

The trick is to make sure the codebase_principal_support is set and that you use
the UniversalPreferencesWrite priveledge trick to get modal windows to open.
This all works fine IF the javascript is IN the main html file. It just doesnt
work when you put it in an external JS file even if they are all in the same
domain and directory.
