I am noticing with some flash websites that if I am running any flash player less than 10.1 and greater than 9.  That some PNG's inside flash are losing their transparency.  It appears the image was being rendered in 16bit rather than 32 bit.  It appears on most flash websites and on other browsers it appears to be fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to a flash website with a transparent png
2.view image
3.
Actual Results:  
The image appears to be rendered in 16 bit.

Expected Results:  
The image should be displaying properly

This appears to happen on Windows machines (XP, Vista, 7) and Flash player 10.1 and less down to 9.
