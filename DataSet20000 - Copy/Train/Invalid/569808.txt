Each tab doubles as a new window

For every tab that is opened, it opens a replicated window of the firefox session, but with that tab selected. 
Example:
Tabs opened: Gmail | Google | Mozilla | Facebook
If I add a new tab for, lets say, bing, it adds | Bing. But this session will have created 5 tabs, and 5 separate windows. It is still one process, but 5 windows for firefox is now open. If I select the window for Google, it will open the exact same firefox session as all the other windows, but the Google tab will be the one focused. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create new tab
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
New tabs are doubled as windows. 

Expected Results:  
Just tabs should appear, no extra windows replicating the software.

This is the 4.0 Minefield build, despite what your detected diagnostics determined.
