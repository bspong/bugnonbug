The browser does not remember the tabs I use in a previous session.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.16) Gecko/20110319 Firefox/3.6.16
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.16) Gecko/20110319 Firefox/3.6.16

All I know is that I used to be able to close one browser session and restore the application later with all my tabs as well. No, what I'm talking about is not Mozilla crashing. I legitimately close the window, and then restart it normally, but now, FireFox does not remember my tabs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Simple, open a few pages, all in different tabs of course
2.close the window
3.open the program again
Actual Results:  
Nothing, none of the tabs will be available in the new window.

Expected Results:  
exactly what I put, nothing.

 I know this is an unorthodox way to contact the developers, I couldn't find another way. There doesn't seem to be a general email address to do that, not that I could find.
