When I am opening a file of office 2007 (.pptx, .docx, .pptx extention) from any repository, it will ask what to do with this file. I am using DocumentToGo application to open these mimeTypes of file. I am opening file with this application and also check mark the option "Do this automatically for files like this from now". 
Now again I am opening the same mimetype of file, again i am getting popup message what to do with this file.

This behavior is limited to only file which are in repository.

Here are some url to varify that "Do this automatically for files like this from now" check mark is not working.
