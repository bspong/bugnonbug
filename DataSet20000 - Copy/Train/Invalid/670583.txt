Missing Javascript Exceptions since FF4
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build ID: 20110615151330

Steps to reproduce:

While writing an plugin, the plugin has a failure of some kind though no error is shown in the JS console, no exception is shown.


Actual results:

Nothing shows up in JS Console


Expected results:

Error should be reported in the console.

I can confirm this is the case by wrapping the failing block of code in a try/catch and the exception is caught there.  Most posts on the web point to: http://kb.mozillazine.org/Dom.report_all_js_exceptions which, among other things I have tried, they do not seem to fix the issue.

I will attempt to post a smaller test case later this week, has anyone else reported anything similar?  I did not find an open bug in the database about this.
