Adware program "dcads" renders firefox unusable

A malicious program named "dcads" will break firefox.  Attempted removal of dcads will leave firefox in a state where it terminates on loading a page (presumably when dcads would attempt a popup).  Removal of dcads is NOT TRIVIAL, I have not found anything that completely removes it. A system restore seems to have worked but even a reinstal of firefox didn't work the first time. Dcads appears to be a registry based popup generator.  Even information on how to kill this thing would be helpful.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Be an idiot and install an unknown .exe from Limewire (I clicked before I thought.) Instantly install @#$%#@ thing called dcads.
2.Try every known spy bot killer. Do System restore.
3.
Actual Results:  
Visit various web pages i.e. oldversion.com & fire fox evaporates.

Expected Results:  
?? Report that fire fox has been tampered with by an outside agent, Resist attempts to hook into the browser ???

No blame to you.  But there appears to be so little info out there on this and there must be others experiencing this and it affects firefox directly.

As of this moment, a system restore followed by a total uninstall and reinstall directly from the download "Seems" to have restored things to normal. 

I really wanted to select "Critical" from the severity below but decided instead to go with enhancement.
