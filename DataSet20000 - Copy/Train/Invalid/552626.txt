Norton Internet Security 2010 has to be uninstalled so it will update then reinstall???
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; OfficeLiveConnector.1.4; OfficeLivePatch.1.3; InfoPath.2; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

I have NIS 2010 and I also use Foxfire.  Well my NIS 2010 would not update so I contacted Norton/Symantec and asked them.  They told me to uninstall Foxfire and then update then reinstall it???  Is there anyway that you guys can play together???  This is a big hassel to do this......Anyone else had this problem??? Apparently Yes because lots of Norton users have had the same problem.  Can you guys fix this please so I can keep Foxfire on my computer.  Thank you very much for Foxfire.
