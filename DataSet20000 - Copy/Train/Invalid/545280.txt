Links on certain catalog pages always result in "File Not Found".
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

While I have had this problem on other pages, the reported URL is always a problem. The owner has been very cooperative and tried to fix it. She says she has had no other reports but does not write pages with Firefox in mind. Cannot find the problem. Tried at least three times. To buy from this site I have to write to them and describe what I want.

I updated two days ago, but had the same problem before updating as well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to Url
2.Look in catalog
3.Click link to see more detail (Or any similar link)
Actual Results:  
Sends you to Homestead (the ISP) File Not Found page instead of expected link.

Expected Results:  
Expected new page showing product details and allowing to choose size and make order.

Gone to expected link.
