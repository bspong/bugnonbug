Google toolbar spell checker causes HTML behind Word Press entry form to get scrambled when using Firefox.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7

Environment:  Windows XP Home SP-2, Firefox 1.5.0.7, Word Press 2.0.4., Google toolbar 2.1.

Description:  Word Press using an HTML form for text entry for blogs.  It composes HTML behind the scenes for various reasons.

When using Google's toolbar to check the spelling of the entered text, the subsequent HTML gets changed.  Most commonly the position of paragraph tags <p> are moved causing the break to appear after the first word of the subsequent paragraph.  Often text attributes like bold and italics get screwed up too, though I have not found a universal form of corruption.

Note that using IE 6.0.2900 does not cause this problem using Google toolbar 4.0.1020.  Thus it is either a problem with the Firefox version of the Google toolbar, Firefox (or less likely with Word Press).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add two or more paragraphs of text with at least one misspelling.
2. Click on "Check" on the Google toolbar.
