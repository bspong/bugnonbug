closeTab causes "TypeError"

Each time I close a tab, the browser responds by blanking the current tab and
displaying "TypeError: arrViewNodes[j].contentWindow has no properties"


I have several extensions installed, among them the ones that seem pertenent to
the problem are "undoclosetab*", "Basics", "duplicateTab", and "Tabbrowser
Preferences" --(*) because it seemed so likely, I have tested whether
uninstalling "undoclosetab" makes the problem go away.  It does not.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open multiple tabs
2. close one of them
3.
