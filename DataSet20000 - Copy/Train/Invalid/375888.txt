GEMPLUS 64K CAC not compatible with Firefox's Certificate Manager
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: Firefox 2.0.0.3

	I have been testing CAC authentication with OWA on my MacBook Pro (10.4.9) for the past couple months now and have proved successful except with one card...the GEMPLUS 64k CAC. All other cards I've tested (Oberthur, Axalto, Schlumberger) have worked flawlessly. The GEMPLUS is recognized in Keychain Access, displays the cert's, and will unlock if directed to do so. However when I pull up Firefox with DOD Configuration 0.6.1 and go into the Certificate Manager, the cert's won't pull up. If you put in any other CAC, your immediately prompted for your PIN upon clicking the "view certificates" tab, and the cert's will display, thus you know you will be prompted for a choice of what cert to use when you attempt OWA. When you attempt with a GEMPLUS on OWA, it immediately brings you to a 401 error. I'm using a SCR331 flashed with 5.22 firmware. I've also tried with Safari, Camino, and BonEcho. The first time I attempted to use a GEMPLUS with Firefox I actually rendered the browser to a non-operational state, forced to troubleshoot and eventually re-install.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to the encryption tab under the advanced tab in preferences.
2.Insert a GEMPLUS 64k CAC card into an attached USB CAC reader.
3.Click on "view certificates"
(none will show up) As opposed to other cards prompting for a PIN.
Actual Results:  
Explained in details section.

Expected Results:  
It should be prompting for a PIN, like any other CAC I've attempted.

I believe I've included the majority of the information including build and peripherals utilized in the details section.
