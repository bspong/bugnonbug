Firefox 1.0.4 fails to block popup at http://www.instant-movie-making.com/
This is believed to be linked to the information at - 
http://www.createandsellproductsonline.com/
which offers code to get round popup blockers.
"Popups will play a crucial role in gaining you more subscribers. But exit pops 
will also provide you with a residual income from those who were about to leave 
your website anyway. That's right, I'm going to show you exactly how to make 
money from people who are exiting your site! 
This unique bonus will provide you with the software necessary to generate your 
popups. I sell it separately for $34.95, but it is yours absolutely free for 
acting today. 
Newly updated. Now you'll also get access to a pop-over script that will defy 
those popup blockers now standard with Windows XP Service Pack 2 and all Google 
and Yahoo toolbars."
