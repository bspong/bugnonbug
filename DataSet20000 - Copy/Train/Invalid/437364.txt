Opening two Firefox windows at the same time kills the enter key. (as of Firefox 3.0 RC2)

People open two Firefox windows all the time, thinking the first click did not work. I would do that, and then close the extra window. Closing the extra window causes enter to not work on the remaining window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close all firefox instances. Open two firefox windows at the same.
2. On the second window, enter an address (e.g. www.yahoo.com) and press enter key. All should be normal
3. Close the second window.
4. On the first window, enter an address (e.g. www.yahoo.com) and press enter. Enter key does not work. Green 'go' button does not work
Actual Results:  
nothing happens. no alerts, etc. 

Expected Results:  
the url is fetched upon pressing the enter key
