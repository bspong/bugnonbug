Facebook proves how horrible Firefox is
Created attachment 559134
Just can't scroll the whole page, can we?

Here we have proof that Firefox is terrible.

We use an 7 inch EEEPC for this experiment, as its smaller screen will
illustrate just how terribly _horrible_ Firefox is.

Do not cheat and think it is OK to use your large screen in an effort
to deny there is a bug and get rid of my report.

We visit http://www.facebook.com/help .
No Facebook account needed, no logging in needed. No excuses not to test.

We hit several CTRL++'s to zoom up the size of the characters a
little.

Now we scroll horizontally.

We notice how Firefox pushes the "Search" textbox further and further
to the edge ... the more we hit CTRL++.

The rest of the screen is _accessible_ but not the search textbox.
Kiss it good bye. It didn't have to be that way, but that is the fact.

This just illustrates how awful Firefox is.

P.S., I used totally vanilla Debian Firefox 8. No add-ons for somebody
to say I didn't turn off.
