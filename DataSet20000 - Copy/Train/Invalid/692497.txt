Panorama screen won't close; can't navigate to any tabs
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:8.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/8.0
Build ID: 20110928060149

Steps to reproduce:

I am running Windows 7 64-bit. This bug appears to only happen when Tab Utilities 1.1 is installed (from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-utilities/)

1. Start firefox with at least two panorama groups and at least two pages in each group.
2. Open panorama.
2. Move current page to another panorama group.
3. Click an unloaded page in the other group group.



Actual results:

The page clicked will not open; in fact, no tabs can be opened. Panorama can't be exited. Have to kill firefox.



Expected results:

Tab page clicked should have opened.
