Problem loading content on flash movie

Firefox fails to represent the correct data from a flash application I designed.
It used to perform all right but since the last time I installed Windows xp it doesn't. In any case, it loads fine on internet explorer. I've been a user of firefox for years and hopefully years to come, that's why I'm contacting you.

It has the same problem with some megavideo videos that for some reason also load fine on ie 6.

I've uploaded a screenshot of both ie and ff on the same page so you can see what I mean.

It also happens on:

Which basically is the same flash with different data.
