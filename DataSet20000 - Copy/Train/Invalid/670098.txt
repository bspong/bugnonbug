css font-family settings are overridden by ff for form tags if not set directly on the tags
Take this basic css part for example:
body { 
  font-family: Arial, serif;
}

text in form tags like input, button, textarea is not rendered in Arial or default serif like all other text on the website.

Workaround:
set font-family directly on the tags works:
button { font-family: Arial, serif }

The workaround does also help in Bug:

FF should not overide the settings on input tags.

Tested on:
Ubuntu
Windows7
