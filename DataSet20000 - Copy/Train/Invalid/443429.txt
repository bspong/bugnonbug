I had a google toolbar until you updated to Firefox 3.0 (without my permission) then lost it and am unable to reinstall it.

I was happy with my older version of firefox.  Your program updated it without any request to me.  This is very rude.  Now I'm unable to use the google toolbar.  All attempts to install it are met with an error message.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.went to google toolbar page
2.Tried to install the google toolbar
3.got error message.
Tried to re-install firefox.
Same thing happened.
Tried to re install old version of firefox.
Wouldn't work at all.
Couldn't put the Yahoo toolbar up, either.
Actual Results:  
Didn't get a result.  Got an error message instead.


Expected Results:  
It should have installed the google toolbar.

Why not put the Google toolbar underneath the navigation toolbar as a standard item?  It isn't very convenient at the RHS of the address bar. It's too small for one thing.
