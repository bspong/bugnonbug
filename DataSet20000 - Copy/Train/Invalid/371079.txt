Drag and drop is very dangerous operation in Mozilla. I's always been ever since the beginning so I only use it accidentally when I forget about the risks.

Most of the time dragging a tab or bookmark creates a nice bookmark icon and then locks up Firefox. The icons stays there no matter what unless Firefox is killed. Last time I tried Firefox even grabbed the X input so I had to kill it from outside X.

There are some safe combinations (iirc dragging the bokmark from the url bar to the bookmark toolbar). But leaving the bookmark elsewhere or taking it elsewhere easily locks up Firefox.

Reproducible: Sometimes
