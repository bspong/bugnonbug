Firefox 4 regression with Flash-blocking add-ons

On some pages on finance.yahoo.com, embedded flash video begins playing automatically, even if Flashblock or Stop Autoplay is installed.  This did not happen in Firefox 3.6.

When I experimented with this problem, sometimes the Flash was blocked correctly - but if I held Shift and hit Reload to clear the cache, the video always started to play.

I recently experienced the issue on these pages:

It appears that the embedded player is typically one of these:

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Install either Flashblock or Stop Autoplay.
2.  Go to affected web page.
3.  If embedded flash video does not start automatically, hit Shift-Reload.
Actual Results:  
Video plays.

Expected Results:  
Embedded Flash should be blocked by add-on.
