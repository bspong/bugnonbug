Hello, I can not use firefox 2.0
I wanted to download it because firefox 3 is so horrible.
BUT when I downloaded 2.0 I opened it up after I finished installing, but it kept on crashing.
It kept on opening two toolbars, and then it loaded for around 3  seconds, then it would have said "firefox is not responding and needs to close". This happened every single time I wanted to try to download 2.0

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
nothing


can i please get firefox 2.0 back?
