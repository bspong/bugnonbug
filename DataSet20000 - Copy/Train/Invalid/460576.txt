when accessing Bookmarks, I am prompted to add a new Bookmark

When I click on Bookmarks the option to add a new Bookmark comes up without me clicking on the option to add a new bookmark.  This is quite annoying.  Also, you need to add the option of sorting bookmarks by name if there are several listed in folders.  For example I have 21 Folders under bookmarks, and the 21 folders have 10's if not 100's of URL bookmarks.  The option to right-click and choose "sort by name" under each folder needs to be made available, not just under the main listing of folders and URLs when you first click on Bookmarks.  Internet Explorer has this option and older versions of Firefox did as well but for whatever reason you revoked this option.  Please add it back in!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Click on Bookmarks
3."Page Bookmarked" Dialog box pops up without clicking on the Bookmark This Page option.
Actual Results:  
The confirmation dialog box for "Page Bookmarked" comes up.




It should just list all of the bookmarks, folders, URLs, etc without prompting to bookmark a page.  This happens with either the default theme or modified theme.
