When you click on non editable text in any website, the keyboard cursor starts flashing there. It its annoying, and since the text is not editable its not supposed to be there.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to any website
2.Click on an area with uneditable text


Actual Results:  
You will see the cursor show up

Expected Results:  
Move focus to that part of the screen, and maybe highlight text when clicking and draging, but do not show cursor.

That's it.
