IE DHTML/JavaScript incompatibility

I wrote this Tic Tac Toe program using client-side DHTML + JavaScript for IE in 2002, and it works perfectly.  Click on a square to put your X, and browser plays O.  But when I run this under FireFox, it doesn't work.

I have several other programs that use similar "technology", and they all also do not work under FireFox (but do with IE).
