A pop up window comes up unexpectedly with your logo claiming I have spyware adware etc. on my computer. It then shows me the problems on my computer and requests I buy the program. Then this thing freezes my computer not allowing me to do anything I had to shut the computer down and restart I found the software on my computer and deleted it. Then the same thing pops up again when I am trying to get some work done very annoying its like being hijacked. Just thought you should know these clowns are using your logo next time they try I will send you a letter snail mail so you can clearly see what they are doing I wrote it down but I am not sure I got the URL right. I know its not a product you offer because I checked that first WHAT CREEPS. I figure if you guys gather hard evidence against them you could sue their socks off.
