I am using the Gradient iCool theme for 2 days. When I was adding bookmarks (richt click the "Bookmarks Toolbar" and select "New Bookmark...")  I saw something weird. When I tried to enter information in the description box, the text that I typed was displayed white. The description box displays the text in white this should be changed into black to make it readable. The rest of the theme is perfect for me, only this little bug irritates me. Yours sincerely

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Make the text that is typed in the "New Bookmark..." description box black instead of white.

Actual Results:  
The Bookmark was added perfectly!

Expected Results:  
Display the text in black instead of white.

I am using the firefox portable version from www.portableapps.com but this shouldn't make a difference.
