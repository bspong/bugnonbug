First CSS menu position by DIV absolute displays OK.

Second CSS menu also positioned by DIV absolute does not display in FF 3.5 nor does subsequent items outside that DIV.

Have now merged both DIV separated CSS menus into one DIV whilst keeping both CSS menus as separate blocks of coding. Instead of having the first CSS menu displayed now neither are displayed.

IE7 and FF 2.0.9 displays the page perfectly.

Have renamed li and ul to xxx... and it made no difference.
Have removed the CSS no overflow but it made no difference.

Validated with W3C the HTML and CSS = both clean.

For demonstration purposes have disabled the background picture.
