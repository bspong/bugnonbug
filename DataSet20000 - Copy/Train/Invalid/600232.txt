add-on bar doesn't support big icon mode
currently the add-on bar is only in small mode.

we want add-ons to be able to be shown in a big mode (24px) there.

however, we don't want that tied to big/small icon mode for the navigation bar. users should be able to customize different sizes for each.

apparently seamonkey supports per-toolbar customization like this, so possible code and UI ideas there.
