Wrong wording: "Remember my browsing history for at least".
The setting is the maximum number of days for which FF keeps history. For example, if I select "5", then AT MOST five days of history will be retained. "AT LEAST" means the least number of days is five (and the most has no limit), which is not how the feature works. 

The ambiguity may cause a security problem for users.

Suggested wording:
"Remember my browsing history for no more than"
"Remember my browsing history for at most"
"Keep no more than this many days of browsing history"
