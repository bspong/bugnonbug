mod_security denies firefox access for the following rule violation:

SecRule &REQUEST_HEADERS:Content-Type "@eq 0" "chain,phase:2,t:none,auditlog,deny,msg:'Request Containing Content, but Missing Content-Type Header'"
SecRule REQUEST_HEADERS:Content-Length "!^0$" "t:none"

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto a link that has the mod_security rule listed in this bugs details
2. Refresh the page in rapid succession
Actual Results:  
mod_security gives a forbidden access and shows the rule violation under level 5 debug logging

Expected Results:  
To see the webpage each time with no errors from mod_security

The bug is very random. I have been stumped on this for roughly 2 weeks. After some extensive testing and log file filtering, I can safely conclude the above bug with confidence. Rapid refreshing will trigger the bug faster but the bug sometimes happens during normal firefox operation.
