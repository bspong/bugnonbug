I can open the page http://www.oxm.co.uk/article.php?id=15099 perfectly fine, but when I click on the link near the bottom to read comments, my monitors go blank and windows restarts.  I've tried this four times just to be sure before I reported the bug.  The page opens fine in internet explorer. It also opens fine with the same version of firefox on my Mac (OSX 10.4).

Note, this is pretty worrisome because this isn't firefox crashing, this is the entire computer crashing when a link is clicked in firefox...  That's frightening.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.oxm.co.uk/article.php?id=15099
2. Click link on bottom to read comments for article
3. Screen go blank, computer restarts...
Actual Results:  
Repeated the steps above four times to be absolutely certain.  It seems so strange that this could actually happen that I had to try multiple times...  There hasn't been a time when the steps above haven't worked.

Expected Results:  
It should have brought me to the comments page for the article.  This is the functionality provided in IE7 on windows, and firefox, safari, and opera on my Mac.

I noticed that when I visited the page in IE7, there is the yellow bar at the top saying "The website wants to run the following add-on: Windows Media Player...".  I received no such notification in firefox.

If some sort of malformed link, or firefox's handling of an add-on, or really anything firefox does, can cause a computer to just die, this is quite a big deal.
