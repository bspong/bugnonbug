Using Opensuse 10.3 with KDE
gtk apps displayed within opensuse using kcm-gtk
Theme is displayed correctly in Opensuse 10.3 except for the back/forward arrows.
These seem to be stok arrows that look out of place with the rest of the displayed theme.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
back / forward arrows should match those from the system theme.

Apparently thee is a workaround for this in systems that use gtk-qt.
However, Opensuse uses the newer kcm-gtk
Haven't been able to locate a workaround.
Workaround shouldn't be needed though. Correct arrows should be shown by default.
