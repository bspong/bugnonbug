Steps to reproduce:

At power up, iMac fails to connect to AT&T 2-wire 721 modem. A re-start does not always result in connection with the modem. A re-start of the modem does not always result in a successful connection attempt. Computer and modem are less than 4ft apart. This is a consistent problem. Repeatable but intermittent. Would estimate >50% of power-ups result in failure to connect.


Actual results:

No connection via wireless link.


Expected results:

Would have expected to connect to 2-Wire 721 modem initially or after computer re-start or modem re-start.
