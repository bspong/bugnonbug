I type an address in IDN (Internationalized Domain Names) on the location bar,
enter it, and when the page opens, the address written on the bar turns to
Punycode. It should remain in IDN.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Digit example www.baú.com on the location bar (or copy and paste).
2.Enter

Actual Results:  
The location bar shows: www.xn--ba-ska.com

Expected Results:  
The location bar should remain showing www.baú.com

This bug used not to happen on Firefox version 1.0. It only began after the
update to version 1.01.
