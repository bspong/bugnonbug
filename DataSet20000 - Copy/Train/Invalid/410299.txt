Yesterday after I restored all of my bookmarks that were deleted in an update that was installed systematically late Friday night(12/28)I created 2 folders.  I realized that I did not need 1 of the folders so I went to delete the empty folder and it will not delete.  What's wrong and how do I delete the empty folder?

2.hit create new folder
3.
Actual Results:

Expected Results:  
expect to be able to delete the un-necessary folder
