I am not a computer savvy guy so I apologize if this is an easy fix. I have run into this issue a few times previously with this same web page but have got campus technicians to fix it for me. I am now wanting to know how to fix it myself as it is apparent that this will continue to affect me. I can not open the links on this web page in particular the 'zoning' and the ' neighborhoods' ones. I have installed the Adobe SVG viewer that appears, as well I have 'checked off' the open with rosetta box that you are told to and the links just will not open. The campus tech guy I had fix it a few months ago (I didnt see what he did to 'fix' it) said something about turning off Firefox native svg viewer or something. Im not sure what he meant as it doesnt make any sense to me. I just go to the web page and expect it to work and to open the links when I click them. I have talked to the City Department in charge of the web page and they say it is not an issue on their end and I don't think it is as I can access these on other computers, just not my mac. It seems that when the latest release of Firefox installed (within the last week) it must have reset what the tech guy did to 'fix' things for me. Now it has reset the default settings of the browser and I can no longer access these links. 
Please help as this is very frustrating.
Thank you
