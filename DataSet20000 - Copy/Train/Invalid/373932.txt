Hi,

I tried this with ff3 (minefield) and a clean profile and it crashes when I enter a very long string in the address bar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.enter a long string in address bar
2.press enter
3.crash (0xc0000005)



I am going to investigate this further, I tried this on my work desktop/laptop xp/w2k, both crashed, maybe it's because of other installed software.
