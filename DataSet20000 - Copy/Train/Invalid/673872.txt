Steps to reproduce:

I'll try to detect when menubar is active via CSS


Actual results:

With the last update (I use nigtly l10n channel) the property tabsintitlebar has been removed from #main-window object, now it is impossible to detect (via CSS) when menubar is active.


Expected results:

The property tabsintitlebar has been removed with the last automatically update of yesterday (I use the l10n nightly of Firefox 8.0a1). 
Before yesterday I could style in different way, with CSS, some objects when the option View->Menubar is enabled. 

I used this code:

#main-window:not(tabsintitlebar) #titlebar-buttonbox-container{
display:none !important;
}

to remove the Window buttons when the menubar is active, I use this because I have moved the buttons in nav-bar.

The problem is that if I don't detect when the menubar is active, I obtain a duplicate buttons box:

This is not a great issue,  but if you can fix adding a property to the #main-window do detect when the menubar is active, this help me :-)
