All bookmarks should be in exactly one folder (don't allow cutting and pasting from a folder to a tag, only copying)

All bookmarks should be in exactly one folder. Currently, a bookmark can be cut from a folder and then pasted into a tag (and a history item can be cut from the history list and pasted into a tag), which makes the tag the only location bookmark or history item. When the tag is removed, the item is deleted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a page. Bookmark it, adding a tag.
2. Visit another page. Bookmark it without tagging it.
3. In the Library, go to the non-tagged page's bookmark. Right-click it and select Cut.
4. Paste the item into the tag you created.
5. Look for a way to access it other than the tag view.
6. Remove the tag from the second page you bookmarked.
Actual Results:  
* After cut-pasting the bookmark into the tag, the tag is the only way you can access it.
* The bookmark disappears if you remove the tag from it.

Expected Results:  
It should not be possible to make a tag the only place a bookmark is located. Either the paste command should be disabled inside a tag when the item that is going to be pasted was cut from a folder, or the item should be moved to Unfiled Bookmarks and tagged.

When an item's only location is a tag, it is always shown as a bookmark by the awesomebar.
