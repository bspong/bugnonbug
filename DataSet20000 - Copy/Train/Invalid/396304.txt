I've visited the website http://www.frabirk-einkauf.com by chance. When I pressed the button in the middle of the page (more information) I noticed that the website  hat already monitored my IP adress and I closed firefox.

a few minutes later I got an email to the first email-adress in the list of my adresses in thunderbird to welcome me as a new customer.

Usually I never use this email adress with any form to fill in with firefox.
