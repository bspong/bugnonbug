Before using the Firefox "SADI" for a background image, of the three selections for a background, "Center," "Tile," and "Stretch,"  when I would use "Center" on a  picture that is taller than my screen (or wider) but not a square, it would set the picture, generally shrink it so I could see the while background with black background in the remaining space.  After using the "SADI" feature, the "Center" choice now lines the center of the picture with the center of my screen, and keeps the original size.
