some flash ads elude superadblocker only when a proxy server is in use

With the ad blocker superadblocker (trial version available from superadblocker.com) installed and configured to block flash ads, the ad blocking works extremely well if a proxy server is not configured.  However, if using MS ISA 2004 (on a different machine) as a proxy server, many flash ads are no longer blocked, although a few still are.  For the best demonstration, go to http://messages.yahoo.com/?action=q&board=UIS and click on a random selection of the available messages.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  install superadblocker & verify that the indicated links do not display any flash ads.
2.  reconfigure firefox to use an external proxy server (I don't know whether or not it would have to be MS ISA 2004)
3.  repeat viewing of messages
