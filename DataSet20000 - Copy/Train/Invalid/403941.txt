I have many bookmarks of local zip files containing manuals with hundreds of html pages that I cannot afford to extract to the filesystem. I use the jar:file: protocol to navigate into the zip file as if it was extracted. I have noticed that if you have set firefox to "Show blank page" at startup the page back and page forward functionality ignores any navigation history.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Options -> Main -> Startup -> When Firefox starts: -> Show blank page
2. Enter an address of the form jar:file: pointing to a zip file with html pages
3. Navigate through the pages

Actual Results:  
Your navigations gestures aren't kept through the forward and back buttons

Expected Results:  
Your navigations gestures aren kept through the forward and back buttons

This problem appears only when you set Options -> Main -> Startup -> When Firefox starts: -> Show blank page. There was an earlier version (I think 1.5) that this problem didn't exist.
