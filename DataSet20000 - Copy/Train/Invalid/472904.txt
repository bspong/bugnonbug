The Page Setup dialog is not correctly sized to fit it's contents. I took a screenshot but there doesn't seem to be the option to upload it here.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a print preview
2. Press the "Page Setup" button
3. Note that the dialog is chopped off about 100 pixels short of where it should be on the right - the "OK" button is almost completely off the edge of the dialog.



Tried restarting, print-previewing different websites, it always happens. Not sure how long it's been happening, it's not a function I use frequently.
