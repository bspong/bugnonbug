change wording of "Enable selected panels for ..."

If I go to a web page that has Console, Script, or Net enabled, I can disable them by unchecking the boxes and clicking "Enable selected panels for ...". The wording is bad here because I'm actually DISabling (not ENabling, as the button says). Change the wording to something unbiased like "Save settings for ...".
