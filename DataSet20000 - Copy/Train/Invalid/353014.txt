Crash after opening page [@ libflashplayer.so]

I saved the attached page under an older version of Firefox.  Opening it under 2.0b2 causes it to display with jumbled content, and then waiting a certain number of seconds or mousing over the jumbled content causes Firefox to crash hard.  I just sent in a Talkback report about this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Extract the attached page.
2.Open it by double-clicking on the .html file
3.Mouse over the jumbled content
