Bookmark Mismanagement
Something just went on the fritz...I cannot manage bookmarks at all!!  The 
Separators don't stay where you put them, and if you move a bookmark to another 
area of the list, it reshuffles everything.  This has never happened I wonder 
if I just reboot, will the world be sane once again?!?!

Help!!

Thanks, and Happy New One!
