Firefox expects an image file to be returned instead of html file.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070725 Firefox/2.0.0.6

When searching www.bookabite.com for a restaurant and clicking Search, firefox sends the data to the HTTP server but when it receives the result page it displays the error: The image “http://bookabite.gotdns.com/Search” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors. 

I have checked the HTTP server logs and the GET request from firefox stipulates Accept: image/png only. This problem does not occur in IE.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit www.bookabite.com
2.Populate the required fields
3.Press search
Actual Results:  
Received error message as listed above:
The image “http://bookabite.gotdns.com/Search” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors.

Expected Results:  
Returned a list of search results - see results from IE.
