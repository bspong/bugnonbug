Firefox crashes after memory upgrade

I have been running a Gateway with no problems with 512Meg of ram. I upgraded to 1.5Gig and now it crashes frequently.  It does not matter what URL I am on - it seems to be random.  I am also seeing Firefox hand at times now, and I can exit using the TaskManager.

I have tried using IE for a day to see if it would run OK, and it does.  The computer is a Gateway with an Athalon 1.1 /133.  The memory is three PC133 512Meg SDRAM. (Max allowed on the motherboard)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open any web page
2.Navigate around and find a download (more than a couple meg)
3.Continue navigating.

Actual Results:  
Firefox may or may not close, if it does it sends a crash report to Mozilla.  When it crashes, Firefox.exe continues as a task and I either use Taskmanager to shut it down or if it hangs, I shut the machine down by holding the reset button in.

It may also hang and I shut it down with the TaskManager.

Expected Results:  
I did not expect the browser to hang or crash.
