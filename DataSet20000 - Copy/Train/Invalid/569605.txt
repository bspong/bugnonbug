Redirected links in background tabs show redirection warning
My STR were to middle click a link in someone's Facebook status. If I switch to the tab before the page loaded, I don't get the dropdown. If I let it load in the background and then switched, I see the dropdown.

The pref to do this is not set:
[12:21:09] johnath: prefs->advanced->general
[12:21:20] johnath: Warn me when web sites try to redirect or reload the page
[12:21:26] robarnold: that's not checked

It's terribly confusing because Minefield doesn't seem to have prevented the redirect it claims to be asking me to allow!
