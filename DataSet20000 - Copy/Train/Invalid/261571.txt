javascript from server a can modify frames loaded from server b (makes phising possible!)

Firefox does not prevent javascript to change the value of the "location.href"
object if the "location.href"-object is modified in the catch-block of a
try-catch-statement.
With this "methode" javascript from server a can modify frames which are loaded
from server b.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Build a page with 2 frames ("left" and "right"). 
2. Load a page like "https://www.paypal.com" in the right frame.
3. Use (local) javascript in the left frame to modify the value of
"top.right.location.href"
4. Firefox will fire an exception and will not allow you to modify the frame
(message will be: "Permission denied to get property Location.href").
5. Set a "try-catch"-block around your javascript and try to modify the right
frame again within the catch block.
6. Voila, no problem to modify Location.href anymore!

Actual Results:  
The object "location.href" can be manipulated by my javascript, although the
protocoll of "location.href" is https

Expected Results:  
Throw another exception or simply denies access to Location.href.
