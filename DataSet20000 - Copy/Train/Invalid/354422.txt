this is new. I am not sure which software changes prompted it, if any. I have installed videodownloader extensions, attempted to install getright as a download manager, which seemed to freeze my system, so I uninstalled it. The other changes are all to do with having installed firefox add-ons only Wizz RSS and video downloader. nothing to do with email. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open any site with a mailto link
2.click link
3.

Actual Results:  
a new browser window opens with googlemail online 

Expected Results:  
a write email window in thuderbird (my default email client program) to open with the contact email address in the "to" line 
no email window opens at all, with anything in any line

tried changing themes - same result. Have not yet tried uninstalling Wizz RSS, or videodownloader. But I notice that since I uninstalled getright and went back to the default firefow download manager, last night I tried to download a clip from youtube using videodownloader and the download manager never opened. I gave up. (This problem I have not fully explored to report on yet. The problems seem unrelated other than in time and post installing and uninstalling getright.)
