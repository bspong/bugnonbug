Fails to connect to multiple download servers

While downloading a bunch of installers it seemed like every other one would refuse to work. The ones that were taking forever to connect I tried cancelling and clicking retry, but still would hang on "connecting". It never seemed to connect. This was a fresh install of Firefox 3.6.9 that I grabbed Dec 19 2010 from ftp.mozilla.org/pub/

While filling out this form it seemed to go back to normal as I tried to do additional testing.

I downloaded Chrome (as you can see), used the "copy download link" to get the links, and opened them in Chrome and they worked fine. So this seems to be specific in Firefox.

(Don't worry, I'm still a Firefox user, Chrome hasn't won me over just because of this weird bug. :P )


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Freshly install Firefox (may or may not matter)
2.Try downloading installers in the order prescribed above.
Actual Results:  
Half of the downloads did not connect to the servers, just hung for a long time at "connecting".

Expected Results:  
The files should have downloaded normally

This is a fresh install of Firefox, on a fresh install of Win7 Professional 64-bit. There should be very little getting in the way of things. I don't think you guys could have missed this so I wouldn't be surprised if you can't reproduce it. It's very possibly just my computer finding a strange way of behaving.
