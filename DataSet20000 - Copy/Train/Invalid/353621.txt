When writing portions of an ANCHOR tag across multiple SCRIPT blocks with document.write(), the Page Info > Links tab will display the ANCHOR name as a combination of the scripts' contents and their output, up to and including the SCRIPT block that writes the closing ANCHOR tag. It does not include the SCRIPT block that wrote the opening ANCHOR tag.

Also reproduced on Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create at least two seperate SCRIPT blocks, one that creates an opening ANCHOR tag with document.write(), and another that closes it.
Actual Results:  
For the first broken link at the demonstration URL, the name will appear as “this broken link <!-- document.write("</a>"); // -->”
