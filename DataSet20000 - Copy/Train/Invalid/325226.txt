My web site created with Front Page 2000 is missing some elements that are shown on IE.  For example: the color of table borders is different; tables don't always correspond with the preview in Front Page.  For example, on my Michale Powell page the links at the top of the page are not distributed as they are in IE.

Reproducible: Always
