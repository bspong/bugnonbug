When I put my desktop to sleep and wake it up, after 2 or more sessions of this, clicking on a Firefox window (usually with some type of webmail) causes the whole screen to blank to white.  Unable to leave white screen with either (alt-tab, alt-f4, or ctl-alt-del).  

Only started happening recently (after 5.02 patch).

Desktop is using an Nvidia card (8800gtx) latest drivers and windows vista 64 home premium (8gb of physical mem, no paging file).  Quadcore 2.53Ghz.

Problem was also reported on UMPCPortal.com as happening with a Gigabyte M912 netbook w/ Firefox.. no details though.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open 2-3 firefox windows (with at least 1-3 tabs each)
2. Put machine to sleep, wake after several minutes or an hour.
3. Click on firefox window to make it frontmost..  
4. Repeat steps 2-3 several times (usually occurs after 2 wakes).
Actual Results:  
whole screen turns white.  no way to leave.

Requires Power button 30sec hold down or power switch reset.
(interesting enough, hdd looks like it's still working).

Expected Results:  
Give me a break, not white out the screen.. how about show the window properly
