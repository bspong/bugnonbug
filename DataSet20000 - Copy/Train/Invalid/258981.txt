After an apt-get upgrade, firefox segfaults on start
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.2; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko)
Build Identifier: 

I am running the Debian testing branch. I wanted to upgrade my system so I ran 
apt-get update then apt-get upgrade. I also forced the new openoffice.org 
version to install (apt-get install openoffice.org-bin) then I coded some XUL. 
I restarted my browser several times, modified my XUL files (registered as an 
extension in installed-chrome.txt), and when I restarted firefox once more, it 
suddenly segfaulted. firefox -chrome chrome://myextension/content still works, 
firefox file:///home/jonathan too but firefox www.somewebsite.com doesn't work.  
 
Well, if I give so much detail, it is because I really don't know where my 
problem comes from. I installed libcurl3 with apt-get, maybe it changed 
something ? For some site, I could get http://xulplanet.com working, but now it 
crashes all the time. Maybe I modified something with my extension ? But when I 
got the latest nightly and deleted my ~/.mozilla directory it still segfaulted.  
 
I can provide a strace / or gdb backtrace if necessary. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
launch firefox on www.somesite.com 
 
Actual Results:  
jonathan@Daisy:~/apps/firefox-old$ ./firefox http://www.linuxtoday.com 
./run-mozilla.sh: line 451:  5214 Erreur de segmentation  "$prog" ${1+"$@"} 

Expected Results:  
It should not have segfaulted ;)
