In blogs, people frequently post pictures that are links to the full versions of the picutres.  When viewing the picture, Firefox's automatic image resizing is bypassed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ensure that browser.enable_automatic_image_resizing is 'true'
2. View a blog (e.g., http://caseybirdphotos.blogspot.com/ )
3. Click on an image to view just that image (e.g., http://bp1.blogger.com/_u7T3TCoMIsU/RlSgixuU58I/AAAAAAAAALo/j0rJB3WqLZg/s1600-h/IMG_0817.jpg  which is also http://tinyurl.com/yv9afx )
3a. If this image is smaller than your browser window, resize your browser window so that it is smaller)
Actual Results:  
Picture remains at 100%, and there is no magnifying glass cursor.

Expected Results:  
Picture is scaled to fit the browser window, and has a magnifying glass cursor to allow the zoom to 100%.

This bug is also present in Firefox 2.0.x.
