I hope this is not a dupe, I have been trying to search in bugzilla for previous
bug reports but have not found anything.

It would be useful if there would be a column showing the exact time and date of
visit of each of the pages in history. When you visit a lot of pages a day, is
it a bit messy. (See History in Opera, it looks much more professional)
