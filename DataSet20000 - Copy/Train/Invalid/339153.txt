Occasionally in Norton Internet Security's Connections log, local and remote IPs on communicating ports will log as jgillick.nettripper.com.  This occurs on various ports that normally log as localhost.  I run Firefox with a number of extensions, but as far as I know, none of them were written by Gillick.  I also have a multitude of anti-virus and anti-spyware programs, and none seems to register anything odd.  It seems to occur randomly, but continues for the entire session.

Reproducible: Sometimes




This may have nothing to do with Firefox, but since all the information I could find indicates that Jeremy Gillick is (or was) part of the Mozilla development team, I figured I'd ask.
