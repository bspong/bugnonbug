Gmail does not display the text message. I can view my email message on IE but not FF8.0.

User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Steps to reproduce:

Tried clearing cache but did not help at all. Now viewing my gmail emails on IE instead of FF.  I do not like IE, but will have to use until this problem gets fixed. Attached in a screen shot of how the emails look on FF8.0.
