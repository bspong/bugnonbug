Roboform toolbar extension has recently switched to frozen XPCOM interfaces.
Unfortunately there is no way to get DOM TEXT nodes coordinates using only frozen API.
Please see attachment. It is our previous implementation of GetSizeInfo function.
I hope that you can add this function to Mozilla frozen API.
Because it is important feature for Roboform.

Reproducible: Always
