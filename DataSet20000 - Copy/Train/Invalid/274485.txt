The Tools | Page Info window has a Forms tab that lists all the FORMS that are
present in the page. The page in question (see above) has FOUR forms

1. Main ASP.NET Form (name Form1)
2. Login Form (name Login)
3. Google Search Form (name Google)
4. PayPal Donation Form (name PayPalDonation)

Forms 2..4 are within #1 because Form1 is the standard ASP.NET form.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the webpage (http://www.FocusOnPanama.com/)
2. In the browser select Tools | Page Info | Forms
3. It will list only forms #1,#3,#4 Form #2 is "swallowed". It does not appear in
   the list and if you look properly you will notice that its input fields
(Usuario/Password) now appear as if they were part of Form1.

Before the order was different (1,4,2,3) and in that case it was #4 that was
"swallowed" with its input fields being "taken" or "absorbed" into #1.

Actual Results:  
One of the forms is not listed

Expected Results:  
The form (Login) should have been listed as well
