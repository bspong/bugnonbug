1. Launch orca and enable speech.
2. Open the test page attached here.
3. Press <F7> to turn on caret browsing.
4. Press arrow key or Tab to focus on the checkbox 'wild animal'.

After speaking this checkbox 'wild animal', orca went on to speak the fourth row in the test page. It shouldn't do that.
