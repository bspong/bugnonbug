Steps to reproduce:

On Wednesday another person made a change to the content of one of our F5 devices (changed part of an iRule to fix a typo).  On Thursday morning it was discovered the that change had been "reversed" - I was the only person who had made a change on the box (to the same iRule but changing totally different text).










Actual results:

After investigating it transpired that when I logged onto the F5 device using Firefox the iRule in question displayed the typo as it was before being fixed - However the iRule displayed perfectly correctly on anybody elses machine using IE or FF. In addition it also displayed perfectly correct on my machine in IE *and* if I created a new profile under FF it displayed correctly under that as well.

Using Fiddler I re-created the issue and Fiddler decrypted the traffic coming back from the F5 and clearly shows that the F5 sends back the text in the iRule correctly but that FF displays the text incorrectly (see attached files)
