At first i have to say sorry for my bad english, but i hope you understand me.
The reopening of an Firefoxwindow (through the Taskbar, Right click > Mozilla Firefox) while a Firefoxdownloadwindow is active, causes a crash!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any Website.
2. Download something (the download has to be active while the process, that means a very large download).
3. Close the Website (only the Firefoxdownloadwindows is now open)
4. Rightclick on the Firefoxicon on the Windows7-Taskbar an select "Mozilla Firefox" (I don't know wheather Firefox has to be "ankered" on the Taskbar.)

Actual Results:  
It crashs, and the download starts again.

Expected Results:  
Not crash :D
