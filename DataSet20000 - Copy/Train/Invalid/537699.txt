In Ubuntu / Debian and some other forms of linux, FF leaks memory and blocks all other process's.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091215 Ubuntu/9.10 (karmic) Firefox/3.5.6

OK the first time I raised this issue of Firefox leaving like a seive under Linux, I had two Firefox fan bois wet themselves and say, "OH NOOOOO Firefox has NO leaks etc...."

Well after about 2 or 3 hang up (lock up) leaks per day, every day.... where Firefox consumes a few hundred meg of memory and the system BOGS to a halt, sometimes taking 10 minutes to flip to a command or a XKILL process.....

The second thing is that this issue of Firefox revving the systems guts out and grinding everything to a halt is a real issue for myself and other linux users.

There is ONE reply in one post, that says it's a Ubuntu issue and plenty of posts on how to KILL the Firefox process, but there is NOT MUCH AT ALL as to what is causing the actual memory leaks in FF that bogs down Ubuntu.

There are issues around "Blame Adobe for making such shit flash" and a few other treats.....

But anyway it's a long term outstanding issue - that remains unresolved, so I am copying this post into the Ubuntu forums and seeing what comes from this.

 So the issue is on getting to the actual root of the problem - Why does Firefox leak like a sieve under Ubuntu?

And what has to be done to SOLVE the problem instead of patching the crashes?
