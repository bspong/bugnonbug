Entire hard drive is displayed when file:///c:/ is entered enter url bar

Whenever you enter file:///c:/ into the url bar, the user's entire hard drive is
displayed on the page. This can lead to a possible security hole. IE does this
and it's one of the main reasons that it has such horrible security, and leads
to ultimately the ease of a hacker deleting someone's entire hard drive.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enter file:///c:/ into the url bar.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Entire hard drive was displayed

Expected Results:  
Not displayed anything: it is not part of the OS and should not be acting as
such for this instance (IE will display the hard drive since it's part of
windows, but it should not be doing so with firefox.)
