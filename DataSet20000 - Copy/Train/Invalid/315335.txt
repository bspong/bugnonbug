When I click on an image link, a dotted rectangle appears around the image. This behaviour did not occur in older Mozilla versions, and does not appear in MS IE.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto http://www.altavista.com/
2. Click and hold on the AltaVisa logo.
3. Keep mouse button held down, and move cursor off logo
4. A dotted "focus" box appears around the image



Expected Results:  
The dotted rectangle should not appear

CSS a:focus border:none has no effect, and the dotted rectangle does not appear to be removable.
