Previews after the second tab was closed

With the fix on bug 445369 it is possible to close the current selected tab within the Ctrl-Tab control. If you have a lot of tabs open, the list of previews is correctly updated - means the latest closed tab is removed. But if you only have 3 tabs open and you close a tab, its preview is not removed anymore and is replaced by the preview of the first tab.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open the following URLs into its own tab: 
     http://www.google.de/prdhp?hl=de&tab=wf
     http://news.google.de/nwshp?hl=de&tab=wn
     http://images.google.de/imghp?hl=de&tab=wi
2. Make sure the last tab is open
3. Press Ctrl+Tab so Google News is selected
4. Press Ctrl+W to close Google News

Expected result:
The tab which contained Google News is closed and the preview is removed from the list of tabs inside the Ctrl-Tab control. Following previews should be visible: Google Products, Google Images

Actual result:
The tab which contained Google News is closed but the list of tabs is not updated. I see following previews now: Google Products, Google Images, Google Products.

I'm not able to test this on Windows because there is no nightly build available for today. Will recheck tomorrow. Aleksej, can you run a test on Linux?
