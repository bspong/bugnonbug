firefox crashes and locks up my PC when scrolling up and down this page a few times.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT 5.0)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040626 Firefox/0.8

When I view this page, the navigation on the left side scrolls up and down as 
the user scrolls their browser.  However, after I scroll up and down a few 
times, Firefox crashes and then the whole PC locks up.  A reboot must be 
performed.  I tried to disable java script to prevent the lockup, but even with 
disabling javascript the browser, then the PC, crash.

I suspect the javascript is the problem, but I could be wrong.  The page is 
loading the JS from http://qa.mandrakesoft.com//twiki/scripts/common.js.  I 
looked at the JS code, and compared it to the advice given in the "broken web 
page faq" (http://www.mozilla.org/docs/web-developer/faq.html).  It seems that 
the JS does the proper thing by checking for the proper DOM api when it 
performs the checks in the first two lines of script.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox and load http://qa.mandrakesoft.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RpmHowTo
2. Using the mouse, drag the browser scrollbar up and down a few times (takes 
me about 5 times, up and down the page. 
3. The browser crashes, then my PC crashes.

It didn't seem to matter that I had disabled javascript.

Actual Results:  
the page loaded, and functions normally for a little while.  After moving up 
and down the page a few times, firefox crashed along with the pc

Expected Results:  
not crash.

I can't get a talkback since the whole pc crashes.  I'm using the default 
theme.  I have MS Win2k SP2 (build 5.00.2195), on an Athlon 1800 XP with 1Gb of 
ram.  Radeon 9500 gfx card.  I have Norton AV, ATI, Sound Blaster Audigy, MS 
Money sitting in my system toolbar.
