This is the first website that I have noticed the problem
(http://www.big-boys.com/articles/poorkid.html).

If I am in a new window of firefox, the embedded video player doesn't show, but
if it's the first (primary) window, it works fine.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close all instances of firefox
2. Load firefox
3. Create a new window (ctrl-n)
4. Close the first window you started (not the new one)
5. Go to the URL (http://www.big-boys.com/articles/poorkid.html)


Actual Results:  
Embedded video player doesn't show.  Just a blank space where it should be.


Expected Results:  
Showed an embedded video player with the video.
