Steps to reproduce:

http://jsfiddle.net/valeshino/mth9k/1/show/

Click the link, then click back, then forward.


Actual results:

The history elements for both the previous and current page are now changed to ?bar=1.


Expected results:

The initial page's history element should be changed to ?bar=1 and the following page should have its history element left in tact.

(using jQuery for simplicity)
$(window).bind('beforeunload', function() {
    window.history.replaceState({}, 'replaced', '?bar=1');
});

The replaceState call is made in the context of the current document, so it should only affect the current document's history.
