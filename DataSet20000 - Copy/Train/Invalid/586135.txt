Web Console input field isn't resized when the user presses Return

Proposed patch.

When the user presses Return to submit a long line of JavaScript, the Web Console field isn't resized. This problem also occurs on other events that change the value of that field without triggering key presses (undo, for example).

The attached patch fixes this.

Requesting blocking status for Firefox 4 because this is a serious UI issue with the Console.
