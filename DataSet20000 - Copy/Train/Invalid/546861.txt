Web pages like youtube keep saying i have firefox version 2.0.0.4 when have newest version
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/2.0.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/2.0.0.4

Not sure what could be causing this. It has been like this ever since version 3 came out. Already tired to uninstall multiple times and no new results. Even the addons site for firefox is saying I have version 2.0,0.4. In about menu, it says 3.6 as of now but at bottom and in build identifier. It still says 2.0.0.4

Reproducible: Always
