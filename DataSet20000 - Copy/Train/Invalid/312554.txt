This page doesn't display properly for firefox 1.07, 1.5 beta, the nightly
build, and mozilla suite.  

Notice how the 'welcome' logo is not centered on the screen and the page
displays about seven screens wide.

I would have put this url in the general feedback page, but I found it strange
that it displays fine on firefox 1.07 for the mac with os 10.4.2

FWIW, it is fine on Safari & ie.  Sorry I can't analyze it further, but I just
don't know html.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to above url
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
page displayed is not centered and is very wide

Expected Results:  
expected it to display on one screen
