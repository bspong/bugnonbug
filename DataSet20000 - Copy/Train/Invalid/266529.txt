Links to .swf files bring up download dialog, even when Shockwave is properly installed

I have the latest version of Flash and Shockwave installed, and the
Macromedia.com site works and verifies this when the .swf is embedded:
http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/welcome/

In the test case provided,
http://us.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=213&subcategory=214&product=10795&campid=20504#),
clicking the "View 360" link opens a blank window, and then prompts to download
the .swf file.

Copying and pasting the URL to that .swf file in the location bar
(http://us.creative.com/images/flash/products/zenmicro/zenMicro360_template_final.swf)
works fine.

After loading it manually by visiting the URL, it presumably gets loaded into
cache.  After this, clicking the "View 360" link now works properly, loading the
.swf in the popup. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit
http://us.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=213&subcategory=214&product=10795&campid=20504#)
2. Click "View 360"
3. Watch a blank pop up appear, and a prompt to download the .swf objects

Actual Results:  
A blank pop up window appears, and a download dialog appears for the .swf object

Expected Results:  
The popup should load with the .swf file embedded in it.

I have checked in Tools -> Objects -> Downloads, and the Macromedia plugins are
enabled.
