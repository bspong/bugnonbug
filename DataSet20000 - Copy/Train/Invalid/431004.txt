I download the latest version of Firefox from Taiwan site, and after installation, the lower part of the screen appear a text box that covered about 1/5 of the screen that cannot be minimized by any means.  I tried to uninstall and re-install the Firefox but the same old problem exist. It seems to be some bugs but my limitation of knowledge to computer programming cannot help to find out what exactly happened.  In the text box, I can only find 1 line of text "_________________________^ <menuitem  "   and that is all....no matter I visit which webpage, the words are still there....
