The new design of the PayPal homepage has on its left the buttons for "sign up", and "login". Behind those are links defined with "rel=nofollow". Clicking on those buttons does not have any visible effect. "Open link in new tab" opens the desired links.

Tried it with FF4 (same result) and IE9 (works).

Other links on the page (not "nofollow") work in both versions of FF,
therefore I suspect that this tag is causing a problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to the paypal site above
2. click on "login"
3.

Actual Results:  
Browser remains on the page

Expected Results:  
Browser loads new page, in this case the login page
