background colour and background image of parent element (e.g. DIV) do not apply to the whole element if margin-top and margin-bottom are specified for child element

In the following code, the area between the 2 HR's should be filled with a red
colour. In firefox deer park alpha 2 (1.0.6), this is not the case: the areas
covered by margin-top and margin-bottom do not have the red colour.

<div style="background-color:red;">
<p style="margin-top:5ex;margin-bottom:5ex;">
   shouldn't there be a red background, extending from 5ex above to 5ex below
this sentence (between the 2 hr's)? works so in IE 6.
</p>
</div>

Reproducible: Always




problem (?) occurs at least on Linux and Windows XP.
