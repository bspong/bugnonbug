Browse to https://www.mimsonline.com.viviena.library.unsw.edu.au and the site is untrusted. Technical details show that "www.mimsonline.com.viviena.library.unsw.edu.au" has an invalid security certificate. The DNS lookup for "*.library.unsw.edu.au" correctly matches this URL to the address 129.94.59.243. The certificate is for "*.library.unsw.edu.au". The certificate is valid.
The EzProxy URL rewriting proxy software has been using multiple levels of subdomains for years without a problem. RFC2818 introduces a new restriction which contradicts existing practice and makes impossible the use of perfectly valid existing software.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Browse to https://www.mimsonline.com.viviena.library.unsw.edu.au 
2.click technical details
3.
Actual Results:  
Browse to https://www.mimsonline.com.viviena.library.unsw.edu.au and the site is untrusted. Technical details show that "www.mimsonline.com.viviena.library.unsw.edu.au" has an invalid security certificate.

Expected Results:  
The browser should proceed to the site without warnings as was the case with version 3.0.10
The DNS resolution of www.mimsonline.com.viviena.library.unsw.edu.au matches the DNS entry *.library.unsw.edu.au so the certificate checking should match the DNS resolution.

Thousands of libraries use EzProxy for remote access to subscribed electronic content and have done so for years. This new innovation is causing untold error reports from concerned users at my univerity library who are at no more risk today than yesterday except that the browser software is now inconsistent in interpretation of URLs between DNS resolution and SSL certificate checking
