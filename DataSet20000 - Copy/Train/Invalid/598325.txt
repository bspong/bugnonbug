size in sync tab, view quota of preferences incorrectly reported as MB when it should be KB

Open Preferences, go to Sync tab, click on View Quota under the Firefox Sync Account heading. At the top, it says "You are currently using 460 KB." This is correct. However, in the table with each piece broken out, it says:

Bookmarks 7.1 MB
History 415 MB
Passwords 25.2 MB
Preferences 6.3 MB
Tabs 3.0 MB

I just installed the browser this morning, so I highly doubt I have accumulated 415 MB of History for it to sync. Further, even if that were right, it would not reconcile with the total offered at the top.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Preferences
2. Go to Sync tab
3. Click on link to View Quota
4. See that size of items is represented in MB and total is KB. How could multiple MB add up to KB?
Actual Results:  
You are currently using 460 KB.

Bookmarks 7.1 MB
History 415 MB
Passwords 25.2 MB
Preferences 6.3 MB
Tabs 3.0 MB

Expected Results:  
You are currently using 460 MB.

Bookmarks 7.1 MB
History 415 MB
Passwords 25.2 MB
Preferences 6.3 MB
Tabs 3.0 MB
