Today updated to FF 3.5. As soon as I open Facebook, begin to get leading dots in front of name Facebook in tab and in top row. FF freezes. After researching and playing w/ Safe mode for the last three hours, the problem is with Boost 9.4.0.  Disabled Boost and everything normal again. It also froze with Fast Dial installed and active, but with Boost disabled, FD is OK. Also noticed that Mem used by FF 3.5 got up to 1.4GB. Yes GB, not a mistake. Had 8 tabs open before opening FB.

This did not happen with pre-3.5.

Vista x64 AMD Phenom II x4 940 8 GB.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Boost 9.4.0 from available Facebook apps.
2.Open FF 3.5
3.Open FB
4.FB will be active very short time and freezes.
Actual Results:  
FB freezes. You will notice flashing leading dots in the FB tab and in first line at top left w/ name of program. Takes about 7 seconds. (with a Vista Ultimate x64 AMD x4 Phenom II 940 8 GB DDR). If you close FB tab fast, won't crash. Wait 1 second too long and you have to use Task Manager Processes to close. Will not close with Application End Task

Expected Results:  
Stayed stable

If I disable Boost everything back to normal. Feel this is minor UNLESS Boost is doing something that other programs may also do. I notifies the developers of Boost on this. Will update this bug if they respond with solution.
