This website: http://aidslex.stage.v51.biz/english/Home-Page/ contains a div with the class "sponsors", which does not always display in firefox.

The div displays properly in all browsers, except occasionally in Firefox. We have looked at the same page from 2 different computers( both using FF 3.6.12). On one computer the div displays fine, in the other it is not visible. Firebugs shows the element on the page, but it is greyed out. 

This is not a problem with the website! There is no script that is altering the display properties of this div. 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. using Firefox, Go to http://aidslex.stage.v51.biz/english/Home-Page/
2. see if div is there
3. If not try again on a different computer
Actual Results:  
Div is not visible and greyed out in firebugs.

Expected Results:  
div is visible

This is difficult to reproduce. Our client (on their computer) and one of our developer's computers reproduces this error using firefox. All other browsers and all other computers are displaying correctly.
