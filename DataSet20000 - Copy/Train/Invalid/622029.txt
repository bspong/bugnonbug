Justin Samuel is now working for, and submitting code to, Firefox.  He is a well known FBI informant with a record for subverting organizations internally.  How can we brand Firefox a “safe and secure” browser with someone who signed a plea agreement obligating him to provide information directly to the FBI?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1: Hire well known FBI Informant
2: Compromise codebase
Actual Results:  
Losing all trust from OSS community.

Expected Results:  
Known untrustworthy people shouldn't be permitted to work on trusted projects. Should be held accountable for their actions. 

Get rid of the guy.  This is a sad sad day he turned up here.

Yes this is a human interface bug and not a code fix but figured might as well report it here given it's a bug nevertheless.
