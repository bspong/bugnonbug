The "Go Back/Go Forward" toolbar buttons in the "Bookmarks -> Organize Bookmarks" window have some graphic glitches and change position depending on whether they are active or not. This with the default theme on Mac OS X.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the "Bookmarks -> Organize Bookmarks" window and note the "Go Forward" button isn't completely drawn;
2. Click on a folder to make the "Go Back" button become active;
3. No "Go Back" and note how the "Go Forward" button changes position and now partially overlaps the "Go Back" button.



The attached screenshots illustrate the problems described above.
