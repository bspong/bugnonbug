The Haptek player located at www.haptek.com will load in Firefox. I have installed this numerous times. After I get a successfully install message. I go back to the webpages that have the 3d characters and it comes up with you currently do not have a  version of haptek player which supports this page. Haptek has their latest release out. The player works fine in Internet Explorer. It may be a compatibility issue with the latest update of Firefox or a the lastest  update of Microsoft. Ihad this working back in December using Firefox. It has to be a Update issue.
