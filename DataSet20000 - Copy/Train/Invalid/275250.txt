Undo + Sort ends up delete bookmark [@ RDFContainerImpl::RemoveElementAt]
Combination of undo and sort deletes bookmarks accidentally.

Steps to reproduce.
1. Open bookmarks manager.
1. Create a folder which has 2 bookmarks.
2. Sort the folder.
3. Reorder these bookmarks with drag and drop.
4. Sort the folder
5. Undo

Actual Result:
The folder has only one bookmark. The other is gone.
Expected result:
Nothing happens.

I'm not sure which should be fixed: transaction or sort function.
Seamonkey's sort calls transactionmanager.clear(), btw.
