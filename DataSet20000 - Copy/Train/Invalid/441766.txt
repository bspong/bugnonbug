Program flow is broken during fast repeating of onclick event (probably also on other events)

Somethings goes wrong with events switching from FF2 into FF3.

Example code from provided URL can be download from here:
http://www.bobson.eu/bugzilla/firefox/events1/events1.tgz

Idea is simple.
Two div's are filled with data from HMTL request.
Steps of event:
1) clear div's
2) get data for div 1
3) concat cleared innerHTML of div 1 with new data ( innerHTML += )
4) get data for div 2
5) concat cleared innerHTML of div 2 with new data ( innerHTML += )

Event is run in onclick event of anchor.
When you click very fast (eg. using double-click button on mouse) it looks like program flow is broken because it seams to doing such:
clear div1; clear div1; concat div1 innerHTML; concat div1 innerHTML;

instead of doing:
clear div1; concat div1 innerHTML; clear div1; concat div1 innerHTML;

In very rare cases it even put data in wrong div - so its looks that:
- or it can happen that getElementById() return's wrong element 
- or local variables are not always loacal, 
- or data flow is broken and some code in function is skipped in execution

There is counter of requests in example put betwean [ and ]. As we see - sometimes its even not make events in proper order of clicks (it shall be asc sorted).


BTW - FF3 freez from time to time for 10-40sec (several times per day) - usually when I'm scrolling or typing text. Its normal?


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
[notice] its happen very often.
1. Open provided url
2. Start to click on anhor very fast to get doubled text in divs
Actual Results:  
[div id=t1]
t1: [110] This is generated on server.
[/div]
[div id=t2]
t2: [111] This is generated on server.
t2: [109] This is generated on server.
[/div]

or

[div id=t1]
t1: [116] This is generated on server.
t1: [117] This is generated on server.
[/div]
[div id=t2]
t2: [118] This is generated on server.
t2: [119] This is generated on server.
[/div]

very rare bug looks like :

[div id=t1]
t1: [116] This is generated on server.
t2: [118] This is generated on server.
[/div]
[div id=t2]
t2: [118] This is generated on server.
t2: [119] This is generated on server.
[/div]


Expected Results:  
every time:
[div id=t1]
t1: [126] This is generated on server.
[/div]
[div id=t2]
t2: [127] This is generated on server.
[/div]

My FF3 is installed on directiory of FF2 instalation. I also have firebug plugin installed. Dont know if this is important - we can reproduce this bug here on several PC's.
