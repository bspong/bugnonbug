After i did install new firefox 2 to my computer, i did notice, that when i leave it open last night and come back after sixteen hours, i can see firefox taking aroud 30 to 60 % cpu power and over 100mb memory. I have been tryed to save all tabs to favorites, but when i open them again, problem is back. That, what webpages i have been leaved open, seems to be no matter.

I did test this in my jobplace and problem is same in there too. Operating system version and build is same.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox
2. Open multible tabs, something like over then
3. Wait around 16 hours and look cpu and memory load

Actual Results:  
It takes so much power (athlon 64 3000+) that using any videoplayer makes video to heavy lag. 


This bug is no problem, if you shutdown computer some times and you are not leaving firefox open long time. But when you are doing something heavy, like searching information, reading news etc. same time and go sleep, school/work and continue from that, where you did leave it last night, it will start noing you.
