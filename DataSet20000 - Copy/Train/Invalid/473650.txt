When proxies are enabled and you want to bypass the proxy for local addresses you put that address in the No Proxy For text area. It works fine for domain names and full IP addresses. However when trying to bypass the proxy for a whole block of IP addresses it does not work.

Trying to bypass the proxy for address 10.6.1.49 (and all other addresses) should be able to be achieved by entering 10.0.0.0/24 however this is not the case. Entering the full IP address of 10.6.1.49 will give the desired result for that address but not for the others. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Setup Proxies
2.Enter Subnet mask to be bypassed
3.
Actual Results:  
The addresses supposedly being bypassed by the subnet mask were not being bypassed

Expected Results:  
The addresses should be bypassed
