I installed the new 1.5.01 version but it will not connect to my wireless network at home.  Hit "repair" multiple times and still will not connect.  Reinstall old version, hit repair, and bingo its connected.  Go back to new version and its a no-go again.  Old version works fine, new version will not.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install new version 1.5.01
2. attempt to connect to wireless network
3. hit "repair connection"

Actual Results:  
Will not connect to network.

Expected Results:  
Connect to network
