Note, I'm not clearing out my private data. History is set to 9 days.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click "Tools" > "Options" dialog and go to the "Main" tab
2. Select "show a blank page" from the "when firefox starts" combo box
3. click OK
4. restart firefox
5. open some tabs
6. close one of the tabs

Actual Results:  
The "Recently Closed Tabs" option in the "History" menu is greyed out. 

Also the history list in the "History" menu is empty.

Expected Results:  
After closing a tab, the "Recently Closed Tabs" menu should not be greyed out.

Also, some history items should appear in the "History" menu between the "Home" and "Recently Closed Tabs" items.

If I set "when firefox starts" back to "show my homepage" everything works fine. I didn't check to see what would happen if "show my windows and tabs from last time" was selected.
