Just installed Firefox 4.0 on my Windows 7 system. When i load it, it has 2 tabs preload and when it opens, on the taskbar, it is showing as if i had opened 2 Firefox Browsers opened at the same time, which would make people think they have extra browsers opening and try to close it down, as one would assume it is using memory. Previous version 3.6, just would show one browser open even if 5 tabs were open in that browser. 
Just helping out this beta.
Regards.
