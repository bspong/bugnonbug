[JavaScript Application] Error: current_domain is null

Since at least two builds ago, but not with the previous stable release, I see a popup message '[JavaScript Application] Error: current_domain is null' at startup.  My startup page appears to be triggering this; however, the startup page contains no JavaScript at all, just lazy HTML consisting of only the tags ul, li, and href (no html, head, body, or doctype declaration). 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start up browser with startup page containing incorrect HTML.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
JavaScript error message popup.

Expected Results:  
I would expect to see no error message, as poorly-formatted HTML exists.

I cannot rule out at this point if the problem is related to an extension which was updated (longurl) recently.  All other extensions have either remained the same since the last stable version, or have been disabled in the upgrade process.
