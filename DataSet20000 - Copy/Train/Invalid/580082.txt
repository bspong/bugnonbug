Tool for replaying web sessions for profiling, performance tracking
I would like to be able to capture a session with a web application and replay it multiple times with multiple different versions of Firefox, without touching any external server. This would be handy for eg tracking FF's performance on heavyweight web apps like gmail.

This could get as complex and fancy as you want it to. An initial cut could just replay HTTP responses (perhaps with some fuzzy matching if the response doesn't exactly match the earlier response). Other possible capabilities:

 - capture exact timing of the initial session and replay it with the same latencies
 - produce the same series of random numbers as in the original session (probably requires forcing the seed both during the original and replay sessions)
 - lie to the Javascript about the date and time
 - local storage, web sockets, mouse and keyboard events
 - what else?

I started looking into this, but I'll be working on something else for a while. Up for grabs!

Note that another major component would be the capture of the original session. To a first approximation, it seems like the NetExport extension to Firebug does this, although it needs to be updated to HAR 1.2 so it can capture binary responses.
