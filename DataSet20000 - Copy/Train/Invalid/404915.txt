Prior to latest update "Send To" would take me to the Gmail sending screen with the URL already loaded and the message "Sent to you using Google Toolbar" or something like that.  After the most recent update "Send to" takes me to the main Gmail screen, and I have to select "compose" and then write a message and paste the URL into the text body.

3.
Actual Results:

Expected Results:  
takes me to Gmail send mail screen with the URL of the website I was at already loaded and all I have to do is put in the email address(es) of the intended recipient(s)
