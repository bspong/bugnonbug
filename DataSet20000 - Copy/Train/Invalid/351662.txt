[OS X] Places popup shows up in Window menu with no title
Trunk, 20060907, Mac OS X 10.4.7

When you click the places button on the bookmarks toolbar, a little floating window appears.

* After this point, it appears in the Window menu as "" (no title). 
* Even after you've closed the popup, by clicking outside of it, the window is still in the Window menu, and can be brought back by selecting it there.

So strictly speaking, there are two bugs:

1) The window has no title (should it even appear in the Window menu?)
2) It is not closable.
