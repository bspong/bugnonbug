Sync with broken password, eats all the bandwidth
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:6.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.1

Steps to reproduce:

I force quite firefox this morning since it was hardlocked. When i opened it again it did and update. 


Actual results:

When it opened my connection was slow. I check my router and all the bandwidth was being used. I closed all the tabs. All the bandwidth being used. I closed firefox. No bandwidth. I opened firefox to the home page. All the bandwidth ( 1.5Mbps ). I disabled all add-ons. All the bandwidth. I closed firefox. No bandwidth. I opened firefox, and disabled sync ( it has been configured with a username and passoword that i changed a long time ago [ aka i get a yellow bar on the bottom saying "sync failed..username/password. blah blha] ).


Expected results:

Firefox should not eat all the bandwidth when sync is not even working, or doesn't have a working username/password combo. The bandwidth sucked at 1.5 Mbps for more then 5  mintues so not sure what it could have been doing.
