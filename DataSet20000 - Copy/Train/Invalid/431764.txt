I have been running trunk builds since last year, and lately firefox has started to become extremely slow in closing down.  To the point where it takes around 3-4 seconds after you've hit the 'X' or File->Quit before it actually closes down.  I've found that if you remove your profile folder and start fresh, firefox closes instantly again.  However over time it slowly takes longer and longer to close.  I'm not seeing this behavior with firefox 3b5 on my winxp partition, so it might be Linux only.

Reproducible: Always
