If you create a link in gaim (perhaps other external applications as well) to
http://`mkdir ~/helloworld`/ and click on it, it creates a helloworld directory
in the home directory.  This exploit was supposed to be fixed in firefox 1.07.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make an external link to http://`mkdir ~/helloworld`/
2. Click on it
3. The directory appears in your home directory

Actual Results:  
There was a helloworld directory in my home directory.

Expected Results:  
There shouldn't be a helloworld directory in my home directory.
