toolbar search should allow https

Several major search engines allow https searching, but there doesn't seem to be a way to convince the toolbar search box to use it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get an invite to Blekko's beta
2. Search many times with Blekko (some http, some https)
3. Use the down arrow to the left of toolbar search to set Blekko as the default engine
4. Search. Note that http is used, not https.



I would be happy to provide a blekko invite to anyone working on this bug :-) :-)
