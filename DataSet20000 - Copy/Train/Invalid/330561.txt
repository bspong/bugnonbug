If an image width is set in the embedded style(or in an external stylesheet)  with an em value, when you try to redimension the text size of the page via CRTL+"+"(or CTRL + "-" or CTRL + "0"), the image width changes only the first time you press the shortcut keys,then it doesn't change anymore;at this point, if you refresh the page the image assumes the correct width according to the text zoom level, so you will see that the image width was wrong before the refresh.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.set the width of an image in "em" in embedded or external stylesheet
2.press CTRL+"+" at least two time

Actual Results:  
the image width change only the first time you press the shortcut keys


Expected Results:  
the image width should change every time you press the text zoom shortcut keys

The behavior is correct if you set the width inside the "style" attribute of the image element.
