When searching using Vivisimo, the cursor fails to blink and allow search term input.  It just disappears.  If I click back in the box, it holds for a few seconds, then disappears.  Same for address bar when inputting URLs.

This has been consistent for at least a week.

I thought it might be a hardware or system problem, but this does NOT occur when I use Safari with the same operations.

I trashed and re-installed a new download of Firefox and the problem remained.

I have Cooliris—which is great—installed.  Might it be interferring?  Never did before.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open Firefox
2. type into search engine box
3.
Actual Results:  
cursor disappears

Expected Results:  
hold the spot so search terms could be completed
