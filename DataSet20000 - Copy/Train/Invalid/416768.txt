I tried to add the forecast option but it didn't finish adding; instead there is a popup window every time I open Firefox.

The popup window says "Forecastfox Options."  I can't do anything with it, nothing I tell it registers.  It just always pops up.  I want to get rid of it.  It's clear I'm not going to be able to add that forecast option.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I haven't tried to reproduce it.  It just comes up.  If just once it didn't come up, I would be happy and not bother you any more.


Actual Results:  
It got on my system after I clicked whatever that was to add the forecast.  

Expected Results:  
I expected to be able to dialog with the popup window but nothing I told it registered.  The popup window pops up every time I open Foxfire.
