Clicking vertical scrollbar caused mouse to freeze. On reboot, irrepairable system crash

Second day of taking Firefox 0.1 PR for a spin and mouse froze on scrollbar
(sometimes there was no scrollbars). Rebooted and had a total mess. Icons were
totally changed to a primitive Windows 98 default and worse, including My
Computer, etal. (Firefox icon was intact and it launched like normal.) IE was
totally gone and not reinstallable from the exe file. The IE folder was there
with only 250k in it instead of 80MB(?) previously. Same with other programs
even as big as 1GB, totally gone, fortunately the data remained. 

Rebooted again and couldn't get into Windows from POST. It took several efforts
to reinstall Win98 and be able to get my system usable 

Even the original setup files (entire app or program) were deleted or cannot be
found, including DX9. Many of these programs/apps cannot be reinstalled because
of missing or misplaced system files. 

Some apps and many files were found in Win98 folders named VCM, VCM.000, VCM.001
(where IE5.5 was found). I went to the Firefox site and downloaded 0.8 and there
was no problem with it, mostly, a lot of bookmarks were lost. The rest of my
system was still screwed however, and much of it still is as I cannot install
some programs from CD ROM.

Trying to find targets from shortcuts most always finds C:\...Mozilla
Firefox\xpicleanup.exe but has found a few apps from backups on another drive.
The numbewr of files in my C:\ directory more than doubled from 34 to 77.

There are numerous zip files in Win98 directory now such as Win98_22 thru
Win98_69 plus Driver_11 thru Driver_21 and others, which were never there before.

It seems impossible to delete and rearrange such a huge amount of GBs in the
brief time between getting froze and rebooting (10 or 15 seconds). Hard drives
don't move that fast. 


Reproducible: Didn't try
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on a vertical scrollbar on the Internet.
2. I would not want to reproduce it.
3.

Actual Results:  
The most unusual total crash I've ever experienced.

Expected Results:  
Scrollbar should have moved in accordance with mouse dragging (trying to drag).

I believe I had the Talkback crash ID on automatic, not sure. 

I got rid of FF 0.1 for 0.8

Version I had was from Tue. - Wed. or Thurs. Oct 5, 6 or 7.
