This applies to every part of the circuitcity website that I've tried where a purchase is possible. Immediately above the "add to wish list" button is supposed to be a green "add to cart" button but the button is not displayed. The button displays properly and works in Camino 1.6.3. (It doesn't display in SeaMonkey 1.1.11 either.) 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to Circuit City website
2.Choose an item to purchase
3.Look for the "add to cart" button
Actual Results:  
No "add to cart" button appears on the web page.

Expected Results:  
Add to cart button is present and can be used to make purchase

Problem is present in SeaMonkey 1.1.11 too. I tried to use the "report a broken web site" menu option but report didn't get sent. When I hit the back button in the report dialogue box, I was taken back to the entry page but the "submit report" was then grayed so I couldn't try again.
