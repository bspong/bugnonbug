When I split of a page to any side (top, left, etc..) the All-in-One gestures do not work in the split off window, only the main window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Split off a window
2.Attempt to use any all in one gesture in the newly split off window
3.
Actual Results:  
It treats it like a normal right click.

Expected Results:  
No all in one gestures worked.

All in one gestures should work in all split off windows
