A tag with the css property "text-decoration" set to none contained in another tag with it set to anything other that "none" will still show the line even if "!important" is used.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
HTML Example:

<style>
.aa {text-decoration:underline}
.bb {text-decoration:none}
.cc {text-decoration:none!important}
</style>


<div class="aa">
	underlined text
	<div class="bb">
		un-underlined text
	</div>
	underlined text
	<div class="cc">
		important un-underlined text
	</div>
	underlined text
</div>
Actual Results:  
text in classes "bb" and "cc" are underlined.

Expected Results:  
They should not be.

This happens for all text-decoration values such as: "underline", "line-through", "overline" and "blink". Other text-* properties like text-transform work as expected.

Weirdly Internet Explorer seems to have the same bug for "text-decoration" but also works ok with "text-transform".

I've submitted it with Normal severity since I don't know of any work-around for removing underline from a nested tag.
