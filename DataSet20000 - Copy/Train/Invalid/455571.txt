pdf files opened in Firefox tab just display garbage

When I open a pdf file for viewing inside Firefox, a whole bunch of messed characters is shown instead. If I open it with Acrobat Reader or MSIE, it shows correctly.
This behaviour is the same for files generated by printing from Firefox to Cute PDF Writer or elsewhere. If the file is in the internet, some of them open well, some not.
A file I generated by printing from Firefox to Cute PDF Writer and uploaded to Yahoo Groups can't be viewed OK in the internet. If downloaded, it can be seen correctly in Acrobat Reader, but not in Firefox.
I have Acrobat Reader 7.1.0 with plugin External Window Manager (Acrobat Browser Manager) 7.0.8.
This started after upgrading Firefox from 2.x to 3.0.
