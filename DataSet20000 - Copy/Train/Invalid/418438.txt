I'm not sure if this is a bug on your end, my end, or a "feature change". We have a Tiff viewing plugin which has more features than Quicktime. It works with Firefox 2.x, but not 3. 

I know that Safari recently removed the ability for plugins to over-ride the viewer for TIFF format files. I wanted to know if Firefox has done similarly before I spend too much time trying to figure out what went wrong.

Thanks
