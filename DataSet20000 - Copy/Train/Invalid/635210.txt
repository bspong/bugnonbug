Example I visit "YouTube" and then a page appears in front of me saying that the web page is blocked but there is an option button to continue loading to the site and I click It, After a while like whenever the internet cuts and reconnects , the message appears again. So My request it to Get Firefox to remember my option (continue) clicked previously. 

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
Remember My Option Clicked Forever 

I live in a school where their firewall have constant blocks to specific sites but a few of them have an option to continue like YouTube and Firefox website. The problem Is that I have to click continue all the time the internet refreshes or reconnects or even sometimes reloads. So Making Firefox remember that option would be awesome . Check the picture in the attachment for the kind of message and what I meant.
