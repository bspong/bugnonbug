Mail updater locks up sometimes.  Instead of showing window/block on lower right hand side of screen with # of messages and hyperlink, it shows up in upper left hand side of screen and is locked.  No amount of clicking will make it work and only a full system restart will rectify this problem.  (control+alt+delete+)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.as above.....cont+alt+delete and full system restart resets it
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
after system restart, works as advertised for an unspecified amount of time then happens again.

Expected Results:  
It usually displays a small window in the lower right hand side of the screen along with a tag in the middle of the screen that there are X number of emails waiting.

I've uninstalled the addon since the only other option was for it to be disabled and then once Mozilla restarts, it would restart also.
