I have a "News" folder in my Bookmarks Toolbar Folder.  This folder has a combination of live feeds (RSS) and regular URLs.  When opening Bookmarks -> Organize Bookmarks, the News folder only shows the live bookmarks.  The non-live bookmarks are NOT shown.  These same bookmarks are visible when navigating using the Bookmarks Toolbar Folder, or Bookmarks -> Bookmarks Toolbar Folder -> News

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Bookmarks -> Organize Bookmarks

see details above.
Actual Results:  
non-Live bookmarks are not shown

Expected Results:  
All bookmarks should be shown, in the same order as when clicking on the News folder.
