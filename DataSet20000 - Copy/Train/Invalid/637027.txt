Font Edita rendered at the wrong size

Screen capture of the problem, as displayed in the 2011-02-26 4.0b13pre nightly

At the website http://fontdeck.com/, a sample of the font "Edita" displays at the wrong size. Other browsers (Firefox 3.6.13, Safari 5.0.3) do not display this problem.

I have seen this in the latest nightly (2011-02-26 4.0b13pre) and in the last 3 versions (4.0beta10, 4.0beta11, 4.0beta12) of 4.0 beta.
