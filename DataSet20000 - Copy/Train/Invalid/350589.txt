The chat session opens what seems to be an expandable toolbar ( I can drag it to fill the page) It also pushes the Status bar below the Windows Task bar . 

This has happened before ( couple of months ago) and disappeared just as mysteriously . Just came back . Not sure what causes it but would like to get rid of this as it takes a third of the webpage space. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open FFox
2.Chat session appears when home page appears 
3.
