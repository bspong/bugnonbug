Slow response of firefox GUI on slow machines like Pentium III 500MHz.

I know, because of the multi platform library that it uses, the response will be slow, but isn't it possible to have something like an event cache that will atleast take care of the clicks and key depressions when the program is busy? I'm not sure; what i say is right but the slow response has to be addressed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make the system busy with things like video encoding.
2. Open very heavy websites, with a lot of DHTML and flash content.
3. The GUI will start slowing down.
4. Opening many tabs say like 20 tabs will help it further.




improving GUI performance will help in optimising the application as a whole.
