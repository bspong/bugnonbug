some objects don't load, even though they work in Netscape and IE
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030529 Mozilla Firebird/0.6

At several sites (including http://www.homestarrunner.com and
http://www.oddtodd.com), a Shockwave or Flash animation won't load; Firebird
will say "done loading" and if I right click on the object, it'll give the Flash
context menu but say "Object not loaded." 
Netscape 7 and IE both load these pages fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a webpage with Firebird that includes such an animation.
2. Observe.
Actual Results:  
Firebird says "done" on the status bar. If I right click on the object, it'll
give the Flash context menu but say "Object not loaded." 

Expected Results:  
Load the animation.
