This page looks wrong in Mozilla.  Other browsers display it correctly.  You suck!

Nah, I just wanted to say that.  Here's the true "gist".

Yes, I don't know why, but I know this happens on Win2000 and WinXP (it was
mentioned to me by a friend running Win2k).  Not only does the text and table
overlap, as seen properly in IE, but the other 'updates' also move up to overlap
each other.  It's insanely odd.

And yes, I checked the "Mozilla Web Developer FAQ" for standards, almost
standards, and quirks, and while that's fantastic for people who design
webpages, it doesn't help me debug them.

Reproducible: Always

I saw oddness.

overlapping each other.
