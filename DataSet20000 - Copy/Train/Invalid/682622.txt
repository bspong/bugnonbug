Frequent releases devalue firefox release names
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:6.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0
Build ID: 20110811165603

Steps to reproduce:

Nothing


Actual results:

Since firefox 5 Mozilla is starting to release Firefox versions more frequently


Expected results:

Firefox releases were perfect the way they are, Mozilla shouldn't have copied the idea of frequent releases from Google Chrome.

Firefox releases used to have a wikipedia page for each one:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_3
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_3.6
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_4

You can't even see the difference between Firefox 4, 5, and 6 with only minor changes between Firefox 4 and 6.

Small changes should be like 4.0.1, 4.0.2, and big ones as 4.1, 4.2 etc. and only major ones as 4, 5, and 6.


Now when a new "release" comes out I don't even bother sometimes to update because I know that there will be mostly nothing new except for a different number.

We should not copy from Google Chrome, when I have it it's just like "Oh, another release, probably nothing new there too".

Please change it back, the firefox community wouldn't have been successfully if we copied our competitors, there is a reason we were growing really fast why change it?
