There should be the option to have several tabbed homepages when the browser is opened.
I want google, wikipedia, voo2do and my blog site open all the time. If they all opened in seperate tabs - ie multiple tabbed homepages - it would be very handy.
At the moment I find myself habitually opening at least one or two extra tabs as soon as I open the browser.
