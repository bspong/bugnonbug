I have a <div> with contains two columns: left and right.  If I try to put a border around the div element, it only creates a line 1 pixel tall.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an html file that has a div element that has a border
2. Create two other div elements inside the original for left and right columns
3. 
Actual Results:  
The border for the outer element is only pixel tall

Expected Results:  
The border for the outer element should wrap around both the left and right columns.

I've tested it with IE6 on a Windows PC and with Opera 9.21 on a Mac and they render it correctly.  It fails under Firefox under Windows XP and Mac OS X 10.4
