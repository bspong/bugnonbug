when js fired in the frame overwrite itself, no textfields can have the caret
User-Agent:       Opera/9.64 (Windows NT 5.1; U; ja) Presto/2.1.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko/20090616 Minefield/3.6a1pre  buildID: 20090616042639

In the frame document, activating the js function that overwrite 
the frame document itself, get lost caret from all textfields 
all over the browser app.  I mean, can not give the caret to 
any textbox or textarea, not only inside content area but also 
other tabs, windows, and even UIs. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0. enable JavaScript.
1. open the testcase.
   same static documents appeare in upper and lower frames.
 (you can jump to step 6)
2. try to give the caret to any textfield. that's ok.
3. click the "write dynamic" link or button inside UPPER frame.
   this fires the js function that overwrite the document 
   in the LOWER frame.
4. try to give the caret to any textfield. that's ok.
5. click the "static doc" link inside lower frame to get back.
6. click the "write dynamic" link or button inside LOWER frame.
   this fires the js function that overwrite the document 
   in the LOWER frame ITSELF.
7. try to give the caret to any textfield. here is the point.

Actual Results:  
no textfield can has caret.

Expected Results:  
any textfield can has caret.

Once caret has gone, the situation carries on until any tab or window 
load some document.  Also, clicking "this doc" or "static doc" link 
in this testcase can get caret back.
