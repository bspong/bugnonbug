sessionrestore is not recursive anymore
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0.1
Build ID: 20110707182747

Steps to reproduce:

update recently


Actual results:

sessionrestore only displays one set of items. If you close firefox, install a program (which opens the browser when it completes), restart (to apply updates), you are left with only that one tab in session restore. This is extremely annoying with windows updates.


Expected results:

sessionrestore used to be recursive-able. When you restore a session, and then go to about:sessionrestore, there would be a new list of old items. You could do this again and again.
