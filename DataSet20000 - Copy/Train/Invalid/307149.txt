Scroll bars are missing from textarea when style overflow: hidden; is used
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050905 Firefox/1.0+

With Firefox 1.0.6, the scrollbar is there, but with Deer Park Alpha 2
(20050905), no scrollbar appears when I write more text than the text area can
hold. 

Reason is this style: textarea { overflow: hidden; }

Opera also seems to show scroll bars, but I really don't know what is the
correct behaviour that browser should do in this situation, but I know at least
one page, where this style is used, so I would either want to get this bug
fixed, or someone to tell me that this is the correct behaviour for this style,
so I can inform the webmasters about it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://personal.inet.fi/koti/aggro/hidden.html
2. Copy-paste this text to the bottom most text area: "aaaaa aaaaa aaaaa aaaaa
aaaaa aaaaa aaaaa aaaaa aaaaa aaaaa aaaaa bbbbb bbbbb bbbbb" (or fill it by
typing some words)

Actual Results:  
Notice that the last bbbbb bbbbb is not visible, and you can't do anything to
make it visible. (If you for some reason have bigger textarea or smaller font,
type some more letters to fill the textarea and try typing more and notice that
scrollbar doesn't appear and you can't see the end of the text.)

Expected Results:  
Scroll bars should appear to allow user to scroll text up and down to see the
end of the text also. ( Or someone should tell me that the current behaviour is
correct. )
