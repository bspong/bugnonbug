When hovering over URL links, Minefield remembers the length of the previous longest string, so if you hover over a long string link with say 50 characters, then hover over a link with only 20 characters, the URL text on the bottom of the page will have 30 blank spaces after the URL.  I am not sure if this is a bug or not and am using the 2/4/11 4.0pre12 Nightly, which is why I reported this bug as with a question mark.

See video to see what I am referring to.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See video.
Actual Results:  
Extra spaces after URL on the bottom of the screen.  Minefield seems to "remember" the longest string length.

Expected Results:  
No extra spaces in URL preview.
