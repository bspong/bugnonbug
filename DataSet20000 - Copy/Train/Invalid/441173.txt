When bookmarking a page through the Right-Click Tab>Bookmark This Tab feature, and attempting to place the bookmark into a folder-within-a-folder (such as Crafts>Knitting>How-To or Crafts>Clay>WhereToBuy), it doesn't show up in my bookmarks/folder toolbar. Neither does it show up in the Bookmarks>Organize Bookmarks>All Bookmarks window. I end up having to use the Right-Click Tab>Bookmark This Tab feature 2-3 times on the same page/tab. The bookmark does however, show up after one attempt if I place it outside of a folder, or into a single folder (such as Travel Sites).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Make sure you have multiple folders-within-a-folder on your bookmark toolbar. (ex. Crafts>Clay>WhereToBuy)
2.Right-Click Tab>Bookmark This Tab
3.Place bookmark in a folder-within-a-folder. (ex. Crafts>Clay>WhereToBuy)
4.Check the folder on your bookmark toolbar for new bookmark.
5.Must repeat steps 1-3 a second or third time in order to actually create a new bookmark.
Actual Results:  
My new bookmark does not appear anywhere in my bookmarks or folders until I have bookmarked the page a second or third time.

Expected Results:  
The page should have been bookmarked to the correct folder the first time I bookmarked it.
