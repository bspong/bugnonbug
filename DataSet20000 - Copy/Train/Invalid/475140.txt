Hang after download completed (during Norton AV scan) on Win7

I am running into an application hang (Firefox) issue that only occurs when downloading a multi-megabyte file while Norton AV is enabled. (It occurs immediately after the download completes, while firefox 3.1 beta says "scanning for viruses".)   An O/S(Windows 7) reboot is required to clear the hang. I have NOT attempted to duplicate this problem on any other Windows O/S, so Windows 7 may be required to duplicate.

This DOES occur with firefox in safe mode.
This DOES occur with Norton 360 AV "Microsoft Office Automatic Scan" set to DISABLED. (which BTW seems to be the default in Norton360 v3)
This DOES NOT occur if I set browser.download.manager.scanWhenDone to false.
This DOES NOT occur if I disable Norton AV Auto-protect.
 
If I successfully complete the download of a file using Firefox 3.1 beta, it will not seem to easily happen again with that exact same file, so choose another one for testing.  

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Windows 7 Build 7000 -32bit
2.Install Norton 360 v3 - 3.0.0.61
3.Install Firefox 3.1 nightly 32-bit build
4.Attempt to download a multi-megabyte binary file.  (It has sometimes taken ~6 files downloaded from places like ftp.mozilla.org or download.com to cause the hang, but it usually occurs on the first try using urls specified above)
Actual Results:  
Firefox hangs at download complete during "scanning for viruses", and can not be killed by task manager or process explorer. An O/S reboot is required to clear the process.

Expected Results:  
Firefox would not hang during virus scan.

Windows 7 Beta - 32-bit - Build 7000
   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/beta-download.aspx
Norton 360 v3 (3.0.0.61)
   http://www.symantec.com/norton/beta/register.jsp?pvid=n3603beta
Firefox 3.1 32-bit Daily Beta build - 20090123

 
I am also going to report this issue to Symantec since this is a multiple software interaction issue.
 
============================================ 
Example files I have been able to duplicate this problem with:
 
Microsoft Netmon 3.2:  
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=f4db40af-1e08-4a21-a26b-ec2f4dc4190d&displaylang=en#filelist
 
Then click on the download button for the 32-bit executable.   
 
Firefox 3.1 Beta nightly builds:
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla-1.9.1/
 
Then click on the win32.installer.exe link.
=========================================================================
I will see if I can get process explorer to tell me any useful information about the threads that are running after the hang. I can repro this problem on demand (within 5 minutes), so let me know if there is any specific details needed to progress the investigation. I have reproed on at least three different firefox 3.1 builds (starting with 3.1b2).

This seems similar (except no crash) to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=458667
