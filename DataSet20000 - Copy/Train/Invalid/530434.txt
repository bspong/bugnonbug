It does however work on the default Kubuntu install of 3.5.5

Reproducible: Always

1. Go to a website with a JAva applet
2.
3.

Expected Results:

I tried creating a symlink from /home/nigel/firefox/plugins to /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so
ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so

but that didn't work.
I also tried:
ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.15/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so

but that didn't work either.
