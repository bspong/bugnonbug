It does work with IE.  I originally registered for timeselect with firefox and
have not done so using IE.  I should mentyion that I'm NOT using the free 14 day
trail, I have a home delivery subscription which I registered with my online
NYTimes id.  This may be new as I think it did work when I first signed up. 
I've gone to more recent nightly since then.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.log in at the nytimes
2.choose the Editorials/Op-Ed option on the left ot the home page
3.

Actual Results:  
I get a "different" page with firefox.  the firefox page offer a free 14 day
trail for timesselect instead of working links for the columns ( I used Herbert
for my testing )



when I go into my member profile; purchase history it shows I have times select
( yes I can see this page fine with firefox )
