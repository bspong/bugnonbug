When using the "End" key to scroll to the bottom of https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/approval.php the navigation bar is displayed where it shouldn't be.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to https://addons.mozilla.org/developers
2. Go to the "Approval Queue" (not all users can do this)
3. Hit the 'End' key
Actual Results:  
The navigation bar is displayed at on top of other content where it is not supposed to be.

Expected Results:  
The navigation bar should not be displayed anywhere else but the top of the page

This is my first bug, I hope I did it right!
