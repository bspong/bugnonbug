Firefox 2.x no longer recognizes the command "- profilemanager"
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.8) Gecko/20061115 Ubuntu/dapper-security Firefox/1.5.0.8
Build Identifier: Ubuntu

It seems the Profile Manager does not function properly.  If on the commandline the command "firefox -P 'Profilename'" or "firefox -profilemanager" no longer does anything.  It is as if the function has changed in how it is to be executed. . . but obviously the command should still be the same.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. run in anyway "firefox -profilemanager" and nothing will occur the browser will come up with default profile or previously set one
2. run "firefox -P 'profilename'" and it ignores the requested profile in favor of opening a new window of an already opened profile
3.
Actual Results:  
see above

Expected Results:  
when runing "firefox -p 'Profilename'" or "firefox-P 'Profilename'" it shoult open the profile regardless of what is opened and never open the default, but only open the requested profile

I think this may be a problem in older releases but I seem to be able to work fine in firefox-1.5.0.8, although it will not allow new windows of the same profile open at once. . .
