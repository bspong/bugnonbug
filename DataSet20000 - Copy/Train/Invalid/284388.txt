Web pages take very long time to load through proxy server
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Firefox/1.0.1 and Firefox/1.0

Firefox takes a long time to display the websites when configured to run 
through our corporate proxy server. The proxy server is MailMarshall 6. The 
platforms I have tested on are Windows XP and 2000. The versions I have tested 
are 1.0 and 1.0.1. Firefox in 1.0 released the ability to pass through user 
name and passwords to network proxies for seamless web browsing. Typically a 
website will take 1-2 minutes loading. I can provide edited network traces. 

I then tested with IE and the browser performs as expected - loading webpages 
on demand. I am wondering if there is a problem with the NTLSSM Firefox 
integrated authentication. I do not have another NT based authentication proxy 
server to test the connections with. Firefox does not consume more than 30 
percent CPU at any given time. There is a lot of http traffic generated at 
intervals and what looks like reset connections.

In order for Firefox to be accepted in Corporate networks it must be 
compatible with all proxys.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure browser to point to NT authentication based proxy (Webmarshall) 
configured port 8080.
2. Try to browse webpage
3. Wait 2 minutes to load each page

Actual Results:  
Waited about 2 minutes for each page to load - page does eventually load.

Expected Results:  
Web page  should load right away. 

Network traces can be obtained on request. (IP addresses will be changed)

Samples of Network output: 
HTTP     HTTP/1.1 407 Proxy Access Denied (text/html)
HTTP     HTTP/1.1 407 Proxy Access Denied, NTLMSSP_CHALLENGE

What I don't understand is why these messages show up in the trace but firefox 
doesn't stop trying/send an error message but keeps trying till it gets 
through.
