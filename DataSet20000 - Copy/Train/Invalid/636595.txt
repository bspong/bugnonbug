Whenever you open some web page that uses javascript and switch the tab to some other tab i.e stop viewing that page, firefox does not stop running that javascript. I hope that it is the same with other dynamic contents which are there on the web page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open the firefox browser and observe the resource that firefox consumes.
2.Now open some web pages using javascript(the mpre you open them the more it is visible).
3.Open a new tab in the same window and open any text based web page.
4.now observe the resources that firefox consumes.

You will observe that it consumes more resources than before even when you are not viewing the tabs which contains the javscript.
Actual Results:  
The resource consumption by firefox increases.

Expected Results:  
It should not waste resources on things which the user is not viewing.
