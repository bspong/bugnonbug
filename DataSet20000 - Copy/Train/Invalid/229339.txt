Icons inconsistent and/or ugly with Windows XP Service Pack 2 beta

I just installed the beta of Service Pack 2 for WinXP, and my toolbar and
bookmark icons are mangled (all icons seem affected, including such things as
the topic icons in the preferences page). They have differently colored squares
and/or indentations surrounding them. These come and go occasionally based on
things like whether you've recently moved over the icon, etc.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install XP SP2 Beta
2. Reboot
3. Launch Firebird

Actual Results:  
Icons mangled


Using the "Mozilla Firebird" theme.
