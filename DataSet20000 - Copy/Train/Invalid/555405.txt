Firefox functionality freezes up
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.2) Gecko/20100316 Firefox/3.6.2

After I recently downloaded the 3.6.2 update, I have begun to experience a decrease in functionality of Firefox after using it for around 10 to 15 minutes. After that time, I can no longer use Forms on websites. If a form utilizes a drop down box, clicking it will not make it drop down. To make matters worse, the same thing happens when I attempt to click the buttons on the browser itself (File, Edit, View, etc). Clicking these normally drops down options like opening a new tab or window, but after 10-15 minutes the box is blank. 

Finally, clicking the minimize, maximize and close buttons on the top right of the browser window don't do anything. If I want to close Firefox I have to right click on the tab on the taskbar and do so from there.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
These problems just happen after I am using the browser for 10-15 minutes.
