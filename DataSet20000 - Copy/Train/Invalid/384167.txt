I want to make a map having objects as keys.

Having the following html cut:
<input type="text" name="txt" id="txt0">
<input type="text" name="txt" id="txt1">

and then script contains the following code:
var a = new Object();
var t0 = document.getElementsByName("txt")[0];
var t1 = document.getElementsByName("txt")[1];

Well, having that t0 != t1 why the following access to the map returns the same object?
a[t0] = 1; 
a[t1] // Returns 1!


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create two or more "input" elements with same "name" attribute and different "id"
2. Create an empty object in javascript
3. Put to this element a dummy value (1 i.e.) with the first "input" (returned by an getElementsByName() call) as the key.
4. Verify the wrong behaviour getting the dummy value looking to the object with the second "input" as key
Actual Results:  
Following the details section:
a[t0] == a[t1]

Expected Results:  
a[t0] != a[t1]
