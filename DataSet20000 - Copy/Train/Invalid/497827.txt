Using Firefox 3.5 Preview (3.5b99), I notice that the color correction feature in the browser is screwed up for a selection of PNG images. For certain PNG images, the color correction cranks up the contrast on the image, causing a shift from the image that was expected. Saving and vieiwng the image yields its normal color, as well as viewing the image in other browsers - it is only in 3.5 Preview that this problem shows up. Disabling color correction fixes the problem, but given 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to a PNG image in Firefox 3.5 Preview
2a. Browse to the same image in another browser
 OR
2b. Save the image to the local computer.
3. Compared the image in Firefox to either the one in the other browser or the saved image.
Actual Results:  
For given images, the contrast of the image being shown in Firefox appears to be higher than the image saved to the computer or shown in the other browser.

Expected Results:  
The image should be the same regardless of where it is viewed, or at least the differences due to color correction should not be noticeable.
