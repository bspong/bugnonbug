- I can not open http://blackboard.binghamton.edu/ with FireFox, it seems that
there is something wrong with "redirection", since:
a) It can be opened fine using Netscape 7.2 & IE 6
b) If I put the target URL directly (for the Main page of blackboard)
http://blackboard.binghamton.edu/webapps/login
The page will open, but I'll not be able to login.
- Again, everything works fine (without doing any changes/settings...) on
Netscape 7.2 & IE.

-- Openning www.alrai.com => Causes hanging of the browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Just try to open:
http://blackboard.binghamton.edu/
-- For the other direct link, a username & password is needed! And if you need
to test a patch/fix, I can test it using my username/password.

-- Also, just try to open www.alrai.com, and the browser will hang!

Actual Results:  
Nothing! Just hanging!

Expected Results:  
Open the page!

I've similar problem with an Arabic site,
http://www.alrai.com, but it seems to be somthing with the HTML page itself,
than the use of Arabic in the page. Because I can access other Arabic pages
without any issues.
If you try accessing the www.alrai.com, the browser will HANG, and you will need
to KILL the browser. The same problem repreduces on Linux too. And as before
everything works fine on Netscape 7.2 & IE.
