In trying to access this site, I get the message "you must login With Cookies Enabled to access the AOPA forums". I have cookies set to "Accept cookies from sites" and "Keep until they expire".

I am able to access this site with (pardon my language) Internet Explorer.

(I tried to find a dupe report.  There were many on Cookies and if this one was there, excuse me for missing it.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just go to the link forums.aopa.org
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
I receive the message: "You must login With Cookies Enabled to access the AOPA forums."

Expected Results:  
I was sent to a differnet site (aopa.org) which, I presume, doesn't require cookies.

I should have linked to the forum.
