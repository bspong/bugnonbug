Firefox Hogs System's Resources

whenever firefox executes any command the browser hogs all of the system's resources slowing everything down to a drag. Examples: When i open firefox for the first time, it slows everything else that i am doing to a crawl. Also when i scroll or open a webpage is slows down the computer. I am not running a slow computer, and the applications that i run in the backround are not that demanding either. I have also checked the task manager and it shows that 100% of the CPU is being used when this happens. Please try and fix this with an update as soon as possible. Thank you.
