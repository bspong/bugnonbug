weather.com or gog.com cause all tabs to stay in loading status
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:7.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0
Build ID: 20110824172139

Steps to reproduce:

Firefox 7.0 beta

When I go to www.weather.com, and click on my saved location (this is the link: http://www.weather.com/weather/today/EIXX0017:1:EI), Firefox starts to behave as if there was no internet connection on all tabs. Even pages served by local IIS ( localhost addresses) do not work, also no other tabs work in the same process. If I restart the process it is happy days until I go to weather.com again.


Actual results:

Firefox behaves as if the internet connection was broken. The wait icon is spinning on all tabs that try to fetch new data and it stays like this until FF is restarted


Expected results:

It should have shown me the weather for my city and live on! :-)
