Newly-made bookmarks in Minefield take on the image of places/defaultFavicon.png.

Most of us themers use our own images for this. ATM, the only way we can use our own image is to put it in the Places directory and name it defaultFavicon.png.

This leaves us unable to make hover and active states, though, so we can't really theme those buttons.

Reproducible: Always




If I am reading lxr correctly, the problem is here:

http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.8/source/browser/components/places/src/nsFaviconService.h#128

at the bottom, where 

#define FAVICON_DEFAULT_URL "chrome://browser/skin/places/defaultFavicon.png"

occurs. 

Nothing I have done with various ID's and classes can get the browser to respond to hover and active states, which is part of improving the accessibility of the browser.
