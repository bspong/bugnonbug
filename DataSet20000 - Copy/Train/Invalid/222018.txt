Calendar extension not shown on browser interface.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.4) Gecko/20030624

I installed the calendar extension. After restarting the browser, I was
expecting something similar to Mozilla: an icon in the bottom left where I can
run the calendar from.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the Calendar (http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/)
2. Restart the browser
3. Result: no icons are displayed in the bottom left.
4. Close browser
5. Start the calendar (add '-calendar' to the command line)
6. Result: there are both the calendar AND the firebird Icons

Actual Results:  
Firebird does not display the icons that are available when you run the calendar
through firebird.

Expected Results:  
Firebird should allow for the calendar icon to be accessed.

Using theme (Orbit 3+1).

Current workaround: start firebird with the '-calendar' option and click on the
browser icon. This loads the calendar AND allows me to use the browser. Quite a
pain if you just want to start the browser :-)
