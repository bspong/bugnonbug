Update Google icon for l10n search plugins
+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #421745 +++

Bug 436497 adds the new icon for the Google search plugin, in en-US. Localizations that have custom versions of these icons should probably use the same ones.

These searches find some old .src plugins, as well as plugins with the same filenames as the en-US plugins. These should be removed, since they're not actually used.
