Noscript-addon is on the list, but no icon on statusbar and it seems to allow
all actions (no questioning as it used to and no sound). I doubt, if it is working
at all. I tried to uninstall and install again, also disabled 'avg safe surch'

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
uninstalled firefox and all its add-ons. New setup and istallation of add-on did 
not help.
