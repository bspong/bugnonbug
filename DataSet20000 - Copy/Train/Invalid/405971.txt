"New Smart Bookmark..." contextual menu item
In areas where we have the "New Bookmark..." contextual menu item (bookmarks toolbar, bookmarks sidebar, library window), I think we should add the item "New Smart Bookmark..." (OS X) and "New Saved Search..." (Windows, Linux), which loads the advanced search UI in the Library window.

One open question is if we should leverage external consistency with the native OS file system for our naming (which makes documentation more complex), or choose a cross platform name (which users may not be familiar with).
