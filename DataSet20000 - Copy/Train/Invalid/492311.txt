slashdot.org home page is detected as an RSS feed (shows Add to Google page)
For about the past three days, trying to go to http://slashdot.org shows the "Add to Google" page.

Presumably since the 3.0.10 upgrade, Firefox now thinks that slashdot.org is serving an RSS feed rather than an HTML page.

Assuming Slashdot treats all user agents equally, this is not the case.  (Note the text/html MIME type.)

$ wget -cv "http://slashdot.org"
--14:40:03--  http://slashdot.org/
           => `index.html'
