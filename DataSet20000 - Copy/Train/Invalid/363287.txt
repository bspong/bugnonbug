I have used Firefox almost exclusively for years. As of today, I am getting rid of any trace of it on my computer and never using it again. Since I downloaded the new Firefox a few days ago, using my computer has become a total nightmare. It is constantly freezing up to the point where I need to turn it of and reboot. I get errors at least once an hour which require Firefox to shut down. Downloading the new Firefox was one of the hugest mistakes I've made regarding my computer in a very long time. It's really sad, because I loved Firefox and never used any other browser. Goodbye.
