The keyboard shortcut for Firefox panorama seems to have changed to Ctrl+E - while the Panorama intro video mentions it as Ctrl+Space. Please remap it to Ctrl+Space as most early adopters of Panorama/TabCandy are used to it and it's counter productive to forget and re-learn the shortcut.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Hit Ctrl+Space
2. 
3.
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
Activate Panorama view.
