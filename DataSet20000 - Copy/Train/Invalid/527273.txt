Hi,
2 main buttons at Navigation tab are BACK and FORWARD.
BACK button allows to return to previous page. FORWARD button allows to go to next page when you navigate ahead.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start browser
2. Go ahead a few pages to have a list of them to jump back or return ahaed.
3. See FORWARD button
5. There is a drop-down arrow and window available to be open for quick navigation
6. See BACK button
7. No drop-down window available here.
8. No quick navigation is possible like you may do with FORWARD button.
9. This is bug!
