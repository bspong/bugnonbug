Video player used on comcast.net does not work when Adblock + is enabled.

This is a recent development that I believe may have coincided with a recent Firefox auto update (within last 3 days), though I'm not positive. I think I recollect an Adobe Flash update also around the same time. My Flash is currently at 10.0.45.2. Yourtube video player works fine. After I click a video my status bar seems to be normal, showing that data is being transferred, but it never completes and no video plays. A normal indicator that a video is loading is an animated arrow in the middle of the video screen. That does not occur when Adblock + is enabled. As soon as I disable Adblock + 1.1.3 and restart Firefox, videos work fine. I have enabled and disabled adblock + several times and there is no mistaking the symptom I described.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I already have adblock + installed and enabled.
2.Then Go to http://www.comcast.net/video/is-sandra-bullock-back-home-/1451136596/Comcast/1450740980/ This goes directly to a video on comcast.net Fancast.
3.If this video is not available, click on one of the others displayed vertically on the left.
3.
Actual Results:  
No video plays and there is no animated - circling arrow in the middle of the screen which is the normal indicator a video is loading. My web status bar says data is transferring.

Expected Results:  
Video loads and starts within a couple seconds.

The comcast video player usually plays an advertisement first. I did not see any other areas of the screen where an ad appeared when Adblock + was enabled. The video player may be the only ad window on the page. While playing an ad, It even says on top edge of the player frame: Advertisement - Your video will resume in xx seconds.

I never attempted to add the comcast fancast video player to the adblock + block list. I could try to remove it if I new what I was looking for.
