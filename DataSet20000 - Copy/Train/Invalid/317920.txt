Multiple visits when using apache's mod_rewrite
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

When I use .htaccess (the mod_rewrite) module to rewrite my url's (e.g. index.php?page=foo is displayed as foo.html), Firefox visits the url's more than once.

You can see this at http://www.westroute.be/ . When you visit the site, there will be a 1 on top of the page. Click "Home" or another link, and you will see the number increases with 5 or more.

As a result of this, my stats are totally wrong, so i think a lot of webdesigners won't be happy with this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit www.westroute.be .
2. Watch the number at the top of the page.
3. Click a link on the page.
4. Watch the number again.

Actual Results:  
The same as I described above.

Expected Results:  
The number should increase with one at the time (of course).
