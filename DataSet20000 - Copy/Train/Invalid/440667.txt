Hi, I cannot surf correctly because all pages are always in downloading/refreshing automatically. I've marked that If iask a tab to go to a page all tabs start to refresh their actual pages. As soon as one page is downloaded the browser refresh it restartin the download.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open firefox
2.open a page (ex www.nba.com)
3.open a new tab and anew pageinit (ex.www.cnn.com)
4. as soon as the first will be loaded the refresh of both tabs will begin
