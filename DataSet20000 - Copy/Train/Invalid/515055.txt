Ok, long and short is this, I went onto Netflix to watch a movie, on my computer, and when I went to go actaually play it it gave the following "error" message:

Instant Watching System Compatibility

To watch instantly, you'll need a computer that meets the following minimum requirements:

    * Windows
          o Windows XP with Service Pack 2, or Vista
          o Internet Explorer 6.0 or higher; or Firefox 2 or higher
          o 1.2 GHz processor
          o 512 MB RAM
    * Mac
          o An Intel-based Mac with OS 10.4.8 or later
          o Safari 3 or higher; or Firefox 2 or higher
          o 1 GB RAM

I understand that this is a "Pre Alpha" version, however, this should be able to do most, if not all, that it's predecessors have done (that previously did not require the necessity of a plug in).  I have watched many videos from various sites (youtube, google videos, Myspace, Facebook, MSN, AOL,Yahoo, Capella (My College Website), Hulu, CBS, ABC, NBC, SyFy etc).  All these sites have varying types of formats and cover most, if not all, formats that are commonly used.

Bottom line, I was wondering if there is a way to get the browser to report that it is in fact version 3.7 preAlpha 1 (or 3.7pA1, or something to that effect)to webpages.  This way, we could test to see if there is in fact a compatibility issue or if it's just blocked because the webpage thinks we aren't up to date.

Mind you, this has happened on other sites, but this is the most recent and I actually remembered to report it this time.

This would be a great help, to both you and your testers. Thanks!!!
