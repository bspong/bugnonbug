I cannot click and drag over text to select in any field. It causes the window to move horizontally instead of being locked in place. This occurs anywhere I click on the window and should only occur if I click and drag the window header.

I've tried maximizing to see if that would lock the window and it does not. This does not occur in any other program. All other programs remain locked in place when I attempt to highlight text.

Reproducible: Always

Expected Results:  
Window should remain locked to the desktop relative position and should NOT move when left-clicking and selecting text. Quite annoying.
