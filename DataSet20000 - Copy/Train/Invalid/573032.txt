I have some bookmarks in the bookmarks tab that when opened, they do not open in a new tab like some other bookmarks, they open right in the bookmarks tab. You can see in the screenshot, on the left Firefox screen that where the bookmarks tab is suppose to be, Firefox has opened the webpage instead of opening the bookmark in a new tab. You can see on the right screen where the bookmarks tab is and how that relates to it. It doesn't do it with all my bookmarks, but some do open in this manner.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click a bookmark in your bookmarks tab.
2. Bookmark will either open correctly, or it will open in the bookmarks tab.
Actual Results:  
Some bookmarks open correctly, but the ones that give me the issue are with onemanga.com. I have deleted the bookmarks and rebook marked the webpage again and it still gives me the same issue for onemanga.com

URLs are:
http://www.onemanga.com/Initial_D/566/

Expected Results:  
Bookmark should have opened in a new tab.
