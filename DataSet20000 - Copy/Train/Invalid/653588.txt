Firefox conducts a search without user authorization
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

Ever since I upgraded to Firefox 4.0, I have visited websites and for no reason, Firefox will try to conduct a search for something.  I will be reading down the page I am looking at, or watching a video on a webpage, and without any action on my part, suddenly Firefox will take me away from what I am viewing and try to conduct some kind of a search.  From what I can tell, the search may be different each time.  It is always a bunch of search terms that don't make sense to me.  It brings up my Yahoo search browser.  This is really annoying since I haven't done anything to prompt this search, and it navigates me away from the page that I am looking at.  Here is an example of the text I saw the last time this happened:  "static ak fbcdn proxy connect."  I cannot figure out what I am doing to bring this about.  I am simply reading or viewing a web pages content and for no reason (no mouse click - nothing) on my part this happens.  I have not observed that there is anything I am doing to cause this web search.
