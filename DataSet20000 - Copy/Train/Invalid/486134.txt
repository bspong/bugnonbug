Bookmarks disappear everytime I close Firefox. Same thing in the personal toolbar.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; fr; rv:1.9.0.8) Gecko/2009032609 Firefox/3.0.8 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

There was a little problem with the bookmarks I have had, when i was still using "SpeedUp My PC" (Uniblue Software): after using the cleaning fonction of this software, Firefox didn't keep my changes in the bookmarks and in the personnal toolbar (e.g., delete old link, add new link in bookmarks folder or in the personnal toolbar).
The only solution was to uninstall Firefox in order to have the default settings.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
I have uninstall both "SpeedUp My PC" & Firefox; I have deleted all Firefox folders, even the hidden one, to make a complete new installation without preferences, history, cache and everything.
No problem anymore.


Don't use "SpeedUp My PC" !
