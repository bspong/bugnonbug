firefox 3 ignores to scroll forward the whole page when the mousecursor is in a frame with a scrollbar

My english is not very good, but I try to explain the problem I found in Firefox 3 rc1:

When I move the mousecursor in FIREFOX 3rc1 to a frame with a scrollbar (in the sample-url to the frame with the pictures, where you can select the youtube-videos), and scroll with the touchpad of a macbook (two-finger-scrolling) in this frame, the cursor will hang only in this frame with the scrollbar, without to scroll forward through the whole webpage when the end of the frame is reached. 

Scrolling forward the page is then only possible when I move the cursor to the outside of the frame.

(In Firefox 2.x this Problem does not exist!!!)

Hope I could explain the Problem - it reduce the performance of the touchpad.

Thank you in advance.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move the cursor into a frame with a scrollbar.
2. Now scroll with the touchpad of a macbook (two-finger-scrolling) or with the mousewheel (without to move the mouse) within this frame.
3. 
Actual Results:  
The cursor hangs only in the frame with the scrollbar, without to scroll forward through the whole webpage.

Expected Results:  
Scrolling forward through page when the end of the frame with the scrollbar is reached without to hang in the frame.
