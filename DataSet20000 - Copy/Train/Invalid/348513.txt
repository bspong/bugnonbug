Had to recycle my DSL router.  When FireFox reloaded it was a NEW verion of 1.5.0.6 and the bookmarks were GONE!!  Nadda--zip--nothing!! Then it has changed the text size to something to small to read!  When I increase the text size it does not remember it the next time I open FireFox. 

The brower seems to work but IT AIN'T what I had and it AIN'T what I want!!
