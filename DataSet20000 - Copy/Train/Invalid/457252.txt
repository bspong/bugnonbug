Under some cases tables are rendered wrong. Tested on every Firefox 3 version, even nightly build. It worked nice on Firefox 2 and previous verions. 

Attached files show it. On a row in a table some cells in a row are not rendered, and the rest of cells in the same row are misplaced. Previous and later rows are rendered right. It happens on some rows but when it happens, it happens every time with that code.

Always I've observed this behaviour always when a CSS td:hover is present.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse attached HTML

Actual Results:  
Table is rendered wrong. Two cells on the seventh row (not counting header) are not rendered and the rest of cells on row are misplaced.

Expected Results:  
A table with all cells rendered.
