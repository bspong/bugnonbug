i've had this happen on several computers that i use...
i click on firefox and then nothing happens...
the hourglass displays for a moment then cursor goes to normal...
if i ctrl+alt+delete i see firefox in the task manager but it never displays...
i have to close firefox while in the task manager or it never works...
clicking again only starts another instance of firefox in the task manager...
this is getting very irritating and only started with v1.5.
