The 'alltabs' button behaves strangely
The 'alltabs' button behaves strangely:
when the panel is open by that button, the button gets status 'disabled', but one can still press the button to close the window, keep the button pressed for a second or two, release it, and the panel is reopened.

It would make more sense if the button works like a dropmarker, opening and closing the panel just like for a menulist.

This is caused/triggered by bug 464205.
