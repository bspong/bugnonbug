The default theme on mac needs to change. with panther the window style on mac
has changed significantly. Now its a lot more greyish.
This new layout makes the old pinstripe theme look totally/horibly/spectacularly
outof place. (sorry... having a bad day with my software).
The theme needs to change.
Change it to anything else you like but change it away from this current theme.

Btw anybody know how to get Qute for mac?(filing a seperate bug report for that)
