I have just installed Firefox 2.0 but apparently there seem to be a mass increase of memory usage compared to Firefox 1.5. I was wondering if this is a bug or could it be my computer preference? Memory usage rose to an average 75000 on a fresh firefox startup and climbs to over 100000 when there 3 tabs or more. I was wondering if this is a build bug, if yes, is there a fix. Otherwise please recommend. Thanks.

Reproducible: Always
