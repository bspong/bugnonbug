Sry, for my English. As I was using daily builds (installed from Ubundu Mozilla PPA) on Ubuntu everything was fine on ff-4.0b9 and and on earlier build (and next like 4.0b10). Now I'm on Linux Mint Debian Edition with ff-4.0b9 download in tar.gz from official Mozilla website, and I see strange App Tabs behavior: I can't just close them using "close tab", cause after that they stay there, and when I click on them then they reloads istead of quit.

I tried to record that problems. So you can download this video from Rapidshare (this moment I don't know better way to show you that). link: http://rapidshare.com/files/444502976/ff_strange_behavior-1.ogv

PS I tried to debug ff, while runing with -console flag, but in output there was nothing interesting.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download ff-4.0b9pre for linux from Mozilla webside.
2. Run ff and make App tab from any tab (even blank tab).
3. Try to close them...
4. Keep smiling :)
Actual Results:  
I'm not smiling :(

Expected Results:  
Make me happy!

Using by me other build than previous (on previous GNU/Linux disto) may be important.
