When I open a link in a new window (holding shift) my toolbars move around
I have the following extensions installed:
WeatherFox
Gmail Notifier
Adblock
FoxyTunes

When I open a link in a new window, Foxytunes (normally docked at the top) moves
to the bottom. This causes the window to be too wide and does not fit on screen
without moving the FoxyTunes bar somewhere. Screenshots available on request.
