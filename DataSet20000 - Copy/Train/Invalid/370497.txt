Having reported 2 problems (bugs) and not getting any answers, I am disappointed with Firefox 2.0.
After over a week using it (*I upgraded from Firefox 1.7 because of sudden problems), I find 2.0 very unstable. 1 out of 8 websites get stuck, often with a warning UNRESPONSIVE SCRIPT. But whether you click CANCEL or CONTINUE, nothing happens, except that the beachball continues, until the same window appears.
I ove Firefox's extensions and quick searches, but with these mishaps, I will go back to Safari.
