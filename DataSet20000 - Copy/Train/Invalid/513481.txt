I just downloaded the 3.7.a1pre and did nothing with it. The first thing that I spotted is that I couldn't use my bookmarks anymore (everything is fine, I can add them, delete them, modify them, but I can't use them).
If I click on a bookmark, firefox  does nothing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Click on a bookmark (either in the bar or in the bookmarks menu).
Actual Results:  
Nothing

Expected Results:  
Open my bookmark
