Multiple tabs open when I open the browser, even after I deleted the folder that these tabs were contained in.

I set up the browser to open with three favorite tabs, but decided that I didn't want to use three tabs when opening a new window. I am not able to stop the window from loading the three tabs even after deleting the tabs from the homepage folder, and even deleting the folder.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Open my browser and there are three tabs that automatically open


Currently using Noia 2.0 Theme. I have tried uninstalling firefox and reinstalling it, but it doesn't get rid of the multiple tabs.
