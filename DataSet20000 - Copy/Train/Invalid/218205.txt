links in the sidebar open in the main window instead of the sidebar

When creating a web sidebar for Firebird the html links will automatically open
up in the main window.  Which is not the way done in Mozilla where the target
must be set to _content

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a html page with links
2.Open in Firebird
3.Create a bookmark
4.Right click the bookmark
5.Select Properties and check Load this bookmark in sidebar
6.Click the bookmark
7.Then click the link in the sidebar

Actual Results:  
The link opens in the main window without being told to and not just the sidebar

Expected Results:  
Loaded the link in the sidebar

This should be fixed before Firebird 0.7 is released with Sidebar support.
