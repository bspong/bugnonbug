Downloading a .torrent file causes system to loose internet connection

Went to isohunt.com.  Clicked to download a .torrent file which opens my default program utorrent.  That part works ok, but then when I go back to browser, no more internet connection.  I even tried IE and my email program.  Windows no longer sees an internet connection.  Must reboot pc to get connection back.  Uninstalled firefox 3 beta 5 and all is back to normal.  I don't know if it matters but I'm using a router for my internet connection.

1.Open firefox 3 beta 5
2.Browse to any torrent search engine
3.click to download and open a .torrent file
4.default .torrent program opens up and starts downloading
