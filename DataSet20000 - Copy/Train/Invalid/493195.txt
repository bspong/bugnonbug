when watching a longer video it is constantly buffering even though the video is loaded

While watching a video online the amount of buffering has increased to every few seconds even when the entire video has loaded.  It causes the video to pause frequently over and over again for a few seconds, sometimes freezing it completely.  This also happened in the previous versions of FF.  I do have the Flash Blocker on but this problem showed up even before adding this tool to FF.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to webpage and begin video
2.Pause video until most or entire video has loaded (this might take a few minutes)
3.Let the video play and watch how much the video has to pause for Buffering over and over again
Actual Results:  
The video continued to buffer even when the video was through loading, every few seconds it would pause.

Expected Results:  
The video, once completely loaded, should be able to play without the need of buffering every few seconds.
