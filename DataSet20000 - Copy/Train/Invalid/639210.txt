Too long in a file upload window causes a hang-up on just about any activity.

Happens on any site with a file upload (i.e. imgur.com's picture upload). Occurs after browsing for too long in the local upload browsing box. If the upload browsing box is dismissed fast enough, it won't happen. I'm not sure exactly how long is needed to stay in the box to recreate it, but it can't be more than a few minutes.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find site with file upload (i.e. imgur.com)
2. Open upload box for computer
3. Browse for a few minutes
4. Exit box by selecting file or simply closing
5. Results
Actual Results:  
Firefox will now hangup on Flash/JS/reloading pages/just about anything UNLESS the mouse cursor is in movement over a FF window. Example: when reloading a page, after clicking the Reload, the user has to move the cursor around to see the progress. If they don't, the page won't reload until they do. 
Some activities can cause it to hang up indefinitely after activating this bug. Example: Operating some flash objects, like pressing a youtube video's pause button, while afflicted will cause the entire browser to freeze.

Currently, the only way I see to fix the problem is a complete restart of FF. The fresh restart should be fine until the steps to reproduce are followed again.

Expected Results:  
It shouldn't be hanging up everything and should proceed as normal.

Using FFb13pre, but has been getting the error sine about b8pre.
Using very few addons. ABP, Stylish, Memory Fox, LastPass, and Chatzilla.

Filed under critical because the software does "hang" as it says.
