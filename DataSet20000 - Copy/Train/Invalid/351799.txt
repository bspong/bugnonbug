when i opened firefox up today the status bar where it tells you how much of the web page you are loading up has left (green bar on bottem right corner) wasnt there anymore been to tools/options/content/advanced - and checked it and it was not set as hide so i ticked it and applied the setting and closed firefox and re opened it up again reapeated the steps but unticked it so it wouldnt hide and restarted firefox again.. and the status bar still wasnt down there.. also have scaned computer for virus's and spyware/adware etc.. and found nothing with norton anitivirus 2006 (most recent virus definitions updated) and with spydoctor (most recent definitions) still nothing found 


anyone have any ideas as to where the status bar has gone or how to get it back?
also tried uninstalling/reinstalling firefox and still had no status bar.. 

firefox version 1.5.0.6.
