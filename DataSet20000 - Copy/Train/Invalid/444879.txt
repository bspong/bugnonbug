When I try to access www.calmail.berkeley.edu through firefox the computer completely freezes. I have accessed www.calmail.berkeley.edu through IE several times. I tried visiting many other sites with firefox and all was okay. When I went back to www.calmail.berkeley.edu it froze again. 4 times in a row the same thing occured. While loading the site, the computer completely freezes. It does not restore on its own when left for a few minutes. I eventually have to hard boot the cpu. After hard booting I can browse the internet just fine as long as I do not access www.calmail.berkeley.edu with Firefox.

Actual Results:  
Computer completely freezes. Ctrl/alt/del does not work. alt/tab does not work. Nothing on the screen appears to be functioning. Hardboot is required.
