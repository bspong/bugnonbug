Opening firefox from PC start up is no problem. If firefox is closed for any reason it wont re-open and the only way to get firefox back is to re-start the PC.


Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
AFTER OPENING, CLOSE FIREFOX. WONT RE-OPEN

Expected Results:  
expect firefox to open and just carry on browsing. 

The only way I can continue browsing if I don't want to re-start the PC is to use Internet explorer
