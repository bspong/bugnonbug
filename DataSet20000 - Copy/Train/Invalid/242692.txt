I go to the web page http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ecn?s=EBAY, and then using the
context menu, set it to Reload Every 10s and then enable it.  I'm then using
another tab in the same window to do other things.  It works fine for a while
(anywhere from minutes to an hour) and then will crash and exit.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up a tab and navigate to http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ecn?s=EBAY
2. Set the Reload Every to be 10sec and enable it.
3. Open up a new tab and let it sit there.
4. Wait.

Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes with no message.

Expected Results:  
Not crash, or at least provide a reason why it crashed.
