mozilla-mplayer needs to emulate QT plug-in in pages like http://www.apple.com/trailers/newline/the_new_world/

URL above contains 6 embedded videos. QT plug-in, i believe, only caches them, and perhaps only caches 1 of them. It could be indicated by:
				<PARAM NAME="controller" VALUE="false">

Whatever the resolution, mplayer should not attempt to launch multiple video streams simultaneously, or immediately next to each other.

An embedded control from that page (1 of 6):
<object classid="clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B"  width="110" height="17" codebase="http://www.apple.com/qtactivex/qtplugin.cab">
				<PARAM NAME="src" VALUE="http://movies.apple.com/trailers/newline/the_new_world/img/trailer_img/JPG_MOV/480_1.mov">
				<param name="href" value="http://movies.apple.com/movies/newline/the_new_world/the_new_world_480p.mov">
				<PARAM NAME="controller" VALUE="false">

				<PARAM NAME="Target" VALUE="QuickTimePlayer">
				<PARAM NAME="pluginspage" VALUE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">
				<EMBED WIDTH="110" HEIGHT="17" TARGET="QuickTimePlayer" CONTROLLER="false" SRC="http://movies.apple.com/trailers/newline/the_new_world/img/trailer_img/JPG_MOV/480_1.mov" 
				HREF="http://movies.apple.com/movies/newline/the_new_world/the_new_world_480p.mov" BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BORDER="0" PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">
				</EMBED>		
				</object>

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Access the URLs
2. If you don't see multiple mplayer windows popping up, go to another URL, and try again.
3.

Actual Results:  
Multipl mplayer windows pop up.

Expected Results:  
No mplayer windows apparently need to pop up, because it appears all 6 embedded movies are there only for caching, probably based on bandwidth.

Cache the best available stream? Start playing it after it's downloaded? Not sure, but not multiple windows at once.
