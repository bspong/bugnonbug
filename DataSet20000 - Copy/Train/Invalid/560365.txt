[Regression] selection of 'awesomebar' search hits is moving around randomly. "Switch to tab"?
Not always reproducible - there must be at least one more factor I don't know yet.

Reproduction:
1. Focus location bar, type a part of a URL you have recently loaded
   (in my case, even a tab currently open)
2. Press "down" arrow key, to go into search results dropdown
3. press "up" and "down" arrow keys, to move between search results

Actual result:
The current selection jump to another item, usually 1-2 back back, i.e. while I go 3 up, it goes 1-2 down, forcing me to press "up" 4-5 times instead of 3 times.

Expected result:
No selection changes. When I press "up", it selection moves one up, and *stays* there.

Reason:
Wild guess: some async action is triggered when an item is selected, and when that finishes, the selection is changed, but at that time, I already moved on.
