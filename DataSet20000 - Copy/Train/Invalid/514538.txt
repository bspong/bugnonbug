I want to request a feature that has been on my mind for a long time.

Some pages display text in containers that are too narrow, and some -- too wide. I want to be able to easily change a width of text I happen to be reading. You may suggest resizing my browser's window, but this isn't convenient often. I often have lots of tabs open (tens of them), and I switch among them from time to time. Because text on different pages requires different widths to be comfortable to read, I'd have to resize the window too often for it to be pleasant. So, I'd like to have a VERY easy and fast way to control the width of a text block on a page. 

The way how MeasureIt extension (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/539) approaches measuring elements comes to mind. I think this would be pretty easy. I would simply draw a rectangle around a fragment of text, and the browser would extend it to the entire container (it may have to go up the hierarchy up to a certain level, which I don't yet know how would be determined).
