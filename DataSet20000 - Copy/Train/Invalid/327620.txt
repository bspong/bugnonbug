Flash on a website makes Firefox crash (SUSE)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; nl; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060126 SUSE/1.5.0.1-5.1 Firefox/1.5.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; nl; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060126 SUSE/1.5.0.1-5.1 Firefox/1.5.0.1

When I enter a website with a flash animation, the flash animation is downloaded, but it seemed to start to play before that was completed, and then the browser hung, frozen. I tried the same website with Mozilla 1.7.12, same flash plugin, and it worked OK, so the flashplayer nor the system seems to be the issue.
I first noticed on another computer using the same operating system and the same version of Firefox. (SuSE 9.3) This was another website.
After the crash I can only force shutdown the browser.

Reproducible: Always
