Basic authentication windows that popup asking for username/password for a page
are no longer modal in Firefox 1.5.

No browser activities such as switching tabs or navigating can occur until the
authentication window has been closed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to https://www.thawte.com/cgi/personal/contents.exe
2. After authentication window pops up, click browser


Actual Results:  
Authentication window goes behind browser window.

Expected Results:  
Authentication window should always be on top since browsing cannot continue
until window closed (either by entering correct username/password or canceling).
