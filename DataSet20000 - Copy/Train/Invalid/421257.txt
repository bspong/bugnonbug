When I quit FireFox and re-load it, all of my AdBlock subscriptions have been lost.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Adblock
2. Add a subscription
3. Restart FireFox
Actual Results:  
All subscriptions lost

Expected Results:  
They should all still be there

I tried installing Firefox 3 Beta 3, but it does the same on that as well. Additionally, my history keeps resetting to 0 days and wiping itself.
