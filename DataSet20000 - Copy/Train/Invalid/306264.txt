Having upgraded from v1.0 to 1.0.6 today, I now get the message 'The

checked that Mozilla is permitted by Windows XP firewall and am running no 
other firewalls.

I have had to resort to going back to Internet Explorer - which DOES work !!!

Actual Results:  
the following message appears:
'The connection was refused when attempting to contact start.mozilla.org'.

Expected Results:
