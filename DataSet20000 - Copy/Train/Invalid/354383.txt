Exception thrown from onmouseover, while an alert dialog is visible, makes statements after the alert not execute
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; Maxthon; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: 

in the following javascript code:
function ArrowClick(TrNr) {
if (MonitorMe)
   alert (WhoAmIText+"  ArrowClick-0  TrNr="+TrNr+"  CurrPosit="+CurrPosit);
  	var NextPict = CurrPosit + TrNr;
if (MonitorMe)
	alert (WhoAmIText+"  ArrowClick-1  NextPict="+NextPict+"  CurrPosit="+CurrPosit);
  	TblRows[CurrPosit].style.backgroundColor = SavedBGColour;
if (MonitorMe)
	alert (WhoAmIText+"  ArrowClick-2  NextPict="+NextPict+"  CurrPosit="+CurrPosit);
	ThumbClick(NextPict);
} //  --------------  end of function ArrowClick

if (MonitorMe)
   alert (WhoAmIText+"  ArrowClick-0  TrNr="+TrNr+"  CurrPosit="+CurrPosit);
gets executed, the following on not.

The next message is the the alert in the function ThumbClick.
This function follows immediatelly after the ArrowClick, and is called by ArrowClick as its last step.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.load the start-page of
www.rakovszky.info
2.click on the link "FireFox-Test" on the left side.

3.click in the downward arrow immediatelly under the happy-icon next to the thumbs.

4. Observe the Alert messages displaying the value of the variables.


Actual Results:  
The function is not executed properly.
Either part of it is not loaded into the memory, (Buffer overflow?)
or the simple instruction
  	var NextPict = CurrPosit + TrNr;
causes such an error, that the rest of the function is not executed.
(but then why is the function ThumbClick entered.

Expected Results:  
Run the same using Internet Explorer, Maxthon or Opera to see, what should happen.

This error was already reported twice. Once as an error in the core. Nothing has happened, not even an acknowledgement has been received.

...On this page the variable-monitoring is activated, so you can see, how a
variable is being lost.

These Picture-Gallery pages work in my standard Browser "Maxthon".

This is the first of many errors in Firefox!.
Please compare the site as displayed by Firefox and Maxthon.

I expect a reply within 24 hours. I know, that you may not be able to repair
the serious errors in your browser within this time, but I see no reason for
not confirming the error, or if you discover, that the cause is a known
incompatibility between the IE interpretation of Javascript and that of
FireFox, information of the necessary workarounds.

Instead of investigating the bug I reported, some other further down my priority list were observed and the original bug-report was hijacked for that error.
In wain have I pleaded for the investigation of the bug I reported, I only found stone-walling and a lack of understanding for the real problem.
(by the way, some of those helping to investigate the bug, displayed a certain lack of competence, for example, declaring the "onMouseOut" to be an undeclared variable, to mention just one.

Please do not try to click on any other button, arrow, picture, just on the one I specified.
When this problem is solved, or at least the cause discovered and described, there is time for the other bugs I found. It could be, that they cannot be tested properly until this bug is solved.

As my page works properly using other browsers, I am not dependent on FireFox, but I want those who swear by it, to be able to access the information on my pages.
If this bug-report is hijacked again, I will abandon any further cooperation and report it to organisations specialising in investigating possible security risks.
If you come to the conclusion, that you see some other error, write your own bug-report about it, and I will help to pinpoint it. 

Please do not change the summary without first discussing the change with me.
Any onesided chage will be regarded as sabotaging the investigation of this error, and interpreted as an attempt to hide some backdoor built into Firefox by one of the many authors.
