some pages look like chinese to me (not in chrome)

When I open the link 

http://www.expreso.com.mx/PortalNovo/sitio/nota.php?cod_idioma=3&cod_conteudo=29445&cod=313&tipoINICIO=&codconteudoINICIO=29445

I get what looks like china or japan characters (NOT extended ascii, I am very  familiarized with that stuff).

Some in other links. Something like 2% of the text I see is "garbage" (to me!).

Not with other browsers

Cheers

I often change between Portuguese, English (uk, us), French settings (I could even switch to Spanish or Italian, but I think that is not the case, recently).

So I have a few "switch language" plugins. I also use Portuguese, English and French dictionaries.

Sometimes I get English mail from (mainland) china or japan with occasional 1 or 2 "strange characters" in the text, but that has been happening for ages and has not been a problem.
