Gmail messages not loading in Firefox 3.6.3 Mac OS 10.6.3
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_3; en-us) AppleWebKit/531.22.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.5 Safari/531.22.7

I can login to gmail fine. I can delete and move messages from the inbox view. I cannot click on a message to view it. Gmail displays "loading" at the top, and never times out. This issue started 6/13/10 and I did not install any new add-ons. The last system update was on 5/27/10: "Java for Mac OS X 10.6 Update 2"

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Login to Gmail
2.Click a message subject
3."Loading" appears at top of page, but never resolves the message.
Actual Results:  
A page that appears to be static with the words "Loading..." at the top indefinitely.

Expected Results:  
I should have been able to view the email in my inbox, but I can only view the list, not the actual messages.

The loading spinner in firefox does not run, and the status bar at bottom reports "Done" for the page, although the gmail software still says "Loading...". New messages appear in the inbox, but I can't look at them.
