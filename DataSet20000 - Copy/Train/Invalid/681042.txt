control+enter has no response in the location bar in Windows
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:6.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0
Build ID: 20110811165603

Steps to reproduce:

type "yahoo" (without quotes) in the location bar and press control+enter


Actual results:

nothing


Expected results:

until recently Firefox would complete the location bar entry with http://www.yahoo.com

I have recently upgraded from Firefox version 3 to version 6.  Not sure when control+enter stopped working in this scenario.  I have also had no response to pressing enter after typing something in the location bar.  Clicking the arrow on the right side of the location bar is the only way I get a response.
