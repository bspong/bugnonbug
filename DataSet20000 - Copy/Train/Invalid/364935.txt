In Yahoo.com mail, there are three major frames on the display: the folders, summary and text frames.  Whether I try to make the folders (left hand) or summary (top right) frames smaller or larger, they ONLY get LARGER, until they reach their own limit, then they won't change.  I cannot return them to a smaller size.  I have tried this on Internet Explorer, and there is no problem resizing the frames in either vertical or horizontal, so it must be Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. get into Yahoo Mail
2. try to resize the top right frame (mail summary) or left hand frame (folders)
3. the frames described will ONLY get LARGER, and cannot be returned to the correct size

Actual Results:  
Each time, the frames got larger, and by an unpredictable amount having little to do with my cursor (grabby) movement.  They reached a maximum, then would not change at all.

Expected Results:  
When you grab a frame boundary, the frame should change size depending on where you drag the grabby to.  It should be changeable to either larger or smaller size, and the amount of change should be dependent on the cursor and mouse button.

I tried this operation in Internet Explorer, and the frame resize works properly and predictably.  I think this has been a problem for the past two updates of Firefox I have received.  Otherwise, I far prefer Firefox to IE!
