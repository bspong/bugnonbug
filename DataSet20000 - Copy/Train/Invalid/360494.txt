With "Show New Tab Button..." selected, the content screen is cropped almost completely to just the left margin. No tabs displayed if they are created, no usable content screen space.

-See URL noted for screenshot. It shows the preference window over the browser window with this feature selected. The vertical scroll bar, does not always appear, but the content window does always get cropped.

Only appears if tab bar is present. If it's a one-tab window with "Hide tab bar when only one tab is open" selected, problem does not appear.

This build first launches with subject preference selected as default. Maybe deselect until problem fixed?
