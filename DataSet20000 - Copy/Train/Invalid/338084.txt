Firefox advertises target platform/ABI of Darwin_x86-gcc3 instead of gcc4
I am building my extension for Intel Mac and ran into this problem:
  "Incompatible Extension
  ... not installed because it is not compatible with your Firefox build type
  (Darwin_x86-gcc3)..."

Firefox 1.5.0.3 (universal binary) is advertising a target platform of Darwin_x86-gcc3 even though about:buildconfig confirms it was built with gcc4 on Intel Mac.

This seems wrong.  Is this intentional?  Is it possible to fix this in 1.5.0.4?
