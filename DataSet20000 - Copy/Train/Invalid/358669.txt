Selecting 'Show a blank page' or 'Show my windows and tabs from last time' doesn't disable the Home Page text box
Selecting 'Show a blank page' or 'Show my windows and tabs from last time' from the pull-down menu in the Options window under 'Main' should disable the Home Page text box, since it isn't needed when either of these options is selected. It should only be active when 'Show my home page' is selected from the pull-down menu.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to Tools, Options
2. Select either 'Show a blank page' or 'Show my windows and tabs from last time' from the 'When Firefox starts' pull-down menu.
3. The 'Home Page:' text box isn't disabled. It should be.
