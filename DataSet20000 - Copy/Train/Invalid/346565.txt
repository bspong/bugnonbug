http://support.sony-europe.com/DIME/digistill/alpha/compatibility/lens.asp?l=en&m=DSLR-A100 is a product description site for the Minolta/Dynax/Sony A100 cameras.  The page launches a popup in Firefox that has the phrase "I have got the focus" and an "OK" button.  Pressing the button reloads the popup.  All other open tabs are greyed out, and all dropdown menu items (Including Quit Firefox under the next to leftmost drop down menu)  The only way I was able to get it stopped was to invoke the "force quit" function under the Mac OS Finder.

I tried the same web site with Safari and did not have the problem, so it is specific to Firefox.  

OS and software build are most current version.

IMHO this code constitutes "malicious malware" and Sony needs to take responsibility for the actions of its code writer(s).

This constitutes a violation of the rule of web conduct in writing code.  As such Sony should bear responsibility for the costs of any Firefox rewrite.
