Bookmarks Toolbar doesn't display the icons/text of contents in the Bookmarks Toolbar...
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404 Firefox/2.0.0.14
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404 Firefox/2.0.0.14

After upgrade to 2.0.0.14 the bookmarks toolbar no longer displays the contents of the Bookmarks|Bookmarks Toolbar Folder.  Using the Bookmarks menu to select the Bookmarks Toolbar Folder shows the saved bookmarks, and clicking on any of the saved bookmarks in the Toolbar Folder causes the browser to navigate properly to the bookmark's associated page.  The contents of the folder were not affected and all bookmark's previously saved work as expected.

I also tested for "phantom" icons or hotspots by clicking along the toolbar where icons should have been represented but there was no navigation or mouse reaction.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox.
2. Bookmarks Toolbar loads every time.
3. No icons appear on the toolbar.
4. Reboot of Firefox does not correct the problem.
5. Reboot of the OS does not correct the problem.
Actual Results:  
No visible icons in the bookmarks toolbar.

Expected Results:  
Display the bookmarks correctly on the toolbar.
