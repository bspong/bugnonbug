After installing update (3.5.2), Firefox is not displaying properly. Only the toolbar and tops of opened tabs are rendered.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_7; en-us) AppleWebKit/525.28.3 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.2.3 Safari/525.28.3
Build Identifier: Firefox 3.5.2

Bizarre display - the application is clearly running, but is not displaying properly. Troubleshooting tried: restarted the computer, uninstalled and reinstalled, cleared cache, and turned off all themes, plug ins, and extensions except for Firefox default (and restarted the application. Other browsers and my computer are functioning normally.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Quit and restart application.
2. Uninstalled and reinstalled.
3. Restarted computer
4. Cleared cache, restarted application.
5. Disabled extensions, themes, and plug ins except for Firefox defaults. Restarted application.
Actual Results:  
nothing. Firefox continues to not display/render properly (as described above)

Expected Results:  
display normally. Be able to see the whole webpage in each tab, not just the tab title (partially cut off)

Firefox support (live chat) asked me to report this bug. I note that the software is unusable as a result of this bug.
