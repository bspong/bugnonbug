Mozilla not responsing when loading any type of website

A few days after updating Mozilla, Mozilla does not load any type of web page. Internet explorer and Opera are working perfectly fine so the problem may not be connected with the internet connection. The only thing that Mozilla does show is a blank white page with the words untitle. I have restart the program several and restarted my computer several times; nothing seems to work.
