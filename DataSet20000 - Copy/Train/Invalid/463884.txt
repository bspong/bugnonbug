FF launches Mplayer/VLC instead of Realplayer. Konquerer works.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092700 SUSE/3.0.3-5.1 Firefox/3.0.3

When trying to listen to the amazon songs always mplayer starts. Realplayer 10 is installed. In the same configuration Konquerer works well. I tried the following:
- add on mediaplayerconnectivity0.9.1 is installed. doesnt help.
- remove the mplayer -rm files from /usr/lib/browser-plugins (the helix.so is in this directory!): doesnt help
- uninstall mplayer: now vlc starts instead of realplayer.
- uninstall also vlc: realplayer starts and plays the song

With Konquerer the playing of the song always works. But Firefox is my favoritebrowser, and I dont want to uninstall mplayer/vlc every time I want to hear songs from amazon....

When I copy the URL and play the URL with realplayer manually (copy the URL into the "site open" menu) it works
