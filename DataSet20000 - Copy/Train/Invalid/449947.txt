Javascript history.back() will not remember the page scroll location

So if you scrolled down a page and clicked on a button that took you somewhere, and the button on the next page used history.back(), it would now take you to the top of the original page instead of scrolled down. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.pageresource.com/jscript/jbutton.htm
2. Scroll down and click on "Go to my other Page!"
3. Once you're on the page, click on "Go Back" and you will be taken to the top of the original page rather than the scrolled position.
Actual Results:  
It takes the user back a page but does not remember scroll position.

Expected Results:  
Remembered to take the user back to the scrolled position, not just the original page.

The user should be taken back to the original page with the original scroll position instead of the scroll position being reset.
