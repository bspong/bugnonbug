Firefox fails to block this popup or script.

When i goto that link which i discovered wasn't what Iwanted anyways. I
discovered that firefox fails to block the popup that occurs at this site which is:

http://www.cybertopia.ca/ 

here is the source of the popup I think:

<script
src="http://www.mybargainnetwork.com/bargains1/actual/hover.php?d=cybertopia.ca&r=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nzone.com%2Fobject%2Fnzone_ngca_home.html&k=insurance"></script></head>

This may be a bug or security issue, but I was unable to locate a similar bug in
the database. I don't know if ain't a bug then I I woudl like to know how to
disable it.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Goto URL http://www.cybertopia.ca/



Actual Results:  
Popup occured even though I have firefox set to block popups and this site is
not in the allows list.


Expected Results:  
Blocked popup!
