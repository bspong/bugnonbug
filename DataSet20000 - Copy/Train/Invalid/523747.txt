tearing off tab into new window sends TabClose event to event listeners

We have custom web app(Oracle ADF Fusion) that uses a custom extension that listens for when a tab closes so that the back end can clean up resources.  When a tab is dragged off to create a new window, the TabClose event is triggered.  This should not happen since the tab didn't close it was just moved to a new window.  After this happens the page doesn't work any more because the server thinks the page has been closed.

In my overlay.js I have this.

     var content = document.getElementById('content');
      var tabs = content.selectedTab.parentNode;

      tabs.addEventListener('TabClose', ext.onTabClose, true); 

Reproducible: Always
