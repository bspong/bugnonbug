When utilizing the feature where you can access Tabs 1-9 using ctrl + # (1-9), if you have more than 9 tabs, let's say 12, when you press Ctrl 9, it goes to the very last tab (the 12th).

Not too big of an issue, but quite annoying.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just Press Ctrl + 9 when you have 9 tabs
2. Repeat Step 1, but with 10+ tabs.
3.

Actual Results:  
Went to last tab instead of the 9th tab.

Expected Results:  
Should just go to the 9th tab.

Computer recently crashed...but restored with chkdsk. Doubt this has ANY impact.
Installed Bon Echo three days after it came out.
