Unable to scroll pages using Arrow Keys and Pg Up/Down

The previuos version on firefox didn't have this bug. When I visit a page like http://www.repubblica.it, facebook and some other sites I cannot scroll page with Arrow Keys and Page Up/Down. Sometimes I can scroll the page, but only for a limited part of the page. If I hold Pg Down (or press repeatedly), for example, the page is blinking (like a very fast scrolling), but it scrolls only for a little part of the page. For example if in http://www.repubblica.it I *click* on the first article and after I press pg down it blinks.
I hope I addressed you to solve the bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Point browser on a page, and load page
2. Scroll down with Arrows or Pg Up/Down (sometimes don't scroll, sometimes blink)
3. Sometimes click on a page and scroll with arrow of pg up/down (blink)
Actual Results:  
Nothing, just I cannot sroll with keyboard

Expected Results:  
Scrolling the page
