An ordinary link within text does not work
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/416.11 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/416.12
Build Identifier: 

This is the link code: <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&lr=&q=chase+decker+art" target="_blank">here</a>

The text is rendered as a link (blue with underline) but cursor does not change, nor are there any other evident actions taken when the text is clicked.

This fails in Firefox (Mac & WinXP) and Camino. It works in my non-mozilla browsers (IE, Opera, Safari, iCab) on both OS X and WinXP

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://kimberlybatteau.com/cline/pages/friends.html
2. The last word of the last sentence in the 2nd paragraph is "here"
3. Click "here" and nothing happens.

Actual Results:  
1. Rendering of link text is correct.
2. No action is taken when clicked on.

Expected Results:  
Open a Google image search in a new tab/window with arguments hl=en&lr=&q=chase+decker+art.
