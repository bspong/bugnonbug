When I do a search on google for instance, google put in strong the terms
searched for in its result.
When I try to middle-click on this text (put in strong) to follow the link,
nothing append while it should open a new link.
Everything works fine when I click on the part of the link where text is not
formatted

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.goole.com
2. Search for "Firefox"
3. Result should show links with "Firefox" in strong
4. Try to middle-click on "Firefox" and nothing append
5. Try to middle-click on the other part of the link and everything works fine
