Password Manager not working.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:10.0a1) Gecko/20111004 Firefox/10.0a1

Steps to reproduce:

I have an account with Pogo.
When going to the Pogo site I'm getting a registration page.
I sign in and get to the homepage as signed in.
Remember Password is checked.
I save the site to the Bookmark Toolbar.


Actual results:

After closing Firefox and reopening FF I click the link on the Toolbar and it reopens to the original page wanting me to register again.
I went into options and I'm not seeing it showing as Saved in the Password list.
I'm not seeing anything at the top of the page asking me to Save the Password.


Expected results:

The signed in page for Pogo should have been saved and wasn't.
