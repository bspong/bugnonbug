I am a web developer. I developed www.ppocweb.net. The form doesn't display the correct colors. Currently, the colors are not set so, they should be white. The name field and the text area field display correctly. The other fields display yellow. I have tried to change the colors to a variety of different colors, red, blue ect. The yellow fields stay yellow. I have viewed the page in other browsers, internet explorer, netscape, opera. The forms display correctly in these browsers.

Being a web developer, I use several browsers and several different somputers to check my work. I offer this feature to my clients as a selling pitch. I would love to continue to use firefox as it is one of the more user friendly browsers.

I hope that this bug is easily fixed.
