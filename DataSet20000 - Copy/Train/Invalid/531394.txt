After every restart the firstrun homepage appears. If I set my personal home in Edit -> Preferences ->  Main -> Startup -> Home Page the default is restored after a browser restart. Before a browser restart I can call the Home Page from the Home Page Icon, and the Home Page url is correctly shown in the GUI.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download and install Firefox from http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/power/software/aix/browsers/index.html
2. Start Firefox
3. Change your Home Page 
4. Quit Firefox
5. Start Firefox and the firstrun page together with the official branding default page is loaded, the Edit -> Preferences dialog has lost your personal Home Page
Actual Results:  
Preferences lost

Expected Results:  
Preferences are stored across browser sessions

The IBM Firefox carries official branding in the about: and about:buildconfig pages
