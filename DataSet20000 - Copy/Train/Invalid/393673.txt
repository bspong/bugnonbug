Has the bug been fixed for the constant crashes on Mac OS X? I installed the new FireFox 2.0 when it first came out and had to remove it from my computer because it kept freezes my entire system. It would freeze my computer after about 5 minutes of surfing the web. After the freeze, I had to restart my computer every time, but the freezing continued after about 5 minutes. So, the best thing to solve the freezing was to remove FireFox 2.0. Luckily, I found an older version (1.0) that works fine on my computer, however, to use certains new features, I have to upgrade to 1.5 or 2.0. I only want to upgrade if the bug has been fixed. I even tried Camino and it freezes my computer too. So, I'm stuck with FF 1.0 until the bug is fixed. Please let me know. Thanks!
