The page at
http://www.costco.com/Common/Category.aspx?whse=&topnav=&cat=4044&hierPath=93*&Browse=
does not display the links and 'add to cart' text entry boxes (no. of items). 
It just displays a blank box of the wrong size.  It could be because they are an
activex control, or something.  IE6 displays the page correctly.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. type in url
2. look at page
3.

Actual Results:  
page displayed incorrectly.  

Expected Results:  
page should look like it does in IE6.

I was using the default theme.  This was also a problem on ver. 0.92
