Hello.
When I went on the website lastminute.com and tried to order something, a box appeared (http://img136.imageshack.us/img136/9025/bugfirefoxbo8.jpg/). This bug also created some little display bugs.


Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.fr.lastminute.com/site/voyages/billets-avion-vols/
2. try to find a flight select it and continue (you do not have to go to the final step --> dont have to pay)
3. when you'll have to confirm your name, your adress, etc., the box will appear
Actual Results:  
This box appeared: http://img136.imageshack.us/img136/9025/bugfirefoxbo8.jpg/

Expected Results:  
With the previous version (did it yesterday...) there wasn't any bug. The box shouldn't appear.

OS: Windows XP Home SP2
Firefox: 3.01 (updated a few hours ago)
