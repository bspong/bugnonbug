IFRAME URLs containing ? behave erratically
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051025 Firefox/1.5

If I have the url "src="http://www.webl.com/rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t" in an IFRAME tag, FireFox does not attempt to load the frame. If I change the final t to X ("src="http://www.webl.com/rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?X") FireFox attempts to load the frame. (There is no page there, just a 404 error.) This is condensed from a real-world problem with the url pointing to amazon, hence the strange string. If I remove the ? (or the rcm.amazon.com) I can't reproduce the failure.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a local HTML file with the following contents:
<html>
<head>
</head>

<body>
<iframe frameborder="1" src="http://www.webl.com/rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t"
></iframe>
</body></html>

2. Point browser to file, observe blank white box with no error text

3. Change the final ?t in the url to ?X

4. Point browser to file, observe 404 error
