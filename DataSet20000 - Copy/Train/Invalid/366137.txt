Hello, 

Since it's very early days in the 80ies I have used Netscape and then the Mozilla Suite. On all my Windows systems since Windows V3.1 I always deactivated the Microsoft Internet Explorer.

Now you advise users to change to Firefox. Hence I tried this, but apparently there are inconsistencies, when I installed Firefox in addition to the Mozilla Suite, it never worked properly, e.g. I could not save any HTML-page, and even more surprising, not even single images received ... The question is: Why for gods sake do you not provide an advice/warning about this???

As a consequence I uninstalled Firefox, but after that also Mozilla seemed not to work properly anymore and I had to uninstall/reinstall the Mozilla Suite 1.7.13.

Of course the alternative would have been to get rid of the Mozilla Suite and to use as recommended Firefox instead. However, this is not feasible for me, because Firefox has one very big disadvantage: There is no HTML-editor, which I really need to maintain my homepage and to fit downloaded HTML-pages to my needs. So the question is: Why on earth do you not add an (optional) HTML-editor module to Firefox ???

With best regards
