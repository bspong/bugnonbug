The CSS color keyword 'Highlight' is supposed to render as the same color the user gets when selecting text manually with the mouse. This color was correct on Firefox 2, but is now a darker shade of whatever the user has set in Firefox 3.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Assign the 'background: Highlight' style to an element.
Actual Results:  
The color was several shades darker than the expected highlight color.

Expected Results:  
The color should match exactly the user specified system highlight color.
