I have an unmovable bar of blank space at the bottom of the Firefox screen below the "done/locked" bar (I'm not sure what to call it) at the very bottom and it contains the right hand corner that expands/contracts the size of the screen. The function that exp/con's still functions. There is also a red "^" that appeared on the left of this blank space at the same time. I have reloaded Firefox from the internet, and it has  remained on the bottom of my screen. It does not appear on other browsers that I open (Safari, Explorer). It does not interfere with other functions, but is impeding visual operation. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open Firefox
Actual Results:  
1. open Firefox, and the bottom bar with expand/contract corner is approx 2.6 cm high with red "^" on extreme left

Expected Results:  
open Firefox, and should have had the very bottom of the bar with expand/contract corner be approx 1cm high
