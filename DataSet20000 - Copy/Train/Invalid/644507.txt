Firefox can't remeber password to two diffrent accounts
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

I am using two e-mail accounts:
1. Private gmail: mail.google.com
2. Company mail based on Google Apps: mail.signati.pl

The two accounts are complatly different without any conection between them.
However Firefox (bot 3,6 and 4.0) can only store one password and want to use the same credentials for both sites which is wrong.

Hope anyone can help to change this behavior.

Reproducible: Always

Expected Results:  
I am expecting to have different credentials to both sites which firefox should remember.
