When a link opens a new window from a maximized window, the new window is not
maximized.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Maximize a Firefox window.
2. In this maximized window, open a page containing links which open in new
windows (example: http://www.fark.com).
3. Follow a link by left-clicking on it (it should open in a new window).
4. The new window is not in a maximized state.
Actual Results:  
new window is not maximized (like parent)

Expected Results:  
new window should be maximized (like parent)

When opening a link (as in the 'steps to reproduce') by right-clicking and
selecting "open link in new window", the new window does keep the parent's
maximized state.  The problem appears to only exist when links open a new window
on their own.
