I am using FF 3.5 RC3 . I need cross domain access for my AJAX enabled web application .

I am trying to load the page using http://localhost:8080/AJAX1/page1.jsp . 
On this page (page1.jsp) using AJAX I am trying to access https://localhost:8443/AJAX1/SomeResource?address=ABC . The Firefox throws error : Access to restricted URI denied code: 1012 .

I am able to access http://localhost:8080/SomeOtherWebApp/index.html from the same page (page1.jsp) using AJAX .
