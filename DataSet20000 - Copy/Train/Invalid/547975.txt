In the URL above there is a checkbox "Please also send me newsletter". If I try to un-check that checkbox it doesnt uncheck at all. If I try the same in IE8 then that checkbox would uncheck. A quick review of the page source shows that checkbox has checked="checked" value.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to URL
2. Try un-checking the newsletter checkbox.

Actual Results:  
Checkbox wont uncheck.

Expected Results:  
Un-check.
