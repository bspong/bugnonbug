If you enter an incomplete URL, Firefox can try to "fix up" the URL by adding a prefix, suffix, or both to what you type.

In Firefox 3.6.x for example, if I typed IMDB in the Location bar, I used to go to www.imdb.com.

Now I am redirected to the Google Search page.

Disclosure: I also have https-everywhere add-on (but it did not cause this issue in Firefox  3.6.x.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type imdb in location bar

Actual Results:  
Goes to the Google Search page.

Expected Results:  
Expected to go directly to www.imdb.com
