Problems with the Yahoo toolbar
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

I upgraded Firefox to 1.5c and then attempted to run Yahoo Anti-Spy.  Instead of running I got an update page for Anti-Spy.  It said I needed to update my Yahoo Anti-Spy.  I downloaded the update (1.13) and attempted to install it.  I got a message that the version I had was newer and it suggested that I cancel the update.  I canceled the updated and again tried to run Anti-Spy.  I got the update page again.  This time I went ahead and updated it, but when I tried to run it (after exiting and then re-entering Firefox), I got the update page again.  It appears that Yahoo Anti-Spy and Firefox 1.5c aren't compatible, although when I installed Firefox 1.5c it checked my extentions to see which ones were compatible and which weren't and the Yahoo Toolbar was in the compatible list.  The Yahoo toolbar itself works, just the antispy doesn't.  I even uninstalled the Yahoo Toolbar and reinstalled it and got the same results when I attempted to run Anti-Spy.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Upgrade to Firefox 1.5c.
2.  If you don't have it, install the Yahoo ToolBar.
3.  Run Anti-Spy.

Actual Results:  
Anti-Spy says you need to update and after you update, it still says you need to update.

Expected Results:  
Having to update Anti-Spy once in a while isn't unusual, but after the update you should be able to run it.  You should be continually asked to update to the same version.

P.S. although I have Talkback installed, I couldn't find how to use it to report this bug.  I couldn't find it in the menu or as a button at the bottom of the window.
