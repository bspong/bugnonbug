DOM (?) error when using style float:left with nested ul

This came out when trying to construct a nested menu using ul/li, and the bug is very strange.

Here is a minimal test case:

-----------------

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />


<title>Untitled Document</title>
<style type="text/css">
ul {
	float: left;
}
</style>
</head>

<body>
    <ul>
        <li>Home</li>
        <li>Next</li>
        <li>Sub
            <ul>
                <li>Sub1</li>
                <li>Sub2</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>After</li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>

-----------------

This document produces a nested list such as

    * Home
    * Next
    * Sub
          o Sub1
          o Sub2
    * After

However, run this document through the DOM inspector, and notice that when highlighting the <li> corresponding to "Sub", only "Sub" is marked and not "Sub1" and "Sub2". On the contrary, when highlighting the <li> corresponding to "After" the "Sub1" and "Sub2" are marked!

However, if you remove the "float: left" from the style of <ul>, the elements of the document are marked correctly, that is "Sub1" and "Sub2" together with "Sub".

Therefore it seems that for some reason the DOM is constructed incorrectly when using this style.


Reproducible: Always
