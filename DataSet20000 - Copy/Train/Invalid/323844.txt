Firefox closed (crashed?) while researching meds.  Window opened suggesting Registry Cleaner & offering free?? download.  Selected DOWNLOAD but nothing happened.  Is cleaner free or just the scan?  How much $$ ?  How do I successfully download it?  How do I get back to the window that offered it?  Mozilla is extremely slow uploading and "generic" scans show over 500 errors.  I am low-tech and don't understand what I am supposed to do.  Does Mozilla have a free REGGISTRY CLEANER program or at least one that it recommends?  How do I get to it?
