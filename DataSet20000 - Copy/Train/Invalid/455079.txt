Where are all my bookmarks?

I am happy that I have a backup file, but I can not organize my bookmarks because ONLY 5 of them are listed in the drop down list.

Could you please fix this FAST?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Bookmarks
2.Add Bookmark (Ctrl+D)
3.Folder (ops. where are the folders ?) Only 5 listed...

Actual Results:  
If I insist on adding the bookmark it goes to the bookmarks, so I have to go to MENU, click on bookmarks, roll them until I find the last added bookmark, click on it and drop it where it was supposed to be stored.

Expected Results:  
Click on ADD BOOKMARK, open the correspondent window, add the bookmark wherever I want in my bookmarks folders (many!).
