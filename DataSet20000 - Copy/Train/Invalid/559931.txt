At the above URL, Firebug opens and displays error - Break on error. Active x-object is not defined. After that, all links are deactivated; sometimes, back button won't work. I usually have to close Firefox in this situation and open another tab.

Reproducible: Always

1.Surf to URL in Firefox with Firebug
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Got same error

Expected Results:  
Firebug should remain closed unless I choose to view the webpage with it, and it should never screw up the use of the page.
