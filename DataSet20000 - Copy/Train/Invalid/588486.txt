For the past few days I've been on a few pages where it takes 2 tries to go back a page.  This includes the Back button, Back on the context menu, a mouse button that's set to go back.  Basically anyway to go back a page.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to URL specified.
2.Find the link in red entitled 'eHow has instructions on how to build a Bailey Chair'
3.Click on link to go to that page in the same tab.  Now go back a page and see if it takes 2 tries.
Actual Results:  
I need two tries to go back a page.

Expected Results:  
One try should be all that is needed.

As noted this is intermittent.  Others I spoke to have the problem, others do not.
