Allow dragging of bookmark folders on the bookmark bar by holding cmd
In a bunch of Mac applications (Adium is one of them) by holding command and dragging you can perform some other sort of drag action.

In this case, it would allow you to drag around folders of bookmarks on the bookmarks bar. IIRC this was one of the most common complaints I got when I asked for feedback from folks about Firefox 2 on the Mac on my blog.

Not sure if this is the right component (maybe toolbars?)
