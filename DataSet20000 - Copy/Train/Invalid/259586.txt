The CSS for this whole section of the site does not load, or its not being
rendered. In other bugs, it said that the type was incorrect, but this is the
tag used. 

<link href="/about.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

Tried in 3 different computers, all running Windows XP, 2 running the new
version of FF, one running 0.9.3 and got the same results.

Tried changing the name of the css file, tried deleting everything in the CSS
file and leaving only basic text formatting and its still not rendering.
