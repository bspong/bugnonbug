When I go to any site and then open a new tab, the section of the URL bar that shows the root of the website stays the same until I go to a different website.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any website.
2. Open a new tab.
Actual Results:  
The root remains in the URL field.

Expected Results:  
The URL bar becomes completely empty.

I don't know if "root" is the right word for it ;)
