Crash On Fx4 Startup Despite Safe Mode Measures
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.16 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/10.0.648.204 Safari/534.16
Build Identifier: http://getfirefox.com

I do not know what caused this state to exist.  I closed the browser, went to re-open it, and now it is crashing every time.  I have tried restoring my profile from a backup, and using all of Safe Mode's abilities to disable add-ons, reset preferences, etc, and nothing is helping.

In Safe Mode, I can get a browser for approximately 1 or 2 seconds before I get another crash.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to start Firefox

Actual Results:  
Crash.

Expected Results:  
Sweet Firefox goodness.

Was told by #firefox folks that this seemed strange, and that the crash report wasn't pointing to anything in particular.

I am going to resume trying to fix my Firefox from here. (wipe profile, reinstall, restore profile again)
