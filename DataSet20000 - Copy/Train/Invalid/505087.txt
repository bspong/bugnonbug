If I have more than 1 tab loaded, control, without any intervention from me, passes from tab to tab every 20 seconds making surfing impossible. I will have to uninstall Firefox and revert to IE8 as surfing is neigh impossible if I need more than 1 tab!!

Reproducible: Always

1. Launch Firefox and wait an age for it to load
2. Create one or more tabs

Actual Results:  
Control will pass from tab to tab every 20 seconds

Expected Results:  
Remained on the desired tab
