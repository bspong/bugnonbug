CSS centering breaks based on order in HTML
Consider a container element that holds three contained elements positioned left, center and right.  As the example below illustrates, whether the contained elements are rendered inside the container element or outside the container element depends not upon the CSS for each of the contained elements, but rather on the order in which they appear in the HTML.

Note that both the HTML and CSS for the example pass W3C validation.
