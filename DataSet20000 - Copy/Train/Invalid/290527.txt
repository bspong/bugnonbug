FF 1.0.2 crashes if you type a URL (any URL, for example http://www.mozilla.org
) into location bar and press enter. This used to work in 1.0. It happens every
time. Location bar is completely unusable. Also dropdown box does not work
(problem with some url in history?).
Tested with default and Noia extreme themes, same result. Other user on same
system has same problem. SuSE 9.1 PII system, KDE 3.2.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start FF.
2.Move to location bar. Type http://www.mozilla.org
3.Press enter and watch FF die.

Actual Results:  
FF crashes. Talkback agent shows up.

Open URL.

This used to work in 1.0
