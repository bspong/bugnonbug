Firebird 0.7 does not correctly process style related events from JavaScript.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7

The following code works in IE. It does not work in Firebird 0.7 - the
background color never changes.

This problem is not isolated to just background colors. It appears that no
styles can be set or changed dynamically using JavaScript in Firdbird 0.7.

Here is the code:

<html>
<head>
  <title>Test</title>
  <script language="JavaScript">
    function MakeGreen(boolEnable)
    {
      if(boolEnable)
      {
        subscribe_question.style.backgroundColor = "Green";
      }
      else
      {
        subscribe_question.style.backgroundColor = "Blue";
      }
    }
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <form name="test_form">
    <input type="button" name="on" value="Make Green" onClick="MakeGreen(true)">
    <input type="button" name="off" value="Make Blue" onClick="MakeGreen(false)">
    <br><br>
    <span id="subscribe_question" style="font-weight: bold; color: White;
background-color: Blue">COLOR</span>
  </form>
</body>
</html>


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run the code sample on Internet Explorer
2. Run the same code sample on Firebird 0.7
3. Notice that it works on IE and not on Firebird

Actual Results:  
When clicking the buttons in my sample, the background color never changed.

Expected Results:  
The backgound color should change according to the button clicked in my sample.

This sort of problem seems to be common to all styles set dynamically using
JavaScript in Firdbird 0.7. The style commands are ignored.
