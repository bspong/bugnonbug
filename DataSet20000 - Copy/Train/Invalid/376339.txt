I installed Blocksite(0.5.2.2) and everything worked properly.
I added a new site to the Blocksite, then Firefox didn't function properly.
I can start up firefox, but my homepage(google.be) won't load. (I haven't add google.be to Blocksite). Also nonen of the menu's and other buttons work. I just see a white page. And that's it. I also can't surf to other pages.

Sometimess if I re-install firefox, everything works properly. I add a site to Blocksite and everything works properly, then I add another site to Blocksite, then suddenly nothing works properly.
