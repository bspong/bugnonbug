If i want to use a file from a link with an other application, the other application will not know the original URL, because the application only know the  temporary local location. "Open with" saves the file temporary. It should not.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Klick on a link to a file, which has a mime-type firefox does not support.
   e.g. data:application/x-archive,
   or
http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/1.8.1.3/contrib/linux-i686/xulrunner-1.8.1.3.en-US.linux-i686.tar.gz
2. Choose your favorite application for this file with "Open with"
Actual Results:  
The file will be saved temporary and the your application will open the temporary file.

Expected Results:  
The file should not be saved temporary. Firefox should refer the URL to the other application.

Good applications can handle a URL. e.g. Firefox, file-roller, gedit and a lot of other applications.

I can save the file directly on the FTP-Server, if the application has the original URL. :-)
