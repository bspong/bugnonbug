no body-background (white space instead) when sent as application/xhtml+xml and container margin specified
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de-AT; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050421 Firefox/1.0.3 (Debian package 1.0.3-2)

In the page at http://prem.de.ms/, you can see a white space above and under the
container. The body-background should actually be displayed. The container
margin is specified as "margin: 13px auto;" in the associated .css-file. This
bug only occurs if the page was sent as application/xhtml+xml. When it is sent
as text/html the page is displayed correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
white space is displayed

Expected Results:  
background-image should be displayed
