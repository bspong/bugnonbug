Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.when I start firefox 
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
every time I start firefox I get four boxes of errors then firefox starts.

Expected Results:  
same as above

I saved a copy of the error page but I can not find where to attach it. I have downloaded it several times but it still does it. I can just delete the error windows and go on and it seems to work OK but very bothersome to have it come up every time.
