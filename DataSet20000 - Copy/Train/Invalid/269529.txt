"IE" can surf to site. firefox errors with  "The connection was refused when attempting to contact ..."

This bug is different than other bug reports regarding "connection refused"
because those bug reports are a general configuration issue where NO sites are
reachable.
In general, I have ZERO configuration issues.  To reproduce this bug and
understand it, it helps to know that the site in question has a very slow upload
link to the internet so it loads VERY slowly. This is true regardless of your
own internet connection (broadband or dialup). However the site is functional.
If you try to surf to site in IE, youll find that IE patiently waits for it to
load and in few minutes (apx 5 minutes) everything is present.  With firefox
after about 25 seconds one gets the error dialog box "The connection was refused
when attempting to contact www.davealex.dnsalias.com"   To recap: with this bug,
IE yields 100% of this slowloading site, firefox yields zero percent of it. The
main unusual item here is the site is a functional, but because of hardware, slow. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. using firefox go to www.davealex.dnsalias.com
2. In apx 25 seconds you'll get error dialog box mentioned.
3. Using IE go to same site. It takes a few minutes but it WILL load.

Actual Results:  
get error dialog box 
"The connection was refused when attempting to contact www.davealex.dnsalias.com" 

Expected Results:  
wait for site to load and display it.
