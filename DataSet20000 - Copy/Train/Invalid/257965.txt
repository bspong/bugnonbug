compile fails on nsChromeRegistry.cpp on Linux (current gentoo box and on Red Hat 7.2 box)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.2) Gecko/20040819
Build Identifier: ftp://ftp.ussg.iu.edu/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/0.9.3/firefox-0.9.3-source.tar.bz2

The compile fails on nsChromeRegistry.cpp with the error 
nsChromeRegistry.cpp:2693: error: prototype for `nsresult 
   nsChromeRegistry::UninstallPackage(const PRUnichar*, int)' does not match 
   any in class `nsChromeRegistry'
nsChromeRegistry.h:76: error: candidate is: virtual nsresult 
   nsChromeRegistry::UninstallPackage(const nsACString&, int)
The error occurs on an up to date Gento Linux box:
   Kernel 2.6.6-rc1 SMP
   Glibc 2.3.3.20040420
   gcc 3.3.4
There is no obvious error in config.log after running ./config. The error is
independent of whether I use gmake or make.

Note that if I use the gentoo package manager to build firefox on this machine
it builds without error.  The error crops up when I download the sources myself
and build.

The error also occurs if I try to compile sources for 0.9.2.

The same occurs on a different linux box that runs Red Hat 7.2 (kernel 2.4.26,
glibc 2.2.4 and gcc-2.96. (This is really the box for which I want to compile
firefox, but I figure that I have a ringer if it builds as a gentoo package but
not on its own on the same box.)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. bzcat firefox-0.9.3-soure.tar.bz2 | tar -xvf -
2. cd mozilla
3. ./configure
4. gmake

Actual Results:  
I get the compile error listed above under details.

Expected Results:  
No compile error!

Not really. In checking the bug logs I see the occasional does not compile
error, but they seem to lack a common theme.
