Hi.
Yesterday I installed my Vista Home Premium x86, then got Firefox (what else ;)).
I imported all the whole Profile folder and wanted to access my bookmarks. Until this point everything ok, but then (I don't know if it is Vista of Firefox) almost every Menu in Firefox has this crappy scrollbars. It is not dependant on the vista theme - i tried 5 of them, including the default one (it is not aero either).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
SETUP: Firefox 3.05 on Vista Home Premium x86 SP 1
1. Open Firefox
2. Klick on one of the menus (even the right-click on one of the pages as seen on the attached screenshot)
Actual Results:  
I have these menus.

Expected Results:  
I do not have them.
