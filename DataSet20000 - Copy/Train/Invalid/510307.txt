When a cookie for ".domain.com" is set, and the user opens www.domain.com, the cookie is not regognized as being from that domain. Actually, the cookie for 'domain.com' has 'host' in the cookie preview, while the '.domain.com' has 'domain' instead of 'host'. 
In previous versions this was working fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://somedomain.com
2. Login (i.e. set a cookie for '.somedomain.com')
3. Nagivate to http://www.somedomain.com
Actual Results:  
the cookie is not recognized, and you are not logged in. As if these are two different pages.

Expected Results:  
The user should appear to be logged (i.e. the cookie recognized as belonging to that domain)
