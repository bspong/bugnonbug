upon doing an update of winamp on my system, my antivirus program notified me of this worm: worm.win32.netsky.q. Is it fatal and why didn,t your software catch this.  So far, nothing has gone wromg with my system, but this has me wondering.
My antivirus caught this, but, it cannot quarantine the problem for deletion.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.nothing seems to work
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
total system restore with no results.

Expected Results:  
deletion of problem file

your firewall should have caught this and notified me of a potential problem.  system seems to be slowing down.
