Javascript alert boxes do not pop up; instead, display in browser window

Alert boxes from any site do not pop up in a "box," but instead pop up in the parent window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a data entry screen
2. Leave out a "required" field and click "run report"
3. Edit produces an alert message that displays in the parent window and disappears because the entry screen is recalled.
Actual Results:  
Same as in "Steps to Reproduce."

Expected Results:  
After clicking "run report|continue|Go!, etc" without all the required fields, edits should produce an error message and return the user to the screen.  The error message is created with a javascript alert box.  The box should appear and have the user click "ok."  After clicking "ok," the user is returned to the entry screen to correct the problem.

This problem occurs in several different systems with Firefox 4.0.1.  It works as expected in Google Chrome and IE.  I don't remember this problem occurring in 4.0.0, but I can't be certain.  I first noticed it yesterday after the automatic upgrade to the 4.0.1 beta was applied to my system.

I'm sorry if this bug has been reported previously.  I attempted to search the list, but I saw nothing like my situation in the results.
