Hi, this time when Orkut upgraded to the new version come to realize that Mozilla Minefield is not compatible with this new version of Orkut, and it shows the look of the old version, why?

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I site Orkut
2.I log in normally
3. And I go on my profile
Actual Results:  
Normally log in my  new orkut profile but with the look of the old orkut.





Expected Results:  
Replacing that is incompatible with the orkut website.
