I've a few suggestions for improving Live Bookmarks.

One of the main problems are Live Bookmarks has limited functionality

1. The unread pages should be in bold (unread in normal text)
2. If the Live Bookmark has a new feed (or update) the button should give out a glow.
3. If mouse is pointed for an x number of time, it should display a summary (if the original XML or Feed page has given a summary)
4. While the Live Bookmark icon is clicked, the button should revert to the linked Feed page with Links to add a Live Bookmark or subsribe to it to Firefox Feed Reader (if you have this planned)
5. Firefox should use the Feed Title as the default name (I think you got this covered)
6. When mouse rolls over the Feed button in the Location bar it should display some sort of behaviour (like glow or something)

And maybe an about:config entry to override the Live Bookmark Icon (on the Bookmark Toolbar) with the site favicon !?!

Live Bookmarks cannot also be reordered by Drag and Drop.

Reproducible: Always
