Code, links and some images don't display correctly in a PHPBB page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040211 Firefox/0.8

If I go, for example, at the site I just gave you above
(http://bpsl.synfuldesires.org/portal.php?sid=8a8e74e2936ca61214c6c60a98e7e99d),
where it says "Link to Beautiful Plus Size Ladies", you'll see that at the
bottom, where it should display a text with which an user can establish a link,
it appears crushed.  This displays also incorrectly in Konqueror, but displays
correctly in MS Internet Explorer.

Just below that part, you'll see the "Links" section, which is completely empty
in Firefox.  However, it displays correctly in MS Internet Explorer and Konqueror.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open Firefox
2.  Go to the site: 
http://bpsl.synfuldesires.org/portal.php?sid=8a8e74e2936ca61214c6c60a98e7e99d
Actual Results:  
displays incorrecty.

Expected Results:  
Display the full text of the code that should be displayed, and also show the
images of the links.
