Don't disable "Do this automatically for files like this from now on" when downloading a file served as application/octet-stream on Windows

The different behavior of these two links is quite strange for those not aware of Content-Type:

http://svn.gnome.org/svn/gnome-icon-theme/trunk/16x16/status/image-missing.png

A partial solution would be to always enable "Do this automatically for files like this from now on", and save the extension the file uses. If no extension is present, save the content type.

Reproducible: Always
