Hi,

It would be great to able to unset the readonly attribute on a text-area element.

Currently, setting text-area's readonly attribute to anyting will make the
text-area readonly, and there is no way to unset it.

I've tried setting it to '', null, 'null', and even
var textAreaElementReadonlyDefault = textAreaElement.getAttribute('readonly');

In other words just setting the text-area readonly attribute, makes the
text-area readonly.

The html specification indicates that setting it to 'readonly' should make it
readonly.  One would think any other value would make it editable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
- Create a document with a text-area.
- Execute javascript setting the readonly attribute to anything
  by clicking in the area.

<html>
<head>
<script>
function setReadonly()
{
var text = document.getElementById('textarea');
text.setAttribute('readonly', '');
}
</script>
</head>
<body style="width:100%">
<text-area style="width:100%; height:100%"
           onMouseUp="setReadonly()"
/>
</body>
</html>

Now type some text and then click in the text-area...the text can no longer be
edited
Actual Results:  
The text-area is now readonly, although the readonly attribute was just set to ''.

Expected Results:  
Setting the readonly attribute to '', or any value other than 'readonly' should
make the field editable.
