Preferences dialog can't be closed with "OK" after viewing Downloads tab

After the Downloads tab in the Preferences dialog has been viewed, the OK button
no longer responds and so preference changes can't be saved. This can't be
bypassed by viewing a different tab before pressing OK: once the Downloads
preferences dialog has been viewed once in a Firefox session, OK doesn't
function and the only way to close the Dialog is via the Cancel button / Esc key.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open preferences dialog
2. Click on Downloads tab on LHS
3. Try to press OK

Actual Results:  
Nothing... the dialog remains and can only be closed by pressing cancel. From
this point on, the preferences OK button is non-functional.

Expected Results:  
Closed the dialog and saved the preference changes.
