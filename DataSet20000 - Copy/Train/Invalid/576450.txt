paper cut: when loading a link that is clicked, the previous page remains onscreen awhile before the screen is blanked out for the destination page.  During this time, you can sometimes click links on previous page and change directions, but not always.

Suggestion for a paper cut:  When loading a link that is clicked, the previous page remains onscreen awhile before the screen is blanked out for the destination page.  During this time, you can sometimes click links on the previous page and change the destination that is to be loaded, but not always.  Some times you can click a link before it heads to the next page; other times clicking on the link before it blanks out to load the next page does nothing.  This small inconsistent behavior causes the user frustration not experienced in other browsers.

It should blank out the current page immediately after clicking a link or allow in all cases for another link to be clicked to change the loading destination.  It is inconsistent behavior that is fit for a paper cut.  As it stands, clicking a link to divert the direction of loading only works some of the time.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click a link on page that takes longer than a second to reach the next page.
2. While browser pauses on current page before blanking out to the next page, click on a different link to change the direction of the loading to another destination.
3. Repeat this on multiple cases to discover that sometimes it does not change the destination.



It has been a standing behavior of Firefox for a long time, up to and including the latest Minefield nightlies of 7/1/2010.
