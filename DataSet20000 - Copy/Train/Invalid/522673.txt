A script can cause another Firefox windows than the selected one, to pop up in foreground.

While I was working on a web page; I tried to remove the dotted border of an anchor <a>, using JavaScript, by calling the 'blur()' method when 'onmouseup' event is raised.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a document with the following code:

<script type="text/javascript">
onload=function(){
 var anchors=document.getElementsByTagName('a');
 for(i=0;i<anchors.length;i++)
  anchors[i].onmouseup=function(){blur();}
}
</script>
<a href="#">Interesting</a>
<a href="#">Firefox</a>
<a href="#">behavior</a>.

2. Open at least two Firefox windows, of ANY kind.

3. View the page and click a link. One of those opened windows shoud pop up, in foreground.
Actual Results:  
An opened Firefox window pops up in foreground, gaining focus.

Expected Results:  
The script should have removed the focus from the clicked anchor <a>, and eventually, proceed to the next page.
