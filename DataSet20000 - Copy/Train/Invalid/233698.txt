Firefox 0.8 fails to start / crashes on startup
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/0.8/

Not much to say. I double-click the icon, get a little disk activity, then
nothing happens. Firefox.exe does appear very briefly in Task Manager, but if
you blink you'll miss it.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 0.8
2. Attempt to start program
3. Scratch head in confusion

Actual Results:  
Nothing.

Expected Results:  
Browser should start up and display home page.

Previous installation (0.7) had toolbar problems -- overlapping icons on
buttons, very weird. Not sure what this may have to do with current problem
since I removed old version before installing 0.8.
