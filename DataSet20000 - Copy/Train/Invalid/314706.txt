When opening multiple tabs in firefox, it eventually eats up all the free memory available. I did test and found that when i opened 10-12 tabs in firefox it ate up memory around 98,000 kb, that too big for a browser. I have seen other browsers too. But they dont eat that much memory. I like firefox, its open source. If any one could provide memory management module in firefox it will literally triple the popularity of the browser, espacially among pepople who have less memory with their system.

And opening tabs around 30(not empty tabs) it eats up and hangs the system(with memory 128MB)

Reproducible: Always
