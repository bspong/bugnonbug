pan tool, to help users handle horizontal scrollbars (which will be making a bigger appearance now when zoom comes along)

A pan tool would be of use in Firefox 3 (or future), especially when horizontal scrollbars are present.

Some programs such as the GIMP (I'm unsure about Photoshop) place a nifty pan tool in the otherwise-blank space at the corner where the two scrollbars meet. That isn't very user-discoverable, but we could put some UI elsewhere also.

Now perhaps we'll decide not to provide this, but I think we should just consider it as this could be popular - and critical - with some users at some times. Zoom is GOING TO lose users, this would be SUCH a handy help.
