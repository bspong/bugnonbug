1) get lots of "application changed, do you want to continue" messages; 2)mozilla stops when I go to email (embarqmail.com)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3

Problem 1) Shortly after I start Mozilla I get several "application changed, do 
you wish to allow" messages from windows.  Happening for a few days

Problem 2) When I go from my home page (myembarq...) to the Embarq mail site Mozilla stops and goes away; I must restart each time after I'm done with email.  I changed the communication channel on my wireless router, and this started.  Maybe coincidental?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.(Mail problem) start Mozilla
2.login to email
3.click "check mail"
Actual Results:  
Mozilla stopped working and went away (no tag at bottom of screen to recall it)

Expected Results:  
Mozilla should remain "in the background" with a tag at the bottom of the screen to call it up

The "application changed" message occurs several times right after I start Mozilla, and intermittently afterward.  When it occurs, the message comes up 2-3 times usually.  It's been happening for a few days.
