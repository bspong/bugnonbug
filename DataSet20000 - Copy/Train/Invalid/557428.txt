Memory leak develops over about 12 hours of use.

Newest rev. 3.6x continues to require more and more memory until overloading the system, hanging, and crashing.  Did not occur using 3.5x.  Tried numerous "fixes" -- quite unsuccessfully. Sorry, to be unable to determine cause...  And, yes, using it on four variously configured machines -- all exhibiting same problem...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. keep many windows and tabs open
2. use FireFox regularly
3. observe crash as memory allocation escalates.
Actual Results:  
FireFox hangs

Expected Results:  
10-16 hours later -- hangs and crashes, every day.

Not gobble more and more resources...
