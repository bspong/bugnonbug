Steps to reproduce:

I was browsing www.apple.com and noticed a bug on the site (double scroll bars for both vertical and horizontal).

I know I don't have the latest version of Nightly and am on 10/18/11.  However, my Windows version is 8 Developer and the startup bug patch (bug 694432) hasn't landed yet in Nightly.


Actual results:

There are TWO scroll bars on www.apple.com for both horizontal and vertical.


Expected results:

Should only be one of each scroll bar and not one inside another.  IE renders the page correctly.
