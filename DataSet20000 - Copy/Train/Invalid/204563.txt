Text entered into textareas displays the spacing andd insertion point
incorrectly. It gets worse the farther to the right the text goesa. Also,
backspaces and text leave screen trash. May be related to fonts that are
displayed at sizes high enough to use anti-aliasing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter a new bug report
2. Type plenty text in the text area 
3. If you are a crap typist as I am, you'll quickly become frustrated
4. Zooming clears screen trash, zooming out enough such that font no longer
anti-aliases results in easy-to-edit text
