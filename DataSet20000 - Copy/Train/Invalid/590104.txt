Download Manager closes on Firefox exit
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100803 Gentoo Firefox/3.6.8

The old behavior was that Firefox would leave the Download Manager be, leaving a user with the option of either opening the files they downloaded from the Download Manager or leaving some background downloads running without the need for the complete Firefox instance to be loaded as well. This behavior was preferable to me personally.

The new situation is that, regardless of whether downloads are running, the Download Manager is closed upon Firefox exit. This may cause half-downloaded files, or a loss of the download history.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox and ensure the "Show the Downloads window when downloading a file" is checked in Preferences -> General.
2. Download a (large) file and the Downloads window should pop up.
3. Before the download is complete, exit the Firefox window. The download window will quit without the user being prompted whether or not they wish to continue the download that's underway.
Actual Results:  
The download manager exited upon firefox exit, breaking off downloads in progress without the user being prompted.

Expected Results:  
The download manager should have remained open so that the download could properly finish. Alternatively, Firefox should have prompted the user with a dialog along these lines:
"You're still downloading a file! Exiting firefox will cancel the download. Really quit? Y/N"
