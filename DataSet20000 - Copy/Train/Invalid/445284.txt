Loaded up Vista, browsed sites with built in IE. Noticed much faster than FF3. So a general improvement needs to be made by Firefox folks, on SPEED optimizations. I know the variables - cache size, Operating system used (my FF is on XP), add-ons in FF slowing down operations etc. But noticed even with multiple tabs opened in IE, it was faster in page rendition than FF3.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start windows Vista
2.open IE
3.browse to a site
4.Open Firefox, browse to same site, notice speed. Maybe less noticeable on very fast computers/hard drives. On my 1.3Ghz its noticeable. Flush cache, turn off plug-ins.



General speed improvements in Firefox would be appreciated. Code Optimization specialists needed to be consulted.
