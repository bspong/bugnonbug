"connection was interrupted" on unsupported SSL cypher
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

If I set Firefox to only allow certain SSL cyphers (such as only allowing AES 128 or 256) and then try to view a HTTPS site that only supports RC4, I get a 'The connection to que.campuscu.com was interrupted while the page was loading.' There is no indication that my SSL cypher limits are causing the issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Only allow AES128/256 encryption
2. Visit a site that has (max) RC4128
3. Witness vague error message
Actual Results:  
Firefox gives a 'The connection was interrupted' page

Expected Results:  
A error page that explains the SSL cypher isn't compatible, and maybe an easy way to turn on the strongest-supported cypher that the site supports.

I disabled all non-AES SSL cyphers in order to test this behavior.
