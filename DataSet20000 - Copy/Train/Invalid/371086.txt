Firefox browser reports a fault and closes not a problem ordinarily as the system enables you to restore the session, however by default the error file is reported to microsoft and I never tell them anything why when their is an eroor does my system by default want to report to Microsoft, can you fix this. also when clicking on links in emails in microsoft outlook by default windows opens as a browser, how do i stop this as I really ahte windows explorer?
Thanks Guys
