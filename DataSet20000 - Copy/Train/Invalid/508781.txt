Hi
I and my family have been faithful fans, followers & word-of-mouth publicists of Mozilla Firefox for quite some time now. Sometime ago, on updating from 3.0.3 to the newer version, WE HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERING A HIGHLY IRRITATING POP UP WARNNING BOX EVERY TIME WE TRY TO LAUNCH FIREFOX.
It reads: "Windows cannot find C:\Documents and Settings\rimu\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\k53b189s.defaults\extensions\{CF40ACC5-e1BB-4aff-AC72-04C2F616BCA7}\chrome\content\getPlus.Adobe_reg_bootstrap.exe'. Make sure you typed the name correctly and then try again. To search for a file,click the start button and then click Search."

Being laypeople in the field of IT, the most we could try is search for the file which the message said, "cannot be found".
We cant take this any more & realise IT IS due to upgrading to the new version (having uninstalled 3.0.3 and not seeing it at all & then upgrading to 3.5.2  and once again bearing the pain of seeing it reappear!!! I understand you have said "do not expect a response" at the top. But dear friends at Mozilla, if we are such devoted fans of yours & have taken the trouble to ask valuable tech advice, could you PLEASE  reply and tell us the way out of this? MANY MANY THANKS
