English words that have an "s" instead of the US "z", such as realise, not realize, and loads more! appear as errors and BritishEnglish dictionary AddOn suggests the American spelling to correct them. 
Or, perhaps I have downloaded BritishEnglish dictionary dictionary AddOn and it does not work? 
There is no way I can see what AddOns are actually working or not working in FireFix, and I ought to be able to Enable and/or Disable any AddOns, oughtn't (?) I?

Expected Results:  
No error in BritishEnglish dictionary / Spellchecker
ps, none of the language dictionaries / spell checkers seem to be able to cope with words from other languages, even though the other dictionaries appear to be loaded: why is there not an option to spellcheck against a group of dictionaries, this is really needed for European users who tend to use several languages quite often..unlike the USofA, the EU has loads and loads of different languages!

There is no workaround for this, it can be a real pain.
