After upgrading to version 3.0.11, firefox doesn't work well with the Itaú bank site. After entering the account numbers, I click on the blue rectangle with my name that should present the virtual keyboard, but nothing happens.
On internet explorer 8 the website work normally.
Before upgrading the site worked normally.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter www.itau.com.br
2. Fill the "agência" and "conta" fields
3. Click on the blue rectangle
4. The virtual keyboard doesn't appear anymore.
Actual Results:  
The virtual keyboard doesn't appear anymore.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should present the virtual keyboard to enter the password.

Tested with my add-ons installed and the upgrade, and with a fresh install of firefox (I deleted the "Mozila" folders on C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Roaming and C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Local before installing, so the bug doesn't refer to add-ons).
