Firefox opens but does not connect to the internet: sit and spin mode only
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.0.2) Gecko/20030208 Netscape/7.02 (VAUSSU03)
Build Identifier: Firefox Setup 1.0.7, from Mozilla website using Netscape browser

Inexplicably, Firefox decided not to see the internet this morning.  It will
simply sit and spin but never connects to any page; my internet connection is
never active.  Uninstalled Firefox and reinstalled latest version to no avail. 
Netscape works fine, so suspect internet connection is not the problem.  Similar
problem reported as #264504.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start computer
2. Start Firefox from toolbar
3. Watch it do nothing.  Connects for a moment, then nothing.

Actual Results:  
Firefox stays open and running but does not connect to any webpage

Expected Results:  
Webpage connection
