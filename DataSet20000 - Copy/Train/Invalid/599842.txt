When starting firefox and using the default homepage (internal website) it will crash within 10 seconds. It keeps trying to load the website untill it crashes.
When (after startup) immediately stopping the loading of the default homepage I'm able to visit other websites. After some time (sometimes a minute, sometimes several minutes) it will crash again.
No crash report is generated.
