After bit.ly shortens URL, text cannot be entered in the text box
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0b5pre) Gecko/20100831 Firefox/4.0b5pre


When using the latest nightly with bit.ly's "Shorten your links and share" service, text cannot be entered in the text area after the URL entered has been shortened.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to reproduce:

- Login to bit.ly
- Copy a URL from the clipboard to the "Shorten your links and share from here" text box
- Wait for the shortened URL to be returned
- Try to enter text in the text box

Expected result: Text can be entered post URL shortening.

Text can be entered until bit.ly tries to parse text that triggers its URI recognition and shortening. As soon as parsing starts, no text can be entered, and the error console reports "Warning: The 'charCode' property of a keyup event should not be used. The value is meaningless."
