Starting with Beta 1, the add bookmarks dialog (both from the "star" in the location bar or the menu) showed only the following items: Bookmarks Menu, Bookmarks Toolbar and only one of my folders.  Also, it did not have the dropdown arrow to access other folders.  

Because of that, I couldn't add bookmarks to the right folders.  My workaround was to add bookmarks to the Bookmarks Menu, then use organize to move the bookmark to the appropriate folder.

This may NOT be a real issue because my gut says that there was some sort of corruption in my bookmarks.  The reason I say this is because when I went into Organize Bookmarks, there were TWO items that said "Bookmarks Menu"  If I renamed one of them to "Bookmarks Menu 1" then both of them got the new name.

I thought it was just a Beta 1 thing, but it continued into Beta 2.

I tried just exporting and re-importing, but that didn't help.

Here's how I fixed the issue...and now I can add bookmarks properly --
1) I exported my bookmarks.
2) I imported them into Safari.
3) I created a new profile in Firefox.
4) I imported Safari's bookmarks.
