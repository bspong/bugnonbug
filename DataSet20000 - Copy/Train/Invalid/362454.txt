If there is a bookmark folder named misc, Firefox will crash when attempting to add bookmarks to it. The dialog box that allows the user to specify details did not appear. Only one URL (http://forum.goteamspeak.com/showthread.php?t=30752) was tried, and only one method was tried (Add Bookmark Here...). Updates will be made after further testing. The URL can be (and was) added in another folder without incident.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Add Bookmark Here extension
2. Create bookmark folder misc
3. add URL as bookmark to misc

Actual Results:  
Firefox crashed when attempted a second time.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have added the bookmark.

Windows gave the error, not Firefox.
