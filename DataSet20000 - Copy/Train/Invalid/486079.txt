FF 3.1 b 3
In this URL click on "jquery-1.3.2.js   117 KB ". The dialog shows jquery-1.3.2.js which is a "text document". I opened the same URL in IE8 and it recognizes it as ".js Javascript file".

Using web sniffer
http://web-sniffer.net/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fjqueryjs.googlecode.com%2Ffiles%2Fjquery-1.3.2.js&submit=Submit&http=1.1&gzip=yes&type=GET&uak=0

the content-disposition is attachment, and the file name ends with .js, so how come it recognizes as a text file?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to URL
2. Click on .js download
3. Resulting dialog box
Actual Results:  
It shows it is a text file to be downloaded, and displays icon for text files. It is a .js file.

Expected Results:  
.js file has different icon which is shown by IE8.
