With JAWS running in the background and a swf file call to flash.accessibility.Accessibility.active always returns false.

In actionscript, there's a flag called active (see http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/langref/flash/accessibility/Accessibility.html#active) which indicates whether a screen reader is currently active and the flash player is communicating with it. I've used that in my test swf and embed it in the html 
and loaded it in FF 3.6.3. Regardless, if JAWS is running or not in the background, this flag always yields to false. In IE 7, this flag is consistent (ie, it returns false when JAWS is not running and true when JAWS is running).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load the html attached to this bug. 
The swf only calls a window.alert with the value of flash.accessibility.Accessibility.active after 1, 3 and 5 seconds delay.

Actual Results:  
The pop-up window will always show that the active flag is always false regardless if JAWS is running in the background or not.

Expected Results:  
The pop-up window should show that active flag is true only if the JAWS is running; Otherwise, false.
