When I Center Click on an item to open a new tab, I get my desktop with multiple small windows based on the number of open programs.  The Minefield window is a black rectangle.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Do a search or look at a list of items in Google Reader
2.Center click to open page in a new tab
3.
Actual Results:  
All open windows minimized and I get my desktop with multiple small windows based on the number of open programs.  The Minefield window is a black rectangle.  If I mouse over a window it slightly enlarges.  If I click on a window it restores to full screen.

Expected Results:  
Minefield should stay open and the item I center clicked should have opened a new tab.  I should continue to have the tab from which I made my selection as the focus. 

I have screen shots but do not see how to attach.  Will do so in a seperate post
