Only in the downards direction and immediately after a mouse wheel scroll the cursor moves up and to the left, infrequently. More frequent with newly switched tabs or upon restarting scrolling down text.  This is a end of January 2011 vanilla virtualized oobuntu build and I do not get this behavior on any other windows. Not really a big deal, but occurs frequently enough to be noticeable and annoying.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a tab with text loaded
2. Scroll down using the mouse wheel
3. Watch as the cursor goes to the upper left corner at a random downward input
Actual Results:  
If I double scroll down sometimes the cursor goes to the original position, instead of moving downards a second time as expected. Otherwise reproducible.

Expected Results:  
There should be no cursor reset.

First bug report. A search of "scroll wheel" "upper left" turned up nothing. This behavior is very strange to me even after years of firefox usage. I am reachable by email.
