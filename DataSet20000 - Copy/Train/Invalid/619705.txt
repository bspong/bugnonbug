BROKEN / REGRESSION

As of today's Nightly (12/16) something is broken.  All the tab previews from Minefield do not show in the Windows taskbar and it worked fine in yesterday's build (12/15).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open multiple tabs in 12/15 Nightly.  All tab previews are available.
2. Try with multiple tabs in 12/16 build (32-Bit for both).  Only first tab has a preview.
Actual Results:  
12/15 build - all tab previews are shown.
12/16 build - only first tab preview is visible.

Expected Results:  
If it worked yesterday it should work today.
