Input fields value is NOT accesible to JavaScript on blur event
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (OS/2; U; Warp 4.5; es-ES; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050922

While developing a JavaScript application I discovered that input field (<input type="text" ... />) values are not accesible for my script functions when the onblur event is triggered, but rather they always get the initial value of those fields.
I tested it in several Mozilla products and they all behave the same. Internet Explorer behaves as I expected and reports the current value. I do my javascript development primarily in Mozilla so this came as a complete surprise to me.
I've made a simple testcase, I'll attach it somewhere over here.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download my testcase file and load it into a Mozilla product.
2. Edit any text field and switch focus somewhere else (just hit tab or whatever).

Actual Results:  
3. See the alert dialog box (wrongly) report the initial value for the input field.


Expected Results:  
4. Repeat the above steps in Internet Explorer and see everything work OK: the alert dialog box reports the current value for the input field.
