Customized toolbar collapse (bookmarks and search box side-by-side)

When I define customized toolbar which looks like [bookmarks,search box], it works precisely. But after restart of Firefox only few bookmark links from Bookmarks toolbar are shown. Many/All of them are hidden under ">>" and there is a huge super-wide search box. But visible bookmarks are expected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. define customized toolbar which looks like [bookmarks,search box]
2. restart Firefox
Actual Results:  
hidden bookmarks, huge search box

Expected Results:  
shown bookmarks, rest (or minimum fixed width) takes fills search box

Its the same on Win XP and current OpenSuse.
Worked fine in Firefox 3.0 (if I rememeber well).
