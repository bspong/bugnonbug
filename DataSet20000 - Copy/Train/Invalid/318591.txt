missing titlebar in all windows

My titlebar and the rest of the border is missing from Firefox. I'm using WinXP SP2 and I just upgraded to FF 1.5, but was experiencing this same problem with FF 1.07. It just started recently and had been working fine. I can't think of any settings or extensions that I have changed/added/updated. This is perfectly consistent in FF, but no other applications are affected. Any popup windows are missing their titlebars also.
I have discovered that resizing the window in any way, including entering 'javascript:top.resizeTo(600,400)' at the locationbar, causes the titlebar/borders to show up.

Having one window open with titlebar visible (having resized the window) and starting a new instance of the browser does not make the titlebar visible in the new instance.

I've checked my extensions against the problematic extensions list, I've searched the Mozillazine Knowledge Base, and found nothing on this.

I've tried loading FF in Safe Mode, and I get my titlebar back, but don't want to work in safemode forever.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, this is driving me nuts. I drag windows around a lot between my two monitors and am at my wit's end.
