Firefox does not respond while it is working in task manager and loads pages
Created attachment 564075
the dump file made by Windows error reporting.

Opened a couple of tabs, started a small download from a reputable site, tried to open Gmail.
While the page was loading and the download still working, Firefox froze and would not respond to any command, like change tabs, minimize, etc. Windows task manager shows that it is running and the CPU usage is fine and under 5%. On any mouse click on the window it produces a "ding" sound, representative of a Windows non responsive error. But I can see it working. In fact it even finished the download in time. But since it would not close, I had to end the task using task manager. I have had this problem since version 6. Hoped it would get fixed in version 7 but it has not.
I am enclosing a file generated by Dr. Watson. The problem occurs more than occasionally. Since firefox does not "crash" in the usual sense, the crash report never pops up so I can not get a stacktrace. If I leave it alone, it continues "working" by itself and will not cause a system crash but will not respond at all. My windows XP system has Service Pack 3 with all updates installed.
