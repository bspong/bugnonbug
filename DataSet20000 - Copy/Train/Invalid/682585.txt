Unexpected doubleclick selection behaviour on Linux
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:6.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0

Steps to reproduce:

Doubleclicking current URL on the awesome bar acts wrong. Ie. if I doubleclick on the word "programming" on http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/, the whole URL gets selected. 

On other platforms (Windows, OSX) the word between /s would get selected with the first doubleclick. On Linux the whole URL gets selected. On the other platforms subsequential doubleclick would select the whole URL.



Expected results:

This is bad for usability as the other platforms act differently. Also, other browsers on Linux platform select the one word only with the first doubleclick. Firefox acts differently from other applications, which is unexpected behaviour.
