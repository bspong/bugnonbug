when i'd opened few windows with few tabs each, i'd checked how much memory does it takes, because i'd found my computer works really slow, then i'd started to close tab by tab, window by window, until there was only one tab in one window left, and it was just www.google.com, but memory used was still big as I saw in Task Manager, after close the last window everything was fine, but I think it would be very useful if You could fix this problem, cause many times I had to save abd then close all tabs with all windows with important pages for me to turn it on again,  thanks
