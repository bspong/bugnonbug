When I right-click on any bookmark or bookmark-folder I get the "links" context-menu.
It seems that the event-handler for this menu has two context-menus, the first (on top of the 2nd) the "link" conext-menu and the 2nd (correct context-menu) just below the 1st.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. just right-click any bookmark or folder
2. now click (left-click) anywhere on the page
3. now you can see the correct menu
