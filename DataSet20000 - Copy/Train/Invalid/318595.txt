I'm a keyboard & tabs junkie, mostly using ctrl-T and ctrl-L to avoid using the mouse. I always have many tabs open at once, but don't believe there is a keyboard shortcut for navigating between them. I believe this would also improve accessibility for whom using a mouse is not easy.

I would prefer having 2 keyboard shortcuts for moving left & right through the open tabs in the current Firefox window. Perhaps Ctrl-Left Arrow and Ctrl-Right Arrow?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
It's an RFE.
