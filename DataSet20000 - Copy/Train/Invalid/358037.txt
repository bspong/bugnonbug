Ctrl + Ins in Location Bar pastes from the wrong buffer. Expected "selection"

From FF20 Ctrl + Ins pastes in the Location Bar, that is wonderful, because it's a xterm shortcut and many people are used to it. The only problem is that in xterm (rxvt etc) Ctrl+Ins pastes from the selection buffer: so I expected Ctrl+Ins in the location bar pasting from the selection buffer too, and not from the Clipboard.

Also because pasting from the clipboard just duplicates what Ctrl+V already does.
