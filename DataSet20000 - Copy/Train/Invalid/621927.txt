When loading a page that has "<?xml" at the top of it, Firefox should do like Internet Explorer does, and display the content as XML, rather than as HTML.

Currently, I /believe/ this only happens when the HTTP Content-type header is set to application/xml, but I don't have a system to test this on.

What I know is that sometimes content is displayed neatly in a tree view as XML, and othertimes, XML content is not.

I work a good deal with XML, so this is nearly enough to make me use Internet Explorer, which makes me rather sad.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load an XML page
Actual Results:  
1. Doesn't load as XML

Expected Results:  
1. Should load as XML
