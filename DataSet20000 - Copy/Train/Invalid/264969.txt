exporting bookmarks doesn't create proper file association
found using 2004101809-0.9 on linux fc2 (using gnome). not sure if this is
limited to linux.

0. make sure that firefox is set to be the default web browser.

1. open the Bookmarks Manager window, select File > Export.

2. the [xul] filepicker dialog appears. I kept the default filename
(bookmarks.html), and chose my desktop as the target location. hit Save button.

observe: the file is saved on my desktop. its icon initially contains the
firefox emblem, but I doubleclick it and a couple odd things happen:

a. the desktop icon for the file turns into the green gnome foot icon.
b. get an alert: "Cannot open bookmarks.html" and verbage saying that opening
this file might pose a security risk, etc.

this is odd, because I can still do the following

* save a webpage (ctrl+S), and it appears as a firefox file on the desktop.
doubleclicking it loads it firefox as expected.

* I can still open bookmarks.html in firefox (ctrl+O) and it loads fine.
