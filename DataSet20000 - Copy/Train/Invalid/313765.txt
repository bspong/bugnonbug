remove tooltips from searchbar
currently the searchbar tooltips are not displaying the right text (Bug 147670 + tons of dupes) and show up miles away from the cursor, in the top-left of the screen (Bug 313673 + the dupes will come if we leave it like that). 

IE6.0 - Only shows tooltip on searchengine, not on pulldown
Opera8.5 - Doesn't show a tooltip at all

Let's just get rid of the searchbar tooltip(s), it's too buggy.
