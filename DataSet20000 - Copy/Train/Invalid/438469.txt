Unable to clear typeahead history for page titles (typeahead for URLs DOES get cleared)

When I select Tools -> Clear Private Data and then both "Browsing History" and "Saved Form and Search History" and click "Clear Private Data Now," the typeahead history for page titles is NOT cleared. Typeahead for URLs does get cleared. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit some sites, noting the page titles
2. Note that when you, for instance, type that first 'w' in the address bar, you get typeahead suggestions based on the page titles as well as page URLs
3. Clear the heck out of your private data
4. Note that you STILL get typeahead suggestions based on page titles (but no longer URLs).
Actual Results:  
As noted in step 4.

Expected Results:  
NO typeahead whatsoever immediately after clearing the private data.
