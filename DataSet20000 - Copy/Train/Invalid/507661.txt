Please stand with me as I describe the problem...it's weird.  

I was exporting my Google notebooks to Google Doc using the Google Notebook's Export function, which when you click on it, it opens a new tab that contains the exported document.  I have about 30 some notebooks.  For the first 10 or so, it worked, then out of nowhere, I got the yellow bar "Firefax has prevented this site from opening 1 pop-up windows".  I clicked "Options", then "Show http...", and the bar remains and now displaying "[prevented] from opening 2 pop-up windows".  So everytime I click "show" the count increases, and I couldn't get my exported document.

Then I tried add google.com, *.google.com to pop-up white list; didn't work.  I went to Tools -> Options..., unchecked block pop-up window; didn't work.

Make me wonder if Firefox has something built-in to prevent unlimited pop-up, and me opening 10 or so new windows in a short time set it off.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to Google Notebook
2. Repeatly export documents until Firefox blocks new window.
3. Allow google.com or uncheck block pop-up window

Actual Results:  
Firefox still blocks new window

Expected Results:  
Open new window or tab
