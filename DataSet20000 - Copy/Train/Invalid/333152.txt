I recently ran a virus scan using kaspersky anvitvirus 5.0.527  on windows xp pro service pack one, and it found tojans in the mozilla cache despite me clearing mozillas cache when Im done using it. since I cannot include file attachments in this bug report I pasted the kasperksy virus info below.
I dont know what website I went to or what I was doing to download these viruses as I did not know they were there till I installed kaspersky, and obviously reporducing this issues is a bad idia.
kaspersky deleted the infected files and I deleted all the cache folders with no problems to the mozilla program functionality/stability, also FYI I have java dissabled 90% of the time on mozilla but I leave java script enabled as allot of websites wont work with it dissabled.
I am a fan of mozilla but have had many issues with the reliablilty of the software such as the first time I installed mozilla many months back, i reset my computer after i installed mozilla and windows wouldnt boot up, I had to run the windows repair option when booting off of the windows xp cd to restore my windows OS. for all I know these trojans have been on my pc from day one and worries me about how secure mozilla actually is compaired to how secure it claims to be, if possible feel free to e-mail me with any comments about this issue as I would like to see what your have to say about it.
