When setting cookies, FF 1.5.0.1 often/sometimes adds a period "." in front of the domain.
This usually causes problems especially when trying to unset the cookie.  I saw TONS of potentially related forum questions but no bug report...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clear all yahoo cookies from Firefox
2. goto http://mail.yahoo.com and accept cookie named "B"
3. view the cookie in Options

Actual Results:  
The "Domain" of the cookie is set to ".yahoo.com"

Expected Results:  
cookie domain should be set to "yahoo.com"
