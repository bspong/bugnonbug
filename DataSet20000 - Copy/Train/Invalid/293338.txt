all instances are closed when I force to close an unresponsive instance
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; it-IT; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.3

when an instance of firefox is unresponsive, all instances of firefox get
unresponsive, and if I try to force to close one of them, all instances of
firefox are closed by the operating system.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open 2 or more instances
2.try to get an instance unresponsive
3.close it (or close the download manager or the bookmarks manager) 

Actual Results:  
all instances were closed

Expected Results:  
close just the instance you forced to close

version 1.0.3 seems to be more unresponsive than the previous

of course firefox rules because the same problem on internet explorer closes any
windows on microsoft operating systems
