Minefield appears to be very heavy on memory leaks

I'm currently displaying only this bugzilla page.  Previously, I was displaying the google search page.  I've had a lot of different pages open, but only one page with low memory requirements is currently open.  The browser is using about 270 MB.  Running the leaks program in OS X, I get:

% leaks 8410
Process 8410: 684163 nodes malloced for 139957 KB
Process 8410: 68201 leaks for 1389744 total leaked bytes.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Run Minefield for a while.
2.  Memory usage gets very high.

Actual Results:  
Using 270 MB with just google.com open.

Expected Results:  
Memory usage should be reasonable.
