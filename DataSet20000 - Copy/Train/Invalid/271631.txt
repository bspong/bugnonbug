Firefox 1.0 won't log into my wifi network

I can't log into my university's wifi network with Firefox 1.0.
Everything works correctly with 1.0PR: I launch Firefox, enter a URL, and I am
taken to the wifi login page (https://bluesocket.bathspa.ac.uk/), I enter my
user ID and then the origianlly requested page loads.

With Firefox 1.0, I merely get a "URL cannot be found" message.
