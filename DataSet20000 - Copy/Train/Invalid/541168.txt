Installed Secure Password Generator 0.5.4, which the compatibility system tells me is OK for FF 3.6.  It does not show up in the Tools menu (where it usually resides).  In the Add-ons window there is an entry for it containing the usual Disable and Uninstall buttons, plus an Options button. Clicking the Options button freezes the Add-ons window.  The window stops responding and cannot even be dragged, although it does repaint when raised or unobscured.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Secure Password Generator and restart FF
2. Tools/Add-ons
3. Find the Secure Password Generator 0.54 entry, click the Options button
Actual Results:  
Add-ons window stops responding

Expected Results:  
Options dialog displayed
