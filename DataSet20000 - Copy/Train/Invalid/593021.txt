The Tabs relatively large. The entire Tab tool bar is almost 3 times the size(width) of navigational tool bar. I'm observing this issue after I updated my browser  4.0 beta4.  Along with the browser tabs, I see the large "Group your tabs" button with lot of small icons (forward, back, stop, etc) within. These icons repeat them selves with in the "group your tabs" multiple times.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Upgrade to Firefox 4.0 beta 4. 
2.launch firefox 4.0  beat4 

Actual Results:  
I see the large tabs bar
