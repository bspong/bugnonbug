Open webpages disappear from the Tab Bar while still remaining in the list of open tabs (arrow on the right-hand side of the tab bar).

I had only three tabs appearing in the Tab Bar, but four were listed in the drop-down menu on the right-hand side of the Tab Bar. When I clicked on the tab that was missing from the Tab Bar, none of the tabs in the Tab Bar were selected. This may explain why Firefox 3.5 has sometimes (uncharacteristically) allowed me to close all open tabs while leaving Firefox open (there was probably one tab still open that was not displayed in the Tab Bar).

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
Don't know. Tends to appear during ordinary use of the browser.
Actual Results:  
Tabs are not displayed in the Tab Bar even though they are still active (according to drop-down menu on the right).

Expected Results:  
All open tabs should be visible in the Tab Bar.

I cannot reproduce this bug on demand, but it has occured numerous times while I've been using Firefox 3.5. I never had this problem with previous versions of Firefox (as far as I can recall). I was using the default theme when this bug occurred, and had the latest version of Firefox (3.5.1).
