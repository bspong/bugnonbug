When a new tab is created, memory gets allocated. immediately closing that tab DOES NOT return the memory to the pool. Continuing to add and remove new tabs simply monotonically increases memory usage under FF. 

Once it gets past approx 350K of memory, the UI slows down to the point that rolling over a link takes the UI about 3 seconds to recognize and "enable" the link. same with buttons. any kind of click action on interface items requires an equal amount of time to process.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. notice memory usage
2.create new tab, immediately close tab
3. notice memory increase
Actual Results:  
memory usage simply increases, and never goes down.

Expected Results:  
properly free the memory, so that windows can reclaim it.
