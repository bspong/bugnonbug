Automatic Update wants to update FF 1.5 Beta 1 to "1.4.1"?
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b5) Gecko/20051006 Firefox/1.4.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b5) Gecko/20051006 Firefox/1.4.1

Looks like the "1.4" moniker is still embedded all over the place in Firefox
1.*5* Beta2.

Even the UA string still reads "1.4.1".  The effect is most spectacular when the
Automatic Update kicks in and wants to update Firefox 1.*5* Beta 1 to "1.4.1" (!?)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Examine the User Agent string for FF 1.5 Beta2.

OR

1. Install FF 1.5 Beta 1
2. Try a Help/Check for Updates...

Actual Results:  
For the first one, the UA string is as noted in this bug report.

For the second case, it offers a new update to Firefox 1.4.1 (instead of
1.5.something).


Expected Results:  
All version strings in FF 1.*5* should say "1.*5*.something".


Marking this "major" as it could be a source of major confusion (especially for
the automatic update that wants to "update" from 1.5 Beta1 to 1.4.1.

Also choosing component "General", as this is not really a problem with
Automatic Update per se (since the internal strings are all consistently 1.4.*,
even though the title bar and Help pages all say "1.5 Beta 2".
