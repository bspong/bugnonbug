Endless loading after autoscrolling on a newly opened tab

I admit it isn't normal browsing behaviour, however the facts are I opened a new
(blank) tab and middle-clicked in it (in the page itself, not on the tab to
close it). Then, it triggered a "loading URL behaviour": Animated top right
circle, filled up progress bar, Stop enabled in tollbar and View menu. Neither
closing the tab, nor hitting stop/esc could stop it, loading an URL did though.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure that "Autoscrolling" is chencked in the Advanced Options
2. Open a new tab
3. Middle-click in the newly opened page

Actual Results:  
It triggered a "loading URL behaviour": Animated top right circle, filled up
progress bar, Stop enabled in toolbar and View menu. You may want to check the
URL I provided for a screenshot (20 KB).

Expected Results:  
Nothing

Nothing happens if I open a new tab, then switch back to the previous tab and
middle-click
