window.dump() does not display dumped string to Firefox console

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make an extension or use an extension that allows injecting javascript commands into Firefox.
2. Use the javascript command "window.dump('Hi');" in the extension code or otherwise run this javascript command in Firefox
3. Observe no output to the Firefox console
Actual Results:  
No output to Firefox console

Expected Results:  
The line "Hi" should appear on the Firefox console

It would be helpful if this bug were fixed as some extension authors use console output for debugging purposes.
