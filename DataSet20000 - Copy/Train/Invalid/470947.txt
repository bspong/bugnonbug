Enhancement: Include DNS test in diagnostic tests section of Page Load Error/troubleshooting message

The Troubleshooting Tools buttons added in FF3 are nice.  I think an additional test for DNS problems should be included, indicating (a) whether DNS responded or not and (b) what the response was (ie. either the resolved IP or the error message returned)

Many OS's and applications respond to DNS failures in strange ways that don't intuitively point the user to a problem with DNS... often firefox will just hang until DNS times out and give you an Address Not Found error.  In other situations, the URL may resolved from a local cache, but if DNS has recently gone down subsequent lookups needed to render the main will timeout but not result in an Address Not Found error.  

It would be nice to know if this was because the server failed to resolve the addr (and why!), or if the DNS server didn't even respond.  If it's the latter, it could be for a variety of reasons, but at least you have a better idea of where the problem lies.

Expected Results:  
An new "DNS" button among the other diagnostic tools buttons ("Ping Server", "Retry This", "Trace to Server", etc.).  When clicked, a DNS request for the the host named in the URL would be sent (bypassing local cache), and the results would be shown, including DNS server name/IP, main result (eg. timeout, error, success), the IP address of the target host or the error message received from the DNS server (plus anything else that might be useful, such as a layman's interpretation and suggestions of what to do in each case.)
