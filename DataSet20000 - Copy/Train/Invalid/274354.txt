Firefox worked perfect until 2minutes ago: I opened it, and a winodw poped up,
asking me to choose a profile to use. I clicked on "ok" choosing the "default"
profile, but I had an error window telling me that I had to choose or create a
new profile cause "default" was already in use. 
I created the "défault user profile" but when I opened Fifefox again, I had lost
ALL my bookmarks and preferences.
How am I supposed to have my bookmarks and preferences back now? 
Please help me.
Thanks in advance!
