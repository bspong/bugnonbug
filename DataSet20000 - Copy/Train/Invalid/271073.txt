Images do not render specifically on JAPANESE Amazon site with Mac Firefox 1.0 (OSX)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

This is very frustrating. I order a lot of products from www.amazon.co.jp. The
images render PERFECTLY on the US&Canadian Amazon sites but not the Japanese
site. In fact none of the crucial buttons/images appear: Amazon logo, shopping
cart, view account, add to shopping cart, etc--you can't see anything. The
strange thing is, there was no problem with this site when I was using the
Preview Release but now that I've upgraded to Firefox 1.0 it doesn't work :(:(
Images render perfectly with Camino and Safari. Is it possible to download the
preview release still? If so, from where? (I couldn't find it in the FTP
archive.) Would greatly appreciate a response. I LOVE Firefox but this is the
site I access the most, and it's useless for this purpose now.
