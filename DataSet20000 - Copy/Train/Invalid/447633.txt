Too large character spacing with font "Segoe UI" between two "m"s without ClearType

The space between two m's in an Input field is too large. It looks like if one entered a blank between both letters.
This seems only happen with Firefox (2 or 3), but not with Internet Explorer or Safari. The font "Segoe UI" must be installed (comes with Office 2007, i think). 

Additionally, if the ClearType font adaption in Windows is enabled, this bug also doesn't ocurr.
