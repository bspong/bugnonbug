Click on "Get Bookmark Add-ons" in Bookmarks menu doesn't open the page in a new tab

Selecting the "Get Bookmark Add-ons" menu item under the Bookmarks menu opens the target page inside the currently open tab. This is bad because on a couple of dynamic websites you will loose any content which was entered in textboxes. We always open a new tab for the menu items under help and we should do it here the same way.

I was tricked by this while running the BFT and loosing all my entered data. That's why I will enter the dataloss keyword. No idea how complex the fix will be and if it something we could consider for 1.9.1.x.
