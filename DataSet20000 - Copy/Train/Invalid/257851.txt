I have Fedora Core 1 running on a server on my LAN, and I just installed Firefox
0.9.3 on my workstation, which is a clean, fully updated version of Fedora Core 1.

Server is running Apache V2.

New Install of Firefox 0.9.3 will not allow me to set home page to my home page
on local server - clicking OK button does not dismiss the preferences dialog, or
save newly entered home page. Will not allow me to set www.google.com either -
cannot set home page at all...........

Did not have this problem on the same network with any previous version of Firefox
