3.0.9 simply does not work on my machine. It hangs on the pages
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/523.12.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.0.4 Safari/523.12.2
Build Identifier: 

I load it, it hangs for about 3 minutes before loading.  Then on the pages that took about a second to load in 3.0.8, it takes between 20 seconds and a minute to load the pages. When I click form links, it only works about half the time.

Please tell me how I can downgrade back to 3.0.8, which was working fine. I need to turn off this auto-install.  With each update, Firefox seems to be getting worse and worse. This one simply does not work on my machine. :-(

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load Firefox
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
hung browser pages, very, very slow to process anything

Expected Results:  
It just hangs!!! It doesn't work!!!! How do I downgrade to 3.0.8? I'm just lucky I had Safari installed as a backup, or I would be completely dead in the water. :-(
