Ensure Places Migrates Correctly
We need to do a full test of our various migration components on a set of existing profiles, rather than testing each piecemeal. This is important since this is the codepath our users will be going down, vs our testing so far in our fresh debug profiles. 

This might be best done after the stability issues with the database are shaken down.
