Hi all

When I have a Skype conference going and I open and scroll pages in FF, the sound in Skype starts to breakup and stays broken even after the work in FF is stopped.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Attend a Skype conference
2. Open 4-5 from Bookmarks (Open All in tabs) pages in FF
3. Navigate and Mouse scroll on a page


Actual Results:  
Skype has broken sound and stays that way until the conference is disconnected and attended again.

Expected Results:  
Skype sound stays okay
