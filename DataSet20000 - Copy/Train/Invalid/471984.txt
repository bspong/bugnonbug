Firefox multiple versions endless loop loading page

This issue first started with firefox 3.0 that came with Ubuntu 8.10.  I removed firefox 3 and installed firefox 2.0, the problem went away. but as of the newest update firefox 2.0.0.19, the problem has returned!

i get email notifications for online surveys.  when i click the link, a new tab is opened, i verify my survey ID and it passes me to the survey link.  when this happens, the page is blank and loading, but it never loads.  

this happens with any survey from Greenfield online.  I can open the link in a new tab or new window and it does the same thing.  I have left the window to load for up to 60 minutes and no error generates.

I have searched for a fix, i have been told it was spyware, my popup blocker, cookies, java or the agent check. none of these things fixed the issue.

I am going to attempt reinstalling firefox 2.0.0.18 to see if can get it working again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open survey notice in Gmail.
2.click link in email.
3.new tab opens, verify ID (clicking a button).
4. watch as tab goes blank and loading wheel spins endlessly.
