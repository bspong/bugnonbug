Firefox seems to "miss" actual private browsing status
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1pre) Gecko/20090605 Shiretoko/3.5pre (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1pre) Gecko/20090605 Shiretoko/3.5pre (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When private browsing is stopped, Shiretoko still displays (Private Browsing) after the website name in the title bar. More weirdly, under tools it still reads "Stop Private Browsing Ctrl+Shift+P", but when clicked Shiretoko asks if I like to START private browsing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Under normal browsing, choose Tools > Start Private Browsing. Shiretoko will restart in PB
2. When done, go back to Tools > Stop Private Browsing. Shiretoko will restart. The title bar still reads (Private Browsing)
3. Go to Tools > Stop Private Browsing. Shiretoko will ask whether you would like to START private browsing
4. Only way to remove it is to manually restart (not through the Tools menu)
Actual Results:  
1. Title bar still reads (Private Browsing)
2. Tools menu still has option "Stop Private Browsing"
3. Clicking "Stop PB" leads to asking if one would like to "Start PB"

Expected Results:  
1. Title bar return to normal
2. Tools has option "Start Private Browsing"
3. "Stop PB" should only appear when actually in PB

Same issue was seen in 3.5 beta 4
