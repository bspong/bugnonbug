When you have some links on page with the same accesskeys and only one of these links is shown, FF3.5 won't execute displayed link action on access key press. However, FF3 does, it executes oncliks of displayed links disregarding not-displayed links.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Use a test page, please note there is a hidden link with the same 'S' accesskey set as on displayed link.
1. Try to press Alt (+ Shift) + S
Actual Results:  
Link with id 'aS' just focuses.

Expected Results:  
Should be activated onclick for link with id 'aS'.
