In our local network we share connected to Internet through VPN network. So, I am often using Firefox offline (to view saved html pages) and sometimes go to WWW by establishing VPN connection.

Problem: When I am offline, Firefox displays "Connect: VPN" window every other minute. (E.g. that standart WinXP window - login, password, etc.). 

It is really irritating! I disabled checks for update, turned off all Firefox addons and  deleted RSS-channels. Nothing helps!!! I updated Firefox recently, it wasn't doing it before (I don't remember what version I had before updating).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Disconnect from VPN.
2. Wait 5-10 minutes.

Actual Results:  
Damn thing doesn't happen when I'm trying reproduce it. But happens alot when I'm not expecting it.

Expected Results:  
Nothing.
