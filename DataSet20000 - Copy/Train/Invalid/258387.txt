bug: when you set a bookmark to check a page and look for updates and then open
a window when things change and then delete said bookmark, it still opens a
windowwhen things change and you can't stop it from doing so, especially because
the bookmark isn't in the bookmarks folder any more.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Expected Results:
