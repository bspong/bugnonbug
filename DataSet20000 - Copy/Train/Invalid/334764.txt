Page capture of Paperport 10 Professional does not work
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7

I use Paperport 10 Professional to get and save in a searchable database web page information.  This works well with IE6.0 and when "web capture" in the tray is clicked on it captures the entire page. When I am at the same page with Firefox it just locks up and becomes unresponsive. I really like Firefox better but I need this function to work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Acquire web page with Firefox and a search engine
2.Click on the paperport webpage capture in the system tray
3.The system locks up and becomes non-responsive

Actual Results:  
see above

Expected Results:  
see above

If I perform the same steps with IE 6.0 the response is just to activate the webpage capture feature of Paperport 10 Professional. I would like to use Firefox as my routine browser but I need this Paperport 10 Profesional function.

I have reported this months ago and have downloaded the latest updates from Mozilla and still the problem persists.
