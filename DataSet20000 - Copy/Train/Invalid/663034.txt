The Java console does not load from the Tools menu in Firefox 4.0.1
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1

Although I did see something similar posted in 2010, I did not see the problem until the most recent update of Java (update 26).  

I found this message in the Error console:

Error: Components.classes['@mozilla.org/oji/jvm-mgr;1'] is undefined
Source File: chrome://javaconsole1.6.0_26/content/ffjcext.js
Line: 33

Does this suggest that the problem is caused by the Java installation?  I had installed, uninstalled, and reinstalled Java to make sure that I had the correct version of the Java console.

I am running Windows XP Home Edition SP3.  The Java console extension 6.0.26 is installed and enabled.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Java update
2.Open Firefox and the Tools menu and attempt to open the Java console
3.

Actual Results:  
The Java console did not open.

Expected Results:  
The console should open, even if there is nothing happening.  This was the way it worked in the past, though it has been some time since I even looked at it.  I would not have paid any attention except that there were reports of problems related to the Java console since the latest update of Java (emergency release of update 26).
