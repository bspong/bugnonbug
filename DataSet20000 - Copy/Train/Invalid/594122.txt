Switch to tab remains in location bar when switching windows
STR on Mac:
1. open google.com in one tab
2. type "google" in a new tab
3. option-tab to another window and option-tab back

Expected: "switch to tab" and URL should revert to original like pressing ESC does (I think?)
Actual: "switch to tab" with URL remains

Actually, it is possible to even do this with one tab (which is probably a separate bug). You can "switch to tab" to the tab you are currently in. Following the steps above, you get the URL for the current window with the "Switch to tab" label.
