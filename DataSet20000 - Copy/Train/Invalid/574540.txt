Okay, I do not care about any technical info to get you to fix the POS you AUTOMATICALLY installed! ALL I want it to be able to undo it!!!!!!!!

3.6.4 IS MOST DEFINITELY a POS, and you ALREADY know that. Now, how about putting that junk on hold and tell us HOW to undo the lousy, Microsoft-like junk you just inflicted on us?

ALL we want is for you to ALLOW us to UNDO the ABSOLUTE CRAP you just killed us with!!! Yes, I can download and re-install 3.6.2 to get rid of 3.6.4, but ALL of my BOOKMARKS are GONE, the google-search bar is disabled and NOTHING works like it used to! Thanks a lot. You have a bright future with MS. I will now DISABLE any updates from you and THOROUGHLY research ALL CRAP you come out with next.

Good job, NOT!!!!!

4. Download prior Firefox version and install -- ALL BOOKMARKS GONE, and nothing works correctly (including google search)!
5. Go to Firefox support -- ABSOLUTELY ZERO HELP!!!!!!!!!
6. Fill out these forms -- probably no help
7. Equate Firefox with MS-Internet-Exploder

Actual Results:

2. When it blows up, decide to go back to prior version.
3. Find out that Firefox sucks, big time!

Expected Results:  
1. Try XP Restore -- no help
2. Re-install Firefox 3.6.2 - find out all bookmarks GONE! and stuff broken.
3. Search Internet (including Firefox site) and find NO HELP!!!!!!!

Umm... it would be nice if 3.6.4 actually worked as well as ANY prior version, or at least not have crashed! I mean really, you tout "crash protection" but mean "crash assurance".
