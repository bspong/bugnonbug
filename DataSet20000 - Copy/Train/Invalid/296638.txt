mozilla sends mass emails with virus attachements to random addresses
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows 98)
Build Identifier: 1.0.4

I have been recieving alot of returned emails with virus attachements thru 
using outlook express 6.00.2800.1123. I recieve these email only when I use the 
firefox browser. the returned emails stop when I use another browser and do not 
start firefox at all. I believe firefox has been turned into a zombie mass 
mailing program. I have not tried anything but running AVG free anitviruse 
version 7.0.323 which has not worked. I have a Zone alarm free 5.5.094 firewall 
and when I take out the premissions for firfox browser to communicate out of my 
computer, the emails stop.
I love firefox and hate using the internet explorer.  Please help with 
suggestions.
thank you

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start using firefox
2.it starts works very slow, not like before, pages take for ever to load.
3.

Actual Results:  
after I have used the firfox browser,even if its for a minute, I check my mail 
using outlook express and there is at least three or four returned emails, with 
attachments, from poeple I do not know.

Expected Results:  
Run at its previous normal speed, without me getting returned emails from 
unkown addresses.

I am not a computer expert, but I know all returned virus email only happen 
when I use firefox. I have stoped using firefox and went back to internet 
explorer, and the emails have stoped so far.
