I have a HTML file with an external stylesheet. When I'm opening the HTML file
from the filesystem (e.g. using file:///d:/test/test.htm), mozilla will not
load/use the styles from an external CSS file.

When the file is loaded via web server (http://...) it works as expected.
Internet Explorer displays the file correctly (even with file://...).

The external CSS file is included with:
 <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="test.css" />

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See details.

Actual Results:  
Style definitions from the external CSS are not applied to the HTML file.

Expected Results:  
Load and apply the style definitions from the external CSS.
