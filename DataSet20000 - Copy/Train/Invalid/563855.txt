While browsing ubuntu forums a malware window was displayed alerting for a system security

I had just install a new Linux O/S and Firefox. No personalization were done yet at both. I was browsing Ubuntu Foruns, when soon appeared a new window that looked like a "genuine" system security warning about a security issue, and asking to click a buttom for a system survey.
I disconnected my modem, and pressed ok. Then, a new Firefox windows tab opened, showing graphical activity, similar to a virus scan.
I took a screenshot and hard disconnected the pc.
Next time I logged in, Firefox was unable to get started. 

Reproducible: Didn't try




Please note that together with being using a just installed linux o/s I was visiting sites that I use to visit, by routine, since I use Linux/Firefox (1 year). Never ever before, anywhere, anything (even far) similar, had happened.
 
So, this looks like a vulnerability at Firefox, by the apparent easy manner how I was targeted with the referred window while using a safe (Ubuntu Forum) site, and also because, even after disconnecting the net, Firefox opened a new window tab, showing graphical activity.

As it happened on a just installed system, I cannot information about loss of information. 

The reason why Firefox did not start at next boot, may have been caused by the hard shut down or by the malware. Everything else, system wise, looks ok. 

For this reason I'll classify this as a security issue, with normal severity, that should be fixed.
