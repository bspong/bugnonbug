when i go to www.google.com i am feeling lucky and google search button disappears and sometimes page is displaed with a fade-in effect. I dug the internet and realized that "cookies" needed to be deleted to restore the buttons. Some false forum participants state that it was google's experiment. Bu it is not the case because internet explorer shows the buttons. I hope this bug gets resolved quickly
