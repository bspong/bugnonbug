Rename "Show in Sidebar" menuitem to "View History in Sidebar"
Firefox-trunk, but also applies to Firefox 2.

Used to Camino and Safari, I was looking for a menuitem akin to "View History". Found nothing. 

Then after a while I noticed "Show in Sidebar" in the History menu. How about making it a tiny bit more explicit and less context-sensitive, by renaming it to "View History in Sidebar"?
