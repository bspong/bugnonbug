I am unable to use Mozilla Firefox. All functions are dead except for green download arrow. Toolbar does not respond. Firefox message does not appear. Google does not appear. This happened after I downloaded version 1.5. I reloaded version 1.0 from CD. It behaved the same so I downloaded 1.5 again and this did not function. I am sending this to you on Microsoft Internet Explorer which does function.  What should I do?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I load Mozilla from its icon on START memo
2.Mozilla apears on screen but it is dead except for green download arrow
3.I have repeated this at least 4 times with restart between.

Actual Results:  
Mozilla Firefox refuse to function

Expected Results:  
MF does not function

When MF is functioning properly the Firefox message and the Google message appear on screen almost imediately and the Toolbar functions. I have just run Norton Anti Virus and they report I have a virus that they have quarentined.
