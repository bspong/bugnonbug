The image I linked in the URL appeares as a black square on my system. I downloaded the image with wget (much slower than firefox did), and was able to view it in EOG. I tried Chromium as well (with the URL), and it displayed it fine.

Right now I'm working on a somewhat unreliable wifi connection.

This is what I see: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1470243/jpeg_issue_screenshot.png

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the link
2. It happened once that displayed most of the image, there was a black strip on the bottom, try zooming in, it will turn black.
3. Most of the time it only displays a black square. F5 and C-F5 won't make any difference.

Actual Results:  
9 times out of 10 I only see a black square.

Expected Results:  
I expect an actually rendered image.

I found two bugs, which may be related, but I wasn't sure:

1. This one was reported on the 2.0 branch, but even the image source (hubble telescope) and file size is the same: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=330065

2. This one is 3.5, but it is only about zooming: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=511776
