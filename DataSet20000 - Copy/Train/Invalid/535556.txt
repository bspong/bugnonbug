When in Google Reader and some other websites, sometimes when I put the mouse over a hyper-link it starts blinking like crazy (very fast).  At the bottom of the browser, it reads the hyper-link (blinking at the same speed as the mouse) as one of the links in my bookmarks toolbar.  It picks the link randomly as far as I can tell.  The toolbar button in question also blinks like crazy at the same time like I'm putting the mouse over the button and off the button (only a zillion times a second).  Occurs randomly.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Google Reader
2. Start sifting through RSS feeds
3. After a few minutes it should have happened
Actual Results:  
It did the same thing.

Expected Results:  
It should not have the buttons or mouse blinking.
