I am  not sure how this got introduced. I suspect it started when I first tried app tab in 4b2. Now the List All Tabs button is shown as a tall vertical bar which takes the full height of the active area of the browser. It sits on the right from the vertical scroll bar and can not be moved or removed. I tried all known to me methods including uninstall.

Reproducible: Always




I still have 3.6.8 installed on this machine
