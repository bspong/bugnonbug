Don't start Firefox after install, if root
Appearantly, the Installer launches Firefox after the installation completed,
even if the Installer ran as root, resulting in a Firefox running as root.

That's a very bad idea security-wise, applications should never (not even once)
run as root. This basically leads or even trains the user to cut himself.

Compare bug 247412.

It's also reason for user confusion, because the profile probably is being
created under root's home, not the user's home, so all configuration during the
first run (where people typically configure the app) is practically lost after
the user restarts the computer.

Suggested fix:
- If Installer runs as root, don't start Firefox automatically.
- If that's too complicated, don't start Firefox automatically after
installation at all.
