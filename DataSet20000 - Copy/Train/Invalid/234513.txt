We have written a web application where it is possible to edit an image to
contain different input elements later. For that purpose we upload the image to
the web server and display it as an image map to give the user the possibility
to add input elements (checkboxes, buttons, etc.), we then reload the page and
place the input elements with CSS positioning (absolute) over the picture (image
map), but in Mozilla this isn't possible (the browser shows the input elements
under the image map).
In IE this works finde

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. create an image with the "ismap" attribute
2. try to add an input element with "absolute" CSS positioning on the image map
3. --> doesn't work

Actual Results:  
The Input elements were displayed under the image map

Expected Results:  
Display the input elements on the image map.
