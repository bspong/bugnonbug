KDE implements two clipboard systems for cut and paste.
-One similar to the windows CTRL-C/CTRL-V.
-One traditional unix using page markup (copy)/middle click (paste)

In normal use both works fine, but when Firefox is closed the contents of the CTRL-C buffer seems to go missing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Mark some text in the browser, for example the URL
2. Insert it into the clipboard by pressing CTRL-C
3. Close browser
4. Try pasting the clipboard content somewhere, for example the location bar of a reopened Firefox browser
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.


Expected Results:  
The content should be pasted...

The content of the other buffer (the markup/middle click one) works fine all the time.
