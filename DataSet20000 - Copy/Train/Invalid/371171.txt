snap of bad page

See the enclosed pic.

I was viewing Axel's preso. I got a few slides in a hit the button in the bottom right to go back to the start. It looks like a 0 with a backslash through it.

When I hit the button, I go to a page that looks like a couple of other pages mashed together.

I can hit the URL again and everything goes back to normal.
