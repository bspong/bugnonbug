I tried 1.5 a few months ago and could eventually get it downloaded but all bookmarks were lost and it did not function. Tried again today with 1.5.0.1 and dowloaded it and it would not open - was able to recover bookmarks and use of browser by re-installing 1.07 and am happy with this version but have been warned it is insecure and subject to attack by hackers - Why can I not use the newer version on this computer, it is only one year old and has a 40g harddrive.
