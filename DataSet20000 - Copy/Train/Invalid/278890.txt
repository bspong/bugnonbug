For 2 weeks or so message appears that a particular site cannot be found.  If I
click "OK" or the X cancellation site it disappears and there seems to be no
problem using the site afterwards.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Boot up successfully or use another program
2.Click on Mozilla
3.The Alert with the message in question appears

Actual Results:  
There appears to be no functional problem afterwards.  The Dell technician in
India told me after she had run through efforts to eradicate the message to
contact Mozilla.

Expected Results:  
The Alert should not be there.
