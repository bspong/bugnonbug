External .css containing HTML tags only partially recognized
I know, it's not correct external CSS, but if an external css-file with the content:

  <style type="text/css">
  <!--
  .dummy { color: red; } 
  .dummy2 { color: blue; }
  -->
  </style>

is referenced with <LINK ...> then the .dummy2-Style is usable in the including
file whereas the .dummy-Style is not. Checked with DOM-Inspector.

Shouldn't the content in the .css be either fully ignored or fully recognized?
Partially presence of the styles easily leads to confusion.
