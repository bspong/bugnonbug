I did an upgrade from your website from 1.02 to 1.03.  I couldn't open any 
webpages.  I rebooted the machine and the same thing happened.  I uninstalled 
the software and reinstalled and still couldn't open any webpages.  I rebooted 
again.  Nothing.  I uninstalled the software, rebooted, disabled firewall and 
virus protection, reinstalled and still I cannot open any webpage. 

I tested in IE and Netscape and those webpages are working fine and my ISP 
isn't down, so something bad happened with the upgrade.  I really like Firefox 
and don't want to give up.
