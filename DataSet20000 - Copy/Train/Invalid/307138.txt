I a running Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10)
Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6.  Last night I was on Yahoo Sports looking at live
updates of a Nascar race, when I just got the hour glass and it stopped
responding. I clicked on the X to shutdown the window and it closed with no
problem, when I restarted Firefox it went to the FireFox start page which I had
changed to panthers.com and my toolbars are gone too.  I only have the Getting
Started button and Latest Headlines button. My Yahoo buttons are gone as well as
my like this site and don't like this site toolbar, I can't remember what that
toolbar was called. Then I looked at my bookmarks and all the ones that I added
are gone all the default ones that come with Firefox are there.  It is almost
like it is a new install.  I did reboot but that had know effect on the problem.
