Build ID: 20110928134238

Steps to reproduce:

Please navigate as below from MENU bar:
Tools --> Options --> Advanced --> General.




Actual results:

Under "Browsing" there is an extra checkbox which is unnecessary. I have verified the Nightly version before reporting and it has the same interface same as the stable version. In fact, this issue is not till the Firefox 6. I noticed it started with Firefox 7 and still present in Firefox 7.1 too.


Expected results:

If we notice the end of the line in the first and third frames within the window, it confirms there is some text possibly missing againts the checkbox or the checkbox is unnecessary and should have been removed.
