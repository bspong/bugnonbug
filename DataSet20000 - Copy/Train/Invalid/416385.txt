Cisco Security Device Manager (SDM) closes all instances of Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-USrv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 ;Firefox/2.0.0.11

When exiting Cisco SDM software 2.4 or 2.5 cause all instances of Firefox to close.  Either a crash to desktop or a design issue with the way Cisco software interacts with browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open one instance of Firefox and browse to any site
2.Open another instance of Firefox
3.Connect to router URL running SDM
4.Enter login credentials
5.SDM launch page opens
6.Enter additional login credentials
7.SDM console apears
8.Click on File|Exit
9.Click on yes for 'Are you sure you want to exit..."



Closing SDM should not cause other instances of Firefox to close.  This issue causes considerable amount of inconvenience when I have to reopen, re-login and/or browse back to other web-based systems.
