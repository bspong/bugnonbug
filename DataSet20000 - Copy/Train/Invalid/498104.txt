Firefox is fully blocked as soon as launched, just afetr upgrade to 3.0.11 ( spinning color wheel)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060214 Firefox/3.0.11
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060214 Firefox/3.0.11

Just after upgrading, Firefox is blocked and is blocking my computer. This happened to me at the previous upgrade as well.

The solution is to remove all Firefox files from "application support"; then firefox works fine ( but problem: lost all bookmarks and passwords etc..)

Reproducible: Always
