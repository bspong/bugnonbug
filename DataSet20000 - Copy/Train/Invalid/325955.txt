Well, both browsers are Gecko based, but, epiphany works with yahoo chess and firefox does not.

Versions:
Firefox: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5
Epiphany: Web Browser 1.8.3

Java Plugin (about:plugins)
Firefox: Java(TM) Plug-in 1.4.2_10-b03, File name: libjavaplugin_oji.so, Java(TM) Plug-in 1.4.2_10
Epiphany: Java(TM) Plug-in 1.4.2_10-b03, File name: libjavaplugin_oji.so, Java(TM) Plug-in 1.4.2_10

There is only one java installed on system: Sun JDK 1.4.2_10

uname -a
Linux Gandalf 2.6.14-gentoo-r5 #1 PREEMPT Mon Jan 16 09:44:58 EST 2006 i686 AMD Athlon(tm) XP 2600+ AuthenticAMD GNU/Linux


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto http://games.yahoo.com/ch
2. Login if need be, click on "Click Here to Continue"
3. On the following page, click on the large purple button labelled "Play Now!"

Actual Results:  
A window popus up, with the java based yahoo chess system missing. But the same java applet loads file in Epiphany.

Expected Results:  
Yahoo chess's Java applet should load fine.

This happens in windows environment too. This used to work earlier (firefox pre 1.5, java 1.4.2_09 and below).

Let me know if you would like me to upload screen shots of firefox and epiphany...

Thanks
