With the new dev build of TMP installed and the option "Display > Tab Bar > When tabs don't fit width..." set to Multi-Row, opening a hyperlink in a web page in a new unfocused tab, the page shifts down slightly for a moment, then the page returns to normal.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In new profile, install Tab Mix Plus 0.3.6.0.080218 Dev Build.
2. In TMP Options, set "Display > Tab Bar > When tabs don't fit width..." to Multi-Row.
3. With at least two tabs open or having the tab bar always displayed, click on a link to open it in an unfocused tab (middle-click or Ctrl+right click).
Actual Results:  
The page in the focused tab shifts down and then back up to its original position as if TMP is trying to expand the tab row to show a second row though a second row is not needed.

Expected Results:  
There should be no page shift.

Tab Mix Plus was just updated to 0.3.6.0.080218 to be, I believe, functionally compatible with Minefield/FF3 beta. The previous "hacked" version, Tab Mix Plus 0.3.6.0.071228-nightly-fix as I have labeled it does not have this issue. It is available in this post:
