No visual indication of auto-discovered search plugin
Go to a website with an auto-discovered search plugin (e.g., http://www.quora.com/).

On older versions of Firefox, the drop down arrow in the search box would turn blue to indicate that a new search plugin was available.

Now, the arrow doesn't change color.  The only way to tell that a search plugin is available for installation is to click on the arrow to make the menu appear.

Tested on both Windows 7 SP1 and Mac OS X 10.7.1 with Aurora 2011-08-16
