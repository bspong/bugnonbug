When right-clicking on an image in FF 1.5.0.3, the Size Of File is not reported correctly.  The example image (http://www.geekitup.com.au/OCAU/signature3.png) is reported as 57KB, when in fact it is only 38KB.  This can be confirmed by
a) the size of the file on my hard drive
b) the size of the file reported by Internet Explorer 6 & 7
c) the size of the file reported by the program it was created in (Corel Paint Shop Pro X)
