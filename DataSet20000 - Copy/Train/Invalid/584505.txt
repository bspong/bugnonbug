I have a chrome file that I made to hide the orange firefox menu. The way I have it setup, everything is on the same toolbar, so it eventually covers up the window controls

Here is normal http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2644556/Normal.jpg

and here is when it covers http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2644556/Cover.jpg

Sorry if there is nothing you can do about it. Realize i'm a very specific case, just been trying some chrome stuff but I can't get it to work. Anyways, thanks for the great work on firefox, and any pointers would be greatly appreciated.
