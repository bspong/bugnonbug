Firefox 2.0.0.15 keeps downloading itself. When I click later it downloads the next time i start up. Once it is downloaded, I have no access to internet at all. Error message re "cannot find" comes up. To get internet back, I have to go to system restore and go to the previous restore point. That corrects every thing until Firefox 2.0.0.15 comes back for downloading. This has happened 5 times.n
