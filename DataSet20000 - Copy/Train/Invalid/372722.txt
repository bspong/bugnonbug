result nodes' uri property needs clarification
nsNavHistoryResultNode has a |uri| property, which is sometimes a place URI, and sometimes a history URI, depending on the type of the result node. With the advent of place URIs for bookmarks and separators, this has become quite problematic. Some discussion of a possible solution is below.

[09:27am] ManoLaptop: dietrich: the uri attribute is very confusing.
[09:28am] ManoLaptop: for bookmark nodes, which do have place uris, it's the bookmarked uri
[09:28am] ManoLaptop: for folders, it's the place uri
[09:28am] ManoLaptop: for separators, it's ""
[09:28am] dietrich: ManoLaptop: yeah, not clear at all
[09:28am] ManoLaptop: the last do have place uris, right?
[09:29am] ManoLaptop: dietrich: for history items, there's no place uri, right?
[09:29am] ManoLaptop: as in real uris are annotated
[09:29am] dietrich: ManoLaptop: any record in the moz_bookmarks table can use getItemURI to get a place URI
[09:30am] dietrich: ManoLaptop: right, no place URI for history items
[09:30am] ManoLaptop: dietrich: well, i'm refering to the node* interfaces
[09:30am] dietrich: so, i'd thought to resolve this by adding a placeURI property to result nodes
[09:30am] ManoLaptop: which expose uris too
[09:30am] dietrich: right, i know
[09:31am] ManoLaptop: dietrich: and move uri to some other interface?
[09:31am] ManoLaptop: "uri" seems to be what you would annonate with
[09:32am] ManoLaptop: except that it doesn't work right for bookmarks now
[09:32am] ManoLaptop: which are no longer annonated with the bookmarked uri...
[09:32am] dietrich: ManoLaptop: what doesn't work right?
[09:33am] ManoLaptop: dietrich: other than bookmark items, "uri" is always the uri you should for annos
[09:33am] dietrich: re: what should be used for annotations... it differs on context
[09:34am] dietrich: ManoLaptop: right, i see what you mean
[09:34am] dietrich: maybe keep uri, and for bookmark nodes add a bookmarkedURI property
[09:34am] ManoLaptop: dietrich: so I would think we should 1) rename uri to placeURI 2) actually add a new interface for bookmarks 3) add uri attribute to visit/url/bookmark interfaces
[09:35am] ManoLaptop: placeURI would be the "real" uri for history items
[09:35am] ManoLaptop: 3) make placeURI work for separators
[09:35am] ManoLaptop: er, 4 
[09:36am] ManoLaptop: dietrich: another issue is whether the frontend code should ceck for annotations for the bookmarked uri.
[09:37am] ManoLaptop: and not just for the place uri
[09:37am] ManoLaptop: right now, it only does the former
[09:37am] ManoLaptop: which is simply wrong
[09:37am] dietrich: ManoLaptop: why is that wrong
[09:37am] dietrich: annotations of bookmarked URIs are not specific to bookmarks
[09:38am] dietrich: extensions, etc, anything can annotate a content uri
[09:38am] stevee left the chat room. (Connection reset by peer)
[09:38am] ManoLaptop: dietrich: wrong alone, that is. we're only checking for annotations for the bookmarked uri
[09:38am] ManoLaptop: and not for the placeURI
[09:38am] stevee joined the chat room.
[09:38am] dietrich: ? can you be more specific? the transaction code checks for the place URI
[09:38am] ManoLaptop: dietrich: in context menu code
[09:38am] ManoLaptop: at the very least
[09:39am] ManoLaptop: see buildSelectionMetaData
[09:39am] dietrich: ok, i see the problem
[09:41am] ManoLaptop: as in, should bookmarks "inherit" annos from their history items?
[09:42am] • ManoLaptop ponders use-cases
[09:43am] dietrich: hm, in buildSelectionMetaData, we're only getting anno names for folders
[09:43am] ManoLaptop: dietrich: recent regression
[09:44am] ManoLaptop: i removed the uri = set from the URI/Vist case
[09:44am] ManoLaptop: i'm adding that back, but not for bookmarks
[09:44am] ManoLaptop: for which we should fist get their own annotations
[09:44am] ManoLaptop: first*
[09:46am] dietrich: so yeah, in the buildSelectionMetaData case, it seems like we should get both bookmark and bookmarked-uri anno names
[09:47am] dietrich: sometimes bookmarks should inherit their bookmarked-uri's annos
[09:47am] dietrich: and likely sometimes not 
[09:47am] ManoLaptop: will do so
[09:47am] ManoLaptop: and back out later when we start using annos for real
