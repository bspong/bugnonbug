I installed Firefox 3 RC2 and then ran the utility CCleaner afterwards, the info in the drop down for the address bar is removed as it should be by ccleaner but then the drop down items are replaced by entries from the bookmarks.  I do not find any way of clearing the history from this drop down.  Have only seen this issue with Firefox 3 all versions (Beta, RC1 and RC2 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 3 RC 2 and surf to some sites to make entries in the history
2. Run the Freeware utility "CCleaner":
3. Check the dropdown and info from bookmarks will be there
Actual Results:  
Same as box above

Expected Results:  
The bookmarks are still shown in the box even after shutting down Firefox and rebooting the computer.

Behaved normally with the browsing typed in entries in the box.
