This one is hard to explain, so I will do my best. Please bear with me.

Today, when viewing the sidebar, we have a choice -- bookmarks, or history. This functionality is fine, but could be extended in a more user-friendly manner (so I think... others may disagree).

Rather than having the "either-or" option, why not have the ability to have both, whereas I can have bookmarks loaded, and history directly below it (or the other way around if I feel like dragging).

This option would ideally include the following:
  a) Display both Bookmarks and History in the sidebar, both showing at the
     same time but in a manner where one can resize and/or move an element
     via click/drag
  b) The option to 'close' a particular element of a sidebar (i.e. close only
     the History bar, but keep bookmarks still opened)
  c) The option to close all immediately (rather than one-by-one, so that on 
     the next decision to open the sidebar, both are displayed in the same 
     manner of before)
  d) Integration with other tools into the sidebar (JavaScript console, for 
     example)

Reproducible: Always




Again, this is a feature request that would be helpful for me, and maybe others.
