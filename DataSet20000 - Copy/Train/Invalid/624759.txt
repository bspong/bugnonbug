User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Installed 4.0 beta 8 on Windows Xp

Now back on Firefox 3.6 13.
Installed 4.0 b8, but after numerous attempts (including rebooting) to load FF,
deleted 4.0 and re-used 3.6 (It was still present in 'Program Files' but in a different folder. 
I noted there were more files with TODAY'S date in the 3.6 folder, than there were in the 4.0 folder !!! And they're still there.
4.0 hung with the Google.co.uk page visible, but with the GREEN loading-circle 
continually rotating in the top left tab. It was using a fair bit of CPU processing time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make goog;e.co.uk my home page
2. Re-install 4.0
3. Run firefox 4.0
4. Google page loads
5. Wait for ever
Actual Results:  
Tried step 3 again and again.
Sometimes killing 4.0, then running 3.6.
3.6 worked OK.
Killed 3.6, retried 4.0

Expected Results:  
Should have loaded an active google page
