If I quit firefox after making some changes in about:config, then start it again, my changes are gone.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Toggle something in about:config (middlemouse.contentLoadURL)
2. See that its changed OK in prefs.js
3. Quit firefox
4. Start firefox
5. The changes are now gone from prefs.js and about:config too.

Actual Results:  
The changes are now gone from prefs.js and about:config too.

Expected Results:  
The changes should persist.

It's a regression, IIRC it worked all right in 4.0.0
