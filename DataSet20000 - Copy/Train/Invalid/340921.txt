I am receiving emails at  "trainer2@shaw.ca" which goes through mozilla firefox. 
On the last 4 days, I log in to email in the morning to check emails...read them and leave them in file. 
When I come back later in the day my Inbox is empty...the emails that were there have just disappeared.  Not in trash/drafts.  This has happened to every email since June 3.2006.  The representative for www.shaw.ca says he feels the problems is with Firefox and not Shaw Cable.
