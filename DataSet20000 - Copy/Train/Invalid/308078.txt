Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to above web site
2. hit tab key once, focus goes to "MGC/Username" entry field
3. hit tab key again, focus goes to "Password" entry field
4. hit tab key again, focus goes to "logon" button
5. hit tab key again, focus goes to "Public Computer" radiobutton
6. hit tab one last time, focus does not go to "Private Computer" radiobutton

Actual Results:  
The focus did not go to the "Private Computer" radiobutton.

Expected Results:  
The focus should go to the "Private Computer" radiobutton, 
at which point, the "space" key can be used to select that option.

This works correctly on Mozilla/Netscape, but not on Firefox.

It appears that the focus never goes to the unselected item(s) in 
a radiobutton object (when using the tab key).  The focus tabs to
the currently selected button only.  If you use the mouse to select
the "Private Computer" radiobutton, then tab through the items again,
this time it will not put focus on the "Public Computer" button.

Again, this problem does not occur when using Mozilla or Netscape browser.
