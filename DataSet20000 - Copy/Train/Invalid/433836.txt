Japanese Firefox: iGoogle/Google Reader selector page shuld be in Japanese
Bug 396536 was solved and now we can select iGoogle/Google Reader when we select google as a feed reader.

1. Go to a feed page. 
   # ex. http://blogs.mozilla-japan.org/inside/feed/)
2. Select Google as a feed reader and press "subscribe" button.
3. You'll see iGoogle/Google Reader selector page
   # ex. http://www.google.co.jp/ig/add?feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.mozilla-japan.org%2Finside%2Ffeed%2F

Both iGoogle/Google Reader service are provided in Japanese but the selector page is only in English.
Google should provide Japanese iGoogle/Google Reader selector page.

Please ping to Google PSO and request him to translate in Japanese.
# If they need translator, we can translate the page.
