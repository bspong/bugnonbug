If/when I do a rmb on the toolbar icons and click customize and then drag icons (e.g. new tab) to the icons on the toolbar (e.g. next to the home icon). These icons are lost after a firefox restart.

I created a new profile and tried this and the icons remained until I copied my cookies file from my old profile.
