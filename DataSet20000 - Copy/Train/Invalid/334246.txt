I have a dual monitor setup and visiting http://gjuha-shqipe.com/ changes the browser window from maximized on one screen to cover the width of both screens. I don't know if this relates to my dual monitor setup, but allowing any site to mess with the size of the browser window like this doesn't seem right.

If it's accepted behavior then I guess it can be closed as INVALID.

Reproducible: Always
