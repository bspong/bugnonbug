Web pages will not load and Feedback button does not work

Sorry for not using the Beta feedback button but it doesn't work. Also, I was unable to load any web page by tying in the URL. The only way I was able to get to web pages was to either go through a bookmark or through google. Ended up uninstalling the beta.

While I'm at it, are you ever going to fix the problems with Youtube? Embedded videos will not play in Firefox and if you go to the Youtube site, videos freeze up every 10 seconds or so.

Reproducible: Always
