Firefox hangs (forever) when trying to save the currently displayed page to local hard disk

While trying to save a page from the web (File --> Save Page As) the Firefox
hangs (i.e. displays a gray in its whole) and never recovers (several times I
waited up to 20 minutes). It does not save the requested file. It does not
recover from that state by itself. I am seing this for every page that I ever
tried to save from Firefox. Exactly the same behaviour is dislayed on all three
machines that I am using - two Win2000Pro boxes and one WinXP Pro box. Versions
impacted: Firefox 1.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.4, 1.0.5 (I did not try v1.0.3). 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any web page (e.g. an interesting Slashdot story)
2. Try to save it (CTRL+S, or File --> Save As)
3. Wait a loooong time and bite your nails becaus you can not browse anything
while the browser hangs
4. Loose patience, kill Firefox, say to you self "this is a *rap", and open
Mozilla suite (which saves files fine, although somehow slow)
5. Several months or weeks later try the same with a new version of Firefox

Actual Results:  
Browser is unresponsive. 
File is not saved.
Browser does not recove itself - ever.

Expected Results:  
File is saved on the local disk, browser allows you to browse further.
