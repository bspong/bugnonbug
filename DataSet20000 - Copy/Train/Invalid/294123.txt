Toolbar items all go grey and do not function (including menus, which when
moused over produce the bump effect, but do not accept clicks) after using
customize.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox
2. Right click in toolbar area
3. Click customize
4. Click done

Actual Results:  
Menu items remained greyed out, "Customize" greyed out from right click menu.

Expected Results:  
Reset state to "not being customized right now", allowing use of items.

My back/forward/refresh buttons are all grey right now and my bookmarks have
disappeared (they reappear when i open the bookmarks manager, but only in the
menu, not the bookmarks toolbar).  I was on 12 and using it fine when this
happened, so I upgraded.  Not sure if this may have an affect on this bug.
