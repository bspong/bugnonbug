Opening link in new window, then clicking picture in the new window results in picture being displayed but Back Button remains disabled.

Opening a link by right clicking on it and selecting "Open in New Window" causes the back button to malfunction somehow.  When you click something in the new window that doesn't open a new tab or window, the Back Button will remain disabled.  This means you cannot return to the article you were viewing, which is extremely annoying.

This bug ONLY occurs when you open the link in a new window.  If you open it in a new tab, there's no problem.  If you copy and paste the URL in a new window, there's no problem either.

I'm happy to supply more information to get this problem fixed.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the supplied webpage, http://linux.slashdot.org/linux/07/01/05/0612213.shtml (just an example, it happens with many pages)

2. Right-click on the link in the summary ("throws light on some of the features"), and select "Open in New Window".  A new window appears on my system with just a single tab visible, as expected.

3. In this new window, click on one of the pictures in the article to see the picture full-size.  Notice that no new tab is created, nor is a new window created.  Notice also that the Back Button is disabled still ... there is no way to return to the article that had the picture embedded in it.
Actual Results:  
The back button is disabled.

Expected Results:  
The back button should be enabled, so I can return to the article.
