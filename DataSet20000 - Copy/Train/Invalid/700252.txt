Close buttons is not responding
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:7.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0.1
Build ID: 20110928134238

Steps to reproduce:

Pressed the Close-button [X] in the upper right corner of FF 7.0.1 on Windows. Reproducable with that version on either Windows 7 or Windows XP Pro SP3.


Actual results:

Button responds, but Firefox is not closing. Looks like the action ('Pressing button [X]) is recongnised, but not executed. I have to close the application by choosing "Close Firefox" from the Windows Taskbar or "Exit" from the main menu.
Mind: Apart from not closing, Firefox does NOT hang and is otherwise responding normally.
This behaviour could first be seen on 2011-11-07.


Expected results:

Firefox should have closed the Window.
