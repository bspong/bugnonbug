Installation of required J2SE Runtime Environment 5.0 totally erased my existing Mozilla Firefox installation, including all bookmarks.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows 98; H010818; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: I already erased the Mozilla program in its entirety from my PC.

This "bug" erased the accumulated functionality of about six months' work. I 
use this PC in my work every day, and have been using Firefox exclusively 
(where possible) since I first installed it. I am amazed and thoroughly 
disgusted that a REQUIRED "plug-in" could have this result! When I went to 
restore a prior installation from an external HD, I discovered that THAT had 
been "updated" as well!!! Apparently, the "required plug-in" downloaded from 
the Internet discovered the Firefox data on the back-up HD and "improved" it as 
well!!  I will not be using your product again, no matter what. Screw me once, 
shame on you. Screw me twice, shame on me.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run Firefox.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Welcome to "Getting Started" and a total absence of my bookmarks.

Expected Results:  
Duh!!!
