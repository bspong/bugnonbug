I downloaded Firefox 1.0.6, and now can't access internet. Revieve 
message:  'www.mozilla.org could not be found'.  This message is displayed for 
any address - 'www.anysitename.com could not be found.  I am using Explorer to 
access your site as I write this query.  Therefore discounting a bad Comast 
connection or Norton security blocker.  My firefox site is stand alone - I do 
not use netscape, outlook, etc.  Earlier in the day I was using the previous 
version of Firefox successfully.  Then I downloaded 1.0.6 and immediately 
recieved the error message.  Thanks for your assistance.

Reproducible: Always
