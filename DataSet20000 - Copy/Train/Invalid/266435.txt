Javascript-finisher "</script>"  is interpreted too early in a PHP file

This script should make thumbnails and open them bigger, when you click on it. I
used an old Javascript to make open a new window with the picture in it. Using
it normally without this PHP-page the script works flawlessly. On the php-page
the command </script> is interpreted too early (the first </script> command is
for the  javascript that is executed in the opened file>. Upon opening the
source-code of the displayed page it's easy to see the bug. Strangely it works
fine with either IE or Safari. Due to that early script-termination the whole
javascript fails (which normally works fine).
I tried to make a workaround but I am not so skilled with all the programming ;)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just load the page.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
The page is displayed wrong. There is some Text that should be hidden by the
Javascript-"brackets" (<script> [...] </script>)). The following text is too much!
'); writeln(''); writeln(''); writeln('
loading...
'); writeln('
'+text+'

'); writeln('Click to close'); writeln('
'); writeln(''); close(); } } -->


Expected Results:  
The whole script should be executed, and so the page should be displayed
correctly. There should be no text except for the gallery and it's title...
