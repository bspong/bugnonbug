Open a live bookmark folder in the Bookmarks Toolbar or from the Bookmarks menu.
It should have a large number of bookmarks (c. 50 - an eg. Mozilla Blogs) 
Scroll down the list to some part and click a bookmark.  Link opens.  the list
is dismissed.  

Now, come back to the same list again. The list stays at the same position as it
was left before.  by design or a bug?
