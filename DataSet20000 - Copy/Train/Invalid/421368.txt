Show location bar in a temporary toolbar when navigation bar is hidden (e.g. when opening a new tab)

A window for location bar is pretty annoying. I thought it could work as a toolbar that opens up from below the content area, just like Find/Quick Find toolbars.

The toolbar would have the same options the real navigation bar location bar has: the location bar. Don't know how used are the options present in the Open Web Location window. Personally, I just open a new tab first, and then go to any page I want. Much faster than selecting the target in the window.

Reproducible: Always
