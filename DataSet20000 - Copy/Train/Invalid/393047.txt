I'm currently using the UbuntuStudio theme with Ubuntu Linux and whenever i mouseover a bookmark in my bookmark menu, it gets hard to read the text and a strange colouration. This issue happens with both the latest tinderbox and the 20070821 trunk. This issue does not occur in Firefox 2.0.0.6.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use the UbuntuStudio GTK/Metacity theme.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
The bookmarks were strangely coloured as i said in the details.

Expected Results:  
The bookmarks should've kept to the colour scheme of the theme that i'm using which is what happens in Firefox 2.0.0.6.

Using the UbuntuStudio theme
