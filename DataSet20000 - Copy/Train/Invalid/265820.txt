The objects on the screen do not display to their correct positions.  The page
is using DOM for to place objects at specific coordinates.  The objects are
overlapping badly in Firefox, but appear normal with IE.  The game also fails to
work under firefox, but this is probably a JS code page error related to bad
screen co-ordinates as a result of this error.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit Site
2. Use up, down, left or right arrow keys

Actual Results:  
Bad object position.  The red 'O' did not move.

Expected Results:  
Objects should have been placed at appropriate object co-ordinates.    The Red
'O' should have moved with the keys.
