Occassionally when I open a new non-emtpy tab or window what appears on the
screen becomes corrupted. Refreshing the page may help temporarily, but unless I
close and restart the browser the problem gets worse. Text is not displayed
correctly, typically it looks bolder and bigger than it should. Images may not
be displayed correctly. The arrow up button at the top of the scrollbar is
replaced with '5'. If I continue to use the browser in this state, when I scroll
the entire contents of the browser screen can become completely corrupted with
text overlayed on other text.

I typically browse with two windows open and about five tabs in each window. The
problem occurs once every 3 or 4 days.
