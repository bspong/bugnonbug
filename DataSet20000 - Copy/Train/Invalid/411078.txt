When I click view button against approved workflow, I got the following error:
Object reference not found Err(202) etc...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open FireFox Browser
2.Enter firefox.com and hit enter
3.Navigate to workflow approvals page
4.Clik View link against the approved record
Actual Results:  
Object reference not found Err(202) etc...

Expected Results:  
User should able to view the approved workflow record

Object reference not found Err(202) etc...is a system defined error instead it should display user defined error message thru the program
