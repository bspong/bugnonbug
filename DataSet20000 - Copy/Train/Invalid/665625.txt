Printing more than Yahoo Email, prints whole list of Folders on left side of Yahoo Screen.

In the past if I brought up an email in my Yahoo Mail and hit print on Firefox toolbar, Firefox printed the email only. Now it's cutting off the right side of my email and including my list of folder titles from the column/box on the left side of the screen... which results in a messed up email print (chopped off on right) and then four more pages of my folder titles down the left hand side of each print off with nothing on the rest of the pages. The only way to get it to print properly is to hit "Print" right above the email on the Yahoo screen. I used to be able to print with Firefox too.

Reproducible: Always
