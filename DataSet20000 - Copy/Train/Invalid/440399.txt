Google toolbar bookmarks does not work -- asks for sign in repeatedly and does nothing

After I installed FF 3, the google toolbar bookmark does not work. In FF 2, I could click on the bookmark button in the google toolbar and it would drop down the bookmarks I had saved. Now it says "Please sign in to access the bookmarks" and when I do sign in with my gmail account, the dialog box disappears, and then when I click the bookmarks button on the google toolbar, it says, "Please sign in ..." and the story repeats just like the instructions on the shampoo bottle.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on the bookmarks button on the google toolbar
2. It will ask you to sign in; sign in.
3. Click on the google toolbar button; it will ask you to sign in.
