XML xlink regression
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.3a1pre) Gecko/20091221 Minefield/3.7a1pre
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.3a1pre) Gecko/20091221 Minefield/3.7a1pre

The simple xlink on XML file works on FF3.5.X but it does not work anymore on Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.3a1pre) Gecko/20091221 Minefield/3.7a1pre. The link is detected but not click-able.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Open this document.
(the css is just here to avoid a message from FF, but it does not impact the issue)

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<?xml-stylesheet href="bug_xlink.css" type="text/css"?>
<doc xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
<ref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="#ICI" xlink:title="link" >HERE</ref>
</doc>
Actual Results:  
If the pointer is on the word HERE, it is a link, but not click is available.

Expected Results:  
a real link in XML !

Do not say XML link are not used. I use many XML files and I need to browse them using FF and a simple CSS. These files have link-references but I don't want to use the <a href...> HTML tags because they mean nothing for these applications.
