I have recently ran across two images which FireFox refuses to display. No error
message is generated. The file loads but no rendering is performed. An example
image that causes this can be found at http://www.adireaudio.com/images/Parthe4.jpg


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load http://www.adireaudio.com/images/Parthe4.jpg

Actual Results:  
The image is not rendered.

Expected Results:  
Render the image.
