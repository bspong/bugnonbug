High-lighting a bookmark and pressing CTRL+T gets confusing result
Hello,

This one was a bit confusing, but I think I know how it acts..

In the Bookmark menu dropdown:

1. IF there is more than three bookmarks in the current folder, AND there is one
or more sub-folders. When highlighting (put the mouse over an entry) and
pressing CTRL+T makes the THIRD bookmark in the current folder to open in the
current active tab.

2. If I open a bookmark sub-folder with more than three entries and no
sub-folders, highlighting an entry there and pressing CTRL+T will result in
nothing to happen.

3. If I open a bookmark sub-folder with more than three entries and one or more
sub-folders, then same as in case 1 will happen.

More detailed explaination:

In the Bookmark menu dropdown:
<folder> sub-test
    - <bookmark> test-bookmark1
    - <bookmark> test-bookmark2
    - <bookmark> test-bookmark3
    - <bookmark> test-bookmark4
<folder> sub-test2
    - <folder> test2-sub-test3
    - <bookmark> test2-bookmark1
    - <bookmark> test2-bookmark2
    - <bookmark> test2-bookmark3
    - <bookmark> test2-bookmark4
<bookmark> bookmark1
<bookmark> bookmark2
<bookmark> bookmark3
<bookmark> bookmark4

Highlighting `bookmark1' and pressing CTRL+T, will cause `bookmark3' to open in
the current active tab.

Highlighting `test2-bookmark2' and pressing CTRL+T, will cause `test2-bookmark3'
to open in the current active tab.

Highlighting `test-bookmark4' and pressing CTRL+T, then nothing will happen.

Regards,
Eric
