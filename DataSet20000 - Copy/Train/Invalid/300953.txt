Conditional loading of CSS, loads fine on two pages but doesn't load at all on another.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

I uploaded the exact same pages to three different sites, listed at the bottom
of this report.

On the first site (geocorecms.com) the browser did not load the CSS stylesheet.
On the other two however, it loaded the stylesheet just fine. The stylesheet is
easily accessible via URL, and when I visit the page in Internet Explorer or
Opera the site loads just fine, CSS and all. This is not a server error, from
what I know. But I don't know how to explain the fact that the system loads fine
on two sites but not at all on another. All three sites (from what I know) run
the Apache webserver.

Here are the URLs (and the respective server type):

http://www.geocorecms.com/cms/index.html (Apache, on Linux) <-- does not show css

http://home.comcast.net/~c.steffen/index.html (Unsure what server/OS)

http://webpages.acs.ttu.edu/chsteffe/cms/index.html (Apache, unsure of OS)

The odd thing is that I have another website hosted on the same server as the
geocorecms.com server, http://www.geodesicsolutions.com. This site also uses
CSS, and it loads just fine.

I would love your fix as soon as you are able to fix it! Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.geocorecms.com/css/index.html to see the defective page.

(If you want to see the proper page, visit one of the other two URLs,
http://home.comcast.net/~c.steffen/index.html or
http://webpages.acs.ttu.edu/chsteffe/cms/index.html)
Actual Results:  
The geocorecms.com site loaded just the HTML, without any CSS formatting, while
the other sites loaded both just fine.

Expected Results:  
It should have loaded the CSS stylesheet along with the HTML as expected, as it
did with the other two websites (and as Internet Explorer and Opera did).

No special theme, just default.

This occurred on multiple computers with multiple setups.

All occurrances were on Windows XP Home systems, running the latest version of
Firefox. No Macintosh or *NIX systems were tested.
