Entered the following code:
var dork = 0;
if(dork < 1) {
  alert("You're a dork");
}
Reports an xml parsing error here:
         if(dork < 1) {
------------------^

If I change the "<" to a ">", the parse error disappears

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enter the code in Details
2.?!?!
3.Profit!
(no seriously, it's an xhtml 1.1 document using the xml namespace (and the svg namespace, although the error occurs independently of it), and the error occurs in a <script language="JavaScript"> tag in the head tag of the document.  I'd been cranking along with a lot of JS code just fine before this error.
Actual Results:  
xml parse error

Expected Results:  
successful parse

Don't think it's relevant, but I'd be happy to supply the buildconfig if you need it.
