Selecting "Never for this site" regarding remembering login information does not prevent username from autofilling

When you go to any site and login for the first time, Firefox offers to remember your password. Even if you say "Never for this site", Firefox subsequently displays the username you entered as a suggestion upon subsequent logins. This is a security problem. Selecting "Never for this site" should mean that none of the form fields related to login information are recorded by Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Logon to a website for the first time.
2. Select "Never for this site" regarding remembering logon credentials.
3. Logout and go back to the login page.
4. The username (and any other login credential information fields) display usernames and any other authentication information that was entered in step 1.
Actual Results:  
Firefox is remembering things like my bank account number on my bank website.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should not remember any part of the login credentials
