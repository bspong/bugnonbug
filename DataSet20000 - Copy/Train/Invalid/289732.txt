symptons I can click on a page to either open a different web page or navigate
within the page I am on.and all Mozilla Firefox windows disappear......... I
have re-launched and followed the pages again and the same situation
occurs.........this is totally random times when it occurs........no common web
pages or anything like that..if I have saved any bookmarks before it goes out
they are always still listed when I re-launch........this seems to be happening
more often than a month ago...I have tried starting in safe mode but  it still
occurs ......any assistance would be appreciated................I tried to
search your known bugs site but did not quite see any with same problem or I did
not understand ............
