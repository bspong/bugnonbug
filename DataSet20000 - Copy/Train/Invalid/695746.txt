Font rendered slightly too large causing page not to fit into assigned space
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en; rv:1.9.0.19) Gecko/2011091218 Camino/2.0.9 (like Firefox/3.0.19)
Build ID: 2011091218

Steps to reproduce:

Opened this web page in Safari, Chrome and IE - they all render it properly with the two links at the bottom showing.
http://www.pranicenergyhealing.ca/meditation_fr.php


Actual results:

When I open that same web page in Firefox, the font of the text on that page is rendered slightly too large so that the text runs down further on the page and the two links at the bottom of the page are not visible


Expected results:

The font should render at the same size with Firefox than for the other browsers.

This issue has been discussed on forums with not very satidfactory work-arounds being proposed but I couldn't find this issue when I searched the Mozilla bug database.
Problem also happens on Camino which is Mozilla based.
