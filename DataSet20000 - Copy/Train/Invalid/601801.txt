For some reason my installation of Firefox 4, which is supposed to be light blue, has recently turned grey. Unless it was changed in a recent update, I don't know what could be causing this. I checked Error Console and it showed no errors. I tried a new profile, reinstalling, and Safe Mode; also changed nothing.

Here's a screenshot:
