Firefox build can include non-SDK headers and link non-SDK libraries on OS X
On OS X, Firefox can be built without specifying an SDK (without
setting MACOS_SDK_DIR).  When you do this, gdb will start searching
for header files in local system headers (e.g. those in /usr/include
and /System/Library/Frameworks), and will by preference link to local
system libraries (those in /usr/lib and /System/Library/Frameworks).

This probably isn't desirable.  The Firefox build process (on OS X)
should probably always specify an SDK, which in turn will cause
-nostdinc, -nostdinc++, -isystem and/or NEXT_ROOT to be used as
needed.

Camino's build process does always specify an SDK (in
camino/config/mozconfig).  Probably the easiest way to change
Firefox's behavior is to also specify one in browser/config/mozconfig.
