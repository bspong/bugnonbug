Firefox 4 RC Won't start
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.2.14) Gecko/20110218 Firefox/3.6.14
Build Identifier: http://www.mozilla.com/products/download.html?product=firefox-4.0rc1&os=osx&lang=en-US

I downloaded Firefox 4 RC and attempted to install it on my computer, a Macintosh iBook G4, OS 10.5.8, 1.07 GHz PowerPC G4, 1.25 GB RAM, 250 GB Hard Drive.  I realize it's a fairly old machine, but the system requirements state Mac OS 10.5 and above, All systems & Languages.

Firefox 4 WILL NOT RUN ON MY COMPUTER!  When the installer opens to the window with the Firefox logo and the Applications Folder, instructing you to drag Firefox to the Applications folder, the Firefox logo appears with a NO symbol in the middle of it (a circle with a slash).  Once moved to the applications folder, the NO symbol remains on the Firefox logo.  When I attempted to open Firefox 4, I received the following message:
You can't open the application "Firefox 4" because it is not supported on this architecture.

I was led to believe it would work on my computer, as I am running OS 10.5 and above, as stated on the page I downloaded from.
