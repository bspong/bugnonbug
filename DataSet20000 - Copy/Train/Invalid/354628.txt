Self-signed root certificate: http://webpki.org/mozbug/root.cer
Imported directly from browser

Then I wanted to import the following sub CA the same way
http://webpki.org/mozbug/cacert.cer

Nothing happended

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See details

Actual Results:  
Only the root is installed

Expected Results:  
The path would be visible in the certificate viewer

Works fine in MSIE

Both certifaces have serial number 1 but since they belong to different parts of the path this is OK.
