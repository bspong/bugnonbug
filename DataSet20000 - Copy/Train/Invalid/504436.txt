Redirection of domains somehow "remembered" by Firefox, prevents access to website
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090624 Firefox/3.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I accidentally connected to my school's residential wireless network, which uses a webpage login method. So typing in any URL redirects me to this page, on the "netreg.service.emory.edu" server (which isn't available externally, so don't try). I had tried to access "dailykos.com", and was brought to this page. Then when I corrected my wireless connection to my own, whenever I try to access this website now, it attempts to access "netreg.service.emory.edu", no matter how I try to access it, preventing me from getting to the page.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Attempt to access a network using a webpage that intercepts all requests and redirects you there until you login
2. Reconnect to an unrestricted network
3. Attempt to access the page
Actual Results:  
Firefox attempts to access "netreg.service.emory.edu" instead of "dailykos.com"

Expected Results:  
Firefox should access "dailykos.com"

I exited Firefox and tried again in safe mode, no effect. I can access the site normally from Internet Explorer.
