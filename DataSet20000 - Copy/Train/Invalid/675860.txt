New tab dragging behavior does not play nice with spaces (warps to random places on the desktop)
BUILD: Current trunk nightly

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
1)  Get a Mac
2)  Set up multiple spaces.  You need at least 2; call them "Space 1" and
    "Space 2".
3)  Start Firefox.
4)  Make sure you have two Firefox windows open which are NOT maximized.  One
    should be on Space 2 and contain a single tab.  The other should be on
    Space 1 and contain two tabs.
5)  Switch to Space 1.
6)  Mouse down on one of the tabs in the single Firefox window you see.  Do not
    mouse up.
7)  Slowly drag your mouse out of the window without hitting the edge of the
    screen.

EXPECTED RESULTS: When the mouse leaves the Firefox window you can drop the tab at the mouse location and get a new window on Space 1.

ACTUAL RESULTS: When the mouse leaves the Firefox window you are suddenly switched to Space 2.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: I am guessing that we're trying to find some other Firefox window than the one we just left and raise it?  Or something like that?  In this case that's really not doing the right thing....

This is seriously interfering with my ability to do tab drag and drop; in particular dragging a tab out of a window, or to a different window is completely broken for me because halfway through the drag I suddenly get warped to some other space, where my drag target is not.  Requesting tracking for Fx8 for this reason.
