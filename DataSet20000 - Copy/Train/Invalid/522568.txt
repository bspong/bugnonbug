I create a keyboard shortcut in the MacOS 10.4.11 Keyboard system preferences for Page Setup... (shift-command-P).  This is by default the Firefox shortcut for "Start Private Browsing".
When loaded, Firefox shows the new shortcut next to "Page Setup..." but still tries to Start Private Browsing when pressed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add "shift-command-P" to "All Applications" in System Preferences for the keyboard shortcut to "Page Setup..."
2. Load Firefox and look at File menu to see if the new shortcut is shown for Page Setup...
3. Try shift-command-P and verify that it tries to start private browsing instead of Page Setup
Actual Results:  
"Start Private Browsing" starts instead

Expected Results:  
"Page Setup..." should have been selected
