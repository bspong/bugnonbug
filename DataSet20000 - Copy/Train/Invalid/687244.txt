GUI Options menu not functioning properly with respect to privacy, history, and website logins
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:7.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0
Build ID: 20110908135051

Steps to reproduce:

Browse to a site, login with 'Keep me Logged In' checkbox engaged. 

Preferences gui set to 'remember history' (with 'remember download history' unchecked, but pulldown still stays on 'remember history', though custom setting is respected).


Actual results:

The next time I reboot my computer and come back to the site, it requests that I log in again. Also happens after a certain amount of time even with the computer if FF is not running.


Expected results:

I should stay logged in for an extended period of time, dependent on the websites' login duration.
