I have a HUGE bookmarks menu. Most of the bookmarks have favicons (those custom icons to the left of the web address). When I open the bookmarks menu after I launch Firefox or after it has been sitting idle for a while, the bookmarks menu freezes as Firefox gets all the favicons, which can take anywhere from 10 seconds to 1 minute at the outside. This happens even if you're just running your mouse along the menu bar with the mouse button down, going from, say, the Window menu to  the History menu by way of the Bookmarks menu.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a huge bookmarks menu, none of it in folders. By huge I mean at least 200 or 300 files.
2. Launch Firefox.
3. Open the Bookmarks menu. And wait.
Actual Results:  
The bookmarks menu opened, Firefox froze for about 20 or 30 seconds fetching all of the favicons, the icons appeared next to the bookmark names, Firefox unfroze.

Expected Results:  
The bookmarks menu opened immediately, with all of the icons in place, Firefox having saved the icon along with the bookmark and (if necessary) updating it when I next visited the website the bookmark was referring to.
