Places UI: Remove the History Sidebar
Note: this is a meta tracking bug for UI mockups and discussion of the overall user experience.

Once bug 524059 is complete (Make history range pages fully interactive), we should be able to completely remove the history sidebar from the Firefox UI.  We will want to re-map the keyboard shortcut (control-H and shift-apple-H) to opening the new interactive content area history view in a new tab.
