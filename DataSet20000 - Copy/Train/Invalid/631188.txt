Most of the audio demos for Firefox 4 seem to be broken due to the fact that Float32Array no longer seems to have a method slice(). Most audio experiments use this method to process the tail generated by the Audio Data API, and thus as soon as there's a tail, the experiment breaks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the site
2. Press a keyboard key
3. Wait
Actual Results:  
The sound starts popping, and soon breaks completely, and the console becomes full of myFloat32Array.slice is undefined (not a function)

Expected Results:  
The sound should come out consistently.
