Inability to access Easylink websites
Hi, Rob Clark here.
I am network manager for a small school that runs an RM CC3 network. Part of the
network has an Easylink secure website that allows students and staff to log in
to their own work area. This is coded in asp. and uses webfolders. Because of
this they still have to use the dreaded IE to gain access to their files from
home. When accessing the site through FireFox after accepting the security
certificate the screan goes blank instead of getting a login screen.
It would be great if they could use FireFox.
