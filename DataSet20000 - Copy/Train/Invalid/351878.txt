The New Default-Theme does not integrate into a linux-Desktop. The Forward-Back-Buttons look ugly, with the Gnome-Buttons around them and the new button-like grafiks around the arrows and the drop-down Buttons. The button formerly known as "Go" looks also ugly, because he is smaller than the drop-down button on next to him and because there is a space between this buttons.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
it sould integrate at least into the Gnome Desktop.
