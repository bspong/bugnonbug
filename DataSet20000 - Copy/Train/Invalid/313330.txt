I have 2 different profiles and this error message only comes up on one of them.
It is there when I first start up and any where I surf, it stays there. It is
just below the "URL       lock" line at the normal bottom of the screen and
pushes the line up about 1". I have looked for this file and it does not exist.
Can't get rid of the message.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on FireFox
2.Select my profile ("pebl1")
3.Blank, normal Firefox screen appears with message at the bottom. Never disappears.

Actual Results:  
Everything appears to work fine. The problem is it is taking over an inch of the
bottom of my browser window. I have to scroll everything.

Expected Results:  
No error message should appear. "URL      lock" line should be at the bottom of
the window.
