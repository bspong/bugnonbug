Firefox causes error in ATI2DRAG.DRV, then crashes

If I leave the PC for a while, it goes into powersaving mode and shuts the
display down. Bringing it out of powersaving by moving the mouse normally works.
Sometimes, though, I only see the mouse and the rest of the display stays black.
Sometimes I have to hard reboot. Sometimes hitting some keys brings the system
back to normal. Occasionally, hitting some keys brings the system back to life,
but windows flashes an error message then DPA terminates. A couple of times the
error message "Firefox has caused an error in ATI2DRAG.DRV" ahs remained on
screen. When I then close the error message Ff terminates.

This is not a new problem, but certainly was happening with DPA1 and possibly
previous nightlies. I do not know if it happens with 1.0.x.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Leave the PC with Ff running.
2.Wait for it to go into power saving mode
3.Move the mouse to bring it to life

Actual Results:  
Display does not always resume correctly, giving a black screen with only the
mouse showing. Sometimes hitting some keys brings it back to life.

Expected Results:  
PC should resume normally

My graphics card is a Sapphire Radeon 9550 with 256Mb RAM. The driver is the
latest on ATI's site, 8-03-98-3-050117a-021000e, but it also happened with the
drivers supplied by Sapphire, and the latest drivers on their site (Catalyst
5.4). Note Sapphire also point you to ATI's site to get updated drivers.
