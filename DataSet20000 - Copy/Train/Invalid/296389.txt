border not drawn around content if positioned elements used in HTML using CSS.

The content reproduced below should lead to the border being drawn around the
entire content. Although the positioned elements are taken into account while
laying out the background of the <body> tag, the positioned elements are not
taken into account when calculating the layout of the border. Instead, we get a
single dashed line across the top of the page, that does not border the
positioned elements that are inside body (displayable root element in the web
page, I would assume).

=========== TEST CONTENT ==================
<html>
<head>
<style type="text/css">
h1.x
{
position:absolute;
left:20px;
top:250px
}

h2.y
{
position:absolute;
left:20px;
top:650px
}
.z{
position:absolute;
left:20px;
top:150px
  }
.test
{
position:absolute;
left:50px;
top:1300px;
}
body { background: red; border: dotted 10px blue }

</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1 class="x">This positioned text</h1>
<h2 class="y">This positioned text</h2>
<p class="z">This positioned text </p>
<p class="test">This</p>
</body>
</html>

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the page whose content is reproduced above.
 
Actual Results:  
All we see is a dashed line across the top of the page because body has ONLY
positioned elements that are placed lower in the page. The text inside
positioned elements are all outside the border for <body>. I noticed the
background color for <body> is drawn taking into account the position of the
other elements as well.

Expected Results:  
We expect to see a dashed border on the outer edge around the entire content,
including the positioned elements.
