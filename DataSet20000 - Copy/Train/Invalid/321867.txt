Firefox 1.5 Exhibits erratic/unstable behavior on Win2000
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

I have observed some very strange/erratic behaviors in Firefox 1.5 that I did not notice in Firefox 1.0.7.  These behaviors are as follows:

1.  Changing the extension/theme installation settings through tools --> Options did not actually change the setting in about:config.  I had to manually change the setting in about:config to allow me to install extensions to Firefox 1.5.

2.  Firefox 1.5 does not always close all instances of its self in the Windows Task manager.  This is most noticeable after Firefox crashes.

3.  When Firefox 1.5 crashes, it does not give me the option to submit a bug report to Mozilla.

4.  Firefox 1.5 seems noticeably slower on Windows 2000 than Firefox 1.0.7.

5.  Firefox 1.5 crashes often when multiple tabs and/or multiple browser windows are open.



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Problem with Extenions installation:
1.  Install Firefox 1.5 after uninstalling Firefox 1.0.7 using add/remove programs on Windows 2000
2.  Try to add an extension.  You will get a message saying that the download was blocked.
3.  Now, use Tools --> Options to configure Firefox to allow 3rd party software installation.
4.  Restart Firefox and try to download the extension again.  You will notice that you still cannot download the extension
5.  Open about:config and look for the argument to allow or disallow extension installation.  It will state that extensions are not allowed.  Manually edit this, restart Firefox, and you will be able to install extensions.

Symptoms 2 through 5 above
1.  Open Firefox with several browser windows and lots of open tabs in at least 1 of those windows (graphics heavy pages work best).
2.  As you open more and more tabs, you will notice system response gets slower and slower and slower until the system basically becomes unresponsive.
3.  At this point Firefox will probably crash and you will receive a Windows explorer error.  You will not receive a Firefox error report submission screen.



I have noticed that Firfox 1.5's instability increases when web pages with lots of images or larger images are viewed and opened in tabs.  I have also noticed that I cannot reproduce this behavior every time, but it happens once or twice per day.  when Firefox crashes, I usually have 20 to 30 tabs open in one browser window and have two or three other windows open with 1 to 5 tabs open in each of them.  Firefox 1.0.7 seemed to handle this load quite well, Firefox 1.5 seems to crash about every other time or becomes very slow and unresponsive.
