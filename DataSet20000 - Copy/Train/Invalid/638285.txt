Viewing a flash video opens one plugin container, closing it then viewing a pdf opens another, closing that and watching a video opens another container. The containers don't close and still take up large ammounts of memory even when not viewing anything with the plugins any more.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open a flash video (eg. youtube)
2.open a pdf
3.open another video or something that uses another plugin
4.close tabs containing the items using the plugins
Actual Results:  
multiple instances of plugin-container.exe were left open hogging memory and causing lag.

Expected Results:  
closed them down after it was finished with them.(or I thought there should only have been one open at a time?)

10 instance in this example, 1 tab open at the new firefox home page, all others had been closed, this was after 30 mins of browsing.
