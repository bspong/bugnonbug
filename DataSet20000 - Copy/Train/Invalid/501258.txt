Before i updated, i used the 3.5b4. Since i updated to the release candidate, all my cookies are deleted, and new cookies are not saved. This affects ALL websites which i visit and it makes no difference if i cange any options.
I haven't tried yet to reinstall my FF, but as soon as possible i will do so and let you know if the problem appears anyway...

(Severity set to Major, because nearly all today's websites use cookies)

Reproducible: Always

1. Install the Firefox version 3.5 beta 4
2. Update to the 3.5 release candidate
