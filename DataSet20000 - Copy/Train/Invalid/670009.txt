http://JesusnJim.com/z/xhtml-css-uc-element-name-test.xhtml

tried these tests with DIV css element name in upper case.


Actual results:

div tag content that should be red is not red.  server is set up to properly serve up xhtml.   DIV css is not accepted but div is.  css is not supposed to be case sensitive I am told.  but in ff 5.0 it only accepts lower case.  not so in other browsers.


Expected results:

should have showed red text where it says "this should be red" and accepted the DIV element name css for the div element.
