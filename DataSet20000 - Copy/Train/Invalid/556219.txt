Long time Firefox User SWITCHED...
to gOOgle Chrome...
I have been using Firefox for OVER 10 Years, but Today was the LAST 
STRAW!!!
My main Computer, a QUAD Core 9450 2.66GHz, Windows 7 Home Premium 
64bit, 6GB Ram, 10K Raptor, ATI radeon 5770 1GB with a 10MB FIOS 
Internet Connection... And After the Firefox 3.6.2 update has been 
SUSTAINING 25%+ (this is the Average) CPU Usage with 6 Tabs Open!!! Almost making this 
Computer unuseable!!!
Then, I had to go over my friends house to work on his computer, so I 
pack my Toshiba T135 laptop,Windows 7 Home Premium 32bit, SU4100 ULV 
Dual-Cored CPU, 3GB ram, 500GB HD on a 6MB Internet Conection... and was 
Welcomed by Firefox with a WHOPPING 50%+ (this is the LOWEST) CPU 
Usage with 5 Tabs open!!! 
Absolutely Making My Laptop unuseable!!!
Now, I would give some slack, but unfortunately Firefox has been STEADILY going DOWNHILL... FAST!!!
This is TOTALLY Unacceptable!!!


Reproducible: Always

1. Clean Boot & Open Firefox

Actual Results:  
BOOM!!!! OVER 50% CPU USAGE!!!

Expected Results:  
about 3-5% CPU usage :)

2 different Windows 7 computers, one with 32BIT (Laptop) & the other with 64bit (Desktop)
I tried disabling a lot of Add-on's, Removing Temp files, running Virus Scans, Malware Scans, Spyware Scans...
but when it TOTALLY LOCKED UP My Laptop with OVER 50% CPU Usage and ONLY 6 Tabs open... That was the End of Trying to find a Solution to HELP Firefox WORK!!!
I installed gOOgle Chrome, currently have 8 Tabs Open and My Laptop WORKS the way it Should :D
