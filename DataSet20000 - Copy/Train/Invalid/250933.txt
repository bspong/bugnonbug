Some pages renders wrong as i browse to the page. Then after I click 'reload'
the page renders correctly.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a website that renders wrong. (look at the menu on www.ati.com for
example. They render at the wrong places.
2.Reload the page
3. Observe that the page now renders the popup menus at the corret places. (not
that this bug also affects normal things like tables that gets wierd lengths and
after a reload they look just fine.

Actual Results:  
The page render just fine as it should

Expected Results:  
Render the pages correctly in the first place. It seems that some things in
meory aren't reset fully before the page is rendered but the 'reload' button does...

Happends on all themes and stuff. All my friends can replicate this bug on quite
a few pages.
