Office environment with 50+ users. Some users previously running 3.0.8 others running 3.0.10. Some users running OS X 10.4.11 others running 10.5.7. All users had existing bookmarks from previous version of Firefox. Affected users updated to or downloaded and replaced old version with 3.0.11. Under 3.0.11, all bookmarks appear to be missing. Under 10.4, reinstalling older version restores previous bookmarks. Under 10.5, bookmarks remain missing even when reverting to older version.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have Firefox 3.0.8 - 3.0.10 and make bookmarks.
2. Update to or delete old and install 3.0.11
3. Look at bookmarks. They're gone.
Actual Results:  
Had to revert to version prior to 3.0.11 on 10.4.11 systems in order to get bookmarks back. Bookmarks still missing under 10.5.7 systems even with older version.

Expected Results:  
Expected to update and standard things like bookmarks still be there.

No errors logged to suggest why bookmarks disappear.
