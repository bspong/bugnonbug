I'm sorry if this is not written according to your bug reporting standards.  I am not in the software business and I don't have time to prepare all of the documentation that you request.  I just want my software to work.
Upgraded to Firefox 2.0 because 1.0 keeps crashing.  Went back to 1.0 because 2.0 does not automatically minimize when switching between applications.  Also does not scroll within a website.  I have to use the thumbnail.  If 1.0 continues to crash, I will go back to Internet Explorer.

Reproducible: Always
