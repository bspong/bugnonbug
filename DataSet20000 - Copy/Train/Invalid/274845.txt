Cannot delete previous search words from google autofill
I cannot, unlike in Explorer, delete previous seaches from the autofll dropdown
 (that appears under the seach rectangle as I begin typing in letters) when
using Google.  With Explorer I would just hit the delete key on my keyboard. 
This does nothing in Firefox.  Nor does the backspace key.  How do I delete
previous word(s) from the autofill dropdown in Google, when using Firefox?  

Thanks.
