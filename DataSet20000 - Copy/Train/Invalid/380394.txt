Hi!  First, I love FF!

I have Session Restore set to false via about:config.  The expected behavior of this feature is that a previous session will NEVER be restored, no matter what.  It seems that if the browser crashes or XP crashes with FF open, I will be asked if I want to restore the session.

Bottom line: if Session Restore is set to false, FF should NEVER restore the session - no matter what the condition.  If there are to be conditional reasons for restoring a previous session, then make the settings more granular to handle specific conditions.

Thanks very much,
Justin
