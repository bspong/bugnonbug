Java2 Plugin is not usable ( Mozilla doesnt find it )
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030516 Mozilla Firebird/0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030516 Mozilla Firebird/0.6

I installed the Java2-SDK onto my linux-system and then created a symbolic link
in /MozillaFirebird/plugins to
/opt/j2sdk1.4.2/jre/plugin/i386/ns610-gcc32/libjavaplugin_oji.so to use the
plugin. This worked, but when I booted the computer the next day and wanted to
load a website with java-plugin I got the errormessage "This page contains
information of a type (application/x-java-vm) that can only be viewed with the
appropriate Plug-In. Click OK to download Plugin"

So I tried to remove the link and link new, I made a link to /.phoenix/plugins/
as described in your Plugins-FAQ and I even installed the J2 Runtime Edition
seperately and linked it to there - nothing helped.

Java2 is not the problem as the "javac"-Compiler, the "java"-Interpreter and the
"appletviewer" work. But to be sure that it is not a Java-specific or
OS-specific problem / bug I linked the Java2-Library to my Mozilla 1.4 where it
works without problems or error messages.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.link the java library to /MozillaFirebird/plugins and/or link it to
./phoenix/plugins
2.Try to load a website with a java-plugin


Actual Results:  
Errormessage :
This page contains information of a type (application/x-java-vm) that can only
be viewed with the appropriate Plug-In. Click OK to download Plugin"

Expected Results:  
Load and display the Website with the Java-Plugin.
