When there's only one tab left, I cannot close it and return to a blank page, as firefox 3.0 does.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any web page in a tab.
2. Try to close it
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens, and the button is gray, firefox prevents you from closing the last one!

Expected Results:  
Close the tab as it used to do, or provide an option for user to choose which way firefox should behave.
