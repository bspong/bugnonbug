Firefox 3 only sometimes renders the menu bars in the Ironport device admin web pages.  Firefox 2 was  fine for some reason.  

Sometimes the menu items are not displayed at all, but usually the items are there but no drop down sub menus appear when they are clicked.  I have checked all popup blockers are switched off.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log on to an Ironport device and check the menus
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
drop down menus do not appear

Expected Results:  
menus should have appeared in the drop down list
