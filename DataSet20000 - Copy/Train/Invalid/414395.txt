Should we use gtk-media-stop for download's stop icon?
This isn't even really a bug as much as an observation that seems logical enough.

For the download manager, we currently uses gtk-media-pause for pause and gtk-media-play for play, but not gtk-media-stop for stop.

In the case that a GTK icon theme makes their media icons much different from the rest of the icons, it would probably be a good idea to use gtk-media-stop for stopping downloads.
