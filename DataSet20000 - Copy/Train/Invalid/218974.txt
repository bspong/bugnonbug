Table td background image does not show blocking menu items
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030728 Mozilla Firebird/0.6.1

In a <table>, for instance:
<td background="http://us.a1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/a/my_ad_here.gif">

The image will still be blocked if the user had selected "Block images from this
server" previously, but when right-clicking on this ad, the "Block images from
this server" menu item does not appear!

Similarly, if a browser plugin is installed that enhances image blocking, such
as AdBlock for Firebird, it will not be inserted into the right-click menu.  The
"AdBlock" menu item will also not appear.

However, the "View Background Image" menu item *does* appear.

It seems odd: the browser menus half-recognize a background image.  The option
to view the background image is shown, but the other usual image menu items
(block image, save image, and so on) are not shown!

Also, the AdBlock plugin does not fire on background images.  This might be
related to the problem above.  For some reason, background images are classified
differently from normal images, causing differing behaviour in plugins and such.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://biz.yahoo.com/rb/030911/economy_5.html
2. Reload until you get a page with the table background element for a large
square ad (about one screen down the page, on the far left)
3. Notice that you can right-click "View Background Image" on the ad, but that
you are powerless to block it!

Actual Results:  
See above.

Expected Results:  
Mozilla should have treated the background image as any other image, with full
context menu items (saving, blocking, and so on).


I'm using Firebird 0.6.1 on Windows 2000.
