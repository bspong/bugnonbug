home page not migrated
Fx3b4rc1 does not import the home page correctly from IE7 on Vista. I'm guessing it happens in Mac and Linux as well.

STR:
1. Run IE7 and set your home page to http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/
2. Run the latest Fx3b4 candidate, go to the File menu and choose Import
3. Select to import from IE

Expected: When I click my Home button in Fx3 I should go to http://bugzilla.mozilla.org (the imported home page from IE)

Actual: Home page not migrated.

Alternatively, we should clearly define what the user can expect to be able to import.
