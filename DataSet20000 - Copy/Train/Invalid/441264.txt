I've managed to get this repeated on Firefox 3 final installations on multiple friends' PCs. As you can see on the demo URL, the times for the feed items aren't displaying correctly - they all read as 12:00pm. The times display correctly under IE7, and viewing the source under Firefox shows that the correct times are in fact there in the feed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open RSS URL in Firefox.
2. Check times.
Actual Results:  
All times displayed as 12:00pm.

Expected Results:  
Displayed the correct times as per the RSS feed contents.
