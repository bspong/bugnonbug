Color of Google Search Visited Links Returns to Default Blue
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4
Build Identifier: Firefox/3.0.6 downloaded from http://www.mozilla.com/products/download.html?product=firefox-3.0.6&os=linux&lang=en-US

After upgrading Firefox from v3.0.4 to v3.0.6, the color of the visited links in Google search results changes to the default blue when search is restarted. In addition, when mouse is put over a link in the Google searched results, a Google address is added at the beginning of the URL in the statusbar and some encrypted string is added at its end, the actual URL being between them. The string added at the end differs each time a new search is done, and this is the cause of the problem

This behavior didn't exist in Firefox 3.0.4 (which I'm using now). In v3.0.6, it exists only for Google search.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type a search word in Google search bar;
2. Click on a link among the results;
3. Close the tab and open a new tab;
4. Retype the same search word and see the color of the same visited link.
Actual Results:  
The visited link is in blue.

Expected Results:  
The color of visited links should change, as it changes in search engines other that Google.


Firefox should behave as it did in v3.0.4, i.e, the visited links in Google search should change color even after restarting search.
