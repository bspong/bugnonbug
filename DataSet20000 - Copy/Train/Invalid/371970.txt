Clickin on Skype icon does not launch IM session as it should
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en-US) AppleWebKit/420+ (KHTML, like Gecko, Safari/420) OmniWeb/v607.17
Build Identifier: 

Our Skype online status indicator will begin a Skype chat session (or a call session, depending upon the javascript we invoke). This icon works fine in webkit browsers (Omniweb, Safari) and Internet Explorer, but so far we have documented failure in Firefox 2 on Windows XP and Camino 1.1beta on Mac OS X.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to www.walki-talki.com
2. click on skype icon in upper right (regardless of online status)
3.
Actual Results:  
Gecko either asks whether user wants to open file (Windows) or offers to download skype (Mac)

Expected Results:  
Start a chat session with user walki-talki.com on Skype

So far this seems to be a gecko problem that affects all gecko browsers on all platforms. Well, Mac and Windows anyway.
