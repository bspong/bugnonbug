Pressing down-arrow in places popup when doing a search should select the first result
It would be really great to be able to do quick keyboard-based bookmark/history searches with this thing by:

(1) Hit keyboard combo to bring up places search popup
(2) Type search term, see results
(3) Hit down-arrow a few times to select the result you want
(4) Hit Enter to open the select result and close the popup
