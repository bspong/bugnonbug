Browser History / URL suggestion appears broken between FF4b4 and 4b5

Have been using FF4b6 for a while on Ubuntu Linux, bothered by the fact that the Awesomebar wasn't being so.

Yesterday noticed that while recent History is visible in the History menu, no History appears in the Library.

Opening FF3.6, I saw that all my History is actually still in there, bang up to date - so it's just not showing up in FF4.

Just now downloaded some of the older betas and ascertained that both problems (No History in Library, no URL suggestions) started in FF4b5. When I load up FF4b4 (same machine, OS, user, profile), they both work fine.

I'm almost reluctant to add this information because it might cause investigation down a fruitless path, but I dual boot with WindowsXP SP3, storing my profile info in C:\MozillaProfiles (/media/xp/MozillaProfiles).

It was suggested that it might be a permissions issue, so just to make sure I copied my profile to my Ubuntu home folder, but the same behavior resulted. And just to reiterate, my latest FF3.6 plus all FF4beta versions prior to beta 5, on the same system with the same user and profile settings, do not suffer from these problems.

I have not tested the behavior comprehensively on Windows yet (don't use it that often), but I believe it suffers from the same problem with the most recent beta. I'll add info as to whether Windows too is ok with 4b4.

I have searched extensively on this problem and not come up with anything. Please let me know any other diagnostic steps I can take to help.

Many thanks!
