I have made my own extension, toolbar menu. When it's installed and I go to Manage bookmarks I get this (http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/linking/_A_TARGET_95y98y108y97y110y107y.html) web page in my browser, but there isn't bookmarks manager. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install expension
2.Go to Bookmarks -> Manage bookmarks

Actual Results:  
There isn't bookmark manager, only this (http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/linking/_A_TARGET_95y98y108y97y110y107y.html) page is opened in browser
