I am trying to create a simple form which consists of a checkbox in an HTML page. The checkbox has an onclick event on which an alert dialog with the value of checkbox is displayed. 

My problem is whenever I click on the checkbox, it always displays:
The value of checkbox is : on

Doesn't matter if the checkbox is checked or unchecked.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a html file.
2. Paste the following code in the file:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
<html>
  <head>
    <title>What is this?</title>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        function fnc(obj)
        {
            alert("The value of checkbox is : " + obj.value);
        }
    </script>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;
charset=UTF-8">
  </head>
  <body>
      <form name="frm">
          <input type="checkbox" name="chk" onclick="fnc(this)"/>
      </form>
  </body>
</html>
3. Open the html file in firefox.
Actual Results:  
Dialog box always displays:
The value of checkbox is : on
