Opening link in Message gives message DebugNextPageMI
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; sv-SE; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

When trying to open a link in a message (be it mail or web page from RSS) in Thunderbird, a messagebox with the text DebugNextPageMI appears from either Firefox or Thunderbird (Firefox is my default web browser).

This leads to a non-functioning Firefox which display it's interface as usual, but no web page is displayed (it's blank) with only the title of the webpage showing in the browsers window title.

No input is being accepted in Firefox (cannot change URL the location text box).

This only happens when Firefox has not been started (and is started by clicking on the link in Thunderbird). If a firefox browser is already open, the link opens up cleanly in a new tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close firefox browser (completely)
2. Click link in Thunderbird message


Actual Results:  
MessageBox "DebugNextPageMI" is displayed several times, and browser is incapacitated

Expected Results:  
Firefox starts up and displays the page on the clicked link
