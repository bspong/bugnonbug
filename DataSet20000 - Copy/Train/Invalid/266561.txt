A highlighted text disapears when the SHIFT key is pressed and you perform a
double-click over the selected text. Maybe is a feature and not a bug...

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
The bug appears following the next steps:
1. put the cursor somewhere inside a text (with simple click)
2. highlight a certain text area (select it with the mouse)
3. keep pressed SHIFT and do double-click on the selected area
4. Voila, the selected text disapears!

The first step is optional, sometimes occurs without it.
Actual Results:  
The selected text disapears.

Expected Results:  
Nothing. Keep the text and not vanish it.

If this is a feature... insted might be better that on double click on the
selected text, to copy it to the clipboard.

I am using the default theme. My computer is Duron at 1.2 GHz with 128 MB ram
and running Windows XP
