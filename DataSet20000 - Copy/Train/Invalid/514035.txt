when using css float: right; clear: right; and float: left; clear: left; blocks floating right get also cleared to the left... (Am I clear about that ?)

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
The blocks should pile up perfectly on the left and right sides with no blank spaces (in height) between them.

IE7 displays it as expected
Safari 4 for PC displays it badly (exactly as Firefox)
