display issue with stackoverflow.com search results
I was searching on stackoverflow.com.
I'm using firefox 6.0.2 on linux x86-64.

http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=[windows]+define+for+os+specific+code&submit=search

If I search for 'c++ define for building on windows', the results do not show up. I get the search box, and the widgets for showing how many pages of results are available. The source for the page shows results are there, they are not just showing up.

It doesn't happen with all search results.  If I search for just '[windows]' or '[linux]' then I see results.   I haven't yet discovered what makes it fail, but it has something to do with the search box that sometimes appears just above the search results.
