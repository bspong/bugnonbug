Only secure URLs (https:// or with "lock" can be accessed after adding Flashblock from your Addons site

I had no problems with 3.0.3 which I downloaded a few weeks ago, until I also added Flashblock from your website two days ago.  Now I cannot access any unsecured website such as airline, search engines, hotels, Google, etc.  Only those sites which are secured are accessible.  Since I downloaded Flashblock which was supposed to make my PC run quicker I haven't been able to access any unsecured site, which is totally unacceptable.  All of the secured sites I tried to access are still accessible.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to access an unsecured site.
2.  "working message" says "connecting to ..."
3.  I then get a "timed out" message which effectively blocks the website from me.
4.  If I try to access a secured site, the "working message" says "connected to ..." and takes me to the secured website
Actual Results:  
Type in the URL or use a bookmark - in either case if it is an unsecured website, I get the working message "connecting to ..." which then times out.

Expected Results:  
I should be able to access whichever websites I choose, not just the secured websites.

It should not have blocked the unsecured websites.  Please advise what steps I must take to enable my computer to access other websites, as it did prior to the installation of your Flashblock.  Thank you.  William Pollak   Pollak500@cs.com
