Mozilla has been working without problems until a few weeks ago.  I had an error message on my PC about imminent hard drive failure.  I took my PC to Geek Squad.  They mirrored my hard drive onto thier machine, installed a new drive and mirrored back.  Since then when I try to click a hyperlink in Outlook 2000 SP3 it will open my "nt" file.  I've set Mozilla as default, downloaded the latest Mozilla and no change.  If I make Internet explorer my default browser - everything works!  I don't want to give up mozilla! Help!

Reproducible: Always
