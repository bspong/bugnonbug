Hello Dear Firefox Creators,
The Firefox works great and is a great pleasure to use it...but now we
have a killer problem...when we open the browser it start to sing a midi
game like song(no matter what web site is opened)....The solution is to
disable the shockwave plugin but after that the pages have no flash...is
it a virus or a trojan?...or a html5 abuse?..
Thank you!
