Build Identifier: 

Observing huge memory usage for firefox.

Machine setup
Win XP

Have installed the addons IETab, Ad Block Plus, Download manager, Download status bar, video download helper.

When the firefox instance is started and some 8-10 tabs are kept open for a day or 2 we see huge memory consumptions. Maybe there is a leak in the addons (I have a doubt on IETab ) I observed this after I have installed IETab addon. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Kepp the 1/2 fireforx instance open with 8-10 tabs.
2.Keep the machine idle for a day or two
3.See that memory usage is huge and firefax has slowed down a lot.
Actual Results:  
Firefox becomes extremely slow and when you go to taskbar you can see arnd half the processor is used by firefox and around 500MB is used by firefox.exe

Expected Results:  
Memory/processor usage should be under control
