Certain sites that aren't overly complex, such as:
(http://jobview.monster.com/Help-Desk-Supervisor-3rd-Party-Prog-Job-Princeton-NJ-95236118.aspx?fwr=true) OR (http://jobview.monster.com/Help-Desk-Specialist-Job-Edison-NJ-96218402.aspx?fwr=true) are sluggish when scrolling with the default options set (Auto-scroll = TRUE and Hardware Acceleration = TRUE).

However, a site such as (http://www.nytimes.com/) scrolls FASTER than the above two sites, even though it has more content on the page.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Actual Results:  
Certain sites that aren't complex in nature are sluggish when scrolling compared to sites that are more complex.

Expected Results:  
Simple sites should not scroll slower than complex sites.
