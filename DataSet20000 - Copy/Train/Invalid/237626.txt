In order to learn much more about Bookmarks and its features, I was using
Scenario testing on it and I realized that using the Bookmarks for any website
requiring us to enter user ID and Password would create a security gap for this
website, or expose failures to deliver desired benefits of the Bookmarks. More
specifically, after we add any website in the Bookmarks, we directly log in the
same website without being asked for our user ID and Password by using the
Bookmarks. On the other hand, we apply the same test for the Favorites in the IE
browser, and have an expected result which requires for us to enter the user id
and password whenever we attempt to connecting to the website via the Bookmarks.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open any website such as MSN Hotmail requiring for you to enter an user ID and
Password.
2.Log in this website.
3.After successfully logging in the website, add it in your Bookmarks by
clicking Bookmarks menu and selecting “Add to Bookmarks…” item.
4.Click OK button after specifying a name and path for the website in your
Bookmarks.
5.After adding the website in Bookmarks, either close the website or log out the
your account.
6.Next time you want to log in the same website, use the bookmarks and click it.
7.After that, you directly log in the website without being asked for your user
ID and Password.
