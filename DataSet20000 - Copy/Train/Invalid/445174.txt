On going to this site, the browser minimized and an alert window popped up and gave a "You need to be scanned message"

I was browsing the web and I encountered this site.  The code on the site minimized my browser window and popped up a window saying

I killed firefox though the taskmanager and set about trying to file this bug report.

Please note that I have copied the "creahes" correctly, that is a mis spelling in the alert box.

Recap of important details.
1. A site minimized my browser without my interaction.
2. A pop window popped outside of the browser window.
