The problem occurs only in the Linux version.  I currently operate an Ubuntu Hardy on a AMD64 platform.  The problem can be seen in multiple websites that use a flash player, one in particular is www.cableaml.com

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  browse www.cableaml.com
2.  hover your mouse over the POINT-TO-POINT LINKS (below search box)
3.
Actual Results:  
Bub makes eb page navigation impossible due to menus showing up below the flash video.  

Expected Results:  
The pull menus should show up on top of the video

You guys do an exceptional job....   Others in Redmond, WA should follow your example.
