performance problem in javascript scroll

going to the http://www.chip7.pt one sees that every time the top text scroll
the CPU reach the top (PIII-600)
openning several pages from this site will take all the CPU and slowing down
alot the firefox
in windows things seens alot better, both firefox and IE seens to use only
little CPU

and its the firefox that its using the CPU, not X11, unlike a similar problem in
konqueror (it updates too many times per second and makes X11 eats all the CPU,
konqueror uses only about 15% of the CPU)

dont know if this is a dupe, there are many performance bugs in bugzilla, but i
have no idea if any of then applies here

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
just go to the page, watch the CPU usage going up sharp when the text start to
scroll


Expected Results:  
i dont belive that this CPU dont have enough power for this script, in windows
things use little cpu, so there is a problem between firefox and linux. So the
CPU usage should be alot lower
