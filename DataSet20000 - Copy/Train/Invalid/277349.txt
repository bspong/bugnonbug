Web pages with Javascript run too slow
Email me here: torently@yahoo.com if you can help me with this java problem.

It's too slow. Everytime there is a java website, and I don't want it to pop up
and tell me that java is on this page.

Can anyone there help with this? Speed it up? Get rid of the pop up?
