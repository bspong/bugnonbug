Firefox isn't display the RSS button in the statusbar when it encounters a page with RSS feeds on it. I don't know if this is because of a bug in not detecting the RSS feed, or just a bug in not displaying the RSS button. Also, right-clicking on an RSS feed link/icon doesn't bring up an option to add the feed as a live bookmark.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a site with an Atom/RSS feed
2. Look at your statusbar


Actual Results:  
The icon is missing

Expected Results:  
You should see the RSS/Atom (feed) icon

I've tried looking for the RSS feed icon in the statusbar with Firefox running in Safe Mode (all extensions disabled), and the result is the same. The RSS feed icon on the statusbar simply isn't showing up. Again, I'm not sure if this is a problem with Firefox not detecting the feeds or if it's just with the icon not showing up, but the fact that you can't add a live bookmark by right-clicking on a RSS feed link in a web page lends me to believe that it's the former.
