If a website changes (or adds) a shortcut icon any previously created bookmarks pointing to said website keep the old shortcut icon (or default 'page' icon) 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Method one.
1. drag link to bookmark toolbar
2. change page, or site's, shortcut icon
3. click on bookmark

Method two
1. manually add bookmark to site with shortcut icon
2. click on newly created book mark


Actual Results:  
old (or default) icon remains

Expected Results:  
icon should update if new one exists. 

Alternately, the "properties" dialog for the bookmark shoul allow you to update or change the icon if so desired.

The best solution for this would be to have the bookmarks reload the icon after the first time they've been accessed for a given user session (or after the browser cache has been cleared).

also, the ability to change or customize a bookmark's icon would be a nice feature to add.
