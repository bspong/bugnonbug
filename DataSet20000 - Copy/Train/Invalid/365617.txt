There is no way for me to access Adobe. Firefox 'hums' for a while and then reports that it has timed out waiting to access..  This fails from Google lookup, direct attempts via Firefox, from within adobe via their 'update' dropdown menu.

I have searched Firefox, Zone Alarm, AVG - NONE of them (as far as I can see) have any mechanism for blocking access to a site.

This MIGHT be a computer problem because I CAN access them from my wife's laptop

    *   The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few
          moments.

    *   If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
          connection.

    *   If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure
          that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.
