There was notice to update when I turned firefox on today.
my mac runs powerpc with mac os x 1.3.9

when I turned it back on after the update 
the pages come up very wide and there is no bar on the bottom to move it back and forth.
instead there is a wide space below the status bar.
in it in red is the following.

<menuitem id="foxlingo_toolbar-linkular" label="&foxlingo.text.linkular;" tooltiptext="&foxlingo.text.linkular.slogan;" class="menuitem-iconic" oncommand="foxlingo_opensite('linkular');"/>______^
