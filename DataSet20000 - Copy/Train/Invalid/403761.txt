[10.5] Help menu opens very slowly
In Minefield on OSX Leopard, a click on the "help" menu takes about 10 seconds (!) until the menu actually opens up.

This may be caused by something related to the "spotlight"-like field now present in help menus on OSX, but I don't know.

This is reproducible for me. Am I the only one having this problem?
