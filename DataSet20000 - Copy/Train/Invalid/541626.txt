Photobucket Uploader 1.

None of the Image uploader add-ons work. For example the photobucket uploader 1.3 can be installed but when I am trying to log into my account it will pop up with a little window and will not let you sign in at all. There is no error code the little image just keeps going and going like if it is loading but never loads. I do have the newer version of firefox 3.6 but I also downgraded and tried it with 3.5 and still nothing. Only the same problem. Please help.

Reproducible: Always
