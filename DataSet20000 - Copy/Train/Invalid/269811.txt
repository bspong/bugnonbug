middle-clicking on a link still opens a new window even when middlemouse.openNewWindow is set to false

I have browser.tabs.opentabfor.middleclick set to false because I don't want to
use tabbed browsing (I like to see all my open windows on my taskbar). Once I
set that, middle-clicking opens the links in new windows. I don't want that
either so I set middlemouse.openNewWindow to false. This has no effect.

I use the middle mouse button to scroll by clicking on the window which creates
a circle icon with up and down arrows on it, then i drag the mouse up or down to
smoothly scroll up or down. Because of this bug, if my mouse happens to be on a
link, then instead of the desired scroll feature, a new window launches.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set browser.tabs.opentabfor.middleclick to false
2. Set middlemouse.openNewWindow to false
3. Go to any web page
4. Middle-click on a link

Actual Results:  
A new window opens with the page that the link in step 4 refers to.

Expected Results:  
Not opened a new window, and show the circular scroll icon with the up and down
arrows on it, allowing me to scroll up and down the page by moving my mouse.

- I am using the Microsoft IntelliMouse.
- someone on the MozillaZine forums told me that this bug was not present in
versions prior to 1.0
