javascript function named onclick is used as body onclick

I was creating a test script to test the document.getElementsByName and
accidentally named my javascript function onclick (I was going to name it test).
 This caused the function to be called everytime I clicked on the page.  No
matter if it is right button, left button or where it is.  So, I decided to see
what if I changed the function to onblur.  Bad idea, couldn't get out of an
infinite loop of alerts.  But it looks like that the name onclick is causing
Firefox to consider it as its onclick handler.  I don't think that is how it
should work, but I might be wrong.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to the web page
2.  Click where ever you like
3.

Actual Results:  
Alert message is shown

Expected Results:  
Alert message should never be shown since the function should never be called as
it is not set as an event handler to any of the items.
