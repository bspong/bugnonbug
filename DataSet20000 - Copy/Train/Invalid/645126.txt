I got firefox 4 and moved my bars around to make it more like 3 , but some toolbars didn't show as expected or didn't move so when I went back in to change them the toolbar changer didn't pop up and the menu bar went grey[inactive,would not take clicks] , leading me to restart to get the toolbar setup back and my menu-bar to to actions and rinse repeat when I tried to load the toolbar changer again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open firefox 4 
2.Right click to change toolbar properties
3.Move or not move a toolbar or item
4. close setting popup
5. try to open again
6. Fail
Actual Results:  
Menu bar stops responding and toolbar properties box does not appear.

Expected Results:  
Toolbar properties pops up and I don't crash my menu bar.
