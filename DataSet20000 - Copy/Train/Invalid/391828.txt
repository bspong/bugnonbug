closure of a tab without proper logout allows a user to launch web application wihtout login prompt.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: 

While visiting  some web application if we close the tab without proper logout and open the same URL in another tab

than we login into application with user name and password.

if we close the browser than we need to login to application.

I have two questions?

is this a feature with tab browsing or a bug.

is there any difference between closing a tab window or complete browser window

Thanks,
Amit
