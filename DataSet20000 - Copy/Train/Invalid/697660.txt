"You are about to close x tabs" x+1 Please

Steps to reproduce:

Hit the (Window$) X to close the browser (I have it set to the old behavior where it just says "are you sure?" instead of "save?").


Actual results:

When the browser asks "You are about to close x tabs" the count is always one less than it should be.


Expected results:

It should have reported the correct number. We've had tabbed browsing for years. What am I missing?
