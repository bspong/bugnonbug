when I uninstall firefox and re-install it
I get old setting back , like extension

coz I can't uninstall some extension(I forgot what)
so I try to un-install firefox, to get rid all extension and install new one.
but when I install it, I get old extension all complete where it left

I don't know why

but I have to format my harddrive to get complete new firefox

so it's mean that uninstall firefox is not all complete
