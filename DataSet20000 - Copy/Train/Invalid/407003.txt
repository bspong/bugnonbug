Half of my bookmarks are gone

Just upgraded from 2.0.0.10 to 2.0.0.11. Not only would it not restart until I shut down and rebooted (it kept saying Firefox was already open though it was showing, even in Task Manager), but now half of my bookmarks (most recent ones) are totally gone. Is there any way to retrieve them?
