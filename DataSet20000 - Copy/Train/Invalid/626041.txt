Track package function from Amazon does not work

Everytime I try to track my packages from Amazon (in my case: Amazon.de and Amazon.co.uk but bug should be present with all Amazon websites since it's the same layout) it fails. When I click on 'track package' in my account, a litte drop down menu opens saying 'Retrieving tracking information...' and it doesn't stop loading. Worked fine with FF 3.6.x

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in to Amazon > Your Account > Your Orders ( https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/css/history/orders/view.html/ ) [or for Amazon.de: Mein Konto > Meine Bestellungen ( https://www.amazon.de/gp/css/history/orders/view.html )]
2. Klick on 'track package' (or 'Lieferung verfolgen')
Actual Results:  
Firefox fails to display the tracking number and the status of the package. Instead it doesn't stop loading until I cancel the function by clicking on the Close Button of the little drop down menu.

Expected Results:  
FF should load and display the function in the correct way.
