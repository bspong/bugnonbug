I downloaded Firefox from mozilla.org and installed it on two computers
succssfully.  The third install , on a PC running XP Pro , seemed to work, but
the application will not access any website. A Dialog box appears indicating
that the web address is incorrect. I tried several different sites with the same
result.

All other Interent applications (IE, Outlook) work fine, so I know that my DNS
server can be accessed. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install product
2.Run program
3.Will NOT find any wqeb page.

Actual Results:  
Dialog box appeared indicating web address could not be found.

Expected Results:  
Gone to my home page.
