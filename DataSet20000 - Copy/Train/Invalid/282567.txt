Extra information (I do not know if it has an impact):
-> The desktop properties are set to Classical Windows Style (like Windows98
SE), with color Marple (Erable, in French).

Steps to reproduce:
-> Go to http://www.afnic.fr/obtenir/choix
-> Select the text from "Critères d'obtention" to the end of paragraph #6
-> Request printing, only limited to the selection.

Results:
=> The test is printed on a grey background, except titles and list with bullets.

Expected result:
=> Should be printed WYSIWIG (before selection), which is in black with a white
background.

This bug occured with a previous version of Mozilla, but wassolved with Mozilla
1.6. It occurs again with FireFox 1.0.

Thanks in advance.
