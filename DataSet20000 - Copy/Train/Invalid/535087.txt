On Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) I can assign a tag to a bookmark, say "t" to "www.nytimes.com," type [t] [return] in the awesome bar, and Firefox invokes the bookmark. This doesn't work on Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger); it ends up searching Google for "t."

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Assign tag to bookmark.
2. Type tag in awesome bar.
3.
Actual Results:  
Firefox searches Google for tag.

Expected Results:  
Firefox invokes bookmark associated with tag.
