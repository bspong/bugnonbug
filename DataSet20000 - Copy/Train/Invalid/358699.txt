When viewing a flash video with multiple tabs open, the mouse clicks to navigate to another tab do not respond, and must press ctrl+tab to force navigation to a different tab.

Wait for it to start, then try clicking on another (already open) tab and find it does not respond unless you use the keyboard shortcut.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Goto http://www.filecabi.net/index.html
2.Click on any video
3.Click on the "flash player" option to playback the video in flash
4. Wait for the video to start, then try clicking on another (already open) tab and find it does not respond.
Actual Results:  
Could not goto another tab unless I use the keyboard shortcut CTRL + TAB which worked instantly

Expected Results:  
After clicking on the other tab, should have switched to that selected tab

Please keep me posed if possible
