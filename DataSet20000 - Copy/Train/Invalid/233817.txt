Will not run after full clean install

I had downloaded the new Firefox but has used add remove to get rid of any old
versions I may have had installed.  Once installed I clicked yes to let it open
the program and it opened to a blank nothing.  It wasn't even a webpage.  

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just install the program and launch it
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Got a blank, no webpage, and it would do nothing but sit there.

Expected Results:  
Loaded the new, " I see you have downloaded a new build of FireFox," page.

Was an easy fix.  Run cmd from the folder FireFox is installed in and then type
in Firefox -p to get into profiles.  I had tried to do this from the menu but it
would not let me get into profiles from there.  I then added a new profile and
removed the default profile without removing the files inside that profile.  Now
it works perfect.  

Am not sure why this happened.  I run an AMD 2700 if that helps any and am
running Win XP with every update.  Hope this is not something hitting everybody
since once I got it running the new program is worth downloading.
