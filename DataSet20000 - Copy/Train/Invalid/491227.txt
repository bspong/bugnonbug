Querying bookmarks menu for "Get Bookmark Add-ons" details fails
Created attachment 375550
Testcase (chrome privilegies)

Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1b5pre) Gecko/20090427 Shiretoko/3.5b5pre ID:20090427031112

When you try to query the details for the "Get Bookmark Add-ons" entry inside the bookmarks menu it fails silently and successive menu items aren't listed anymore.

Steps:
1. Start Firefox with a fresh profile
2. Open and start the testcase (download it locally first)
3. Check and compare the items which are listed for the bookmarks menu

As you can see all successive menu items of the "Get Bookmark Add-ons" item aren't listed anymore. No error or exception is visible inside the error console. But enclosing the menu code inside a try/catch block fixes the problem locally for me. At one time I have seen a warning at the following line and _result not defined:

No idea, what causes this problem but calling details for this special item should not silently fail.
