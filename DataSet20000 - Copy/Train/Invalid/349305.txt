I downloaded FIREFOX to use godaddy's "website tonight" program but was unable to complete functions like changing color of text.  Godaddy support said the FIREFOX TOOLS menu should have 'OPTIONS" in the dropdown menu but it doesn't.  He suggested I reinstall firefox and I did although I couldn't uninstall the program entirely because there was no uninstall function to uninstall the program completely so now I have 2 FIREFOX application icons and duplicate FIREFOX data.  Godaddy also said I should empty cookies.  Should I and how?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on "TOOLS" and no "OPTIONS" appears in dropdown.  Was told there should be an 'OPTIONS" option
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Reinstalled software and still no OPTIONS in TOOLS menu.

Expected Results:  
OPTIONS in TOOLS menu and ability to use godaddy "website tonight" program using Foxfire as my browser.

Help uninstalling first Foxfire and help getting Foxfire to work successfully.  I'm using the latest version of Mac Tiger 10.4.7 and I use a powerbook 15" aluminum - bought last December.
