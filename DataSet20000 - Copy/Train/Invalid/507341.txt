Since downloading latest version 3.5 when browsing on random web pages it will just suddenly freeze and won't let you do anything. I have been using firefox for a long time love it and have had to go back to using IE because of the freezing.  One of the web sites it always has been freezing on is www.yahoo.com

Reproducible: Sometimes
