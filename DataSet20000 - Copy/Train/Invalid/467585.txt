Latest Minefield Trunk: extensions can't be overridden
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko/20081202 Minefield/3.2a1pre

Installed the latest trunk; all extensions inactive/greyed out - incl Nightly tester Tools; no button to force install. I attempted to re-install Nightly tester Tools: message that ext is incompatible with this version of Minefield. 

I've never had this problem with builds before; do these compatibility issues come up from time to time with a major build change - like, something that you are aware of and that would be fixed with future builds as the exts are made compatible?

I posted my exts here: http://mysite.verizon.net/lupatrian/exts120208.jpg


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Downloaded/installed Minefield 3.2a1pre 12/2 build
2. Opened Minefield; exts unavailable, override unavaiable
3.
