Anything typed in the URL bar does not show up when hovered over a link.

When the cursor hovered over a link and the new bubble pops up that shows the
name of the link in bold text and then the URL it goes to shows, anything typed
in the address bar does not show up until the bubble goes away.  Sometimes the
first letter will show up and other times it doesn't, but I havent had any text
show up after that.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Put the focus on the address bar (click on it and make sure it can be typed
in, specifically.  Doesn't have to be cleared).
2.  Hover your mouse over a link until the new popup box shows (the one with the
bold text and where the link goes to (I don't know the technical name of it)).
3.  Type anything into the address bar.  I haven't had anything show up.

Actual Results:  
No URL or text shows up.

Expected Results:  
Visable text.
