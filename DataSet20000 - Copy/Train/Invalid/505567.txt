When you have a flash application that can go full screen, and the flash application is loaded using wmode=opaque, then if you focus the flash app, then go full screen, the flash app won't resize correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a flash application that has a button. The code behind the button takes you to full screen.
2. load the flash application in a webpage using wmode=opaque.  I used swfobject to do this with javascript.
3. before clicking the button to take the app to full screen, click somewhere else on the app to give it focus (you will see dotted lines around the app once it has focus).  Now click the button to take it full screen and it won't be resized correctly.
4. if you exit full screen, click somewhere on the page to take focus way from the flash app, then click the button in the flash app to go full screen, then it will resize correctly.
Actual Results:  
the flash app resizes incorrecty

Expected Results:  
the flash app should resize correctly

it only happens in FF3.5.  I tried in previous versions of FF and it doesn't seem to happen.  Also, IE does not have any problems either.
