Hi.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. hold down the left mouse button (lmb) over a bookmark toolbar button

2. move the mouse (with hold down lmb)

3. move the mouse back over the button where you have started to hold down the lmb

4. release the lmb

Notice the mouse over effect of this bookmark toolbar button, it now looks like it is pressed, while the other buttons have the correct mouse over effect!

I will attache a screenshot.
