The download manager is so bad it is not worth identifying specific bugs. It needs to be totally scrapped and rewritten by someone who knows how to do that job right.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Add a list of bookmarks and folders
2.Move a subfolder to a higher folder
3.Try to delete one of the bookmarks in either folder
4.You will go nuts trying to undo the damage the bookmark manager does to your bookmard list.
