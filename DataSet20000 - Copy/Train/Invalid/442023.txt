The Oracle/Siebel portal - Metalink3 shows the "403 Forbidden" message after logging in. This seems to happen only with FFv3

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to https://metalink3.oracle.com/
2. Click "Login to Metalink 3" link
3. Enter Login/ Password
4. Browser gets forwarded to https://metalink3.oracle.com/od/faces/index.jspx
Actual Results:  
You see message "403 Forbidden" instead of page content (See Screenshot)

Expected Results:  
One should get logged on to Oracle Metalink3 and see regular pages (see screenshot)

The same thing works if tried with FFv2.x or IE (i tried with v6+)
