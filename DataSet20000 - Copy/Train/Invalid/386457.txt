This is not an actual bug but a virus that seems to have got into a Mozilla file.
PCGuard antivirus detected "W32/SelfStarterInternetTrojan!Maximus" virus in
C:\Documents and Settings\Malcolm Slocombe\Local Settings\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\5ia2116n.default\Cache\DAF1E752d01
PCGuard did (or could) not disinfect it and recommended deleting it which I have done. It said this file was used for storing emails!?
