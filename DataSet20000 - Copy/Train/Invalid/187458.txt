If you uncheck "Hide the tab bar when only one tab is open" the tab bar does not
appear when you have only one page open. I think it would be more logical if the
tab bar appeared if you uncheck that pref.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Preferences
2. Uncheck "Hide the tab bar when only one tab is open"
3. Click OK

Actual Results:  
Tab bar does not appear until you create a new tab from the File menu

Expected Results:  
Make the Tab Bar appear
