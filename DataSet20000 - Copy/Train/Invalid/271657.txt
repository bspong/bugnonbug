Incorrect changed settings in IE 6.0.2900.2180.xp_sp2_rtm.040803-2158

After installing firefox and importing my IE 6.0 bookmarks/settings/etc. I can
no longer use Tools >> Internet Options in IE. I get the following error when
attempting to view my IE settings:

This operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this
computer. Please contact your system administrator.

Operating environment:
Windows XP, SP2
768 MB RAM
T40 IBM laptop computer

Impacted software:
IE 6.0.2900.2180.xp_sp2_rtm.040803-2158


Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce
Steps to Reproduce:
I cannot reproduce the problem because the IE settings are now locked and I
can't unlock them since I don't know what devilish changes firefox made.


Expected Results:  
There should be NO CHANGE AT ALL to IE 6.0 settings or behavior on installing
firefox and importing said settings from IE.

I'm giving this a MAJOR severity since it impacts regular use of existing
software on the computer, although it does not impact firefox itself.
