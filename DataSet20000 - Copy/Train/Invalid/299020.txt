I cannot open a new window.  Originally, it seemed that I could not open a new
window after closing all windows.  It comes up with the mouse arrow and the
little black-and-white spinning wheel to the lower right of the mouse arrow.  I
would have to quit Deer Park and restart it to get a new window, and remember
never to close all of them.  Now, it won't open any new windows at all, not by
the keyboard shortcut, nor by the menu.  I can open new tabs, but not new windows.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Deer Park
2. Select File -> New Window or type CMD-N.
3. Nothing

Actual Results:  
The mouse added the little black-and-white spinning wheel to its lower right
corner, but nothing else.

Expected Results:  
Open a new window.
