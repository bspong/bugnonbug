The background file for my website does not show up on Mozilla. It does on Netscape and Internet Explorer.

My website has a turqouise colored pattern background defined under an HTML style command. The latest version of Internet Explorer and an earlier version of Netscape (7.1) both load the background properly when displaying the home page. (http://www.salrachele.com). Mozilla Firefox latest version does not. I suspect it has something to do with the way Mozilla interprets HTML code. Offending script is ...<style="background-image:url([file path])">...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Mozilla Firefox (latest version)
2. Call URL (http://www.salrachele.com)
3. Background image fails to load -- there is only a white background.
Actual Results:  
No background image is displayed. Text and graphics load normally.

Expected Results:  
A turquoise colored pattern background should appear behind the text and graphics on the home page (and all other pages linked to the home page).

I have not tested this out on other computers - only on other browsers (Netscape 7.1 and IE 7.x. 

I uninstalled and re-installed Firefox (which reset the profile and build sequences). No effect.
