I started noticing issues with web sites not operating properly relating to opening new windows. Then noticed the Firefox New Window command would not work.  I uninstalled Firefox along with profiles multiple times and then finally noticed that on the default installation there was a Skype extension automatically being installed.  When I removed this Skype extension everything began functioning properly again.
