mcafee firewall 8.0 won't allow permission for firefox 1.5.0.1

Build Identifier: Firefox/1.5.0.1

After installing the firefox 1.5.0.1 update I get repeatedly queried by a dialog box asking whether to Allow or Deny Firefox by McAfee Firewall 8.0.  Selecting allow in the dialog box is an endless loop.  Looking at the Mcafee log, it indicates a bad packet from Firefox each time.

Reproducible: Always
