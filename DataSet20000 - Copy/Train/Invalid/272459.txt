After closing all open windows, going to the menu -> View -> Full Screen results
in a large white window covering the entire desktop (menu remains visible though).

In addition, going to menu -> Toolbars, shows a submenu that only has a divider
and Customize... option (no Navigation Toolbar or Bookmark Toolbar).

To remove the white screen, go to menu -> View -> Full Screen again.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close all browser windows.
2. Go to the menu -> View -> Full Screen

Actual Results:  
A blank window/screen with no controls covered the entire desktop.

Expected Results:  
With no windows open, the Full Screen option should be greyed out or a new
window in Full Screen mode should open.
