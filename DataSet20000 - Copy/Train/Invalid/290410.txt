I got a now common link in msn... one of those propagating msn viruses.  I
clicked it and it opened up the supplied link.

A virus was automatically downloaded to:
C:\DOCUMENTS AND SETTINGS\ALIASNIGMA\LOCAL SETTINGS\TEMP

The browser immediately opens and propts me as to whether I want to same some
.com file.  Before I even made a choice Norton Antivirus had caught the virus
already downloaded in a temp folder.

In later trials Norton Antivirus did not catch the virus until I pressed the
cancel button in the download dialog.

At no time did I choose to download the file.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the supplied link. !!Caution!!
2.The virus automatically downloads and firefox asks save the file.
Antivirus dialog appears informing a virus has been found.
3.Infected Client... or quarantined .com file

Actual Results:  
Virus auto-downloaded.
As stated If not for Norton Antivirus i would have been infected... with the
autodownloading virus.

Expected Results:  
I was expecting Firefox not to download a .com file automatically... rather ask
to download it as usual.
Expected results are identical.  This is a working security hole.



A bug like this enables pretty much anything to get through.

The server hosting the virus and infection page will IP ban or email ban you if
you enter the link more then about 3 times.
