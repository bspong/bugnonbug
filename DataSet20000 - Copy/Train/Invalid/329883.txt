Firfox is using more than 100,000K (when checking it on Task Manager) even though I have only 1 or 2 firefox open
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

firefox is taking way too much memory ( and virtual memory ) as soon as i open the browser!

Reproducible: Always
