For the web page http://gimp.lisanet.de/Website/Download.html I'm getting strange behaviour where a 'Open in New Tab' from right-cliking links is causing subsequent key presses to attempt to open pages in new windows.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://gimp.lisanet.de/Website/Download.html
2. Right click on Snow Leopard, Leopard, or Tiger downloads
3. Select 'Open in New Tab' from context menu
4. Try pressing either q, w, e, r, Applekey+T.


Actual Results:  
Observe after any key press that a warning about preventing a popup will appear, or if multiple key presses, an increasing count of prevented popups.


Expected Results:  
Keypresses such as q, w, e, r should do nothing; Applekey+T should open a new tab.

Optional steps to stop:
1. Right click a 'News', 'Photo Editing' or 'Download' links
2. Choose 'Open in New Tab' from context menu
3. Press a key such as q, w, e.
4. Observe counter does not increase on prevented popups
