Hello, when I have used previous versions of Firefox I have had no problems, when trying to log on electronically to my Swedish Bank Accounts that use the so called BankID system. With the Beta this doesnt work. I get the Bank ID on the screen, but it doesnt work.

To see what Bank ID I mean, pls check the following Bank link: http://www.skandiabanken.se/hem/

Reproducible: Always
