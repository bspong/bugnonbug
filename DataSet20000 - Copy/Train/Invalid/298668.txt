Dear Sir
I have a glitch with Firefox.. The option "Australian pages only" was 
available with the original free download.  It vanished a while back. I 
reported it and asked what to do.  Yes, I did clear all temp files and 
cookies.  The option came back, but only for two days. I have not had 
the option for several weeks.. My version is 1.0.4.  I would like this 
option back, because Firefox is a great program apart from this.  I 
would be happy to donate, once this is fixed permanently, or do I need 
to buy the updated program.
Regards
