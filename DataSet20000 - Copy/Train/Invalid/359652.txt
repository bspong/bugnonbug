Hangs randomly in Firefox 2 - second firefox.exe magically appears

When moving quickly around web sites and clicking on items, such as scroll bars, before the previous command has fully refreshed the screen, Firefox 2 will occasionally hang. Task manager shows two firefox.exe tasks not responding when this happens, despite only one being visible. When it occurs, I usually have at least three tabs open. This behaviour is new to Firefox 2.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Choose any site with many controls - for me it happens mostly with etrade.com.au (stock trading site)
2. Make many fast actions without waiting for refresh to complete
3. Watch it hang.
