Home page doesn't always load on startup (when choosing "Save and Quit" at exit)

When booting PC from cold then invoking FFox version 3 my home page specified in the options panel does not always load, I get a blank page. If I then close FFox and re-invoke it, it loads fine and continues to load ok while PC is running. When the problem happens If I click the home page tool bar button it loads ok.

I have set the home page to http://www.orange.co.uk/ and "show my home page on startup". When exiting FFox I clear all 8 categories of private data.

Unfortunately I cannot force this to happen but it has been happening about every other day since I upgraded (I think I upgraded on the day of release) When it does happen I checked the options panel and confirmed that home page is specified as required. 

Hope I've given enough detail.

Regards,
Ned.

Wouldn't normally bother you but there used to be a virus/trojan/malware/whatever associated with setting one's home page to Blank so it made me a bit twitchy.
