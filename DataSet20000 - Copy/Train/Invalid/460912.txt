When running All In One Sidebar (and only AIOS) on FF3.1b2, the "Customize Toolbar" dialogue is blank -- in other words, it is empty of buttons to drag and drop onto toolbars.  This only occurs when AIOS is running.

This bug has also been reported to the developer of AIOS -- firefox.exxile.net.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run Firefox 3.1 beta 2 pre
2.Right click on toolbar
3.Select "Customize..."
Actual Results:  
Customize Toolbar opens with no visible buttons to place on toolbars.
