Tabmix forces you to restore all webpages if you want to restore even one rather then giving you a choice of which sites you want to reopen the next time around OR TO OPEN IN A SEPARATE WINDOW.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Crash firefox with soem websites open.
2. Restart it.
3. Get forced to restore all or nothing.
Actual Results:  
Forced to restore all web pages previously visited just to find even one.

Expected Results:  
Not to be forced to reopen websites infected with viruses, trojans, worms, adware, and malware just to get even one website back.

Ugh. Maxthon can do this... but it doesn't give you the option of opening certain other sites in a separate window if you want (which would make it easier to sort out things the next time around. And it would be nice if someone made a plugin in which you could make selected tabs go into a specific separate instance of firefox rather then a totally new instance all the time.
