'Bouncing' Window
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2

I recently formatted and reinstalled XP, so of course installed the latest Firefox.
After the install I imported all item from I.E.
When Firefox opened, there were no toolbar folders as I recall from other installs.
The problem is that the entire Firefox window where a page would be is 'bouncing'.
It is jumping up and down about half a line 2-3 times a second.
At the same time, in the address bar I see the cursor disappear and reappear in
time with the bouncing. BTW- I use about:blank for the starting page.

If I enter about:blank into the address bar, the bouncing stops. But, if I open
a URL in a new tab it will begin again while the new page is loading.
This happens with or without extensions loaded/installed.
I have javascript enabled, but do not have Java installed on the machine.

I'm at a loss. It is like it is trying to open something when it is displaying a
blank page.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install on my system using defaults.
2.Import I.E. all items.
3.Open Firefox

Actual Results:  
The webpage display portion of the Firefox window bounces and the address bar
cursor 'jumps'/blinks in time to this bounce.

Expected Results:  
Open and not move.
