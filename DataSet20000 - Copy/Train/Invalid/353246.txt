loss of graphic elements on websites.

In Yahoo mail and elsewhere, like NYTimes, download of version 1.5.0.7 resulted in loss of labels (security label and utton bar in Yahoo mail) or graphics (NYTimes).

This is very similar to events after the previous download; however, that fault self-corrected and this has not. Very Annoying and cannot do online shopping on many sites (LandsEnd.com, jcp.com).

Mozilla does not crash but is far less functional than IE.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the website for merchants of NYTimes; enter Yahoo mail. Easy!
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Same thing as experienced since downloading

Expected Results:  
It should have revealed all graphic elements that are parts of the default screen for that site.
