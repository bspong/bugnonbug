Prefer toolbar names over names in other menus when importing bookmarks
On import when there are duplicate items with the same URI, whichever one was defined last gets the global title for the item. Instead, we should use, in order of preference: (1) the name in the toolbar, (2) the name in a submenu of the toolbar, (2) some other name. This will reduce the pain of having a unique title by giving the name most likely to be customized.
