User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1b1pre) Gecko/20080930093007 Minefield/3.1b1pre

When I open a web link from inside FahMon, the web page opens in Firefox. however, the default theme that it opens as is the Windows XP strata theme, instead of the Vista. This only occours when Firefox is not already open, but when the application is opening a new instance of FF. I do not have any themes installed, so it is not a compatibility issue. Also, occours in with my 2 extensions disabled.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open FahMon
2.Click "My Stats"
3.Observe the FF theme when opening.
Actual Results:  
Windows XP theme(green new tab button, home, etc)

Expected Results:  
Vista theme (blue).
