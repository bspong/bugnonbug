Suddenly bad rendering, temporally associated with 3.5.7b5 and weave merge
I have two firefoxen running on two machines: Namoroka on my laptop, Firefox 3.5.6 (but was trying 3.5.7beta when this occurred) on my desktop. Both Mac OS/X. I had just installed weave on both machines, and synced them. Don't know if weave is involved. Don't know if beta is involved.

At some point, I noticed that the beta browser (on desktop machine) was rendering badly. Attached png shows three grabs:
 - The search bar in top right corner has its icon/glyph mis-placed
 - the tabs have no close buttons
 - the thumb has no bottom 'rounded part'
There are also apparently issues with location inside a text box.

I tried:
  restart firefox beta: No success
  kill beta and revert to 3.5.6: No success
  restart the whole machine: No success
  download new 3.5.6 and restart machine: No success
  sign out of weave and restart firefox: No success

It seems to me that the problem is likely to be something to do with the rendering engine, and maybe to do with some kind of cache that the renderer is not clearing. Maybe. I do not think that the bad rendering is the actual problem, but it is the symptom I'm seeing.

What I need (very much) is a way to fix the symptom. I also hope that this bug helps lead to a fix the underlying problem whatever it may be.
