firefox cannot handle numeric stylesheet selectors
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Firefox 1.0 (and Mozilla 1.7.3) cannot handle stylesheet selectors that are
numeric.  Opera and IE do not have this problem.  And forgive me if I am wrong,
but I don't think the W3C CSS spec states that numeric selectors should not be used.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.create a page style with a numeric stylesheet selector
2.view the page in firefox

Actual Results:  
styles with numeric selectors are ignored.

Expected Results:  
styles with numeric selectors should display
