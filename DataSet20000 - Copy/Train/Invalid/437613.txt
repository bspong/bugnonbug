when accessing a private home server with a ssl certificate for localhost, firefox gives the message "Error code: sec_error_reused_issuer_and_serial". It doesn't allow to override this warning and accept the certificate manually.

this is nice for normal domain names. there should be an exception for localhost certs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. browse a server that has a certificate for localhost
2. set firefox to accept this cert, although it is not signed....
3. browse another server that has a certificate for localhost
Actual Results:  
errorpage "Error code: sec_error_reused_issuer_and_serial"

Expected Results:  
firefox should allow in this case to override the warning.
