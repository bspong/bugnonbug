Typing Ctrl+K when in the page takes the cursor to the search toolbar. However,
if the focus/cursor is in the location bar, then typing Ctrl+K does not take
focus to the search toolbar. This occurs regardless of whether focus was placed
on location bar with mouse or keyboard.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on Location bar
2. Press Ctrl+K
3.

Actual Results:  
Did not move to search toolbar

Expected Results:  
Moved focus to search toolbar (as in Windows version).

Windows version handles this fine. I am using KDE3.0.5
