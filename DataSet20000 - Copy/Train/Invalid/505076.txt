Separate Quicktime popup windows not working in Firefox but work in IE
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

An example on the above URL.  If you click on any of the "View Video" links and nothing happens.  If you try this in Internet Explorer, it opens up another window with a Quicktime window. Also, if I right click and select "Open Link in a new Window", nothing happens.  If I can right click and select "open Link in New Tab", it will just open the same window in a new tab.  In other instances, I have had it open the Quicktime video in a new tab but then there are no controls to pause/start the video.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on link that should open a Quicktime video window
2. If you hover over the link, it shows the url address on lower left
3. If you click on the link, nothing happens
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens

Expected Results:  
It should open a Quicktime video in a separate window


This problem started with 3.5 (it worked before).  Was not fixed with 3.5.1. I was hoping this problem would be solved in 3.5.1 but it wasn't and this is a biggy for me.
