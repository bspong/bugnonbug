double refresh causes XSS
To repro, paste the URL included into the address bar and press go. Once google loads, press OK on the alert box and you will be shown the current location and cookie. For some reason, I could only get this to work when the PoC was in the form of a javascript: page and only when the url was pasted directly into the address bar.
