external protocol handlers and privacy

some people are trying to hide their ip address when browsing.
a poor man solution is tor (tor.eff.org) and http proxy on localhost.

most of the traffic is tunneled via tor.

external protocols reveal the ip:
sftp://server
<img src="sftp://server">

how to reproduce:
configure tor and http proxy, set proxy.
start
tcpdump 'host server'
visit a page containing <img src="sftp://server">
tcpdump shows connection to 'server' which means that the traffic is not
tunneled via tor.

trunk gives security error.
