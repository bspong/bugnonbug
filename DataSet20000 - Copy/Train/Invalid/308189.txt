on the page: http://myspace.com/fox186 or many other pages which include css
coding; firefox 1.5 beta 1 and Mozilla 1.7.11 dont seem to be able to read it
properly, stuff seem to be out of order and mixed together, the same problem
occured in the previous versions of both softwares

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://myspace.com/fox186
2. look at the tables on the left of the page or right of the page
3. the code used in one of those tables includes "<div
style="filter:Glow(color=blue,strength=2);height:10px;">" and i believe that is
the thing that is causing the page to be out of place

Actual Results:  
tables seem to be out of place and squished together, some even include the
css/html code directly viewed in the tables

Expected Results:  
viewed the tables normally (works fine in internet explorer and msn explorer)
