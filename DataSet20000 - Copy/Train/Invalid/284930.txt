At the website https://practicum-web.aii.avans.nl/rvdwestela/compressie/ you see
a rendered HTML page (the server is secure btw). It was rendered from a PDF
file. As PDF documents are created for printing purposes I find reading it (the
HTML one) in FireFox not preferred. But when opening this site in IE, you will
see that there is a spacing between the two PNG background images, so they tend
to look like pages, which I find much nicer to read from. I don't know if it is
desireable to change this (as it can affect other elements in the browser) but
if it can change, it would please me.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to https://practicum-web.aii.avans.nl/rvdwestela/compressie/
2. Look between two pages

Actual Results:  
No Images spacing between two background images.

Expected Results:  
A little gap between two PNG background images would improve readability.
