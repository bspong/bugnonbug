Firefox x64 fails to start unless I reboot
User-Agent:       Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 6.1; U; pl) Presto/2.7.62 Version/11.00
Build Identifier: 20110301030203

After exiting firefox (pretty much any nightly), I can start it again only after a reboot. When I try to launch it, the process appears (takes up around 7-15MB, however always the same RAM), uses 0-2% CPU for a while and disappears after a few seconds.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install a fresh firefox with new profile
2. Start firefox
3. Exit firefox
4. Try to launch firefox again
Actual Results:  
Firefox failed to start, nothing happens, a crash is logged to windows log

Expected Results:  
Normal start of Firefox

I'm attaching the XML extract from Windows system logs, Process Monitor files with monitored events of the firefox.exe process and a screencast
