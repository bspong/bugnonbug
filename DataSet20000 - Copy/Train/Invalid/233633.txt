firebird bookmarks lost on updating to firefox 0.8
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7

after updating to mozilla firefox 0.8 via windows installer, the old bookmarks
of firebird were lost. I think this may be because the old profile (at document
and settings>application data>..) was updated to a new profile. not sure because
I didn't check it before updating, and I don't remember the random name of the
.slt folder.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. unzip/install mozilla firebird 0.7
2. use it, make some bookmarks
3. now install mozilla firefox 0.8
4. voila! the bookmarks are lost

Actual Results:  
bookmarks from mozilla firefox were lost

Expected Results:  
bookmarks from firebird should have been retained
