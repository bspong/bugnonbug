Using the spell check on a text area, it does not trigger the javascript onchange event. Enough said.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load form with bad spelling
2.Correct spelling using firefox spell checker
3.Button that is enabled by change of form element is not enabled because onchange even is not called when spell checker updated form element
Actual Results:  
No onchange event trigger, no result other than spelling corrected as expected.

Expected Results:  
Called the onchange event when the spell checker altered the contents of the text area.
