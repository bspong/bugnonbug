User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; fr; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5
Build Identifier: Firefox/1.5.0.1

Automatic update while I was surfing on the web with FF 1.5.
I close FireFox and reopen it : Can't access to any server with FF, OK with IE
I try to uninstall 1.5.0.1 : not possible, firefox.exe stay in memory, can't stop it.
I restart my pc : same problem, can't kill firefox.exe (in memory before I used it)
My solution for the moment : clean all "mozilla firefox" with regedit, delete all of "mozilla firefox" in Program Files and reinstall firefox 1.5
