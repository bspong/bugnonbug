Do you want Firefox to save your tabs for the next time it starts?
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

This function does not appear to be functioning properly.  It prompts me every time I close Firefox, but if I choose to "Save and Quit," the next time Firefox is started, I get nothing but a blank browser.  The tabs that were "saved" don't reopen nor do my home pages.  And there's nothing in the history.  I have to hit the home button to open my home pages.  If I choose not to save the open tabs when closing, then the next time I restart, the home pages open just fine.  However, just to clarify, the home pages are not the issue.  The issue is that the save tabs for next restart is not functioning, no matter what sites I am on.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open random sites in tabs
2.Close firefox and choose to "save and quit" when prompted
3.Reopen firefox and NO pages open, not even home pages
Actual Results:  
Blank browser window after restarting

Expected Results:  
I expected my tabs that were open when I closed Firefox to reopen
