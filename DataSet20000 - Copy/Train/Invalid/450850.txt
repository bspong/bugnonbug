Cookies not cleared when Firefox exits

When the privacy preference "Always clear my private data when I close Firefox" is enabled and the "Settings..." dialog has been set to erase cookies, the latest version of Firefox is not clearing cookies when all instances are closed normally. I noticed this after my banks website mysteriously started managing to remember my user name on return visits days apart.

"Show Cookies" confirms this behavior. Having been used to this feature working in past I generally expect that closing out the browser before visiting sites that I don't lend much trust to will erase all tracking cookies, prevent some types of XSS attacks on authenticated sites and so forth. Apparently that is no longer the case.

I have Adblock Plus, Web Developer, and NoScript extensions installed, but I doubt these are interfering with this function of the browser.
