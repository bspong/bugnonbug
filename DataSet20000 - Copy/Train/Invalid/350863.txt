proxy keeps changing to manual connect with unknown HTTP everytime firefox restarts (problem with Hide IP)

Everytime i restart Firefox my Internet isn't working so i checked the Proxies. It gave me this: 140.113.88.165 and 8080 as the port. I have to change it to Auto detect everytime i restart Firefox because the settings keep going back to the same HTTP (140.113.88.165).

Reproducible: Always
