Problem with gzip'ed images when server and browser on same machine

I have a very strange problem with gzip'ed images, I get broken image.
The problem only occurs when all of the following conditions are met:
When the web-server and browser is running on the same machine and the server
sends gzip'ed images to the browser and the page has never been visited before.

The image is display'ed correctly when I refresh the page. I cannot reproduce
the error even if I clear the cache. I only get the error if the page has never
been visited before.

I have run the Camino browser on MacOSX and not seen the same problem.

I can send you a link to the web-server I am running and a test program if you
would like to test this problem. The web-server can be run from the command
prompt so you do not have to install anything in order to run a test case.


Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
You need to run a server on the same machine as the browser and fetch a gzip'ed
file from a page never visited before.
Actual Results:  
Image broken symbol

Expected Results:  
Display the image correctly.
