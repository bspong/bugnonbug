When having the Google toolbar options/login button on the toolbar, the Gmail button doesn't refresh after every other open of Firefox. Using Minefield a month ago worked fine, but within the last few updates it has worked on and off, then the most recent update it broke again. Using the most recent version of Firefox and any version of the google toolbar it doesn't refresh. 
If the options button is not on the toolbar it works fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Having the google toolbar options/login button the toolbar. Gmail button refreshes email.
2. Close Firefox, then reopen. 
3. Gmail button dropdown displays Refresh, which does nothing.
4. Close Firefox and reopen, Gmail button works fine.
Actual Results:  
Gmail button does not refresh email.

Expected Results:  
Gmail button should update gmail messages with every Firefox open.

It used to work fine, but with recent updates to Firefox, any google toolbar version doesn't work. Using Minefield it worked fine until recent updates.
