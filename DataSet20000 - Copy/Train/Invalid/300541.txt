Whatever the web page, when i drag a tab before or after another one, the
content of the previous or the next tab (in the new order) is unreachable (that
means the main windows doesn't refresh when i click this tab).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.While in multiple tabs session, choose one tab
2.Drag it before or after another one
3.Clic on the previous or the next tab (in the new order)

Actual Results:  
The content of the previous or the next tab was unreachable

Expected Results:  
Refresh the main window with the tab content

Reversing the order modification makes the problematic tab reachable again
