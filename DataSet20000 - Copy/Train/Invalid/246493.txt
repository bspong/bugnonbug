Gmail signout, then home button crashes firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

The following sequence repeatably crashes firefox.

1. Start firefox.
2. Sign in to gmail (in this case, as a remembered long-term session).
3. Hit gmail's "sign out" link.
4. Hit firefox's home icon.
<crash>

I get the Apple crash reporter, but not sure how to extract that for this entry.
 Let me know, if needed.
