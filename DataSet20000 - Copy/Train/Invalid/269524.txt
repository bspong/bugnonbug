Does not import bookmarks from MSIE or Safari on first launch, cannot import later.

When I installed Firefox and launched it for the first time, no bookmarks were
imported. If it is supposed to present a dialog asking which bookmarks to import
if there are multiple browsers, it did not do that. When I tried File -> Import
-> Bookmarks, the dialog appeared but no other browsers were listed, so that the
Next button, although enabled, did not function.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install a frech copy of Firefox.
2. Launch it. No bookmarks are imported.
3. Choose File -> Imoirt -> Bookmarks. No other browsers are presented to import
from.

Actual Results:  
As described above.

Expected Results:  
Should have imported some browser's bookmarks on first launch, should have
listed other installed browsers for manual import.
