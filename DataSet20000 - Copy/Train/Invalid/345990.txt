The Script Not Responding dialog box in FF 1.5.0.4 pops up even when firefox is minimized. This isn't inherently bad, but there's nothing in that window to indicate that it actually belongs to Firefox, and not whatever else you're doing. I was, in a curious coincidence, working with a shell script in a putty window when that dialog came up informing me that my script had stopped responding, which was sort of wierd.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a site that generates that warning, and minimize FF
2. work on something else
3.

Actual Results:  
The dialog appears in front of whatever you're working on.

Expected Results:  
Ideally, it would either not appear until you reopened your FF window, or the dialog would contain some indication that it belongs to the browser.
