Firefox (had 1.0.3 I believe) asked me to upgrade to 1.0.4, now I can't see anything...
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

I was prompted to upgrade to 1.0.4 which I eagerly did, but now firefox can't 
see any websites at all.  I open internet explorer (yuck!) and it does fine, 
so it's nothing with my network...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Accepted notice from Firefox to get/install 1.0.4 update
2. open firefox
3. type in any URL, click on bookmarks, etc.
Actual Results:  
Can't access any websites that can be accessed on my same machine by internet 
explorer.

Expected Results:  
Let me use the web?!?

Nothing at all out of the ordinary...
