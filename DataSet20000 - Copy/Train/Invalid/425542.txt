When I click a Text or anything that I'm not supposed be able to click, it acts as if its Notepad and has the text line thing, I can't use Page Down/Up or Home/End or the Arrowkeys with this Bug.

Like if I'm at Google
Google Search Bar: [insert search] if I click the part where I can't write it acts as if I can, but I really can't it just shows I can. So this screws Pgdn,pgup, home and end functions cause they all just goto the Text Line Bar thing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I was just using Firefox
2. Then it started to happen
3. Now I can't do many things because I don't know how to get rid of it.
Actual Results:  
Nothing, it still happened, this is either a Glitch, a Bug, or Firefox starting to hate me.

Expected Results:  
It should've acted normally, without the Text Line where it supposed be.

...Firefox 2.0.0.13, PC/Desktop, and it randomly started to happen. How do I change Theme?
