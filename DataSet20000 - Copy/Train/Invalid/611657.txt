Firefox not recognizing changes in URL (no history, refresh does nothing, url bar never updates)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b7) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b7
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b7) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b7

Firefox no longer recognizes that I am navigating between webpages. The URL/location bar does not reflect the current url (or any url for that matter) and always shows 'Go to a website', even after clicking on links. When on a secure site it will show the site name (e.g. mozilla.org) and show the icon but where the full url should be it still shows 'Go to a website'.

Also, the back button is always disabled even after visiting several links and the reload option under View->Reload is disabled. F5 , Ctrl + R, and Ctrl + F5 all have no affect.

Also, there is no status bar or option to turn it on to see where a link is going to take me. There is an addon bar now but that doesn't show link destination.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open  Firefox
2.Navigate around the internet.
3.Try to see where you are(location bar), where you've been(history), or where you are going(status bar).
Actual Results:  
Location bar never updates, nothing in the history, and there is no status bar anywhere.

Expected Results:  
Location bar shows current URL, back button allows me to go back and has a dropdown for sites I was just at, and the status bar shows the url of where a link will take me.
