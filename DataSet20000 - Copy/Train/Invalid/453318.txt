When I click the mouse button that has been assigned to be 'double-click', with the cursor on the 'go back one page' button, the browser should go back 2 pages with the single click. The previous version, and older ones too, of Firefox did this properly, but the latest one does not... is there some way to set it to response to the 'double-click' mouse button?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Simply advance 2 pages and attempt to go back the initial page with a single 'double-click;.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
When the 'double-click' mouse button is hit, it only goes back one page. I've retried this with the previous version of Firefox and it works as usual so nothing has been altered at my end.
