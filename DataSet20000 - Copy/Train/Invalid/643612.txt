When clicked, images never load from a mootools script that embeds Picasa web albums. Worked in FF3.

This Mootools script works in FF2 and 3, but does not actually load the Picasa web photos in FF4. It opens the light box, begins to expand, then just sits blank and never displays picture.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on any photo.
2. See how photo does not load.

Actual Results:  
A blank white box opens and begins to re-size, but then stops and never displays photo.

Expected Results:  
The window should re-size and display the photo which was clicked on. Check it out in FF3 to see how it used to work.
