Selecting a new theme (not default) for Firebird causes the window contents to
bounce up and down inside the client area.

Changing the icon size for the toolbar will usually cause this to occur, as well.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select Tools->Options->Themes
2. Select a non default theme
3. Press 'OK'
4. Watch page contents start to bounce.

Actual Results:  
Window contents (web page) bounces up and down in client area.

Expected Results:  
Window contents shouldn't bounce.

While the contents are bouncing, it looks like the status bar isn't staying the
same size, either. It almost looks like the status bar is constantly changing
height up and down, causing the window contents to bounce.
