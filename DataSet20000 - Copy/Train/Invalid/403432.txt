I searched through dozens of Bugzilla posts but still didn't see one that matched my inquiry, so I apologize if this has already been addressed. - -
I customized my toolbar by going to view/toolbars/customize.  I successfully grabbed and dragged several tools to the navigation toolbar. Then I wanted to undo this and clicked the button “standard” (in the customize-window). Now if I view the navigation toolbar, I get a duplicate address and search bar. No way to remove the doublettes! In the contrary, trying to fix the problem by clicking the “standard”-button again, I got now three address and search bars! 
Can anybody help me? Thanks and sorry, my English is not very good. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Customize the navigation toolbar with drag and drop.
2.Press "standard" in the customize window to undo. 
3.You get now two buttons "address bar", two "search bar", two "home", two "back" and so on.
4.Press "standard" to undo again.
5.You get now THREE buttons "address bar", THREE "search bar", THREE "home", THREE "back" and so on.
6.Trying remove the triples by hand from the toolbar with drag and drop fails.
Actual Results:  
I've got a very full toolbar with triple tools, the tools very narrow by each other, and some tools disappear at the right side (can't be seen). 

Expected Results:  
I want to be able to remove all tools from the toolbar I don't need.
