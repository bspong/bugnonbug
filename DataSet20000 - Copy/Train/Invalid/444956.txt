I have found that a lot of websites are telling me to upgrade to a newer version of firefox. I have. 4 times. I can't remember all the websites (there have been a lot) but my email (MSN/Hotmail from Qwest) does EVERY time. However, I can click on "go to inbox anyway" and I can still see my email. But next time I log on, it will tell me to upgrade again. 
Also, I have found a lot of websites that crash firefox. When you restore the session, some will then allow you to navigate, whereas other will not. Particularly, the Comcast WebChat... it crashes every time. 
This is kind of obnoxious. I want the previous version of firefox back... I never had any problems with it!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
attempting to connect to Comcast's web chat
Actual Results:  
firefox crashes

Expected Results:  
chatting with a Comcast rep.
