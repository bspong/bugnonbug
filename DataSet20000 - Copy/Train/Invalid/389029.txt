busy data transfer ring thingy continually runs when not in safe mode.

I recently upgraded to Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.5) Gecko/20070713 Firefox/2.0.0.5 from previous version.

I recently noticed that the browser continues to let the little circle in the top right corner of the window run long after all content has been received.  (apparently)

I have tried several websites with the same results.

The type of action makes me concerned about visiting web pages with this browser since I'm not expecting to see the "downloading/busy/data transfer" continually running.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open up web browser to any home page - continues to run
2.  Change URL - continues to run
3.  Start browser in Safe Mode - busy indicator stops when network traffic stops.
Actual Results:  
transfer indicator continues to run

Expected Results:  
transfer indicator stops when page has loaded
