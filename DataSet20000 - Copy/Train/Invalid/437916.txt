If Firefox is left up (ie not closed first) when the machine suspends (to RAM) on Windows Vista Home Premium SP1(32 bit), after a period of time in suspend, spontaneously restarts.  When Vista comes back up it reports having 'recovered from a serious error'.  The session restore works fine and the pages restore to where they were.  I do not have an exact amount of time as to how long it takes before it causes the machine to crash but it is approximately 30-60 minutes.  The machine suspends without problem when Firefox is closed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open up Firefox.
2.  Place the machine in suspend.
3.  Wait 30-60 minutes.
Actual Results:  
The machine crashes while suspended.

Expected Results:  
It should not be crashing.

This problem is not new in RC2, but has been around since at least Beta 5. However, I did not trace down the exact cause (believing it to be general Vista instability) until last week.
