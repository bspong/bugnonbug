In the latest nightly the favicon in adressbar was replaced by #identity-container (e.g. the box that indicates the current domain you are viewing page on), which now doesn't show you the process of searching for the typed into the addressbar words through history.
Old behavior was so: you type anything in the addressbar and the search begins and the favicon turns into rotating arrows, which will disappear when the search is finished.
And now users can't get know whether the search is finished or not.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type anything into address bar.
Actual Results:  
Search starts, but the user doesn't get informed whether it is in process or it has already stopped.

Expected Results:  
Search starts and the user gets informed whether it is in process or it has already stopped.

This bug appeared since yesterday's nightly build's out, where the new feature (#identity-container) landed.
