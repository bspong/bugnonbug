When I Switched to save mode. This problem isn't there. I've tried disabling Add-ons on at a time, to no avail. It's just very annoying. It doesn't seem to effect browsing in any way.

I have the same Add-ons and version of Firefox on my two other pc's which works fine.

I am running Windows7 x64. This is the only thing I can think of at this time.
