Simple test to run. Go to www.switchboard.com and for the category enter 'guitar' and the location enter in a zip code (in my case, 91411).

The output shows that there are results, but no results are displayed.

This happens on both WinXP and Mac OS X 10.5.6 (probably Linux as well). If I use the latest version of Safari on the Mac, the search results are displayed. If I used IE 6 on XP, the results are displayed.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to www.switchboard.com
2.enter 'guitar' for the category and 91411 as the zip for the location
3.hit search and you WON'T see any search results, yet the page will show that there are evidently about 82 hits.
Actual Results:  
Missing results.

Expected Results:  
A list of the first 10 businesses.
