Firefox crashes on some pages with flash. Unable to kill/do anything

While opening some sites using Flash firefox hangs. It looks like this:
http://public.mar.lt/iloveit.jpg
I'm unable to kill it. It happens with all browsers so its probably Flash fault.

The actual file that crashed flash was http://public.mar.lt/viewer.swf . It's not crashing at the moment (probably because broadcast is over)

I tried running only that one file with direct link and Flash crashed in all browsers. All browsers are like firefox on this situation except IE that after taskkill hides from taskbar but it remains in process list.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to site with flash
2. See how firefox hangs
Actual Results:  
Firefox hanged

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have shown that Flash plugin has crased and it needs to restart or something. The really anoying thing is not the crash but that firefox hangs, it remains in taskbar and you're unable to kill it. Only restart helps.
