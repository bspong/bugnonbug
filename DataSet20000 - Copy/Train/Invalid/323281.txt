While reading the text, I tend to mark the sentence/paragraph I read. When selectiong the 4th paragraph, the browser segfaults.

This have happend to me with our sites as well, which has Hebrew text. I didn't notice this kind of behaviour with English text.

The html of the page, is a long paragraph with several BRs to make it look like several paragraphs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://www.notes.co.il/yariv/15175.asp (notice the page is in Hebrew)
2. Double click a few (4-5) times on words in the 4th paragraph so the whole line will be selected.


Actual Results:  
Firefox segfaulted.

Expected Results:  
The whole line/paragraph to be selected.
