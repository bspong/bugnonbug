Flash does not appear to work on FF 1.5 at the "GlideDigital" (and probably most others, too). Does not work on my XP SP2 platform. When I clikc the "login" button, the message that Flash 7.0 or greater is required" is displayed briefly, then a blank page is displayed. The login popup is not displayed. I had previously installed Flash 8.0.

This works properly in the IE 6.0 browser.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.glidedigital.com/index.html
2. Click "login"
3. Verify that warning message is displayed briefly, but no login screen is dsplayed. 

Actual Results:  
no login screen is displayed, just a blank page

Expected Results:  
the login screen should appear.
