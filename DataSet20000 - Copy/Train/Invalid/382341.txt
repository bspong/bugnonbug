reload times differ between 'reload' button and re-entering the URL

See for example http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki, but this behaves the same with other sites

- type http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki into the URL bar. page loads making 26 requests (seen with firebug)
- put the cursor in the url bar and just hit enter. page loads making 17 requests. 0.7 seconds to load
- hit 'reload' (no shift or anything like that). page loads making 26 requests. 4.16 seconds to load

In other sites, where caching is more tuned, this is much worse:
- in cnn.com, first time access makes 199 requests, hitting the url again makes 35 requests (5.2 seconds), 'reload' makes 191 (13.2 seconds) requests

Same behavior in -safe-mode and new profile

I think reload should be the same as re-entering the URL. If I want to truely reload everything (because I'm a site developer), I can do this with shift-reload.

Note: the revalidate Cache-Control directive is not the issue here, other sites that don't use this show the same behavior
