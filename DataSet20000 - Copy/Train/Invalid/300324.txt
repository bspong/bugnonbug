Cannot add a new search engine. Cannot judge it.

Simply nothing happens when I click in new search engines to add them. I can't
judge them either. I tried closing and opening Firefox again. I tried rebooting.
Everytime I click in the new search engine to add it, nothing happens. Even I
can't see the mouse arrow changing to "thinking" or "busy" status. I tried to do
it from the main page (http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/central.html),
then  I tried from (http://mycroft.mozdev.org/download.html), then I tried from
(http://mycroft.mozdev.org/quick/imdb.html). Then I tried with many different
examples (imdb, wikipedia, askjeeves, etc). Nothing happens when I click.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to (http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/central.html)
2. Go to "add new search engines"
3. Click on the name (imdb, wikipedia, etc)

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens

Expected Results:  
add the engine to the search toolbar. I still keep the original six.
