Firebird normally won't highlight text, but it does sometimes
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030529 Mozilla Firebird/0.6

If I normally start Firebird, it won't highlight text if I hold down left click
and move the cursor (caret browsing or not). However, if I open Firebird through
a link from Thunderbird, it allows me to highlight--until I bring another window
to the foreground, where it goes away.

Caret browsing allows me to navigate (through arrow keys) the cursor to what I
want to highlight, and holding shift lets me do it. However, this is inconvenient.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firebird
2. Navigate to a web page with text
3. Attempt to highlight

Actual Results:  
Nothing happened.
