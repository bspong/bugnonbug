The Big Fish Games Toolbar displays as a blank, blue line in the latest Nightly build, but loads fine in Firefox 3.6.  I am not sure if this is a Minefield issue or if Big Fish Games just needs to update their toolbar code to recognize Firefox version 4.  Sometimes toolbar companies won't update until official browser release.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download Big Fish Games Toolbar from the above website.
2. Display the toolbar in Minefield using the Options menu or right-clicking on the top portion of Minefield (above the address bar).
3. The toolbar will load as a blank, blue line.  Firefox 3.6 displays it correctly with buttons (new game releases, etc).
Actual Results:  
Toolbar does not load elements.

Expected Results:  
Toolbar should not be blank.
