Javascript error using "event.cancelBubble": has no properties
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)

I use Hotmail as Emailacount. (www.hotmail.com)
Its not possible to use Firefox with Hotmail.
I got many javaerrors: x has no properties.

Example: Delete Mails from overview:
1) marking mails to delete
2) cklick "Delete"
3) Firefox reads more data and reports "done"
-> no mail deletet

The call used by "delete": Subm('delete',0,1)

function Subm(act,first,dosub,e)
{
  if (act=='delete')
  {
    if (!e) var e=window.event;
    e.cancelBubble=true;
  }
...

The error (e has no properties) occures in line: e.cancelBubble=true;
As result to this error, no mails will be deleted.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use www.hotmail.com for mails
2. selete some mails for delete
3. click "delete"

Actual Results:  
Nothing !!! Same mails as bevor.

In Javascript console:
