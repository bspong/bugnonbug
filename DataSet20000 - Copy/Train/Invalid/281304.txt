Fails to render a multi-table page properly

Rendering works ok in IE, however when rendering it by FireFox the middle part
of the page (content) somehow displays PART of the background picture of a cell
that was part of ANOTHER table in the left pane table cell.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I have put a test page in the provided URL
2. Point your browser to http://www.coralys.com/Test/default.html using IE 6
3. Do the same with FireFox 1.0

Actual Results:  
OK on IE, On FireFox it displays an image from a DIFFERENT table cell somewhere
else on the page as well as the place where it was supposed to be

Expected Results:  
Not display the background image for that cell, after all there is no background
image specification on that cell (See HTML code, the part marked in HTML
comments as "Middle Pane")
