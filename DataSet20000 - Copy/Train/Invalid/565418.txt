now that add-ons manager has gone into a tab, it seems logic to do the same for other parts of FF UI

case
Open FF and crash
after breakpad let FF restart with 1 tab, containing  about:sessionrestore
select what you want (restore or new)
delete the "about:sessionrestore-tab" and open the (restored/new) session in the current window
