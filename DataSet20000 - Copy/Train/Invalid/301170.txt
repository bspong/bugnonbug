I've used this program for a while the 1.0 version. Then suddently i cannot 
open the file. I can see the program "firefox.exe" when i press ctrl + alt + 
del. but no window opens up. Then i downloaded the newer version hoping that 
it would fix my problems. 1.0.5.v but its the same problem.

Reproducible: Always
