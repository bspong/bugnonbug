In Help About Firefox under Firefox 3.0.10 (Windows XP) the first sentence starts "(C) 1998-2008 contributors" despite that this build was created in the year 2009.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Help menu
2. Click "About Mozilla Firefox"
3. Read the screen that comes up. Its the first line below the version number.
Actual Results:  
It starts "(C) 1998 - 2008..."

Expected Results:  
As this build was created this year (ie 2009), I would expect it to read (C) 1998 - 2009

Would recommend modifying this second date to use the year of the build date rather than the fixed value.
This way it becomes self updating as versions change, but won't update at the start of a new year until a build issued that year has been installed.
