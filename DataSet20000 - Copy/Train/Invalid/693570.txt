STR:
1. Launch Firefox on a clean profile
2. Create 2 groups with at least one tab in each one
3. In one of the groups detach/attach a tab to the tab strip

Expected result:
In step 3, the content of the tab should not move

Actual result:
In step 3, the content of the tab moves one pixel line (up when detaching, and down when attaching)

*Notes:
-> This bug is a regression from the behavior before the landing of the bug 455694 (implementation of the feature Tab Animation)
-> The issue is visible on Windows only. The content doesn't move when detaching/attaching tabs on Linux or Mac
