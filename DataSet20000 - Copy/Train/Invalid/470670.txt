I use FF 3.1 BETA Hebrew Lang. 
Speed Dial is my homepage. After some time while surfing, I open a new tab (speed dial as the default) and when I try to click on one of the boxes it doesn't react (and so are the rest). Only when I open another new tab the speed dial page reacts.
I don't use any tab specific addon.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open browser
2. Open multiple tabs directly from the dials
3. Close all tabs/open a new homepage (speeddial by default) tab.
4. Click on a preset box/dial.
Actual Results:  
nothing happens

Expected Results:  
open a new preset site.
