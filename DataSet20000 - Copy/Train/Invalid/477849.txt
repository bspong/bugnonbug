I have tried everything I can think and even consulted a few IT friends.  Since I started using Moz FF about 2-3 wks ago, downloading is a strange and often interrupted process now.   My biggest challenge right now is Google Adwords Editor and Adobe Flash Player.  I couldn't find any answers in the bugzilla forums.  Do you have any suggestions for me?  I wonder if I have some setting on this comp that I'm unaware of.   By the way, I've tried Explorer and those programs won't download either.
I'll take anything you can suggest.  Thanks so much.

Reproducible: Always
