Location bar overflow ellipsis not removed if URL is shortened
The overflow ellipsis of the location bar is not removed if an overly long url is shortened.

Reproduce:
1. Visit a page with a long url (or add some characters to the end of an url and click somewhere else to defocus the location bar) => ellipsis correctly displayed
2. remove some characters to make the url fit in the location bar
3. defocus the location bar => the ellipsis is still being displayed and even persists when pressing enter.  The tooltip still shows over the location bar also.
