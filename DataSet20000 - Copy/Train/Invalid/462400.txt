Cannot launch long URLs to Firefox from Adobe PDF file
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.16) Gecko/20080702 (CK-IBM) Firefox/2.0.0.16
Build Identifier: Firefox 2.0.0.16

Error is received when clicking on link in a PDF file when the URL is more than 232 characters.  Receive the Adobe error "An error occurred while trying to communicate with the web browser.".  If IE is confired as default browser, works fine with IE.  Sample URL to try is this:  http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/index.wss?buttonpressed=DET002PT004&page=8&user+type=Regular&panelurl=index.wss%3Fbuttonpressed%3DNAV002PT090&paneltext=Announcement+letter+search&DET002PEF002=&DET002PEF003=&DET002PEF001=5724-I21&DET002PEF004=&al_date_group_index=DET002PT016&ALDATEGROUP=DET002PT016&al_date_index=DET005PEF031&DET002PGL002=DET005PEF031&det003pef003=EXTERNAL&coincidence_index=0&submit.x=54&submit.y=12

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Create link in a PDF file that is longer than 232 characters
2.  Configure Firefox as default browser
3.  Click link to see failure
Actual Results:  
"An error occurred while trying to communicate with the web browser." error received in Acrobat Reader.  If Internet Explorer is browser, do not get this error.

Expected Results:  
Long URLs work if invoked or pasted directly into Firefox.  Should work from PDF links also but don't.

You may need to collaborate with Adobe on this issue, but I'm posting to Firefox since it works with Internet Explorer.
