The page (www.adobe.com) reloads an infinite number of times. This causes the
cursor to flicker, and entering data becomes tricky, since focus seems to be
lost at some times. One "walkaround" is to click another tab, and then go back
to the previous one (adobe.com). This causes the cursor flickering to stop.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.adobe.com
2. Open up a new tab
3. Select the new tab, and then go back to the "adobe" tab

Actual Results:  
After 1, the cursor starts flickering, and the page is reloading itself an
infinite number of times. After 3, everything is fine.

Expected Results:  
The page should only be reloaded once.
