Accessing a file:/// resource using + characters for spaces doesn't work.

When accessing a local resource which has one or more spaces in the file name,
you should, to the best of my knowledge, be able to substitute those spaces with
+ characters.  However, this causes Firefox to be unable to find the resource.

Note that this only applies to *local* resources.  Here is an example of a
remote URL that contains + characters in place of spaces, which Firefox has no
trouble with: http://snipsnap.org/space/Foo+Bar+Baz

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to a file with spaces in the name, substituting + characters for
those spaces; example: 'file:///c:/foo+bar' for 'c:\foo bar'.
Actual Results:  
I observed Firefox report a 'not found' error.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should've opened 'c:\foo bar'.

Work-around: use %20 in place of any spaces.
