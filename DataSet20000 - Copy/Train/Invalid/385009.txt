This happens on a system with a Radeon R300 graphics card and the open source R300 driver.

Whenever X is started with radeon's MergedFB turned on and activated pseudo-xinerama support, firefox doesn't show the main window. Besides that, it seems to run normal. Even other startup windows are shown, like the question whether to restore the session or extension upgrade information.

If pseudo-xinerama is not activated (i.e. MergedFB in clone mode) or MergedFB is disabled alltogether, the problem does not exist. Also, it is irrelevant whether a second display is actually connected, or not.

No other application besides firefox is affected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start X with open source Radeon driver and enable pseudo-xinerama
2. Start firefox

Actual Results:  
No main window is shown

Expected Results:  
Main window
