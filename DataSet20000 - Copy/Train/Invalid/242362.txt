XML error when remotely scanning images as TIFFs with HP PSC 2500

The HP PSC 2500 series multifunction device has a network scanning feature.  I
am able to scan images as JPEGs, but when I attempted to scan an image as a
TIFF, this error message was displayed:

XML Parsing Error: not well-formed
Location: chrome://mozapps/content/downloads/unknownContentType.xul
Line Number 1, Column 1:

<funnycharacter>
^

The funny character which is displayed in the error message is a graphical
character resembling an upper case T rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Install and configure an HP PSC 2500 device.
2.  Connect to http://printer.name/ with Firefox.
3.  Select "Scan" from the left-hand frame.
4.  Select "TIFF" from the left-hand side of the center frame.
4.  Select the button marked "Scan" on the bottom edge.
Actual Results:  
After I performed the steps above, a new Firefox browser window appears, and
moments later, a small yellowish window with a title-bar of "firefox-bin" is
created, containing the error message described in "Details".

Expected Results:  
The version of Firefox I have on Windows -- Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT
5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8) -- asks me if I'd like to save
the image.

The Windows box mentioned above has the QuickTime plugin installed, which might
make a difference.  I don't think the Unix box does.
