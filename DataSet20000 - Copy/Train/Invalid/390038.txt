Ff3 reimplements "Text Zoom" feature to behave like Opera "Page Zoom".

But the new Text Zoom - which zooms whole page - has a serious problem: it zooms whole page.

Origin of "Text Zoom" feature lies in habit of (let's call them) web designers to set very very small fonts on web sites they are responsible for, making them pretty much unusable. With "Text Zoom" it was still possible to read the web site content at font size suitable for anybody's else eyes.

Newer "Page Zoom" breaks that. It zooms whole page what not only increases font size (and consequently length of the page) - but also increases width of the displayed page.

I have tested several suits of HTML documentation I use on daily/weekly basis and most of them become unusable because page width doesn't fit my screen anymore. In 3 out of 5, zooming does increase page width which makes document practically unreadable.

It works perfectly with Ff2.x. But in 3.x - not anymore.

Thus, an option to allow for "only text" zooming - iow "Increase Font Size" - would be very very desirable.

P.S. Unfortunately I cannot supply openly available examples. http://FT.com/ could have been an example - but they have recently started using readable fonts, so I normally need to zoom it only once (single Ctrl-+) and page width still fits my 1280x1024.

Reproducible: Always
