FireFox crashes when you try to log-in to your bank account with BankID.

BankID is a electronic-identification system. Has been in use in Sweden for like 4 years at least. And it is planed to be more widely spread on goverment webpages and banking websites. It's like a personal identification that you can carry around with your USB-memory.

Far as I know Handelsbanken ( http://www.handelsbanken.se/ ) has most problems with this system. They are using a system developed by Nexussafe ( http://www.nexussafe.com ) and the software is called "Nexus Personal". There are some other developers out there for this e-id system so Nexussafe isn't the only one. Gladfully.

And this "BankID" system is based on Java. The "BankID" system always requires the latest Java version to be installed on your system. I thought I should mention this.

Errors 1:
I have done some research and found out that the Nexus Personal software that you have to install on your system(client). Installs a plug-in to FireFox. This plug-in can be nasty and load a *.ngp file in this folder: "C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Application Data\Personal\store". It can load about 10 times in a second that *.ngp file. This is when FireFox is running. Or if FireFox isn't running the the "Nexus Personal" does this or sometimes even both off them at the same time. 10+10 = 20 times in a second.

Well it's clear to me that the Nexus Personal has some coding issues. But this problem doesn't appear all the time.

Errors 2:
For some people FireFox crashes everytime they try to log-in with "BankID". Or for some people it does from time to time. This crashing problem appears on Windows os and Mac os. Even with Safari Nexus Personal crashes sometimes.

This problem has been live from:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; sv-SE; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11
to
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; sv-SE; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Error 3:
If you can log-in. Then there can be a problem for FireFox to remember the certificate.

This problem appeared last with:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; sv-SE; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11


Common error messages:
1. You don't have a secure connection.
2. Page cannot be loaded cause there where a error with authenticating the received data.
3. The connection was reseted.
4. Can't find the certificate. (This can be problem if the user hasn't received the cert from Handelsbanken from one off their offices).
5. Security software(Nexus Personal) couldn't start. 
6. Error code 12227 - http://eleg.handelsbanken.se has received a wrong or unexpected data.
7. http://eleg.handelsbanken.se don't support the SSL certificate. Error code: ssl_error_unsupported_cert_alert .
8. Cannot open page http://www.handelsbanken.se/bestallabankid (It is here you order a new "BankID").
9. Couldn't find server. (It could have been offline?).

All these problems appears on Mac os too as I sayed before. But not on Linux cause there isn't any "BankID" system for Linux yet. As I know.

Why I'm report this bug is cause there are many who has a "BankID" and has "Handelsbanken" as their bank. Like my work and I have to be the network administrator. And my works administrator office complains always about the problems with this "BankID"... >.< I think there are many other network administrators who has the same problems as I do and won't let the users to use Internet Explorer. I have strictly forbidden the use of Internet Explorer cause off all the vulnerabilities.


But I think all off these problems/errors is caused by "Nexus Personal". But I thought you guys wanted to know about this problem. Because this has been a big issue for a long time. And I know that people has stopped using FireFox because off these problems.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just try to log-in with "BankID" and hope for the best.
2. If you have been lucky to get loged-in then try to order a new BankID.
3. It should have crashed by now.
