If you have a 2 head display and open a firefox.  Then open another firefox window and move it to the other screen.  When you go to quit firefox on the second window it will bring up the quit for firefox on the first window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox, make a few tabs
2.Open another Firefox, with no tabs
3.On the second Firefox (the one with no tabs) go to File -> Quit
4.This will bring up the quit menu box for the original Firefox with the number of tabs you created.
Actual Results:  
It closes the wrong Firefox.

Expected Results:  
It should open a quit menu for the Firefox you clicked on File -> Quit.  Then allow you to quit that firefox.

You cat press Alt-F4 or click on the X in the top right corner and it will close the correct firefox.  This is really a clone of 234819 which was closed incorrectly because it got linked to a different bug.  When that bug was closed it got closed as well but the issue is still there.
