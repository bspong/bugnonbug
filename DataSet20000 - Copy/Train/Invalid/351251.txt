Removing firefox-toolbar.png from cvs makes nightlies builds crash
firefox-toolbar.png is not used anymore (see bug 299554 comment #12). Removing this from l10n cvs causes nightly build to break. It could be the same for the other removed .png files.
Builds shouldn't break while removing these files.
