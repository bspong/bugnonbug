If a site has multiple RSS feeds, which all use a different type="" value,
Firefox will only allow you to add a random feed, instead of allowing you to
select which feed you want.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Visit any website which uses multiple RSS feeds (Wordpress Blogs) and click on
the RSS icon.

This code would generate this problem:

<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="RSS 2.0"
href="http://www.cavemonkey50.com/feed/" />
<link rel="alternate" type="text/xml" title="RSS .92"
href="http://www.cavemonkey50.com/feed/rss/" />
<link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" title="Atom 0.3"
href="http://www.cavemonkey50.com/feed/atom/" />

This code works fine, and the drop down which is suppose to appear to allow you
to select which feed you want does:

<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="Subscribe to LaG News"
href="http://lag.cavemonkey50.com/feed/" />
<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="Subscribe to LaG
Podcast" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/LaG" />
Actual Results:  
It appears the Atom feed is usually selected instead of giving you the option to
select which feed you want.

Expected Results:  
Displayed a drop down, allowing you to select a feed.
