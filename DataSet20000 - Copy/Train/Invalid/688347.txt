Steps to reproduce:

Options/Content/color/visited links - change to red.


Actual results:

Not change UNLESS I uncheck "Allow pages to choose their own colors, instead of my selection above."
 
But if I DO uncheck it all the pages render poorly.  This was Marked Fixed but it is not.


Expected results:

It should cause visited links to be red.
I the above mentioned uncheck is done the attached file shows what Google comes up as.
