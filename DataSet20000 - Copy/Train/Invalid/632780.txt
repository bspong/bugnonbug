In some websites, you cannot use the "Back" navigation button of Firefox.

Example for such a website:

http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/566147/top_5_cheapest_countries_in_the_world.html?cat=3

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any website, such as the homepage.

2. Go to a website such as http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/566147/top_5_cheapest_countries_in_the_world.html?cat=3

3. Click the "Back" (Left arrow" button of firefox, or menu History->Back
Actual Results:  
The browser stays at the same website

Expected Results:  
The browser should go to the previous website.

I guess this is caused by some javascript code at the website, however firefox should protect the user from such cases and make the "Back" button usable.
