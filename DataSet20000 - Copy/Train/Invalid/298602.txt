Positioning Javascript does not work in Mozilla with newer Doctypes
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/312.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/312
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1

At the bottom of the page is a floating DHTML menu.  It can work in all browsers without a Doctype or 
an outdated Doctype (HTML 2.0).

It can only work in IE with a current Doctype (HTML 4.0 transitional, strict, XHTML..etc..).

When it has a current doctype, Mozilla is able to display or hide the menu, but it is not able to use 
Javascript to position the menu.

The value window.document.getElementById('aboutnav').top is returnd as blank. not null, or 0, but just 
blank.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add current doctype header to document
2. load page and rollover menu nav at the bottom of page ("Sections")
3.  You can see that the menu is appearing at the top of the page, by quickly scrolling upscreen to see 
the menu near it's default position (0,0)

Actual Results:  
Menu appears a top of screen rather than it's Javascript determined location.

Expected Results:  
Placed the menu directly above the black bar navigation at the bottom of the page.
