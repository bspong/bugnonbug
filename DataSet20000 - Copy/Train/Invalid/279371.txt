Popup blocker disables itself

I have popup blocking enabled.  However, about once every few days, I will see a
popup.  Thinking the site must somehow be on my popup whitelist, I open
Tools->Options->Web Features.  But before I get to the whitelist, I can see that
the checkbox for "Block Popup Windows" is unchecked.  So I recheck it and
everything is fine again.  But later in the week it will happen again, and a
quick check of the options will confirm that it's disabled again.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
My apologies, I'll try to get a URL that consistently does this when I get a chance.

1. Visit certain websites.
2. Popup ads appear.
3. Popup blocking checkbox has become unchecked.

Actual Results:  
Popups displayed.

Expected Results:  
Suppressed display of popups.
