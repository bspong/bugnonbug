When upgrading to newer versions of Firefox from 1.5.0.5 and up (and even 2.0) the internet is non-funtioning
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.5) Gecko/20060719 Firefox/1.5.0.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.5) Gecko/20060719 Firefox/1.5.0.5

The browser simply does not function with Firefox versions 1.5.0.5 and above.  THe settings are all set the same but nothing happens with future versions, I have to use 1.5.0.5 or earlier. It must be some malfunction with Firefox because Internet Explorer works just fine. Also, the setting for automatic program update changes by itself (I always have it set not to automatically update) yet it does by itself anyway and it upgrades to 1.5.0.9 which doesn't function.  Thanks for any insight on the problem. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set Automatic Update ON
2. Let Firefox updrade & install
3. Firefox opens but does not function
Actual Results:  
I can be browsing the internet then Firefox says it automatically updated to 1.5.0.9 and it installs on the next opening of Firefox.

Expected Results:  
when it finishes installing I open it and it's a white page saying website cannot be found. It cannot find any website, browser does not function at all.

It should open up websites just like previous versions of Firefox (1.5.0.5 and below) and function.
