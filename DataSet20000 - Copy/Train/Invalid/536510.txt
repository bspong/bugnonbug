@font-face loaded fonts aren't working.
They do download, have a proper mimetype, and show up in the cache. They are listed in the cache as haveing zero bytes. The @font-face declaration works fine in Chrome. The @font-face loads the font from another domain.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. @font-face on separate domain
2. The font downloads & caches
3. The font is cached at zero bytes and is not showing up in the page.
Actual Results:  
The default fonts from firefox are shown.

Expected Results:  
The @font-face fonts should have loaded, as the markup was correct.
