Firefox 3.1b3 shows the drop-down menus on the bookmarks toolbar and in the window as transparent

When I open a folder or RSS feed on the my bookmark toolbar, the drop down menu is transparent (see linked image) and this is also the case when opening a drop-menu in the window itself (i.e. crtl-click or right-clicking inside the window)

However, this is not the case when opening menus on the top bar

I am on OSX 10.4.11., with shapeshifter running AYOFE.

The same result occurs both with the default theme and with 'chromifox basic'.  It does not occur though when using the 'walnut for firefox' theme.  This leads me to believe that it is something in the resources itself of firefox that's missing, or badly linked too, or something...
