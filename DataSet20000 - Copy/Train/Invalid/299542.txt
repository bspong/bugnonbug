Cache content being saved in a folder different from the profile; breaks pre-Deer Park profiles; may be StumbleUpon or other extension issue

The user profiles & caches have historically been stored here...

C:\Documents and Settings\(username)\Application
Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\(profile name)\(cache)

However, since using the 7-2-2005 nightly for Deer Park, even after purging the
profile content & this new folder, Deer Park still puts all the cache content in
the following folder...

C:\Documents and Settings\(username)\Local Settings\Application
Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\(profilename)\Cache

This also seems to cause inexplicable back button, forward button, and location
bar errors if you don't delete the old profile data beforehand.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download & install the Deer Park 7-2-2005 nightly (I used the ZIP version).
2. Begin surfing different webpages without deleting anything from the profile
folders.

Actual Results:  
Back and forward will have random glitches; address bar may not update to new
sites visited.

Expected Results:  
In the past, upgrading to a nightly in this fashion hasn't caused the errors
described above.
