addons like adblock plus, cookie safe and flashblock (all operating on a per-domain basis) fail to operate for this website when rendered in XML/XSLT to XHTML. When shown as xhtml directly (http://eu.blizzard.com/diablo3/?rhtml=y) the addons work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install (for example) Flashblock
2. set it to block all Flash by default
3. open http://eu.blizzard.com/diablo3/
4. open http://eu.blizzard.com/diablo3/?rhtml=y


Actual Results:  
Flashblock does not show the flash placeholder for the xml-page but does for the xhtml one.

ABP does not show any files except the xsl file on its blockable items list.

Cookie safe does behave as if i were on about:blank, i.e. it doesn't allow me to set any domain-specific options

Expected Results:  
All addons should just operate like on any other website
