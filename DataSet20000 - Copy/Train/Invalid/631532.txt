Can't drag and drop a file into a folder which's lexicographically below/above  it into the folder in two situations
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When I'm in the bookmarks menu,  I click "Name" tab/vertical column.
When the Bookmarks Menu doesn't display ,
"Recent Tags", "Recently Bookmarked", "Get Bookmark Add-ons" in the window,
upon clicking "Name" as mentioned above,
I can't really drag and drop files into a folder above/below it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+B. Open Bookmarks Menu
2. Create a Folder "Firefox". Bookmark a page. Click on "Name" which will give you an interface with ascending/descending order of folders and files in it without the following on the menu interface:
 "Recent Tags", "Recently Bookmarked", "Get Bookmark Add-ons"
3. Now drag and drop a file into a folder
Actual Results:  
Shows a "Not allowed" symbol while trying to drag and drop

Expected Results:  
Should drag and drop file into the folder
