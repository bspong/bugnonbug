Clean up localeVersion mess and use the XUL preprocessor for that
Working on bug 214207, I noticed that mozilla/browser/ and mozilla/toolkit/
currently contain five different localeVersion strings.

This should be cleaned up and set to 1.5b to fit with Seamonkey after the
checkin for bug 214207. Patch will follow in a second.
