Ajax refreshing in gmail causes rendering problem (anti-aliasing?)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050721 Firefox/1.0+

If I leave gmail's Inbox page open for a while (or hit the refresh *link* within
gmail a few times) I notice that my email address at the top of the page seems
to get more and more bold, as well as all the text off the messages directly
below the email address.  If you you hit the actual reload *button* in the
browser, the page goes back to normal.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to GMail Inbox
2. Click on Refresh *link* (within the page) 3 or 4 times

Actual Results:  
Email address is "extra bold", as well as the text of the message titles 

Expected Results:  
Nothing (just displayed the page normally).
