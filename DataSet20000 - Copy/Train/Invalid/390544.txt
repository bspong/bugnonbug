When the visitor clicks on an external link on the left hand side, and then clicks the close button Firefox closes out of the website altogether instead of returning to the website

The external links have been set up using 'blank' to return the visitor to the website on closing out of the external link. This works fine in Internet Explorer. In Firefox the visitor is given two options - Close Tabs or Cancel. Both have virtually the same result - the visitor is not returned to the website he was exploring. I design websites and this means that visitors to my clients' sites are taken away from their site - perhaps 'never to return again' if they are using Firefox and not IE.  This has not always been the case. Was there an update that changed this option. If so, How to I ensure searchers are returned to the page they left when they close out of an external link?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.joansmall.com/articles.htm
2. Click on the Visit my Blog link or any of the previous article links
3. Try to return to the page http://www.joansmall.com/articles.htm (no return arrow, only option is close box which gives you option of Close Tabs or Cancel)
Actual Results:  
Visitors clicking on external links get disconnected from the website they were searching and perhaps will not return.

Expected Results:  
I was closed out of the website.

Returned me to the page I had been exploring.
