Only by using safe mode can I get Firefox to produce a browser window
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.12) Gecko/20101026 Firefox/3.6.12
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.12) Gecko/20101026 Firefox/3.6.12

When clicking on the Firefox icon the browser window does not open,although the program is running inthe processes tab of task manager. Using safe mode I can usually but not always get the bowser window to appear. 
this has only happened in the last few days.

Reproducible: Always
