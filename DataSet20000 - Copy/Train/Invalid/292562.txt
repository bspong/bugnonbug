90% cpu utilization even when Firefox minimized after more than an hour
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: 1.0.3

I don't have a specific URL that this occurs for.  But several times I have had 
to close Firefox using the Task Manager ... when the PC becomes totally 
consumed by Firefox ... even though it is minimized and have not loaded any new 
pages for minutes or even hours.  In these situations Firefox is unresponsive 
and I am unable to determine what caused the instability.  Please advise if and 
what diagnostics I could attempt prior to forceable shutdown by TaskManager.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. So far, I have not observed a predetermined sequence that leads to this 
situation
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
n/a

Expected Results:  
n/a

Please advise what diagnostic precautions I should take either before or after 
a lockup occurs.  Since this happens only occasionally, I have not observed any 
consistent precursor.  

I have seen similar bug reports for Linux, Mac and even WinXP ... but not for 
Win2k (server) ... is this something that is unique to each OS or systemic for 
all OS versions?

Finally, if this not a known bug ... what can I do to help you to nail it down?

Suggestions?
