"Save image as...", "View image" don't work on canvas
We have many charts painted on canvas using the Flot extension to jQuery. We'd like to be able to save these for use in other documents. It turns out that while our charts, when right-clicked, show "Save Images As..." and "View Image" options, but neither works.

They should either work (preferably) or not be there.
