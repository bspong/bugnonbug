Secure bookmarks with port cannot be added properly

This occurred every time I tried to add a bookmark for an internal admin website which was secure and had a port number. Such as an example below:

https://subdomain.doman.com:4321/

In short when I tried to add a bookmark by choosing "Bookmark this Page" or creating a new bookmark in the boomark dialog it did one of the following: created nothing, created a folder with that name, or created a bookmark with the address of the last page which did not have port number. Also, modifying an existing bookmark to have such a web address resulted in very odd behavior where once I went to another website the bookmark address was changed to the page I just visited (which is why the address is now listed as this bugzilla page).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a secure page with a port number (eg. https://subdomain.doman.com:4321/)
2. Ensure the page resolves and loads
3. Try to add a bookmark
Actual Results:  
New bookmark is not added or contains a web address for a page other than the one selected for bookmark.

Expected Results:  
A new bookmark of the address https://subdomain.doman.com:4321/
