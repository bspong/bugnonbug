Viewing a web page containing a flash movie that has an alpha fade or moving images and moving the mouse (pointer) around causes the pointer to be very choppy and 35% - 50% of the time causes the USB Mouse / Keyboard to stop working and requires the USB device to be unplugged and replugged to work again. Program itself does not crash nor does the Flash movie have any problems playing.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load web page with Flash movie that contains alpha fade or moving images.
2.Move mouse around browser window or over Flash Movie.
3.Continue moving mouse until it stops working.
Actual Results:  
Mouse stopped working the first time, keyboard the second.

Expected Results:  
It did exactly what I expected, as always.

I have the following add-ons installed:
- Cache Status 0.7.2
- Firebug 1.05
- IE Tab 1.3.3.20070528
- Talkback 2.0.0.11
- Web Developer 1.1.4

I use a D-Link 7 Port USB 2 hub with all the devices on it.
