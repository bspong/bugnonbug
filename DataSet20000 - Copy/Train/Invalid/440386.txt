The URL http://sg.news.yahoo.com/cna/20080619/tap-354944-231650b.html causes Firefox 3 to freeze forever, i need to end process to close it. So I can't use the "Report Broken Web Site" button, because the browser itself and all instances are frozen the moment I click the link. In firefox 2 the web site works perfectly. Thank you.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:

I have Firefox 3 default instalation with no extras.
