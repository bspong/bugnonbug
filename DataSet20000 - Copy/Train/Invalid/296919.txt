Firefox doesn't understand empty SCRIPT element
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

After making my XHTML 1.0 Strict work in "standards compliance mode" according
to Firefox, it doesn't load JavaScript in "script" elements formatted as follows:
<script type="text/javascript" src="forms/scripts/nifty.js" />
Changing this to the following works:
<script type="text/javascript" src="forms/scripts/nifty.js" ></script>

There are two problems with this:
- The former format is valid XHTML 1.0 Strict, and should pose no problems for
Firefox
- Attempting to output the end tag in XSLT doesn't work, as it is (correctly)
truncated by Xalan

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Generate a valid XHTML page with empty "script" elements referencing
JavaScript files
2. View the page
3. Observe the (lack of) JavaScript functionality
Actual Results:  
Nothing showing that any JavaScript had been loaded. The JavaScript Console
doesn't show any error either...

Expected Results:  
All JavaScript should be activated, and transformed the page accordingly
