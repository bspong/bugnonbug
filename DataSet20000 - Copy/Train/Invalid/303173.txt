Firefox hangs (does not usefully respond) after loading simple page with two empty applet tags
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

When I open a page with this text:
=================================================
<html>
<head><title>V</title></head>
<body>


<applet code="v.class"></applet>
<applet code="v.class"></applet>


</body>
</html>
=================================================

(The applet doesn't exist.)

The "busy/stop" button comes on and stays on.  Even after I stop the page no
other tab can be loaded or reloaded.  Exiting leaves a firefox.exe process
running.  Some features work:  I can create and delete tabs, and closing with
more than one tab gives me a warning (and after I say close the window vanishes
but the process remains).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the specified file.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
No other pages can be loaded.
Exiting leaves a firefox process around.

Expected Results:  
Allowed other pages to be opened.
Not left a hanging process.

I load these extensions:  Adblock (disabling it has no effect on the bug), Image
Zoon, IE View, Web Developer, tabbrowser extensions, googlebar, link visitor,
spellbound and spellbound component.
