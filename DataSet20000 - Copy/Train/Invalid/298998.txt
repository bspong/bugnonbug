Gecko DOM Reference says:

window.parent
Returns a reference to the parent of the current window or subframe.

When you start browser, its window has no parent, has it? So window.parent IMO
should be null. But it isn't and points to window.self.

What confuses me a bit is that MSIE behaves exactly the same way. :o(
Did I get the DOM-Ref wrong?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create page with js-expression (window.parent == window.self).
2. Open that page within a new browser window.

Actual Results:  
Expression is evaluated to TRUE.

Expected Results:  
Expression should be evaluated to FALSE ... ???
