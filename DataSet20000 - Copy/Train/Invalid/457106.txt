A CSS wrapper div has the top margin of its first child div applied to it incorrectly forcing the wrapper div down the body of the page.

Using a standard css technique of centering a wrapping parent div within the body the following incorrect css handling occurs.

If the wrapping div has a child div that has a top margin applied to it the child div's top margin value is applied to the wrapper div.  This forces the wrapper div vertical position within the body to alter by the margin value set.

The wrapper div can be relatively positioned explicitly or have no positioning and this has no effect on the bug.

Adding a height value to the wrapper div has no effect.

The wrapper div can contain as many other divs, with varying positioning techniques, but as long as the first child div is relatively, or default positioned as the first child within the div, the problem remains.

One cure is to add any orphaned text or character element directly into the wrapper div.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Constant with a simple two div page construct.
2.DTD can be xhtml 1.0 strict or transitional.
3.Limited testing for corrections as this behavior is simply an incorrect application of css.
Actual Results:  
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

<title>Untitled Document</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/test.css" media="screen" />
</head>

<body>
<div id="wrapper">something to open the wrapper up
<div id="ban">
<h4>title test</h4></div>
</div>
</body>
</html>

css:

@charset "utf-8";

*{
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
}

body{
background: #000066;
}

#wrapper{
width: 1000px; /* fixed central page width */
position: relative;
margin: 0 auto;
}

#ban{
margin-top: 10px;
}

Expected Results:  
Incorrect application of css positioning of parent div.  Child div still controls top margin of parent if parent does not contain at least one orphaned character.

Wrapper div should remain fixed to the top of the body element.  Child div should move down the wrapper div by the value set in the child's top margin.
