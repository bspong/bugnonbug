I have installed the Forecastfox addon yesterday. Everything was OK. Down on the status bar was forecast for Today, Thursday and Friday. I do not shout down my PC during the week. Today I came to work and there is still Today, Thursday and Friday. I guess the days should change to Today, Friday and Saturday.
I have closed all the Firefox windows, I have restarted my PC and nothing has changed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Forecastfox addon. Check the days on the status bar.
2.Wait till next day. Check the days on the status bar.
3.Days has not changed, there is the same forecast as previous day.
Actual Results:  
I see bad structure of the days. I see Today, Thursday and Friday, but today is Friday. That is not correct.

Expected Results:  
The days will be changing every day.
