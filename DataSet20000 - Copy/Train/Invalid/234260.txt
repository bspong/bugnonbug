JavaScript does not work as expected: checkbox should check all messages but checks only one
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/0.8/FirefoxSetup-0.8.exe

web.de offers the possibility to select all messages to be deleted by checking
one checkbox. When using the new version of firefox checking the box only
results in checking the first message.
With older versions of Firefox this problem didn't occur.
Best you set up a web.de account and try it out to see what I mean.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in to web.de
2. Check messages in the "spam" folder
3. Delete messages in spam folder -> only the first message is marked for deletion

Actual Results:  
Only the 1st message was checked and could be deleted. Have to check every
message so that it gets deleted.

Expected Results:  
All messages should be checked and then be deleted.
