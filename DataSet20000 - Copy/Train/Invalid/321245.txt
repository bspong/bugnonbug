That's not a bug, but a little weakpoint compare with IE6 (Normally I think Firefox is better than IE).

With javascript function I can add my message into the little window of confirmation with IE:
        
       window.event.returnValue = message;

With firefox, I can get the same funciton by:

	e.preventDefault();

But I can't add the message.

Maybe in the next verison you can add the parameter, so it can be used as:

	e.preventDefault(message);

Here we can add the message into the little window of the confirmation.

With Java or C++ its easy to do it, isn't it ?

My best regards.

Reproducible: Always
