If the user has a nightly build that is more than a day old, the new updater will download the full update for the latest build to get them up to date.  When the browser applies the update and restarts, the previous session is not restored.  Only the home page is loaded.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Get an hourly/nightly build from a few days ago.  
2.  Make sure that session restore is turned on through the hidden prefs.
3.  Load a few tabs.
4.  Check for updates and update to the most recent build.

Actual Results:  
Upon restart the session is not restored.  Instead, the home page is loaded.

Expected Results:  
The previous session should be restored.
