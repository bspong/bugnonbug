Add Credits link to its rightful place in the About Mozilla Firefox window

Rationale:
* Giving credit where credit is due is just common courtesy, and the least Mozilla can do for the people who worked on the software. A link labeled "global community" does not make one think "the people who contributed their time and effort to make this", and given the proximity to "Mozilla", it looks like further information about Mozilla Foundation/Corporation.
* According to bug 579547, comment 3 the original Credits button was removed because the list was not up-to-date. But this is being addressed by bug 594788
* The new About dialog is significantly wider and there is ample space to have four links at the bottom instead of three.

In a nutshell:
A Credits link belongs on the same row as Licensing Information, End User Rights and Privacy Policy.
