USELESS MASTER PASSWORD WHEN CLICKING "CANCEL" AT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW SESSION.

When a new session of Firefox is to start and you use a master password, a dialog box will pop up and you will be requested to type it before Firefox opens. We normally type the master password and click "Ok". However, If you click on "Cancel", instead, Firefox accepts this command as if you had typed the correct master password and goes directly to the session you had saved and quit. I suppose this is an issue on security. It always happens.
Thanks for your time & Happy 2009 to you all.
