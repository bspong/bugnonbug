Hard crash (freeze) when reloading Gmail in FF 1.5.02

Serious regression with FF 1.5.02. When loading Gmail with multiple tabs, Gmail loads just fine. Any attempts to manually reload Gmail, esp while reloading another tab simultaneously, cause a hard crash in 1.5.02. This behavior is new or much worse in FF 1.5.02 and is a serious regression. Previously, FF had been very stable for me. I can no longer use Gmail in FF. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load Gmail with multiple tabs
2. Reload Gmail tab
3. Esp, reload Gmail tab while reloading another tab simultaneously

Actual Results:  
Hard crash with FF with a hard freeze that does not recover with time. On restart, Gmail loads normally.

Expected Results:  
Gmail reloads normally, albeit a bit slowly.

This is the worst bug I have seen in FF in some time now. My previously hard-stable browser is now seriously unstable. I may have to use IE for Gmail. FF 1.5.02 seems to have introduced a serious regression. Fix!

I do have quite a few extensions installed, FWIW.

There are a number of other Gmail bugs and crashers on this list, and most of them were purportedly fixed in FF 1.5.02. Since this one is decidely NOT fixed, and is somewhat different from all other bugs and crashers, I opened a new bug.
