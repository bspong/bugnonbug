Bad merge of tab/window prefs can lead to Options UI showing wrong setting
This came up in #firefox, from a user who prefers windows to tabs. They found that target="_blank" links were opening in new tabs in Firefox 2, despite the UI saying they would  open in a new window. They'd previously had this set up to their satisfaction in 1.5.0.x, and weren't using any extensions.

Steps to reproduce:
1, Create a new profile with Firefox 1.5
2, Set "Open links from other apps" to new window, and "Force links to open ..." to new window
3, verify that the images at the URL load in new windows 
4, load profile with Firefox 2
5, click on images again

Expected results:
Image loads in new window

Actual results:
Image loads in new tab, but UI shows "new window" for Options:Tabs:"New pages should be opened in"

I haven't looked at other combinations of those prefs, or other link scenarios.
