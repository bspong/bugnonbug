Switch progress line to slideback / cylon state on navigation event
Right now we only switch to use the slideback CSS style created in bug 596812 when we get a "Connecting..." pause from the system. This results in a lack of immediate feedback after a user clicks on a navigation event. We should switch to the state immediately after we click, and switch to a loading progress bar once we start to show content.
