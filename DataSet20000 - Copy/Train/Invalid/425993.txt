liferea built with xulrunner 1.9 dumping tons of places.sqlite-\d+.corrupt files
liferea, built with xulrunner 1.9 is dumping tons of places.sqlite-\d+.corrupt files. Even with a fresh profile, all those ".corrupt" files appear at startup.
This is 100% reproducible. A dump shows they are not corrupted at all.

It's a regression introduced when bug 415460 landed, between b3 and b4, and it's still there in 1.9pre.

Those ".corrupt" files are created when InitDB() fails.
I've traced it down to mDBGetTags:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/toolkit/components/places/src/nsNavHistory.cpp#1140

1140   // mDBGetTags
1141   rv = mDBConn->CreateStatement(NS_LITERAL_CSTRING(
1142       "SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(t.title, ' ') "
1143       "FROM moz_places h "
1144       "JOIN moz_bookmarks b ON b.type = ") +
1145         nsPrintfCString("%d", nsINavBookmarksService::TYPE_BOOKMARK) +
1146         NS_LITERAL_CSTRING(" AND b.fk = h.id "
1147       "JOIN moz_bookmarks t ON t.parent = ?1 AND t.id = b.parent "
1148       "WHERE h.url = ?2"),
1149     getter_AddRefs(mDBGetTags));
1150   NS_ENSURE_SUCCESS(rv, rv);
