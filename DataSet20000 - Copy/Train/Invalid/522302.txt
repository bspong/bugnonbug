Sessionstore tests use openDialog with undefined param
openDialog is supposed to be called with a chrome location. In most (all?) of the cases we're using it, it's called with location, which is undefined. This isn't causing any problems that I know of, but we might as well fix it sometime. With all the oranges in sessionstore, it's in our best interest to make the tests as correct as possible.

We can use getBrowserURL() which just returns "chrome://browser/content/browser.xul", that string literal, or use |openNewWindowWith()| http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/utilityOverlay.js#609. openWindowWith calls openDialog with the right parameters and the same window options we're using anyway ("_blank", "chrome,all,dialog=no") and all we have to pass is a URL.
