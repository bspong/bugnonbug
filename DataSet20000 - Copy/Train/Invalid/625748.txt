There is currently no way anymore to check for updates of FireFox. This was present in older versions in the Help menu. All I can see is a preference for automatic update checking. That is grossly insufficient. I certainly should not have to choose between automatic checks or no checks at all. There MUST be support for a manual check.

Reproducible: Always
