Crash when using DOM against an event containing multiple lines of Javascript
We have encountered a situation that results in consistent crashes in all
current Mozilla based browsers.  This issue appears to be occuring when we use
the DOM level 2 manipulation functions against a tag that has an event
containing Javascript that has newlines in it - therefore spanning multiple lines.

It would be my guess that this non-standard Javascript implementation is not
being handled properly by the parser and the visible result is in a hung page
request resulting in a browser crash after some small period of time.
