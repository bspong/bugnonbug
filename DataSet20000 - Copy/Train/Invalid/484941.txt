I added that address to my bookmark-toolbar, 
then I wang to rename it, but when I right-click this icon, Firefox goes to auto-close with nothing message.
When I re-open Firefox, anything become fine.
But I cann't rename any one icon on bookmark-toolbar.

I tried to use "Manage bookmark" on Menubar(Bookmark), but now this dialog is also broken, it will be auto-close when I open this dialog.
Who can tell me how to Rename or Remove it?

Reproducible: Always
