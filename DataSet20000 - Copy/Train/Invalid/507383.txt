FireFox 3.5.1 has developed two problems after I installed the last update of colorful tabs addon:
1. If I leave the browser idle for a while, it hangs up on resuming activity, requiring termination with windows task manager.
2. On restarting it will will not be able to reload the tabs open during the terminated session with a message "well this is embarrassing but ..."
For the time being it seems I have resolved the problem by uninstalling Colorful tabs addon.


Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Install the latest colorful tabs addon
open 3 or four different urls in so many tabs
leave idle for, say, 30 minutes
resume
close and restart firefox

Expected Results:  
1. FireFox may freeze on resuming from idle state
                     AND
2. Tabs will show the reload problem with "well this is embarrassing but ..." message
