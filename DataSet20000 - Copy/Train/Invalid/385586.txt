Some warning messages (e.g. Viewing an encrypted page with unencrypted content) only have an Ok (and maybe a Cancel) button.  There is no option to see more information about what is causing the warning, nor is there a Help button to explain to less sophisticated users what the warning means.

The UI guidelines for Firefox et al should require these warning messages to show more information to the user, and to offer a Help page explaining what is causing the warning.
