Since updating to the latest version of Firefox I can no longer print anything associated with the internet - all I get is rubbish.  I have an HP Laserjet 2100M printer and have no trouble printing from, for example, Word or Excel files, from my hard disk.  What can I do to fix this?  Incidentally, the update took about half-an-hour to download - is this normal?
