Hektor+FF I found a bug that allows me to connect to a server that is defined in the exclusion list in Preferences => Network => Proxy without use the proxy (Hektor).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
*Open Preferences => Network => Proxy
*Add to exclusion list example.org
*Click OK
*Open example.org
Actual Results:  
I can open example.org without proxy (Hektor).

Expected Results:  
Do not allow me to visit example.org.

Hector is a local proxy server that should prevent me visiting certain websites and downloading some files via HTTP. Hector should not let me turn off the proxy in Preferences => Network => Proxy by exiting FF.
