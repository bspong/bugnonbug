Firefox refuses to open a link with download in it?
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; nl-NL; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041027 Firefox/1.0RC1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; nl-NL; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041027 Firefox/1.0RC1

When I go to http://www.growl.info/ the downloads link does not work. The url
displays in the status bar when I hover my mouse over the image, but clicking on
it does not trigger any action.

The same problem can be witnessed at http://www.adiumx.com The download url
there is: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/adium/AdiumX_0.71.dmg?download
which firefox refuses to open as well. Opening it directly in the adres bar
doesn't open the link neither. Neither does http://www.growl.info/downloads.php
I haven't seen this problem on other OS-ses yet.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.growl.info
2. Click the download image


Actual Results:  
Nothing happend

Expected Results:  
The download page should be openened. Safari does do fine.
