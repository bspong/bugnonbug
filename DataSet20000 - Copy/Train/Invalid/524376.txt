Error report on start up, every time. Sometimes repeats - see below.

Each time I start Firefox I get the following error report:

"getPlusPlus_Adobe_reg_bootstrap.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close.  We are sorry for the inconvenience."

I will also get this on other occasions, such as when I open a Yahoo! video via "http://ca.yahoo.com/" and then offers to send/not send error report to Microsoft.

The browser opens and seems to function okay . . . this is more of an annoyance than anything.

As I don't have this issue with IE, I presume there is some form of incompatibility with Firefox. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Browser
2.Open Yahoo! Videos
3.

I have the same results with different themes and have not made any recent significant reconfigurations to my computer.  However, installing Adobe Flash Player 10 was a hassle in both IE and Firefox and it seems to me that the issue began after the install.  The Adobe website was unresponsive at times and seemed to be set up to direct me to overview a variety of their other software programs before allowing me to upgrade Flash Player.  

I perform daily scans for spyware & viruses, with low level tracking cookies being all that show up.
