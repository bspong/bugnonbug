I cannot get the Tools / Options / Privacy preference changes to be saved.  For me this affects any changes to the Privacy area.  Example: I try to set History to "Remember visited pages for the last" 30 "days" or turn ON "Allow sites to set cookies" on the Cookies tab then click on Ok.  As long as Firefox remains open there is no problem, but if I close and reopen Firefox then the preference changes are gone.

Firefox help says no updates are available - so I guess that means I am running the latest version.  I did see one other bug report that looked similar but the resolution was flagged as "Invalid" because the suggestion was made to 'create a new profile'.  Does this mean create a new Windows XP Profile? That would involve reinstalling many software packages on the PC.  Or is there a way to recreate a Firefox profile?

Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.
