This rule is in a section <head>/<style type="text/css"> (this is an example from Flanagan's JavaScript book):

.tooltipContent {
     left: -4px; top: -4px;        /* how much of the shadow shows * /
     background-color: #ff0;       /* yellow background * /
     border: solid black 1px;      /* thin black border * /
     padding: 5px;                 /* spacing between text and border * /
     font: bold 10pt sans-serif;   /* small bold font * /
   }

This is interpreted as if it were .tooltipContent {left: -4px; top: -4px;}. Removing the /* comments */ on each line makes the other rules be included.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create HTML document containing this in the head.
2. (easiest) Use Firebug to view CSS. or (more work) create an HTML element that uses this rule in the <body> section.
3.
Actual Results:  
No style rule except the first is effective.

Expected Results:  
background color, border, etc rules are obeyed.
