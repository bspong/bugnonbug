Avoid new use of accesskey 's' in main menu

The new menu which uses Hi%story has the accesskey as 's'. This removes one of the commonly usable accesskeys as other browsers don't use it and Mozilla has not used it before:

Please could you re-consider the use of S as an access key so that existing applications that have made use of it as accessibility accesskeys, knowing that it wasn't currently used, don't have to be changed to use one of the ever-diminishing set of usable keys.

Reproducible: Always




This seems to be new in Firefox Beta 2.
