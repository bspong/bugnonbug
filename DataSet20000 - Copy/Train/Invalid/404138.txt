Program crashes when using Bookmarks while loading page in other tab

Nearly half of the time I try to select the "Bookmarks", the program crashes and freezes, needing to be restarted.  This is independent of the number of tabs open or the sites being accessed.  This does not happen EVERY time, but about one-half of the time.  It seems especially likely when a page is loading in another tab. 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open multiple tabs
2. While a page is loading in one tab, switch to another
3. Try to load a new page from the "Bookmarks" in the menu - this almost always produces the "crash" symptom.
Actual Results:  
The program stops responding.  I "Force Quit" the program, and restart using "Restore Session" to re-load the tabs I had opened.

Expected Results:  
I would expect to be able to access and load a new page in a new tab while the other tabs are loading.  This seems to only be a problem when accessing pages from the "Bookmarks" in the Menu.  If I enter the web address in the browser, the pages load successfully.
