recieved a screen on my mac whilst using hotmail via your browser - it looked like a standard update thing so I clicked a few seconds later I recieved a call, it all sounded very dubious (They were from microsoft ! apparently I had mistakenly downloaded some dodgy info) so I ended the call and restarted my computer and have now installed security software for protection. But clearly some dubious party was trying to hack into my computer and may have been partially succesful via your software at 11.17am uk time

Reproducible: Always
