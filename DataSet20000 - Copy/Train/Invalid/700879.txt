Steps to reproduce:

Opened about:permissions


Actual results:

Browser started loading favicons for sites listed, causing several authentication boxes for sites requiring HTTP authentication.
As well as being a bother in the authentication case, this could also be a privacy issue - some people no doubt turn off favicons for this reason.


Expected results:

Either no icons, or the default icon, should have appeared next to the sites given.
