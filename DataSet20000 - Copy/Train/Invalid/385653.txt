I tried to set another page as my startpage while I had three tabs open. I wanted to use the page that was on the second tab. The second tab was active. I went to preferences and pressed the button 'Use current page.' I expected that the page in the second tab would be used as my startpage, but the page in the first tab was used.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open two or more different tabs
2. Select the second, the third, the fourth or the fifth tab
3. Go to Tools > Preferences
4. Press the button 'Use current page'
Actual Results:  
The page that is loaded in the first tab is used as startpage.

Expected Results:  
The page in the active tab should be set as startpage.
