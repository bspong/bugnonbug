Using the latest version of Firefox in Windows XP SP3 under Apple's Boot Camp which has been updated with Snow Leopard drivers, pages such as Apple Discussion scroll in ripples when using either the ball on the top of the mighty mouse or dragging the side bar. The original Google search page appears to be OK and scrolls normally.

There is no problem with Safari 4 in Boot Camp when looking at the same page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. It has become a problem since updating with the Snow Leopard drivers
2. Scrolling the ball on top of mouse creates a pause, then a large section of page moves, rather than continuously smoothly shifting.
3.
Actual Results:  
The pages look as if they are rippling rather than smoothly scrolling.

Expected Results:  
I would expect a smooth movement of the page.

This appears to particular to Firefox as Safari runs as expected
