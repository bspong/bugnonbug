The UI might look a little cleaner if the file types list was wider. 

In all the other options when there are multiple buttons the right most buttons
all line up vertically except downloads. The show folder button, the file types
list and the plug-ins... button should be in line vertically. The show folder
button is placed correctly with respect to all the buttons in other options
[general, web features] so all the other elements should line up to that button.
