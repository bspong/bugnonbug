On the web page http://www.rossowinspections.com/, the 4th link on the left 'Fees' is not a clickable link.  There is a valid anchor tag associated with the word.  In Internet Explorer the link works.  In Firefox on SUSE Linux 10.0 the link works (although then if you click on fees then the Home link doesn't work.  Using Firefox on Windows XP, the link does not work.  Using Mozilla on Windows all of the links work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.browse to http://www.rossowinspections.com/
2.try clicking on the Fees link on the left menu
3.view source to verify the link is well formed

Actual Results:  
Nothing, link action did not occur

Expected Results:  
The page sould link and forward to http://www.rossowinspections.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5&Itemid=5

Joomla is the supporting framework behind the site.  As the link appears to be well formed Im thinking this isn't a Joomla issue?
