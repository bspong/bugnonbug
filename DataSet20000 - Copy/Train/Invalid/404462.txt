I installed the java plugin by copying libjavaplugin_oji.so to the plugins folder. The browser shows that the plugin is installed (in Tools/Addons/Plugins and in about:plugins). However, pages with applets display white space where the applet should be. The plugin verification at java.com also fails.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the java plugin by copying libjavaplugin_oji.so to the plugins folder
2. Go to: http://java.sun.com/applets/jdk/1.4/demo/applets/BarChart/example1.html
