becuase the css calls the focused tab to have a two pixel wider left padding
than an unfocused tab, we get a growth of the entire tab bar to the right two
pixels when you select a new tab. this causes a bit of disorientation and
generaly dirty feel to the tab bar here.  I've posted an example screenshot that
shows the growth.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.open the page-info window
2.select a new tab
3.watch carefully for the shift

Actual Results:  
tab bar grew two pixels to the right

Expected Results:  
all tabs should remain fixed widths.  And at the very least the tab bar itself
should remain a fixed size.

this occurs in the tabbox.css file in the global folder of the classic theme.

in particular the segments at fualt are 

here:

tab 
{ ...

  padding: 1px 4px 2px 4px;

  ...
}

and here:

tab[selected="true"] {
  margin-top: 0;
  border-bottom-color: transparent;
  padding: 1px 6px 4px 6px;
}

In my theme by making the tab[selected="true"] padding the same sizes as the
"tab" paddings I've stopped this slidding effect.  In general I believe this
gives a cleaner feel.
