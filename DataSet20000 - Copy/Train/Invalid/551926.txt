the icons in the bookmarks toolbar are not displayed.
I tried to access various sites to see if they will load but they don't.
but the icons in the tabs are displayed normally.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install the 3.6 firefox update
2. start the browser
Actual Results:  
the icons in the bookmarks toolbar don't show up

Expected Results:  
load the icons in the bookmarks toolbar

when I did the update I had a non-compatible theme installed.
I disinstalled it and restarted the browser a couple of times with the default theme but the bug still occurs.
