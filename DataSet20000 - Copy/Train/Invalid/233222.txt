Firebird ignores selected percentage size reduction when printing. However Mozilla works perfectly.
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040130 Firebird/0.8.0+

Select File --> Page setup -> Scale 92% size reduction before printing to A4
paper or .ps file. Firebird does not shrink printed version as expected. So the
whole of the chambers crossword does not fit on one page.
However Mozilla works perfectly.

The fault is there whether I print direct to the printer, or first create a
postscript file. This may be related to bug 21689 which complains about
excessive font size in printing, but I don't know.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.chambersharrap.co.uk/chambers/crossword/ChambersJul_print.html
2.Select 92% size reduction with A4 size.
3.Print to A4 paper or .ps file. 


Actual Results:  
Firebird does not shrink printed version as expected to fit on one page.

However Mozilla works perfectly.

I have found this difference with several different web pages.
Essentially, Firebird seems to ignore the Scale setting.

Expected Results:  
After I select 92% reduction the whole crossword (i.e. all the questions)
should fit on one A4 page.

I have tried this in more than one nightly build of Firebird. I get this version
of Firebird  MozillaFirebird-i686-linux-gtk2+xft.tar.gz, just untar it in a
subdirectory of /usr/local/src, set /usr/local/bin/firebird to point to it, and
mostly it just works apart from this printing problem.

It makes no difference whether I have installed extra plugins or not.
I have the TTLO tool extension.

It's very annoying as I have to run Mozilla to do printing, even though I
generally much prefer Firebird's interface.
