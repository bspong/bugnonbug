Bad data in tab window one

The msn.com website "page options" allows the user to switch between "wide" (3-column) and "narrow" (2-column) layout. The MSNBC News summary appears in column 2, in both display modes. The problem is that in wide-mode, the MSNBC News section appears in column 1 (rather than column 2) and it contains obsolete data -- the news report is a week old. This bad display is repeated when I switch between narrow and wide modes, even after I clear the cache. HOWEVER, the problem occurs only when I am in Firefox tab window one! The display is ok in tab windows 2, 3, 4 (open new tab, go to msn.com.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Go to msn.com
3. Under "Page Options" select "Switch to Wide page" or "Switch to Narrow page"
4. Look for the MSNBC News segment
5. Repeat step (4) several times, switching between wide and narrow modes
Actual Results:  
In wide-screen mode, the MSNBC News segment is in column 1 and had old data; in narrow mode it is in column 2 with current data.

Expected Results:  
In both modes, it should be in column 2 with current data.

The problem was seen before updating to Firefox 2.0.0.6. I don't remember what that older version was, but I do have automatic updates. For both tab window 1 and 2 I did a "view source" and saved that data. Will attach it later.
