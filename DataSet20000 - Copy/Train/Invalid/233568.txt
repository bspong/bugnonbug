FireFox 0.8 Install trashed Mozilla 1.6 Settings
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

After installing FireFox 0.8 (using the Win32 Installer program), I later opened
Mozilla 1.6.

I was presented with the "select user" dialog box, and my previous Mozilla
settings no longer existed.  This included add-ins, themes, and bookmarks.

I *did* have Moz 1.6 open at the time I started the install, but shut it down
when FireFox installer complained.
