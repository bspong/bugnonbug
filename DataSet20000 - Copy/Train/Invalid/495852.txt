Mac OS X 10.4.11 on Intel Core2Duo MacBook Pro and FireFox 3.0.10

FireFox is installed in Account1.
FireFox is set to always download to a second partition.
Download location is a shared drive area with no ownership permissions set.
Account1 settings are copied into the default User Template.
Account2 is created, which gets its settings from the customized default User Template.
Account2 user attempts to download a file and permission is denied because it tries to download to /Users/Account1/Desktop.

Uninstalling FireFox (delete app and search for all searchable references to FireFox and Mozilla) and reinstalling does not help. Same results.

Need FireFox fixed and need to know ALL file locations that are external to the FireFox.app file that would affect this. Someone please summarize these files and what each does.

Reproducible: Always
