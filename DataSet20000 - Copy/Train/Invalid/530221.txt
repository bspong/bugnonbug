Hi All,

Would you guys please fix this for me?  This is a total pain in the neck!

If you set your DNS servers to Open DNS: 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220 and make a posting on a forum (CentOS, VirtualBox, Open Office, etc.) or just watch a thread on a forum, then leave your browser set on the forum list to monitor it, Open DNS disallows you to read your forum after a wait of about a half hour.  You get all kinds of idiot errors about loops and redirection.  You have to exit FF and restart it.  Then go back to your forums to be able to read them again.

Many thanks,
-T
