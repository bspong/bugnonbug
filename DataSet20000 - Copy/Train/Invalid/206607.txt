If you make a config file (steps can be found at
http://opensourceschools.org/article.php?story=20030326162402253 ) you are able
to set and lock preferences for other proxy settings, but not the autoconfig
url.  A configuration of:

lockPref("network.proxy.autoconfig_url", "http://www.domain.com/proxy.js");
lockPref("network.proxy.type", 2);

will lock the proxy settings to force use of an autoconfig url, however, the url
itself is not changed, and the text box for it is not disabled.  Users may
change the url to anything that like.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a config file using steps at
http://opensourceschools.org/article.php?story=20030326162402253
2.Restart Firebird
3.Check preferences - Connection

Actual Results:  
Proxy setting will be set to use autoconfig url and user can not change this
option.  However, the autoconfig url to be used is not set and the text box is
not disabled.

Expected Results:  
The proxy setting should have been set to the correct proxy autoconfig url and
users should not be able to change this via Tools-Options menu.

I can upload sample configs if needed.  This bug is preventing deployment by
some organizations who allow public or student access to the web.
