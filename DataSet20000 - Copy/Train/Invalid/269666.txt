When opening a SmartFind bookmark "folder", the search will - among the normal
search results - also return the folder itself as a result. This allows the user
to open an unlimited amount of subfolders.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add the following bookmark:

find:datasource=rdf:bookmarks&match=http://home.netscape.com/NC-rdf#Name&method=contains&text=Mozilla

2. The new bookmark shows as a folder, open it via the Bookmarks menu.

3. Goto 2.



Expected Results:  
SmartFind bookmarks should not consider themselves as a valid search result.
