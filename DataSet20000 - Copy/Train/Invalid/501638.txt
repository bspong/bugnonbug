The paste functionality will stop working after the first paste on a particular webpage.  I can copy from FF3.5 to any other software and then paste.  This has only affected my Windows XP installation and not Vista.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.copy and paste into toolbar, for example
2.copy something else and paste again
3.note it will not take
Actual Results:  
leaves first paste in place, does not replace

Expected Results:  
should have replaced the text

I am running Google Toolbar 5.0 as well as a side note.
