Fast Dial works incorrect a little

When pressed "New tab" Fast Dial opens a new tab. In a recent versions of Firefox, address bar contained "Fast dial" text. When clicked on bar that text disappears and the text cursor was put on 1st position ready to input a new URL.
Now after creating a new tab the address bar is empty. If u click any place free of fast dial icons the address bar fills in "chrome://fastdial/content/fastdial.html". Since, u need first manually delete all that symbols before entering a new url from keyboard. Not a good idea. If tab leaved as is(containing chrome://fastdial/content/fastdial.html in address bar) and switched on another when switching back soon it's address bar already contains search bookmarks and history - now it's ok !

Reproducible: Always
