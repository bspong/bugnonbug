Firefox exits without OS error or TalkBack when clicking on HTML link on Web page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 1.0.3705)
Build Identifier: Firefox/2.0.0.3

This was discovered while doing a google image search on Jessica Alba. Several pages into the seach results I clicked on a link to this picture and Firefox exited.

If I cut and paste the URL into the Address bar the web page displays fine. However, when the URL is a link on a web page and you click the link, the application exits without OS error or Firefox errors. I have verfied this with the nightly build as well. The issues is not with the URL address itself, rather the interpretation of the URL link within Firefox, i.e. a link on a page that is clicked on.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the sample files with the URL enbedded as a hyperlink
2.Click on the link and the application will exit.
3.
Actual Results:  
Paste the above URL into an HTML page and make the link a hyperlink to the same source. Save the HTML page. Open the page in Firefox. You should see a hyperlink to the URL noted above. Click on the link.

Expected Results:  
Firefox exits without error.

The link should have gone to the web site.
