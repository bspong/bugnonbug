An enhancement I have been thinking about for a while is that the Alert dialog
that shows up when trying to go to an unreachable URL should also contain an
adress field with the unreachable URL posted in it so it is possible to correct
typing errors.  This field should have focus when the alert is displayed.

Reproducible: Always
