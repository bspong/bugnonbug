Shift Alt does not open a new tab with TabMixPlus and FF7
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:7.0a1) Gecko/20110629 Firefox/7.0a1
Build ID: 20110629030813

Steps to reproduce:

* Installed TabMixPlus
* Tried to open a new tab in the address bar with Shift Alt Enter
* Tried the same from the search bar
* Deactivated TMP
* Did the same


Actual results:

Opening a new tab from the address bar does not work. However, from the search bar, there are no problems. If I deactivate TMP, both works.
Btw.: The address completion (adding www. and .net when hitting Shift Alt Enter) in the addressbar works at every time - just that there is no new tab.
