When using a css background-image and having a hover on a once-playing gif, this
does not reset causing the gif not to play the next time again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Making a css with a default and hover on a once (in contrast to infinite)
running gif.

e.g.:

a { backgound-image:url(foo.jpg); }
a:hover { background-image:url(once-playing.gif) }
Actual Results:  
The gif plays only on the first mouse over, the next hovers only show the last
frame of the gif and don't play again.


Expected Results:  
The gif should have played once on each mouseover (hover) effect.
