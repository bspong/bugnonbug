i code a drag'n'drop img sorting page in javascript. i put img & names in a div. 
if i want to displace a div and the mousecursor is on the img, the m-cursor becomes a prohibition sign. and the div stays where it was. 
if the cursor is only on the div (the div is bigger than the img) it's no problem to displace the div.
in opera it works as expected.
