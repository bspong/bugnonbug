More than 90Mb after some minutes. This slows down my system considerably. This happened after the latest update. Mozilla starts at about 60Mb and keeps on growing even when doing nothing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Mozilla. With Google toolbar.
2.Start Windows taskmanager.
3.Look.

Actual Results:  
System slows down due to huge memory usage of Mozilla.

Expected Results:  
Behave properly. Like Internet Explorer for instance.

My PC has 196Mb memory and a P III processor. Which was always adequate for using Mozilla.
