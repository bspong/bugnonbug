firefox hangs trying to load any bookmark or history data
Firefox was recently stuck using 100% so I had to force-quit it. After restarting, my bookmark bar was blank. When I clicked on the bookmarks menu, firefox hung, and required multiple force-quits to exit. Restarted again, and the same appearance (blank bookmark bar). This time I clicked on the URL-bar drop-down, and firefox again hung. Rebooted, and get the same behavior. Other menus work (File, edit, etc). My bookmarks.html file appears perfectly readable in a text editor.

I'm unfamiliar with the awesome new bookmarks/history backend--is there a cache file that could be corrupt?
