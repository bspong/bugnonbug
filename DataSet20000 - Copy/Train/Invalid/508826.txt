Firefox hangs on start-up on OSX10.5
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_8; en-us) AppleWebKit/530.19.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.2 Safari/530.19
Build Identifier: Mozilla Firefox 3.5.2 -- sorry can't open it to find out the build no.

I've done everything I can think of... and it is still hanging! I've done repair disk permissions, I've moved the folder to all disable plugins and everything else, I've deleted the .plist file and and FF and started over. Got the most recent version 3.5.2, then I downloaded and tried V3.0.11 , and it still hangs after 3-10 seconds with ~600MB of ram taken up. I just ran the new Apple update too, 10.5.8, which didn't do a thing to help. I've updated Flash to the newest version. Tried the Nightly Build. Tried running in safe-mode from terminal. Nothing. Camino works fine, Safari works fine.  Can anyone help?

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
hangs and makes me force quit

Expected Results:  
not hung me on a line
