Firefox 3.5.7 either prints garbage or nothing on HP Laserjet 4000
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

The two pages above are examples of the problem I'm experiencing in printing with my HP Laserjet 4000. When I try to print using PCL6, the driver won't process anything. When I try to print using PCL5e, the driver produces either garbage or nothing. I could get the page at lordslaw.com to print through print preview. On other pages, such as the City of Houston web page where I pay my water bill, the receipt prints OK, but the information at the top and bottom that identifies the website, date and page info is garbage.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the web page
2. Hit Ctrl-P or click File>print
3. Select HP printer with PCL5e if not already selected
4. Click OK
Actual Results:  
Garbage on pages printed at lordslaw.com; some garbage on receipts at City of Houston public utilities website; nothing on myyahoo.com

Expected Results:  
Everything should have printed in legible English, just as it was presented.

I tried disabling all the extensions and add-ons, but that didn't help. I had the same problem when I tried to print emails through Thunderbird 3.0, but fortunately, I had an version 1.5 of it available, so I'm able to use it and print emails. I can print with my Canon MF4150, but it's not close to my desk, and it costs more to print with it, so I prefer the HPLJ4000. I can save the desired page in PDF format and print that, but it would be nicer if someone could diagnose the source of this problem and fix it. As an alternative, tell me where I can download an older version of Firefox that doesn't present printing problems.
