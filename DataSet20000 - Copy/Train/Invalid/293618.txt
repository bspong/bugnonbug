Memory goes off the charts, firefox needs to be killed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the mht file with firefox
2. watch your single-core machine get on its knees
3. kill firefox

Actual Results:  
memory usage shoots up, got to over 1GB the first time before I could kill it.

Expected Results:  
fail gracefully if it's a bad file, which I'm note certain it is (works in IE, etc)
