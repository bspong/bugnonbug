When you login to your GMail account and click on Contacts, you get a message
saying a popup blocker is blocking the Contacts window.
So I added http://gmail.google.com to my exceptions list and now when I try it
the spinning beachball comes up and stays there. I have to force quit Firefox.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login into GMail
2. After gmail.google.com is a popup blocker exception click on Contacts
3.

Actual Results:  
The browser locks up

Expected Results:  
Whatever it's supposed to do :)
