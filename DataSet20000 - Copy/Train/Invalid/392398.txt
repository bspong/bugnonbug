The first check of hasSelection is imo unnecessary, because it checks if _selection is null.
Now, let's look at selectedNode.
return this.hasSelection ? this._selection : null;
If hasSelection is true, it returns a valid object. If it's null, it will return null.
So why the first check? It can be removed, because in both possibilities the returned value is what would be returned by the current method.

Reproducible: Always
