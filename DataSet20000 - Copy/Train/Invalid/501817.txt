It doesn't happen in Safari and I've never noticed it before. This is the only copy of 3.5 that I have installed on any of my machines so I can't compare. All I know is, there is an ENORMOUS blinking cursor (movable throughout the page and it changes size according to the item). This must be a bug. It is my site, and I know it was never there before 3.5. Like a text entry cursor.

Sorry if I don't know all the techie terminology but if this was reported, I couldn't find it or maybe I just didn't understand it in the terminology used.
