you are using netscape 5.0
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1

When I try to log-on to my web-based student management site, it says that I am running Netscape version 5.0, please install IE 5.5 or higher.  Netscape is nowhere on my computer, so I am assuming it is identifying Firefox as a Netscape application.  Is there any way to change this?
