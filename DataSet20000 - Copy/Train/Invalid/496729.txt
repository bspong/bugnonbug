I surf to a site, a box is in a blank area on the screen, saying "click here to download plug in".  I click and am routed to Adobe's website where I say I am in Windows 7, and want to install Adobe Flash Player.  I execute the downloadable and it deposits nothing in the Firefox, plugin directory, and when I surf back to the original website " https://www.growfinancial.org/" the click here to download appears again.   I have surfed the web on this and apparently NPFSF32.DLL and/or Flashplayer.xpt are missing from the Flash directory.   What to do?
