Movable Type problem

There seems to be a bug affecting the browsing of blog pages which are formatted using Movable Type software (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_Type), especially long pages.  When I access pages like this one using 1.5, my CPU usage goes up to 90% or more, with the task manager showing most of that being from Firefox.exe.  This has the consequence of making the browser be rather sluggish and slow to respond.  Was not a problem in the 1.0.X line.  When I close those pages, the usage drops back down.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a long blog page which uses Movable Type, such as the URL I listed above.
2. Monitor CPU usage.
3. Close the tab or window with that page and see the CPU usage go back down.

Actual Results:  
The CPU usage got really high and stayed really high for as long as I was at that site, with the resulting reduced browser proformance.

Expected Results:  
Not used anywhere near as much CPU capacity for just one web page.

Occurs with the default theme.
