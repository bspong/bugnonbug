User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:7.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0.1
Build ID: 20110928134238

Steps to reproduce:

Wrote some bad javascript. Can't use nightly builds because of extension dependency that only works in FF7 currently to test for resolution, sorry. 


Actual results:

Error console did not even log simple reference errors. Opened up my page in chrome, immediately saw that there were simply references to undeclared variables. Made sure "errors" and "warnings" were both enabled for the console. 


Expected results:

Errors should have been logged. See comparison to chrome in attached image.
