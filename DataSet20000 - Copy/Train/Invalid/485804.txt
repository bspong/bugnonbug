can not delete disk image from desktop after downloading and installing Firefox 3.0.8 update
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.0.8) Gecko/2009032608 Firefox/3.0.8

With Firefox not running, I can drag the disk image to the trash, but when launch Firefox again the disk image is back on my desktop. I want it to go away. The application is in my Application folder and the alias is in my dock.

Reproducible: Always




Everything is in my details above.
