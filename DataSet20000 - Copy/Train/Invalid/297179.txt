Previously no popups would appear at dilbert.com when using firefox (although
they always did with IE). Since upgrading to version 1.0.4, a popup now appears
the first time I view the site each day. Once it has been viewed no further
popups will appear in further visits that day.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.dilbert.com
2. A popup will appear
3. Revisit the same site sometime later
4. Popup will not appear
