User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; de; rv:1.9.2b1) Gecko/20091029 Firefox/3.6b1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

With 3.6b1 Firefox only displays half of my bookmarks in its bookmarks bar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
If I knew...
Actual Results:  
I just updated my Firefox from 3.5.4 to 3.6b1, and it is the first time that something goes completely wrong. I don't have a clue why but now only half of the bookmarks appear, and they don't have actual icons.

According to the Error Console there's nothing wrong with it.

If I try to move a bookmark in the sidebar an assertion error appears. Maybe this is of any interest? Another screenshot: http://img94.imageshack.us/img94/6338/assertionfailed20091031.png
