When loggin on a remote machine as user (same username as on the local machine), become root with "su" and start a firefox window, the remote firefox will start again, when starting firefox local.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. local and remote username (logon) e.g."user"
2. start local terminal
3. ssh -X -l user <remote machine>
4. su - <pwd>
5. start firefox (remote firefox from root on local screen)
6. start local firefox
7. => additional firefox window from remote as root

Actual Results:  
local user can use remote root firefox

Expected Results:  
first window with firefox as root from remote and second firefox window as user on local machine

Seems only to be, if local and remote machine have the same user.
