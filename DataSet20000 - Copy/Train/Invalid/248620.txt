No choice of install location

The installer assumes that the install location will be C:\Program Files. You 
don't get the usual install option to change the location.  On my machine, only 
the main operating system files and those that absolutely have to be on the C: 
drive are on it.  All software is otherwise installed on my F: drive.  D: and E: 
are CD and CDRW drives.
