I have found a site whos source code looks perfectly find that has the problem
of the links inside there tables not actiavting at all or only activating when
you move your mouse over a certain part of there link. There source code shows
the entire words within the a href tag and when checking in netscape and IE the
links work fine. The site is http://www.ff-universe.com/ContentPage.html

Note: When I say "activate" I mean become clickable to take you to another page

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.ff-universe.com/ContentPage.html
2. Try moving the mouse over any link inside the tables

Actual Results:  
The links either do not actiavet or only activate when you move your mouse over
a certain part of the word

Expected Results:  
The links should actiavte.
