Unzipped download into temporary folder to perform installation.  I cannot find any INSTALL.EXE or SETUP.EXE to perform an installation.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows 98)
Build Identifier: Unknown.  Downloaded version 0.6.1-win32 on 10/8/03

What program is used to inaugurate the install process?  There must be some 
executable to select, and I am unable to find any obvious candidate.

How is installation performed?  What tool(s) are useable? e.g., Install/Remove 
Software, etc.

Thanks,
Dick Fraser
