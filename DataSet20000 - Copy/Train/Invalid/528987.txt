SERIOUS Windows Explorer Crashes when useing Windows 7 + Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.0 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.195.33 Safari/532.0
Build Identifier: tested with Firefox 3.5 - 3.6 Beta 2

On Windows 7 x64 FF 3.5 - 3.6 Beta 2 seems to crash the Windows Explorer. Dosn't matter if FF is running or was run once after startup - pure install of FF is enough to cause this problem. Tryed different Windows Reg manipulations from people haveing simular bugs (e.g. windows 7 "disabled sessions" bug looks the same) (very hard to specify what is causing the problem since not only FF seems to cause it!) but nothing helped (tryed like 6 different FF installs) till FF was uninstalled. Since then, no single Explorer crash anymore.
Stable Windows 7 run for like 2 weeks now. 

Bug was first spotted at Windows 7 RC (the last 3 builds i tested) and  IS present in the final Windows 7 ultimate and professional edition.
Windows 7 x64 seems to be the main trouble-maker, even tought SOME people useing Windows 7 x86 seem to have simular problems i suppose some other software is causing theirs since like 85% of all people reporting this bug use a x64 system.
Maybe thats the reason why it wasn't reported before (very little x64 systems used compared to x86 ATM) but than this means that in future even more reports will be spotted since x64 presens grows.
