Just for those lurkers of you who might think "Oh, Mozilla had so many bugs":
BugZilla is used to track work on Mozilla. Every bit of work has to have a bug
here. This includes new features and bugs found by developers/testers during
development (bugs that never reached users). So, the number of filed closed bugs
cannot be used as criteria of the quality of Mozilla.
