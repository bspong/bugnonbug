Save File To Does Not Stick, Download Status Bar Inoperable

I have tried to save multiple times to the same folder in Save File To under options whereas I try to save a file, it does not open a window to ask if I care to save a file to designated location.

And if it does work (which this process is repeated all over again if the browser is restarted), the download status bar does not move at all.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have Vista x64 installed with SP1
2.Set download directory under options (Save File To)
3.Try to download file from internet
Actual Results:  
File would not download or would download after a period of time without a working status bar.

Expected Results:  
File would download to designated folder and show a status time in the Download Status indicator.
