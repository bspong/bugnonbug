Online viewing disabled/blocked ever since most recent updates of add-ons/extensions. Can no longer view online streaming sites with addblock plus; ghostery; and (TACO) targeted advertising cookie opt-out! any combination of these alone or together in two's or three's gives me the same results. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click "tools" 
2. click "add-ons"
3. go into "extensions" and disable any combination -  one, two or three of the above mentioned extensions (addblock plus;  ghostery;  TACO targeted advertising cookie opt-out). 
Actual Results:  
page or image or screen or video is blank and if there is a screen/video "play button" on page/screen does not work - no streaming image is forthcoming

Expected Results:  
should be able to see a screen/image to view and should be able to view the online streaming videos and should be able to view them without ads or tracking and should have the ability to continually update list of target marketers to be blocked

ads are blocked as have been for the past year+ no need to skip any ads and one can instantly open up a page with a screen/video and play all content immediately and without any delay also list of blocked target marketers are visually accessible and available in upper the right hand corner and can be continually updated to be added to blocked list
