In an external style sheet, a:link & active link styles set for color/bold/no
underline; hover: color/bold/underline; visited: alternatecolor/bold/no
underline. When viewed in Firefox 0.7 the active link style shows as mostly
default: medium blue/normal weight/no underline. The visited style and hover
styles show as set in style sheet.  SEtting a pseudo-class does not change the
behavior.  These styles show correctly with In. Explorer. They are set in the
style sheet in the correct order (L-V-H-A).

Others have checked and see the same behavior.

There is no apparent workaround.
It doesn't affect browser behavior, but it does affect the appearance of the
webpage. The text "jumps" on mouseover from normal weight text to bolded text,
and the letters/lines on that line to the right of the link move noticeably.
