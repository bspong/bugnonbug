Installed version 2.0 about 2 days ago and have 10 or so complete stalls resulting in a crash of firefox. On reboot I'm asked to restore my session or start a new one. I have not been doing anything in particular during these crashes. Once, checking email another browsing a shopping cart, even crashed when going over a database on my localhost; so unfortunately i cant give any more details as to what i have specifically been doing to cause the crash.

I'm well aware of the the fact this is a BETA version as i'm a fond firefox user.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Unfortunately I cant - not sure what the common denominator is, however if more people give the same error, maybe you can figure out what the problem is.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
n/a

Expected Results:  
n/a

Will file a new bug report if i can figure out what i did similarly at all of these occurencies.
