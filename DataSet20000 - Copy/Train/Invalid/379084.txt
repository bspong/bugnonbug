<applet></applet> causes browser to hang

A webpage containing "<applet></applet>" (no attributes, no child tags) hangs Firefox.  It appears to search forever for the applet, when in fact none has been specified.

As a result, the application becomes extremely unresponsive (to the point of hanging).  Closing it does not end the process, which must be killed manually.

There may be other methods of reproducing this error.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a webpage containing the HTML, "<applet></applet>"
2. Load the page
Actual Results:  
Extreme slowdown, hanging

Expected Results:  
Handle the error gracefully.

* Ignore the tag altogether.
* Do not load the JRE but render the object (a la Opera 9)
* Load the JRE but do not instantiate a class--instead, showing an error icon (a la Internet Explorer 7)
