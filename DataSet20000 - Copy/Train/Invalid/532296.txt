FEBE appears to backup, but the progress window continues to indicate that the backup is not finished.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When backing up out of a User Account FEBE's progress bar continues a scan type action indicating that the backup is not complete.  The directory where the backup has been designated for the backups does have backups as follows:
bookmarks{default}.html; 2,546 KB
bookmarks{default}.json; 2,453 KB
FEBE data{default}.fbu; 1 KB
prefs{default}.js; 13 KB

My preferences are set up to create a backup file both when Firefox opens, and when it closes.  I did this just to test the backup capabilities

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup FEBE to indicate whether a backup is desired when opening/closing Firefox
2. Open Firefox
3. Backup progress window opens, and a progress scanner seems to indicate that the backup is proceeding.
4. The scanner never indicates the backup is complete
5. As stated above in "Details", backup files are created in a folder which has a the current date as its name.
6. I haven't tried to Restore any of these backups because I don't know if they are complete valid files.
Actual Results:  
See "Steps to Reproduce"

Expected Results:  
Backup progress window in the User Account should show completion instead of a dark strip in the progress bar that passes from left to right indicating that the backup has not completed.

I'm not sure how to classify this issue. While there seem to be backup files, I'm not sure if they are usable since the progress window never shows that the backup has completed.

I haven't checked FEBE in my Administrative Account, since I never access the Internet from it.
