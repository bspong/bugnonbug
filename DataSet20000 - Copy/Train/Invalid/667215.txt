Google toolbar is not compatible with the 5.0 update

I tried to update my browser to version 5.0 and now I cannot download or use my Google toolbar. I use google toolbar for everything including bookmarks, mail, and more. I am very irritated that this is happening. It is now a pain to get to my bookmarks and I don't want to have to go to all my pages and remark them through firefox.  I like to be able to sign in on any computer and use my bookmarks. VERY DISAPPOINTED.  PLEASE FIX.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
Allowed the use of Google toolbar

Please fix
