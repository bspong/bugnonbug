saved form data not migrated
Saved form data is not migrated from IE7 using Fx3b4rc1 on Vista.

STR:
1. Run IE7 and go to www.google.com
2. Search for something like "mozilla foundation"
3. Opt to save form data when the IE7 dialog shows up after entering the above search.
4. Run the latest Fx3b4 candidate, go to the File menu and select Import. Import everything.

Expected: Once I go to www.google.com in Fx3b4 and start to type "mozilla fou..." the search should be autocompleted thanks to the saved form data import.

Actual: Fx3b4 does not autocomplete my search.
