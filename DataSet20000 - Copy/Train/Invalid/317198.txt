Internationalisation: SVG systemlanguage should allow one download, to work in many languages

When I open Safari the button labels are in the OS system language.
When I change the OS system language, by rebooting, the labels change.

Using Firefox, for example I need to download a different beta for each language. This is one hell of a lot of duplication, and downloading, for very little extra text.

This is a real issue, if like me you are creating a  homepage in many languages, and want to check the results in each one.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open application
2.change OS system language
3.reboot
4.open application
Actual Results:  
language of labels on buttons remains in say "English"

Expected Results:  
language should change to respond to change in system language

a very loosely related SVG example http://peepo.co.uk/index.svg that should work, but doesn't yet:
