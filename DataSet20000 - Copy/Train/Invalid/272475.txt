css does not render if doctype is XHTML 1.1
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/168 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/168

This page, for some reason, does not render the css at all.  It is valid XHTML 1.1 and the CSS validates as 
well, so in theory the HTML is correct.

If I remove the doctype line from the page, it renders correctly.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to the web site

Actual Results:  
page renders with no style

Expected Results:  
page renders with style (tables with various blue hues)
