Firefox 3.5.7 hangs indefinitely at this page, clicking on the page turns it pale.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7

If I open the page to see the list of Usenet groups (many lines of data) Firefox starts loading it, and then comes to a grinding halt when the page is part loaded. No escape possible except shut down of Firefox. Given that this is merely a list of inoperative hyperlinks to some 100k newsgroups, it seems unlikely that it is due to non compliant code.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to URL. 
2. When page load stops, try to do something
3. 
Actual Results:  
The page starts displaying, but when some or all is loaded (the side button is pretty small) loading stops and Firefox is seen to be in total paralysis. Can't change tabs, only way out is to exit browser. 

Expected Results:  
I expected the full list of Newsgroups carried by astraweb to be displayed.

This bug happened every time with Firefox 3.5.7. However, Internet Explorer 8 loaded the full page like a lamb.
