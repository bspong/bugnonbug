firefox includes unnecessary vc8 dlls
msvcm80.dll and msvcp80.dll don't appear to be imported by firefox.exe.  it only needs msvcr80.dll, so i think we can probably reduce the download size by not including the two unused dlls.  or, am i mistaken?  are those other dlls lazily loaded via LoadLibrary?
