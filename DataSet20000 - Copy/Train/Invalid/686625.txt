Steps to reproduce:

I just updated the Firefox Nightly from the Mozilla repositores on Ubuntu 11.04, 64bit. Now I run Firefox 9.0a1 (2011-09-13)


Actual results:

All seems to work, except the individual tabs don't have the [x] for closing anymore. See attached screenshot.


Expected results:

The [x] for closing individual tabs should still be there.
