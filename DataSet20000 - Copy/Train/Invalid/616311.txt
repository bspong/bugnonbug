the bottom curves connecting the tabs to the main toolbars are asymmetrical, with the left side not overlapping the curve for the left inactive tab, unlike the right side

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. have many tabs open with a middle one selected

Actual Results:  
left and right connecting curves differ

Expected Results:  
should be the same, both like the right curve

most visible on win xp, the transparent areo borders hide the problem.

both curves should be a little bigger, like the mac theme and mockups(another bug)
