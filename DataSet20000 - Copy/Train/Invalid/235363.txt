When trying to access a .php file inside of an html page with <iframe> (where
the php file is being loaded inside the iframe) firefox promts the  download
dialog, if you click open it opens the php file in a new window (not a new tab)
and the iframe remains blank rather than loading inside the iframe.  clicking
save just save to disk like any other file

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.navigate to http://www.laurelglenbible.org/highschool/

3.click open or save

Actual Results:  
either .php file loads in a new window rather than in the iframe or you save the
.php file to the disk and nothing else happens.

Expected Results:  
load the .php file inside of the iframe like any normal .html file would
