In the above site, a music in embeded and FireFox reports the following error:

The movie “pcp_download.php” can’t be opened.

However, as you see in below, "php_download.php" is just a web application that downloads the actual music, and the complete url should be "http://cfs11.planet.daum.net/upload_control/pcp_download.php?fhandle=NXJWcGxAZnMxMS5wbGFuZXQuZGF1bS5uZXQ6LzE2MDkyMjQ2LzAvNTkud21h&amp;filename=59.wma" and the extension is wma.

Note also, that IE, Safari and other browsers don't exhibit this problem.
Only FireFox has have this problem for many years and have not been fixed yet.
A lot of Korean portals use this method to link the music, but since FireFox cannot recognize  this kind of type url and thus cannot play the music, FireFox becomes the least favorite browser in S. Korea, which also causes Linux to be unpopular. I think that this should be fixed as soon as possible, so that general public in S. Korea may also recognize FireFox as "functioning" browser. At this moment, FireFox is not considered as a "functioning" browser in there, for various reasons, and this is one of the chief reasons. Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the indicated web page.
2. The music should be played ( it's wma file )
3. FireFox indicates that it needs plugin to be installed.
Actual Results:  

In case of Mac (with Flip4Mac installed), it says: 
"The movie “pcp_download.php” can’t be opened."

Expected Results:  
The wma file should be played as in other browsers (ex IE, Safari )
