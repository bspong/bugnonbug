Any java applet within a webpage will not run, even though the correct java plugin is shown to be installed in Minefield. Webpages display messages similar to "java must be enabled for this content to display." I have reinstalled the latest Java 7 beta which is supposed to work with 64-bit browsers, but to no effect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load any web page with a java applet, such as the URL I provided.
2. 
3.
Actual Results:  
Java applet would not load, and a message is usually displayed saying that I need to have java installed.

Expected Results:  
The applet should have loaded.
