The embed tag which is no longer part of the html 4.01 specification is required
for firefox to display flash content as opposed to the object tag which is part
of the standard and supported by internet explorer.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the website.
2. The flash file will be missing but the website will verify as valid html.
3. Go to http://www.rabiner.net, the flash will appear but the addition of embed
tags makes the page not compatible with webstandards.

Actual Results:  
on /noembed.html, the flash movie does not appear.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should Support object tags.
