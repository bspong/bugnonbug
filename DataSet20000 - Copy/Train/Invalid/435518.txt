Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008051202 Firefox/3.0

The Accept Button does not turn BLUE after you scroll down the EULA on FF3. 

Actual Result observed: None of the buttons on the bottom of the latest EULA get focus.

Expected result: The 3D Accept button turns blue- gets focus after user scrolls down to bottom of EULA

Steps to recreate this bug:

1  download FF3 
2. install onto your Hard drive
3 when the EULA notice appears. scroll down to the bottom
4. Notice - the Accept button does NOT gain focus
