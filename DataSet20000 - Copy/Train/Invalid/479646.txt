Firefox cannot properly display a Flash site that contains any FLVPlayback or other component referencing a resource using the "\" character.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011913 Firefox/3.0.6

Firefox 3.0.6 with Flash 10.0.12, cannot properly display flash site which has a component like the FlV Playback component that is linking to a file using the "\" character in the path name.

For example, a path that causes the problem looks like this:

"assets\videos\video1.flv"

A path that does not cause the problem looks like this:

"assets/videos/video1.flv"

I can view the a flash site with other browsers (Chrome, IE7, Safari) when it contains paths written like the first example, but Firefox cannot read the path correctly, and in Firebug I noticed it erroring out at that point, which causes the flash site to malfunction.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox.

2. Browse the malfunctioning version of my site at (http://www.mfvisuals.com/index_bad.html).

3. Browse the working version of my site at (http://www.mfvisuals.com/index.html).
Actual Results:  
After step 2, the site will load but reel video does not stream and buttons do not work. Music does play however.


Expected Results:  
Everything works (see step 3 for working version)

Again, it is the difference between using "\" and "/" in the path name, but Firefox simply cannot decipher the former correctly.
