on-page function fail, restart issues

I recently installed the latest update to firefox and I have been having problems with the application since. Specifically when I try to print using an on-page link the function doesn't work (nothing visible happens.) In order to use the functionality I have to access the page with explorer. This is true of other functions also.

Also, when I close firefox in an session and then try to reopen it later it won't reopen until I kill the foxfire process in Task Manager and then firefox opens with the web page from the previous session.

This has all started happening since the latest update was installed. I hate having to go back to explorer for so much.

Reproducible: Sometimes
