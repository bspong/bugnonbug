Firefox 3.0.1 crashes frequently during VPN connection

When I am using a VPN connection (via the Cisco VPN client), Firefox will frequently crash. It seems to be somewhat related to certain pages, but not entire sites. Revisiting a page that was loading when the browser crashed will often cause it to crash again.

However, it has also crashed during periods of inactivity (maybe AJAX?).

When I am not connected via VPN, Firefox does not crash. I have attempted to disable/uninstall all of my plugins, with no noticeable result.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Connect via VPN. (I am only able to try this with one VPN client and only have one VPN network to connect to.)
Actual Results:  
Firefox unexpectedly crashes.

Expected Results:  
Browsing should have continued uninterrupted.

The network being VPNed into uses software called iPrism to block inappropriate sites. Crashes don't happen on pages that would require action by iPrism, but I thought its presence was worth mentioning.
