Single search-term in address-bar searches by default using search.netscape.com

When typing a single search-term into the address/location bar, the search is
always carried out by search.netscape.com (there seems to be no way of altering
this).  If more than one search-term is entered in, an "I'm feeling lucky"
search is performed using google.

The search method that is used when words are entered into the location bar
should be configurable, and should be consistent for single or multiple-terms
(when not using specific keywords (i.e. not using 'google' or 'dict' as the
first word)).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Type in 'test' (without quotes) in the location bar and press enter
2.  Type in 'test test' (without quotes) in the location bar and press enter

(this assumes that 'test' is not a keyword registered with the browser (as
'google' and 'dict' are))
Actual Results:  
1.  Goes to
http://search.netscape.com/ns/search?fromPage=nsBrowserRoll&query=test page
2.  Goes to same page which doing a google "i'm feeling lucky" search on "test
test" goes to

Expected Results:  
Assuming that there is a setting available to choose what the 'non-keyword'
search behavior should be, and that this setting is set to "google i'm feeling
lucky search", then the results should be:
1.  Go to "i'm  feeling lucky" page for "test"
2.  Go to "i'm  feeling lucky" page for "test test"  <performed as expected>
