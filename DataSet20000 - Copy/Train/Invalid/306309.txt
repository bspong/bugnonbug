Deep Park Alpha 2: Whenever I try to get to the options window (tools -> options) the options window steals the focus but opens in the background and it is not really accessible.

Whenever I try to get to the options window (tools -> options) the options
window steals the focus but opens in the background and it is not really
accessible. All I see are just 3 buttons (ok, cancel, help) and the only way I
could continue working is like pressing the OK or Cancel button.

As in the help about the build # is missing, I send you the most detailed
information I could get:

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b3) Gecko/20050712
Firefox/1.0+

Note that on 08/28/2005 I downloaded Deep Park 2 at home and there was no such
an issue although I have been using quite the same OS, Software, hardware
configuration. 



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to get to the options window (Tools -> Options).

Actual Results:  
the options window steals the focus but opens in the background and it is not
really accessible. All I see are just 3 buttons (ok, cancel, help) and the only

Expected Results:  
One might think that the 'options' window should have been opened normally and
not in the background stealing focus :-).
