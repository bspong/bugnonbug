We have a internal web application powered by struts framework. The images and
menu navigation is developed through Macromedia Fireworks. The problem is when
using FireFox (1.0 pre-release and the 0.9) the menu does not work. No errors
seen but the pop-up menu does not work. I use firefox for almost everything but
for just this one reason I am using IE. If I can be more helpful, please let me
know. Thanks.
