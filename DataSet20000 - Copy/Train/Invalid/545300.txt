computer locks up once or twice per day.  I have to unplug it to shut it down as Ctrl Alt Delete will not kick me out of Firefox browser.  I am not able to identify a particular type of site that causes this.  

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to a site and try to scroll down and the computer locks up.
2. It seems to be random
3. Ctrl Alt Delete has no effect.  Try to shut down computer with on/off button and that doesn't work.  I unplug the computer to shut it down
Actual Results:  
Randomly locks up


I notice alot of bug reports regarding locked up computers and doubt that my report is plowing any new ground.  However, having to un-plug my computer to exit the locked up browser isn't something I have seen reported.
