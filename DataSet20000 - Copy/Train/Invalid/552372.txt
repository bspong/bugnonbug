Firefox 3.6 very slow loading account pages from chaseonline.chase.com

When I login to my banking account on chase.com, every selection I make results in a long delay for the page to load. During this time, firefox stops responding entirely - that page and all other windows/tabs open.  This problem started a couple weeks ago (around the time I upgraded to v3.6?) and does not occur if I load the same pages with IE. The main login page for accounts (https://chaseonline.chase.com/Logon.aspx) does this, and does not require a chase bank account.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox
2. Open IE
3. Go to https://chaseonline.chase.com/Logon.aspx in both browsers. IE loads much faster than FF.
4. Hit back on both browsers. Hit forward on both and again IE loads much faster than FF.
5. Same thing happens if you login with an account, and go from page to page under the account. But other links from the main page do not have the problem.
Actual Results:  
FF takes several seconds to load and goes unresponsive during this time. It isn't the site itself, because IE does not have this problem.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should load the page as quickly as IE under same conditions (like at same time, on same computer).

Loaded the page in same time as IE. Do not go unresponsive during delay between pages.

I am using FF 3.6.  My computer has Windows XP Media Center Edition. It is a Dell XPS M1710 notebook. I have tried using a new profile and clearing my browser cache & history.
