My FF browse will not switch rendering engines and make a new tab for IExplorer. There is a FF add on involved but I am not aware of any operational difficulties with it. However, the browser will load an external IE, if I hold down the control key.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install add on
2.press toolkit button for engine switch
3.
Actual Results:  
FF freezes while opening the new tab. Restart is then necessary

Expected Results:  
Created a new tab with IE availability.

The add on is IE Tab by PCMan (Hong Jen Lee)
