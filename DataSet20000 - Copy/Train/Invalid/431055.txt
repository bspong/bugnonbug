IIRC in Firefox 2, the Back button and Forward button both had popup menus which you could open by clicking and keeping pressed the button. So you could directly jump to any desired point in the browsing history of the current tab.

However now in Firefox 3 Beta 5 I see the Back button no longer has the popup menu. I use the Back button popup menu very regularly and much more than the Forward button popup menu. I presume there are thousands of people out there like me.

Please reinstate the Back button popup menu.

Reproducible: Always
