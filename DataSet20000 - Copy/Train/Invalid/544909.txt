When trying to take of the problem none of control panel applications don't have any access to them due to the virus as the Security Warning states as it pops up everytime I click on it. Not only that it pops up every 2 secs without any activity and a antivirus software alert (that looks fake) pops up every 20 secs but if click it will lead you to purchase a new antivirus software right after that a porn website pops up. The fire wall status will say out of date and instanly change to the on position
