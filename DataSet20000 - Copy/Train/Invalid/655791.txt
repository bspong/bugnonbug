crashes when SSRS reports are open for an unpredictable amount of time [@ npcoralietab.dll@0x36d58 ]
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I have two windows ALWAYS open which display dashboards that autorefresh every 5 and 30 seconds.  These dashboards are Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports that are uploaded to Report Manager (accessed by the default web site on the server).  The report are viewed using IE Tab + as they were not formatting correctly in Firefox.
Starting last week Firefox is crashing several times a day.  Prior to this we had a beautiful dashboard solution in place.  I upgraded Firefox to 4.0 but then quickly realized that since it disabled the Microsoft .NET Framework the scrollbars became permanent and everything I tried to get rid of them failed.
I then went back to 3.6 and it crashed about 1 1/2 hours later.
I can't have it crashing as this is live real-time information that the entire company views.
Please help!

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open SSRS report using URL above

Firefox crashes
