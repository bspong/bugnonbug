Intermittently, and, lately it has been happening often, I select a hyperlink, and, initially, I get an error indicating that the connection with the server was reset, and, the web-page is not displayed.  This happens within a few seconds.  Then I select 'Try again' and the webpage is loaded.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Last time this happened I:
1. Browsed to http://www.w7forums.com/windows-7-beta-now-available-t77.html
2. Found the 'This link' hyperlink (http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/), 
   which by default opens a new tab with the webpage.

Actual Results:  
The webpage is not displayed and error is displayed indicating that the connection with the server was reset.

Expected Results:  
Webpage should be loaded.
