Open Link in New Tab/ Ctrl+Click does nothing. In Gecko 20050511 it works.

After installing the newest nightly build it was no longer possible to open
links in new tabs, neither via context menu nor via ctrl+click.
I found this problem also in a nightly build of 1.0.5de last week and returned
to 1.0.4de. Now i realized that the problem still exists. (Maybe it's a problem
of my extensions(see list attached), but why doesn't appear that problem in
1.0.4de?)
