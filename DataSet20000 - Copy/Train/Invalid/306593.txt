where is page info in mozilla firefox? Where is File: Edit page in firefox?
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414
Build Identifier: mozilla firefox 1.0.6

In viewing any Web page in Mozilla Firefox 1.0.6, I can't View: Info, which is
necessary to find the date of publication when I need to cite that Web page.

What happened to: File: Edit Page??

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to any web page
2.go to view (there is no page info)
3.go to file (there is no edit page)

Actual Results:  
There is no page info provided
there is no file: edit page

Expected Results:  
add page info
add file: edit file

Mozilla is my preferred browser. I thought Firefox was more up-to-date.

Thanks for listening,
