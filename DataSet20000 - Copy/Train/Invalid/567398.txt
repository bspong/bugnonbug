An annoying siren and 'cartoon' sound effects audio track starts one minute after opening Firebox.  I use a Mac OS X 10.6.  I cannot turn off the audio from within Firefox.  I must hit mute on my computer to eliminate sound.  I've tried re-installing Firefox but problem persists.  I use the default theme setting.
