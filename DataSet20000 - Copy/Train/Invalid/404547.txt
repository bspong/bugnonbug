Error pages redirected to from J2EE web.xml don't render as HTML but show as text/plain

I am testing my web application with Firefox 3 BETA. When something bad happens in the application it redirects to a standard error page. This renders as HTML fine in Safari, IE and Firefox 2. In Firefox 3 it displays as plain unrendered text.

The error page is called by the J2EE web.xml deployment descriptor (very standard feature see : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web.xml)

Good luck and thanks! Loving the new FF look on the Mac. Shiney!

Cheers,

Damian.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In a J2EE (JEE) Application cause an application error
2. The application will attempt to render the error page
3. FF3 displays the unrendered HTML
Actual Results:  
FF3 displays unrendered HTML

Expected Results:  
FF3 should render the HTML and display as normal page

I wouldn't normally say that this is a major but I suspect it's caused by a background reRender problem so maybe symptomatic of something deeper?
