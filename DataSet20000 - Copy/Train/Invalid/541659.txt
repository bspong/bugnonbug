open link in new tab doesn't work (tab control add-on)

When I middle-click on any link or right-click on the link and then select Open link in new tab - a new tab actually opens, link url is shown in address bar but the page won't load. I need left-click on address bar and press enter to start opening the page. Noticed this issue after updating Firefox to 3.6.

Reproducible: Always
