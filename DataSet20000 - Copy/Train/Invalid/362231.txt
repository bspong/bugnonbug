A few days ago Firefox starting having scrolling issues. When I start to scroll up i see a small line on the top(see screen shot) and it also freezes images (see screen shot). Nothing on the system has changed and this happens with and without smooth scrolling being checked. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Scroll down
2.Scroll Up
3.See




I also reinstalled it and it did the same thing.
