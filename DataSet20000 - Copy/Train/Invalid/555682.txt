When running the new Minefield alpha 4, I can't use the Back/forward buttons. They are always disabled. Neither do the right click: Back/forward work. I can use History menu as a temporary workaround.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a page
2. Go to another page
3. Observe how the back/forward buttons are both disabled
Actual Results:  
Back/forward buttons are disabled

Expected Results:  
Back/forward buttons should be enabled when in a history-containing context.
