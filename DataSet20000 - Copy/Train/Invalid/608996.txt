I'm mentioning it here because the issue doesn't occur in Chrome. There's a new scroll bar for the left column in Google news (US version only. Now the thing is that when scrolling the main page there (ie not the left column), all the links seem to suddenly disappear. Okay that's not easy to describe. In fact all the google news links and summaries are pushed back to the bottom of the screen.
 Don't know where the bug comes from, Google or Firefox...probably a compatibility issue. Again this doesn't happen in Chrome.

Reproducible: Always
