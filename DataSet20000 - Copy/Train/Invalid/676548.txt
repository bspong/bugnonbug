Firefox vs IE result.doc

User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; InfoPath.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; AskTB5.6)

Steps to reproduce:

J2EE application deployed under IBM WAS 6.1 and client is accessing the apps using web browser.


Actual results:

There is a scrollable box / frame to populate records. The box will only fit 8 records and can be scrolled up and down to see previous/next records. 
Using Internet Explorer (or Firefox 3.5), the display result is normal. 
But using Firefox 5.0 or Firefox 5.0.1, all the records were displayed and spill outside the frame.


Expected results:

We like Firefox very much, but our corporate user cannot use this Firefox version anymore due to this spill out.
