Continuous and highly disturbing popups advertising Personal Security Software products

I get a continuous popup when using Firefox which begins with a yellow diamond with an exclamation mark(!)in my system tray lower right handside of my screen. Some minutes later a popup window appears that I may have some kind of security problem. When I click on the icon a new window pops up titled Personal Security Center. It is advertising Ultimate Fixer, Ultimate Defender, Ultimate Cleaner, and Security Monitor. I am not interested in any of these products.

I have no idea how to fix this problem.

I am not interested in this product and need to know how to stop this disturbing problem.  Please advise.

Regards,  Jack Bell
