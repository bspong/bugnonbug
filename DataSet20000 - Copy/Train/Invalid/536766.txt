Following instructions for deleting items in autocomplete menu ( http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Smart+Location+Bar#Settings ), scroll to item to delete and hit delete. The item is removed from the list as expected.  

However, the next time the autocomplete menu is brought up, the item previously "delete" reappears.

The item is in my Bookmarks.  It will be removed if removed from Bookmarks. However,it should be removed from the list in the autocomplete menu whether or not it is bookmarked (the behavior in V 3.5.6).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set options to show autocomplete for bookmarks (or bookmarks and history)
2.Delete item in autocomplete menu and close the menu
3.Reopen autocomplete meun. Voila...it should still be there
