With the new 3.6.14 upgrade, window.openDialog no longer stalls code until the window closes.

After making a call to window.openDialog in the previous version of FF, the code would wait for a response from that window.  Now it seems that the code no longer waits for a response from that window.  This makes using information from that window difficult.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
The software ignored any input from opened dialogs. 

Expected Results:  
The software should stop and wait for a response from that window before it continues.
