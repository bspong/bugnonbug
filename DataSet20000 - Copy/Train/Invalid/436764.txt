Special urlescaped characters such as apostrophe (%27) are unescaped before the JavaScript call is made, causing the call to fail with a syntax error.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the URL http://jssp.de/FirefoxBugTest.html
2. Click the link "Test bug"
3. Have a look at the error on the console
Actual Results:  
The JavaScript execution fails.

Expected Results:  
The JavaScript function test(a, b) is called

While unescaping of href content may be ok for ordinary links it should be disabled for links starting with "javascript:".
