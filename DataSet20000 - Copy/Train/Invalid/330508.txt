New bookmarks menu reverts bookmarks

Upon restarting firefox after installing the latest automatic download, I went to browse my bookmarks and found that they have reverted to where they were on March 1, 2006.

I tried to resolve this by exiting firefox, copying bookmarkbackups/bookmarks-2006-03-14.html to bookmarks.html, and finally restarting firefox, but that did not restore my lost bookmarks.

I also tried going to Organize Bookmarks, File->Import and that did not bring up a dialog box at all.

Reproducible: Always
