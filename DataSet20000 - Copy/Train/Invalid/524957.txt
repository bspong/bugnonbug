When reopening a session with many many tabs (80+) firefox seems to load the pages mostly on a tab-by-tab basis instead of fetching all HTML/CSS/JS first and then loading the heavy-weight content (images, flash, pdfs).

Since i have many image-heavy pages in my session it can take several minutes until everything is loaded. I'd like to browse the remaining (mostly text-based) pages before everything is done loading.

I propose an option to queue the requests globally based on expected content-type instead of queueing things tab by tab. Or if it's not possible to do based on content-type then at least load images last, globally.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open many tabs
2. Enable session restore
3. Restart Firefox
4. Trace the order in which content is fetched (e.g. with the live http headers extension)

Actual Results:  
Watch how not even the HTML is fetched for some tabs until other tabs have loaded completely

Expected Results:  
The basic page being fetched/rendered first before the fluff is loaded
