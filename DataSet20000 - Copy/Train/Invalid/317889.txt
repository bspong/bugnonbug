My problem with Firefox is as stated in the summary, it just won't release memory back to the OS.
In my normal usage I open lots of tabs and new windows, memory consumption goes up, but when I close them, it doesn't go down. It's very annoying for me to have to restart Firefox when that happens.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start firefox 
2. Open three tabs and use this in websites
3. Close tabs 

Actual Results:  
The memory used on navigation with 3 tabs is the same when I close this

Expected Results:  
Release memory back to the OS.

Debian GNU/Linux
Kernel 2.6.14.2
Gnome 2.10
I created a NEW profile to make the test


Browsers:
