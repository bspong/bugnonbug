flash player debugger gets reported as crashed when debugging takes long

When debugging in flash, with flash player debugger, when a breakpoint is hit, flash builder is being open in debug mode and I can check all variables and stuff, the problem is that flash player suddenly stops working and I lose the debugging info because firefox kills it. In chrome, it displays a window asking what to do, which is optimal.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. make project in flash builder and set a breakpoint
2. run project in debug mode
3. when breakpoint hits, wait a few minutes
Actual Results:  
Firefox kills flash player plugin thinking it has crashed

Expected Results:  
ask me if I want to wait for the plugin to respond or if it actually crashed and I want to kill it.

This problem is key for flash and flex developers, it's the main reason of why I don't use firefox as default browser, therefore I don't use it at all.
