Firefox worked yesterday, will not work today.  

Reproducible: Always

2. Attempt to load from programs/firefox/firefox(safemode)...nothing happens.
3. Attempt to run as administrator...nothing happens.



I terminated some services (and put some others in 'manual' mode) in Vista yesterday to reduce its memory footprint. And (or course) I did not keep a list of items changed. Please advise which services or groups of said Firefox relies on.  

Explorer still works btw. :-(
