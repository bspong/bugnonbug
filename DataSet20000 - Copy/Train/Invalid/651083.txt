suppose there is a add on which adds an toolbar button . and it has as icon sized at some higher resolution for e.g. 200*300 then it should be resized to the 16*16 image. It was been resized in earlier version of firefox. but it is not resizing in latest version. So , many times its quite annoying to see such a big icon for any toolbarbutton.

Reproducible: Always
