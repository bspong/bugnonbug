If one manually deletes pages from history, but views a page with links to those pages, the links are (sometimes) still highlighted as visited links.

The assumption is that URLs manually deleted from history somehow still remain there, even though they are not visible.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clear history
2. Visit a site
3. In history side panel, manually delete all references to that site
4. Exit Firefox and restart
5. Visit a page that links to the site (e.g. Google a term where that site shows up)

Actual Results:  
Often (but not always) the page is highlighted as having been visited, even though the entry for that page has been manually cleared from history.



Expected Results:  
The page should not show up as having been visited
