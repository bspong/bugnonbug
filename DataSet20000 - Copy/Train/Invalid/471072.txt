BBC site embedded videos are shifted down covering subsequent page content

The embedded BBC videos which are as wide as the text column are shifted downwards by the amount approximately equal to their height, thus hiding some page content.  This does not happen when the video is narrower (1/2 of the text column).  The only workaround I've found is to use AddBlock addon to block all BBC videos.  Versions 2.* of Firefox did the same thing.  I reported this to BBC webmaster as well but they never even acknowledged it may be a problem with their site.  I tested the same pages with Safari on Mac and they worked correctly.
