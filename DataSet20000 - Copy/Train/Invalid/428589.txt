URLencoding inappropriately expanded within href
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.13) Gecko/20080311 Firefox/2.0.0.13

The following code (as an example) is inappropriately URLdecoded

<a href="javascript:func('Joe%27s%20Pizza')">LINK</a>

Hovering over the word LINK shows the following in the status bar:

javascript:func('Joe's Pizza')

and clicking the link causes an error because of the mismatched single quotes.

the link should remain as:
javascript:func('Joe%27s%20Pizza') 

which would behave as expected


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. build a page with the following:
<a href="javascript:func('Joe%27s%20Pizza')">LINK</a>

2. hover over the link and observe the status bar

3. click the link and observe the error
Actual Results:  
Firefox sends javascript:func('Joe's Pizza') as the link, and fails.

Expected Results:  
Firefox ought to send javascript:func('Joe%27s%20Pizza') as the link thus preserving the correct function parameter as coded.
