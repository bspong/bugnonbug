Crash at random interval after Firefox started up before running Thunderbird
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

Vague impression: Firefox much more 'flakey' after installing 1.5.0.1 update.
 
Reproducible: Start up FF then run Thunderbird email (v1.5). At a random interval FF with 2 or more windows and several tabs open Firefox will literally quit and disappear with no error reporting. I then shut machine down and restart and load up Thunderbird prior to running Firefox. Extensions installed include Feedview, Adblock, Scrapbook, Colorzilla, JustBlogIt!, SessionSaver (which will retrieve the  sessions opened just before the crash), Sage, Web Developer, del.icio.us, FireFTP, enhanced History manager, Performancing, SpellBound Development.
None of these caused any problems before the .0.1 'upgrade'. (I might uninstall SpellBound just to check that this is not doing the damage.)

This Tiddlywiki site works fine in Mozilla (1.7.10) and did work properly in Firefox before the .0.1 update:

Now, FF will not load the page.
