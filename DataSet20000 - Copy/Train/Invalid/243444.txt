basic property (html/css) not correctly rendered
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows 98)

The code of the page goes like (semantically):

<!-- snip --> 
<body> 
 <div style="text-align:center;" name="toplevel"> 
  Some-Text-1 
  <div style="width:780px;" name="lowerlevel"> 
   Some-Text2 
  </div> 
  <table style="width:780px;" name="lowerlevel"> 
   <!-- snip --> 
  </table> 
 </div> 
</body> 
</html> 

For some reason, the two "lowerlevel" children (div and table) 
of the "toplevel"-div are not centered (while Some-Text-1, of 
course, is). 
(they are positioned fully to the left, as one would expect from 
text-align:left). 

Reading css & html standard documentation, as I understand it, 
all children should be positioned the same way, independently, 
if they are <![CDATA[]]> or further html-elements... 

(Also, IE renders it, as expected (even if that does not mean
anything ;-)

Is something wrong with my interpretation, or is this indeed 
a rendering bug in Firefox? 


It seems to me, that centering objects is quite an important
and basic feature that should be correctly handled.
