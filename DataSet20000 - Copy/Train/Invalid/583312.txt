URL bar has no transparency when not focused when using lightweight themes
Previously on Firefox, when a Persona was installed, the URL bar has some transparency.

With Firefox 4, the URL bar has no transparency which means Personas don't look good.

Best solution would be to recreate the URL bar images with some transparency. Alternatively I think what Firefox 3.6 did was do a 90% opacity on the URL bar.
