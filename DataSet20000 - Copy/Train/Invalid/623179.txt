Right Click Context Menu: Doesn't appear when right clicking on images with ONE click [caused by Image Zoom 0.4.6]

Whenever I right click on any webpage, the context menu opens up immediately. However when right clicking on any image, the menu will not appear unless I right-click twice. It's rather annoying as I save images from various websites rather frequently.

This isn't a problem with firefox 3.6 so I'm rather surprised to this issue with 4.0 betas
