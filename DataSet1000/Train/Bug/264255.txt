Forms don't work with ISO-2022-CN
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041013 Firefox/0.10

I worked with a web page developer whose page used the ISO-2022-CN Chinese
character set.  It turns out that form data does not get transmitted back to the
server with this character set.  Using the GET method, all that shows in the URL
is the equals sign, not the field name or contents.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run script CGI included below.
2. Enter some text in the box
3. Submit.
4. Look at the URL  

Actual Results:  
The page reference will fail, but that isn't a problem.  The URL will have an =
without the field name beforehand or the contents afterwards.

Expected Results:  
The field name and contents should be in the URL.

CGI script to demonstrate the problem.  I don't have a handy public server to
demonstrate the problem from.


----------------------------------------------

#!/usr/bin/perl -T

use strict;

use CGI qw/:standard/;

print header(-charset => 'ISO-2022-CN'),
        start_html(-title => "A simple example");
print '<form action="bin/echo-form.cgi" method=get>

<p>This form uses the get method.

<p>Click the Submit query button.

<p><input type=text name=textinput value="Hello, world.">

<p><input type=submit>

<p>After you click the Submit query button, check the Location: box.

<p>The original URL should have the following string appended to it:

<p>?text_input=Hello%2C+world.

</form>',
        end_html;
