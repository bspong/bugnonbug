At random times, certain pages never finish loading, even when Mozilla and IE have no problem
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1

Sometimes (more and more often lately) when I try to load a page (examples: 
http://login.postini.com  and  http://www.mozilla.org/quality/bug-writing-
guidelines.html) the page never finished loading.  The progress bar stops 
moving before reaching the end, the word "Loading..." remains on the tab, and 
the logo keeps spinning, on both the tab and the main window.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enter the URL and press the <enter> key
-or-
2.Paste the URL and click the GO button
-or-
3.Paste the URL with "Paste & GO"

I've reproduces with the following URLs:

http://login.postini.com

http://www.mozilla.org/quality/bug-writing-guidelines.html


Actual Results:  
The page never finishes loading.  The progress bar stops moving before 
reaching the end, the word "Loading..." remains on the tab, and the logo keeps 
spinning, on both the tab and the main window.

(And if you quit the window the process remains forever!!!  But that's another 
bug alread in the database.)

5...10....15 qand more minutes later, they're still going.


Expected Results:  
The page loads and displays and the progress bar clears and the spinning logos 
quit spinning and the status text "Loading..." disappears.
