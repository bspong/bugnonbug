Parts of page are completely non-interactive
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1

Firefox (and possibly other mozilla products) seem to fail to allow
interactivity with some components of my webpage - the main panel.  There is no
scripting that Firefox should see (one cond comment to get IE to show PNG's).

What is strange, is that the problem only relates to a particular part of the
webpage, and it completely disables everything in that area including windows
provided scrollbars, while not doing so in other browsers (otherwise I'd think
it was a layering problem).

Interestingly, this part of the page is delivered by a complicated server
backend, but that should be completely hidden from the browser, right?  If not,
let me know and I'll see if I can tinker with the server side stuff.

If anyone has any suggestions as to how I can reacquire this part of my webpage,
I would appreciate it.  Thanks for you help.
