Phoenix should provide "Extension Preferences" to display a preferences UI for
installed extensions.  Currently extensions wishing to implement a preferences
UI must overlay the prefs panel.  This seems like a suboptimal solution. 
Ideally the extension could specify in its contents.rdf the chrome url of its
preferences dialog, i.e.:

<RDF:Description about="urn:mozilla:package:textlink"
        chrome:displayName="Text Links"
        chrome:author="Ted Mielczarek"
        chrome:name="textlink"
	chrome:extension="true"
	chrome:description="Allow navigation to plain text urls"
        chrome:prefs="chrome://textlink/textlinkPrefs.xul">

Phoenix could then have an "Extension Preferences" button in the extensions
panel that would display this prefs dialog.  The main advantage would be keeping
the Phoenix prefs panel uncluttered and consistent regardless of installed
plugins.  It would also make it easy for extension authors to add preferences
without spending time wondering which prefs page to shoehorn them under.
