Firefox stops responding to keyboard/mouse input

At random times firebird stops responding to keyboard/mouse input.  

This usually seems to happen when I'm trying to type into the url bar so it may
be focus related however once firebird enters this state, it hangs completely. 
No keyboard input is accepted nor is any mouse input.  Minimizing and
redisplaying the browser results in correct redisplay, but no user input is
accepted.  The browser must then be killed by hand. 

Simple tests like switching windows (or switching desktops) seem to make no
difference.  

I have tab extensions and radial context installed.  

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start browsing.
2. Switch to url bar to type/change a url.
3. Repeat until browser hangs.   Eventually firebird pretty much always hangs
when I do this, but how long it takes varies from a few minutes to a few hours.   
Actual Results:  
Browser hangs.  Does not accept keyboard/mouse input. 

Expected Results:  
Not hang. 

Linux - several releases of linux do the same thing.  I dont use windows often
enough to know if it occurs there.  

Tab extensions and readial context installed.
