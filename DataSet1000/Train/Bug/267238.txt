Note that you may have to set up a login on the Motley Fool site, and log in, to
see this issue.  

When browsing on Motley Fool, many pages are shown "doubled".  Clicking on a
link on the "top" copy moves you to the "bottom" copy, and clicking on the link
there takes you to the actual referenced page. 

When browsing this same page using IE you only see the content once.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an account on Motley Fool 
2. Log in
3. Call up a quote for any stock symbol, for instance ORCL or MSFT.
4. Observe the page is shown twice.
5. In the top half, click on the link for "chart".
6. Observe it repositions the page at the second copy of the page.
7. Click the "chart" link there.
8. Chart appears.
9. Twice!
10. Repeat with IE.
11. Observe "normal" behavior (for a Microsoft product).

Actual Results:  
You will see the pages generated from Motley Fool are shown in the browser
window two times.

Expected Results:  
Show the content one time.

I have installed the Adblock extension, and have various filters set up,
including blocking from g.fool.com  They have a lot of annoying ads.
