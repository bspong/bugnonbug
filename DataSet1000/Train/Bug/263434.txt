If the only window you have open in Firefox is the bookmarks manager, then
opening a new browser window can be tricky.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the bookmarks manager.
2. Close all other windows.
3. Click in the bookmarks manager window (notice the menu bar changes to the
bookmarks manager context).
4. Try to open a new browser window.
Actual Results:  
It's hard. Since the bookmarks manager changes the menu bar, there is no CMD-N
or File -> New Window. The only two ways I've found how to do it are:

1. Close the bookmarks manager window and try again.

2. Hit CMD-TAB until you select the super-secret invisible window (see #168692
and #223545), then the menu changes back and you can try again.

Expected Results:  
You know what? I have no idea. I expected to be able to open a new browser
window, but I haven't the foggiest idea how to be presented with the opportunity
that retains any kind of UI consistency.

It's probably useful to note that workaround #2 (above) is probably no longer
going to work since the super-secret invisible window is no longer accessible.

It may be that the best thing is just to leave the behavior and require that
people close the bookmarks manager to open a new browser window. Or perhaps put
a "New Window" command in the bookmarks manager's File menu? I dunno. It's late.
My head hurts. :-)
