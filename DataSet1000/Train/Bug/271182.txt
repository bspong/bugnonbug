once the music stops playing, attempting to use any of the controls in the
player (pop up) window will freeze firefox, and sometimes the whole computer.  
I opened the webpage in IE (not the main page, but if you select a station and
are listening to it), and it did stop after a while.   Eventually the player
window changed to 'server not found', but it did not freeze up.  Choosing a
different station from my favorites (in main window, not the player window)
caused the station to change and begin playing the new station (in IE).   In
Firefox this also causes a freezeup.  

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.I start www.icebergradio.com
2.login, go to favorites
3.play a station
4.after some random period of time the music will stop
5.if I ignore the player things are ok, but if I attempt to change anything such
as the station (by clicking on a different one in main tab/window), or by
clicking stop or play in the player window, it locks up the player and shortly
after the computer

Actual Results:  
firefox froze, then computer froze

Expected Results:  
change to different station if server failed, or restart, or stop, or close
player window if click on close
