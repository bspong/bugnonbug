Upon reaching the "Website Certified by an Unknown Authority" dialog (you get
one by trying to reach the url given), the "Examine Certificate..." button has
focus.  Pressing TAB moves focus to the middle of the three radio buttons:

( ) Accept this certificate permanently
(*) Accept this certificate temporarily for this session
( ) Do not accept this certificate and do not connect to this Web site

At this point, pressing the up-arrow moves focus *down*, and the down-arrow
moves focus *up*.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Attempt to connect to a site with a certificate that isn't issued by a
recognized authority.
2. Press TAB to move focus to the radio buttons.
3. Use the up and down arrow keys.

Actual Results:  
Up and down arrow keys move focus down and up.

Expected Results:  
The up-arrow should move focus up, and the down-arrow should move focus down.

I've seen this happen on two installs of Firefox 0.8; one that I've been using
since release, and one a totally fresh install.  I don't see this behavior with
Mozilla 1.6.
