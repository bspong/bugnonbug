browser sometimes hangs while opening links from other programs

Sometimes when i click on a link link in my email client (TheBat!) or Klipfolio
or my newsreader (Agent) then there will open a new tab but nothing will be
loaded and all other tabs stop loading, too. The loading animation stops also.
Firefox hangs but not completely. The process runs at 0% CPU but has to be
killed. It can't be closed normaly. 
It _may_ be possible that it will close after a lot of time, because you still
can surf the web, but it is extremely slow. I can see my traffic, and if i
reload a page, there is for moment some traffic, then it stops and after some
time simple pages are loaded. Generally speaking surfing is not possible in this
state.
In this case (it happens almost every day) i kill the process and start a new
one. Maybe because of TBE, all tabs of the last session are restored, except the
last one opened.
This never happens if i open new tabs in FF itself, only with URLS from other
apps. And it doesn't depend on the tab opened or the amount of already opened tabs.

Reproducible: Sometimes

1. open links with external programs
