displaying save as dialog instead of playing flash (swf) file
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de-DE; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

When opening an URI http://*.swf or opening a page with a flash animation as
frame, the "save as" dialog to save the .swf file appears instead of just
playing the flash animation.
When I open a page with object
classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" etc (where the flash
animation is displayed as it should be) before opening an URI http://*.swf or
opening a page with a flash animation as frame, then the animation is displayed
correctly.
Even when I close the object classid etc page, the other animations work.
When restarting the browser, the "save as" bug appears again.

Only appears in Firefox, could not reproduce it with Mozilla 1.6

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. make sure you did not display a flash file in the current browser session
2. open a pure .swf file (no html with swf inside), ie.
http://www.superlaugh.com/1/behappy.swf or http://www.darklan.com/
3. the "save as" dialog will appear instead of playing the animation

Actual Results:  
the "save as" dialog appeared to save the .swf

Expected Results:  
the .swf should be displayed

using Flash Click to View Extension, sorry I forgot to try without it, I will
post the result when turned off as comment
