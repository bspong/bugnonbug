PNG display with alpha channel corrupts background images
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6a) Gecko/20030927

The example page is displayed incorrectly in Firebird; however the nightly build
of Mozilla I have installed does not exhibit this issue, and the same page
displayed in IE with IE's alpha filters on renders correctly. Areas where one or
more alpha PNGs with semitransparent areas are visible, appear to have the
background image corrupted. I am attaching a screenshot of the corruption and a
screenshot of what it should look like.

I have a dual monitor system (one video card for each monitor), and the
corruption is visible no matter which card is being used. This suggests to me
that it is not a video driver issue (even though I still suspect it is.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open said page in Firebird 0.61 (Win32).
2. Look in the top left corner.

Actual Results:  
The background is distorted.

Expected Results:  
The background should not be distorted in areas where the overlapping image is
faintly visible.

My video cards are a Trident PCI video card (model number unknown) and an ATI
Radeon 8500LE. I am running the Trident in 16-bit and the ATI in 32-bit. Both
cards display the page properly in IE6 and Mozilla 2003092704. Firebird displays
the page incorrectly on both cards.
