Attempting to render large numbers of listboxes completely kills WinXP desktop

Attempting to render a page containing a large number of listboxes (for
instance slashdot with moderator access) can cause the entire WinXP
desktop (not just Mozilla) to become unresponsive.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE SAVED EVERYTHING ON YOUR WORKSTATION!

2. Create a web page with:

    <select id="test" >
          <option value="1" selected>Testing
          </option>
    </select>

repeated 1500 or so times. The exact amount isn't critical,
but might vary depending on the system.

3. Navigate to this page using Mozilla on WinXP.


Actual Results:  
WinXP becomes unresponsive to the extent that you can't even
bring up the task manager to kill Mozilla or shutdown the system. :(


Expected Results:  
Render the page, or at least not take down the desktop.

IE 6.0 renders the page very slowly, but does not lock up.

Note that this is a security issue as it allows a denial-of-service
attack, and possible data loss on the client as it requires a hard
reboot to recover the system.

I've noticed similar problems to this using older versions of IE
on various windows platforms, but it seems to have been fixed with
the latest IE.
