Download manager window/auto-handling settings not correctly migrated from SeaMonkey
BUILD: Nightly downloaded from
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2004-10-16-09-0.9/firefox-1.0.en-US.linux-i686.tar.gz

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
1)  Make sure there is no .mozilla/firefox directory
2)  Launch Firefox
3)  Migrate the Mozilla profile
4)  Load https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=161578&action=view

EXPECTED RESULTS:  Browser asks you what to do with the file

ACTUAL RESULTS:  The file is silently saved to $HOME, download manager never
appears.

NOTES:

Checking the preferences settings, they are set to "Save all files to this
desktop" (which explains the automatic saving to $HOME, sorta), and "Show
download manager when download begins".  "Close download manager when download
is complete" is NOT checked.

My Mozilla profile uses progress dialogs, not the download manager, and has
"close on download complete" set.  I would have expected this behavior to be
migrated, but also to be prompted for each download.

Note that a brand-new profile created by Firefox itself (not via migration)
prompts for every download.

Marking this major, since I couldn't figure out why Firefox wasn't offering to
save my zip file.
