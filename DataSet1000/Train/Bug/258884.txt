Bring back chrome bar below tabs
With the landing of the (great) Winstripe theme, there was a change to the
bottom of tabs in Firefox. Before Winstripe, there was a divider between the
bottom of the tabs and the start of the web page. Now, there is no divider.

While this looks ok initially with a web-site with a white-background, I think
we should bring back the divider.

Pinstripe on Mac OS X handles this nicely with a divider below the tabs and
above the page content area (screenshot:

With Winstripe on Windows and Gnome now, the page runs right into the bottom of
the tabs:

Here's how it looked before Winstripe landed (Qute):

I think it should have a divider for the following reasons:
- The edge looks rough agains non-white backgrounds
 When scrolling, there's not solid edge for the page to slide behind. This is
especially apparant when text on a white background is sliding under the tabs -
you can get half of a line of text showing and it looks oddly cut-off.
- The web page portion of the browser should be squarely framed - any opening in
that breaks up the page and can conflict with page contents.
