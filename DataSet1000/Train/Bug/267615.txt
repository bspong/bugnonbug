Images from secure server don't load properly
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041103 Firefox/1.0RC2

When you go to http://urec.wsu.edu/urec/im/index.jsp (or any page on wsu.edu
with the top banner loaded from a secure server), Firefox has issues trying to
load the images at the top. Sometimes it loads them, sometimes it just site
there and never loads them. If you move to another page (on- or off-site) and
then navigate back to a page in the site, the images load correctly. Sometimes
it takes a few back n' forths to get all the images to show up correctly. Note
that it doesn't matter if you go to the https version of the page, the issue
still persists. Also note that *the images are being loaded through a script*
but that this problem shows up with script-less images as well (see additional
info).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to http://urec.wsu.edu/urec/im/index.jsp
2. Observer banner images not loading/loading incorrectly
3. Navigate to another page by clicking a link, pressing back, home, etc.
4. Navigate back to the page (or any page on the site) through link, back, etc.
5. Notice images. If not all of them are loaded, do step 3 and 4 again.

Actual Results:  
Images aren't always loading correctly, or sometimes the images load in the
incorrect places.

Expected Results:  
Loaded the images.

I am the webmaster for urec.wsu.edu, so I may be able to setup some test cases
if need be. I have also noticed similar issues accessing other secure sites on
wsu.edu (I'm a student). Example: filling out a secure login page before all the
graphics load (graphics NOT loaded through JS, so that may not be the issue) and
submitting it. Then, instead of getting the next page, I just get an image that
was trying to be loaded on the previous page.

I just reproduced the above from this page:
https://www.it.wsu.edu/AIS/REG/cgi-bin/reg_info.cgi?site=SIC&sel_1=reg
And then clicking one of the buttons listed to the right of "Registration
Services" before they finished loading brought me to a page that just showed one
of those buttons. Also notice the banner at the top of the site, the same banner
used on urec.wsu.edu.
