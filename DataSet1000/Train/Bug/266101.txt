When I try to enter an web address containing characters not directly mapped to
my keyboard and I have to use an ALT+numeric keypad escape sequence, such as the
tilde (~) typed as ALT+0126, if autocomplete drop-down contains an item
beginning with the part of the URL already entered, autocompletion is triggered
and makes it difficult or impossible to manually complete the desired address.
Further observation leads me to think that the ALT+2 and ALT+3 combinations
specifically interfere with the autocompletion machinery. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open this URL in the browser: http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/ 
2. Try to manually enter in the location bar this address:
http://www.mozilla.org/~myhome using the ALT+0126 numeric keypad escape sequence


Actual Results:  
The location bar shows the following address:
www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/~myhome

Expected Results:  
The location bar should show the following address:
http://www.mozilla.org/~myhome
