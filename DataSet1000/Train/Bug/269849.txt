dead iframe blocks proper drawing of page

 When I visit www.versiontracker.com via my Mac (OS X 10.3.5) and then visit any
page linked under the "Today's Mac OS X Updates:" list there, I get a
significant sized rectangular 'empty' area near the top left of the page.
Initially its blank, but when I scroll down the page (it scrolls out of sight)
and then back up to the top... then its got a duplicate of some other part of
the page in its area. Switching to another 'tab', and then back, leaves a chunk
of the other frame overlayed on it.
  Refreshing the page doesn't help. Disabling Adblock doesn't help. I don't see
this behavior with any other browser (including latest Mozilla), and I didn't
see it with earlier versions of FireFox either. Restarting FireFox doesn't help.
Restarting the computer doesn't help.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Visit www.versiontracker.com
2.  Click on any links in the "Today's Mac OS X Updates:"
3.  On the new page, scroll around or switch to another tab and back.  See problem.

Actual Results:  
A dead iframe near the top left of the page retains whatever was displayed their
previously via scrolling or tab switching.... rather than what should be there.

Expected Results:  
The dead iframe should not be there, obscuring what is supposed to be under it.

reproduced it on Firefox, and that it doesn't occur with Mozilla proper.
