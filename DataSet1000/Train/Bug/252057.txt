Invalid or missing favicon.ico not being saved for HTTPS pages

This seems related to the recent bugfixes for favicons and bookmarks.  I have a
particular bookmark on the Bookmarks toolbar which has the incorrect favicon and
has had since before I upgraded to this version of Firefox.

When I go to the page again, Firefox sees that the new favicon for the page is
invalid and removes it.  However, it does not replace it with the generic "Page"
icon.  It just leaves a gap where the icon once was.

In addition, if I restart the browser, the incorrect icon will have reappeared.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bookmark a page which has a valid favicon.ico
2. Change the site so its favicon.ico is invalid
3. Revisit the site

Actual Results:  
- Icon next to bookmark disappears and leaves a blank space.
- Reloading the browser causes the old, now invalid, bookmark to reappear.

Expected Results:  
- Bookmark should show generic "Page" icon.
- Should "forget" the old icon which is invalid.

Hard to reproduce because the reproduce steps I gave involve actually making
changes to the website and reloading Firefox.
