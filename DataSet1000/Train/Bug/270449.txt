firefox blocks requested popup when the function opening it is in a frameset
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1) Opera 7.54  [en]
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

for your convenience you can test this bug on http://www.purplemoon.ch/
firefox_frameset.html and compare it to http://www.purplemoon.ch/firefox.html : 
The second page contains a link which opens a popup, firefox doesn't block this 
popup because it is (correctly) user-requested. The first page however contains 
a frameset in which you can click on the same link in every frame, the link 
opens the same function as before, just this time it is located in the frameset, 
so it calls the link javascript:top.last_messages() instead of javascript:
last_messages() - firefox blocks this popup as an unwanted popup. Clearly, it 
isn't an unrequested popup and should not be blocked.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.purplemoon.ch/firefox_frameset.html
2. Try to click on any of the two links when having the popup-blocker enabled.
For comparison see http://www.purplemoon.ch/firefox.html which contains almost 
the same code in a single html-file and which works flawlessly.

Actual Results:  
Firefox blocks the requested popup-link you clicked on.

Expected Results:  
It should have opened the popup because it was user-requested and not unwanted.
