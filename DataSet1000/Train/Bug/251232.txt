-Problem: In ameritade command center (Java Applet Connected to ameritrade
website) if you clikc on "Open Orders" and then click on an order price you
would like to change and then click sumbit The applet hangs and the broswer does
not respond. Hitting CTRL + ALT + DEL and going to windows task manager,
appplications, it says that the firefox broswer is not responding and the Java
applet is running.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:

1. Go To your ameritade.com
2. Login
3. On hte left hand side clikc "Command Center" ( A seprate window will launch
and that will tell you a java script is being loaded)
4. Once the command center has loaded click on the "Open Orders" tab
5. Click on an buy/sell order that you have place
6. Click on the Price and change it.
7. Click submit button (Some times you can not get to Step 7 it will hang on step 6)

Actual Results:  
The broswer hangs. I have to go into task manager and "End Task" inorder to use
Firefox again.

Expected Results:  
If I got to step 7 the broswer should have asked me to confirm my request, and
then the price would have been updated.

I feel this bug is pretty major since I have to use IE (YUCK) to do all of my
day trading. Once the problem is resolved I Will be recommending FireFox to all
of the Trading community just becuase Is clean, its fast, and its NOT MS! Thanks
guys
