It would be good if Firefox had the ability to rewrap text in text areas. I'm
forced to use an HTML email interface, and often people send emails with fairly
long lines. Especially when one adds to that the quotation marks ">", the lines
become too long, get wrapped and look way ugly.

The text editor "joe" does the wrapping in a way I wish Firefox were capable of
doing. If you have joe installed (has been on Redhat install CDs for a long
time), you can try the feature by starting joe, pressing ^T W to disable line
wrapping, typing more than abou 80 characters (some of which are spaces), and
typing ^K J to wrap the text, while the cursor is over the paragraph to be wrapped.

Joe recognizes "paragraphs" in the text quite smartly, and if no text is
selected while ^K J is pressed wraps only the paragraph the cursor is over. The
paragraph detection algorithm appears to be such that paragraphs are separated
by empty lines, except "non-text" characters in beginning of the line are
ignored. This way fe. in the above example with wrapping quoted text, paragraphs
get detected correctly regardless of quoting.

I suggest Firefox uses similar interface: if any text is hilighted, wrap it (I'm
not sure if it should be considered one paragraph, or the paragraphs within it
detected automatically as joe does), otherwise wrap current paragraph. It would
also be good if there was some way to set the right margin manually.
