Tbis is a dupe of http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75138 (for
Mozilla).  There's a great discussion of it over there.  However, that RFE has
been listed for over a year now and is still marked for "future".

I think this feature would be important.  I, myself, prefer links to open new
windows.  Others would prefer them to use an existing window.  Now that you can
also browse with tabs, other people might like a combination of the two (open a
new tab in an existing window).

Right now it's pretty much random for me.  Some applications open links in a new
window while others seem to always use the top most window.  However, I think
it's important that opening new links be consitant.  I can't get all of my
applications to do the same thing, so it's logical that I should be able to set
my browser to act only one way.

I would like to open up this enhancement for Phoenix since (I think) the
developers of Phoenix can add features independant of Mozilla.  However, I'll
understand it if you feel this isn't that important.  At least you will have
considered it.
