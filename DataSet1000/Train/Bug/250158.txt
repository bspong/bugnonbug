When forwarding an email and loading addresses from the address book, Firefox
opens a new mail window instead of placing the selected addresses in the
forwarded mail. Firefox used to handle this action correctly. I noticed the
change last week while using 0.9. I am not sure if AOL changed something or if
there is a corruption within Firefox. I upgraded to 0.9.1 this morning, trashed
the profiles.ini but have seen no change.

Tried Safari this morning (have not been using it since Firefox) and the forward
function works properly.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log on to http://webmail.aol.com/
2. Open a piece of mail.
3. Select "Forward"
4. Select "Address Book"
5. Select desired "contact"
6. Select "Send Mail"
Actual Results:  
Firefox opens a new mail window with the selected address in the "TO:" window

Expected Results:  
Placed the selected addresses in the forwarded mail "TO:"window.
