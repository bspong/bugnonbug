When Firebird opens a dialog box, if I click OK/CANCEL once, it doesn´t close!
To close it, I have to click it more than 2 times and wait about 7 seconds. It
also happens when I open the Options Window and when I´m installing a Plug-in.
Sometimes I have to close Firebird and reopen it, because even clicking OK or
CANCEL a hundred times, the dialog box don´t disappear. This is happening since
I´ve installed Firebird.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click "Tools" -> "Options..." on the menu bar or, install a plug-in or, force
firebird to open a dialog box where OK or CANCEL appears.
2. Click OK or CANCEL.
Actual Results:  
I had to click OK 3 times and wait 7 seconds to firebird close the window.

Expected Results:  
Close the window/dialog box/plug-in installer as soon as I click a button.

I´m using Firebird as default.
My computer is a Compaq Presario 5333.
My OS is Windows 2000 Professional.
