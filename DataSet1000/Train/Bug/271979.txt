Using "Load Images", "For the originating website only", and "Exceptions" to block ads

Firefox is an absolutely excellent browser.  Just have to say that up front.  On
thing that I think would make it even better is if I could choose "Load Images",
"For the originating website only", and then choose exceptions for those two
rules.  For example, many news sites have most of their presentation images
hosted on their site, but then have their image or Macromedia ads hosted off
site.  There are just a few websites that I have visited where pertinent content
for the page is hosted off site, and those sites would be the "Exceptions". 
Also, more sophisticated sites are starting to use javascript to
document.write('<IFRAME SRC="http://ad.doubleclick.net..."') or
document.write('<scr'+'ipt language=javascript
src="http://a.tribalfusion.com..."') ads into their site, but the content is
still off site.  I have used Guidescope to block images in the past, but it
cannot handle the Macromedia files, and blocking them through the browser would
be the best option.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox.
2. Go to www.cnn.com.
3. Notice that it hosts its images at i.cnn.net.

Actual Results:  
Front and center image was blocked.

Expected Results:  
Been able to track this page as an exception to the rule that "All pages should
load images only from their own site."

I used the Advanced Query to check Bugzilla, and it didn't seem like there was a
similar feature request/bug report.
