Cookies on some sites are not being saved after Firebird session ends.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7

The above url example is just one of many sites that require login user ids and
passwords.  It happens a lot of forums.  But it also happens on Slashdot's site
as well.  The only sites that seem to keep their cookies are Yahoo and
Amazon.com.  Just about every other site forgets the cookie after the Firebird
session ends -- that is, I close Firebird.

When I reopen Firebird and visit the forums websites, for example, I have to
re-enter my user id and password.

Under Tools->Options->Privacy, I have Cookies Enabled.  I have experienced this
problem with previous builds of Firebird.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into a forum website or Slashdot.
2. Close Firebird.
3. Reopen Firebird and visit the site again.

Actual Results:  
My login was not remembered.  I had to re-enter my user id and password all over
again.

Expected Results:  
It should have remembered my cookie from my previous session where I already
logged in.  I should not have to log in again.
