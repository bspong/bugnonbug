I set my Privacy preferences to remember 0 days of visited URLs.  However, the
address bar still has the down-arrow for the drop-down list.  This is a waste of
screen space.  I would prefer that if there is no remembered history (nothing in
the drop-down), then the down-arrow should go away (that is, the address bar
should appear as a plain vanilla text box.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set your Privacy pref to remember some positive number of days' worth of URLs.
2. Visit some URLs.
3. Observe that the drop-down list from the address bar shows these URLs.
4. Set your Privacy pref to remember 0 days' worth of URLs.
5. Visit some more URLs.
6. Observe that no drop-down list appears in the address bar, even when clicking
the down arrow.

Actual Results:  
no drop-down list appears in the address bar, even when clicking the down arrow

Expected Results:  
Removed the down arrow, or at least grayed it out (The first option is
preferable to optimize screen space)
