Minimized window won't stay put

When you have a Firefox browser window open and maximized to fill the screen,
and then minimize it to the taskbar, after a while it will pop back up onto the
screen and un-maximize itself, reverting back to the size the window was before
being maximized.  If you have multiple Firefox windows (windows, not tabs) open
and they're all minimized, it will be the last one opened that will pop back up
while the others stay put.  Multiple or single tabs in each windows don't appear
to make any difference because the window always pops back with the tab that was
active when it was minimized.  I notice it most when I leave my computer for a
while and come back, but I think it will pop up even when I'm working on other
things too.  The web page loaded in these windows does not matter.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox and maximize the window.
2. Load up any webpage you desire.
3. Minimize the window to the taskbar and leave it sit there for a while.

Actual Results:  
After a few minutes (not sure if it's the same amount of time each time), the
window will un-minimize itself and also un-maximize itself, reverting back to
the size the window was before being maximized.

Expected Results:  
It should have sat in the taskbar like a nice little background program should
and when it's restored, should still be maximized.

As far as I can tell, this problem occurs no matter what theme (tried several
different themes) or extensions (if I remember, it did this before I even found
out about extensions in Firefox) are loaded, so I doubt that's the issue.
