The javascript-based game isn't getting rendered properly

If you attempt to play the game Illumina (javascript-based) in Firefox, you
can't use the standard move arrows (not the ones on the numberpad) to move the
character around, but the ones on the numpad do work.  However, when the
character does move the map doesn't move in-sync with the character. Try the
game for more details.  There may be other problems, but I can't get any further
in the game to find them.  I have experienced this problem in both Windows and
Linux.

This is the most major of the bugs I have experience with Javascript in Firefox.
 Another that comes to mind is in the web-based game Legend Arena
(www.legendarena.com).  The clock in the upper-left corner never loads.  You do
have to create an account to see this, but it is free.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to the URL above
2.Go to launch game at the bottom of the page.
3.Follow the steps on that page to start playing
4.Try moving the character around.

Actual Results:  
The map moves out-of-sync with the character, as described in the details section.

Expected Results:  
The map and the character should have move in-sync, so the character is always
in the middle of the screen.  Try the game in Internet Explorer for expected
results.
