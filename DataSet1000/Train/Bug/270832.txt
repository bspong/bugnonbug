Opening multiple urls in tabs with | (pipe) doesn't always work
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Depending on the setting for "Open links from other applications in," opening
multiple urls separated by | (pipe) doesn't always open new tabs. If the setting
is "a new window," it works as expected: another application requesting that
Firefox open "http://www.siteone.com/|http://www.sitetwo.com/" opens a new
window with the two urls, each in its own tab. If the setting is "a new tab in
the most recent window," a single new tab opens in the most recent window,
treating the pipe-separated urls as a single URL, usually resulting in a 404
from siteone.com.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set "Open links from other applications in" to "a new tab in the most recent
window."
2. Open a link in another application (in XP, Start -> Run) with multiple urls
separated by | (pipe), like "http://www.google.com/|http://www.yahoo.com/"

Actual Results:  
Firefox will open a single new tab on the most recent window, attempting to open
the multiple URLs as a single URL. Google will give you a 404 that it could not
find "/%7Chttp://www.yahoo.com/"

Expected Results:  
Two new tabs should have been opened in the current window, one with
http://www.google.com, the other with http://www.yahoo.com.
