Navigating location bar history w/ keyboard drops www/ftp prefix from displayed address

When navigating the location bar history with the keyboard (arrow up/down) the
address shown in the location bar does not include any www or ftp prefix from
the entry.

If you press enter to go to an url from the history firefox actually goes to the
saved url (with www or ftp prefixed) and not the one displayed (without
www/ftp). This is good.

But is you modify the selected url, eg. change the filename you want to go to
firefox goes to the "wrong" url, the url displayed without the www prefix.

This is unfortunate. If you want to go to an url on the same site as one in your
history you can save a lot of typing by just modifying a history item. But
because of this bug you have to manually prepend www. Not a big problem but a
bit annoying.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clear the location bar history.
2. Enter url http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/ and go.
3. Enter the url fon another site, eg. www.userfriendly.org and go.
4. Type ctrl-l to activate the location bar and type mozil and press arrow down
   to highlight http://ftp.mozilla.org ... /nightly/. In the location bar only
   mozilla.org ... /nightly/ is shown.
5. Type contrib to append this to the url in the location bar. Go.

Actual Results:  
You get a 404 error from www.mozilla.org (expanded from mozilla.org) that the
given page wasn't found.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have displayed the entire url (including ftp.) when the history
item was selected. That way you would get to the ftp.mozilla.org page you really
wanted.
