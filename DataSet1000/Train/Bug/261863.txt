unable to POST (submit) form when only form submit object is a <input type="image">

I cannot login to several major sites, including FreshDirect and Amazon with my
build of Firefox.  I've tried using the scriptlet
"javascript:document.forms[0].submit();" [assuming 0 is the correct index];
however that returns the following error in the JS console:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code:
0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIDOMHTMLFormElement.submit]"  nsresult:
"0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame ::
javascript:document.forms[0].submit(); :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 1"  data: no]

I can reproduce this behavior at the following two URIs:

https://www.freshdirect.com/login/login_main.jsp




Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Navigate to a web page containing a form with three form input elements: a
text type for the username, a password type for the password, and an image type
for the submit button.
2.  Enter the username and password fields with valid data.
3.  Click the submit image button.

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
The form should be POST'd to the specified form action URI.

Perhaps the fact that SSL is used is interesting here? 

I also only allow session cookies, and block all pop-ups.
