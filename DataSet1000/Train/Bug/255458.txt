live bookmark shouldnt use cache

maybe I'm wrong but I have the strong feeling live bookmark uses cache when it
comes to refresh. Often I go to a website to find there are new articles and the
rss feed didn't refresh properly ...

I downloaded the Sage extension after to find out it was correctly updating the
rss feeds.

So my guess was that the live bmark uses the cache system and sage doesn't; it
might be another problem but the fact is : Sage properly detects updated rss
while the internal rss system doesn't.

Please have a look at that, I like the way its done with bookmark but its
useless if the updates are not working well.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download Sage extension and install
2.Put some rss feeds in sage and the same also as live bookmark
3.Use both on a regular basis (always starting with the live bookmark when you
update your rss)
Actual Results:  
You will see sage shows the updated rss when the live bookmark didnt find any


Expected Results:  
Shouldnt see any difference

I guessed it was dealing with using the cache or not because once Sage gets the
updated rss feeds, the live bookmark will get them too. 

I will now try to desactivate the network.http-usecache pref and see if it makes
a difference (I'm sure it will)
