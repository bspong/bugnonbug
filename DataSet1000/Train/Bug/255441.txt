Blocking a site that begins with dot does not work in cookie exceptions

I periodically go through my stored cookies looking for sites I want to block. 
When I find one, I copy the Host: field into another window for temporary
storage, and do this for each one.

Next, I go into the Cookie Exceptions panel, and copy and paste each host into
the "Address of website:" field, and then click block.  The problem is that if
the text begins with a . (for instance .reference.com), it goes into the list as
doubleclick.net and says blocked, but DOES NOT BLOCK.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Options->Privacy->Cookies->Exceptions...
2. Type .reference.com into the "Address of website:" field (any site name
beginning with '.' will do.
3. Click Block.  Notice that reference.com shows up on the list (not .reference.com)
4. Make sure to remove any reference.com cookies from the stored cookies list.
5. Go to www.dictionary.com.  Notice that a new cookie from .reference.com is
accepted and shows up in the stored cookies list.
Actual Results:  
My Stored Cookies showed a .reference.com cookie.  If I removed that cookie and
go back to www.dictionary.com, it reappears.

Expected Results:  
It should either block the cookie, or give an error when an attempt is made to
add .reference.com to the exceptions list (stating that site names cannot begin
with '.').  For obvious reasons, blocking the cookie is preferable.
