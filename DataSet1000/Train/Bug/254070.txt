I am experiencing problems with post submittals of forms in Firefox 0.9.1+ 20040802

It appears that the post data for forms is prepended to the request string as
noted in this log entry:

This appears to happen on pages where a particular file (in this case
editperson.php) is first called through get with a variable, then the form is
posted to itself (or PHP_SELF). I have experienced this on several different
forms using several different builds of Firefox (0.8, 0.9, 0.9.1, 0.9.2,
0.9.1+). In some cases, after several tries, Firefox will send the form data
without prepending it to the request and the form will work, though I have only
been able to confirm this on Firefox 0.8.

The forms in question are unfortunately behind a IP and password restriction...


Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. link to a form that uses get data to prepopulate.
2. complete the form
3. submit and get errors for data that was completed on the form not being
completed, or for data required to complete db requests or for some other reason
not being available
4. observe odd log entries

Actual Results:  
result page was displayed with errors due to post variables not being available
to the system...

Expected Results:  
post variables should have been available to the system to generate correct results.
