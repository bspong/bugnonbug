If the cursor is in a textarea (i.e. it has the focus) such as right now typing
this, turning the mousewheel does not scroll the page. If i click somewhere out
of the textarea, the wheel works. I have a Microsoft Intellimouse that works
with IE and when textareas are not focused. This problem does not affect
single-line textboxes

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to any page with a textarea (examples: this page, or any thread in the
mozillazine forums
2. click in a textarea to focus it
3. try to scroll the page with the mouse wheel (turn the wheel)
Actual Results:  
Nothing happened, i.e. the page did not scroll.

Expected Results:  
The page should have scrolled.
