Floating toolbar which works on IE doesn't work on Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3

At the website http://actris.marketlinx.com (need username/password to get in -
ping me, I can provide you that for testing purpose), there is a floating menu
bar which stays at upper left hand corner of the browser when the page is
scrolled up or down. It works very well with IE, but when I use Firefox for the
site, it says 'Loading' but never loads the menu bar.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Email hem@hemknowshomes for username/pass
2. Open IE and log into http://actris.marketlinx.com 
2. Close the pop up window, you will see a floating menu bar on the main window.
3. Open Firefox.
4. Switch OFF pop-up blocker on Firefox.
2. Log into http://actris.marketlinx.com using user/pass
3. A pop up window loads, close that.
3.On the original page, the floating menu bar will not load
4. It says loading, and stays there

Actual Results:  
The menu bar doesn't load.

Expected Results:  
Firefox will load the menu bar.

I have reported this as a bug with the folks who developed the software called
Tempo, but they are adamant that they will not make their software work with
non-IE browsers (the pages use ASPX).
If the bright Firefox developers can look at that and if it can be accomodated,
then I almost never have to use IE!.
I am not sure if it is a bug, but if we can develop a work around for all the
pages which IE will load, make the software more popular.
