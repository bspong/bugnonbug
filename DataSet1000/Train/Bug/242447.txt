JavaScript: inconsistent handling of script defined object and its properties
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)
Build Identifier: Gecko/20040206

I work for the US Government and the code in question is on a non-public site.  
I'll quite the sample script below.  This problem does not happen in NN7 or 
IE5+.  I have not tested Mozilla.

The problem is:  I am creating a var/object for a popup window, which is opened 
either via an href link or automatically after 30 seconds.  I am also defining 
a property for the window from the function that opens the window.  When the 
function is called by the href tag (i.e. user clicks the link) all is well, but 
when the function is called from within my countdown script, I get the error 
message "popupWin has no properties".

Here is the code (note popupWin.linkedFrom):

<script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript">
<!--

// This function defines a new window object for the Java applet anchor.
// the variable appstart is first declared but not defined in the countdown
// below.  When this function is called it defines appstart to a non-null value
// to signal the countdown to terminate (lest we get two instances of the
// the applet).  This function also created and sets the child window property
// linkedFrom to notify the child window that it was opened by an authorized
// opener (in lieu of http_referrer).

function launch3d() {
      popupwin = window.open('launch3d.html','open_launchpad'
            'status=yes,width=500,height=25') ;
      appstart = '1' ;
      window.status = "Applet Anchor Started..." ;
      popupWin.linkedFrom = document.URL ; // where FireFox throws error      
setTimeout("window.close()",5000);
}

// -->
</script>

<script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript">
<!--

// This is the countdown referenced above which automatically launches the
// applet after a specified amount of time.  It will detect if the applet it
// launched manually by detecting a value in the variable 'appstart' and exit.

var appstart;
var time="30";

function countdown(){
    if (appstart === undefined){
         if (time==0){
              launch3d();   // calls the function above but FireFox has issues
              window.status="Applet started....";
         }
         else{
              time-=1;
              window.status="Applet will start in "+time+" seconds.";
              setTimeout("countdown()",1000);
         }
    }
}

window.onlaod=countdown

// -->
</script>


As you can see, this is a valid script, and all works fine, even in FireFox, 
EXCEPT when the 'launch3d()' is called from the 'countdown()' function if it 
reaches zero.  The countdown works fine oterwise, and the launch3d() function 
executes flawlessly if called via a <A HREF="javascript:launch3d();"> link.  As 
you can see, we are explicitly setting the linkedFrom property for popupWin, 
but FF seems to be confused.

Again, this works without fail in NN 4/6/7 and IE 5.5/6 in Windows NT based 
systems.  I have not yet tried it in Red Hat.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Make a page with the code mentioned above
2.Start launch3d(); from a link, and it will work
3.Start launch3d(); from within another function, and it will fail.

Actual Results:  
Ref Details....

Expected Results:  
It should have defined the linkedFrom property regardless of the method from 
which the function was called.
