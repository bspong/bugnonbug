User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040914 Firefox/0.10
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040914 Firefox/0.10

See below

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Case 1:
1.Bookmark the specified URL and set it to "Loaded in sidebar in properties"
2.Open the URL in sidebar,login as testmozilla/mozilla (username/password),try
to expand the tree by clicking the plus button
3.Open the javascript console,check for any error message
Case 2:
1. Enter the URL in the url bar to load it in normal browser window
2. Try to expand the tree by clicking the plus button


Actual Results:  
Case 1:
The tree do not expand when clicking the plug button. An error something like
"tree is not defined" is shown in the javascript dialog
Case 2:
The tree can be expanded successfully

Sometimes the URL is both opened in sidebar and browser window,clicking the plus
button in sidebar expand the tree in browser window,but I cannot always
reproduce it.

Expected Results:  
The behaviour of loading in sidebar and browser window should be the same,no
javascript error should be shown when the page is loaded in sidebar

Can be also reproduced in 0.9.1
