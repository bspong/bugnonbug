I have to setup workstation with WindowsXP OS for about 10 users.
I create an user account (let it be USER), 
logon and install and configure different software including FF.
For FireFox I set up homepage, proxy, bookmarks and so on.
When all software is installed and configured I logout and copy 
all files from USER Profile folder to Default Profile folder.
Then I create accounts for each users.
But when new user login and run FF, FF says that folder not found
and continuing running with default settings.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Logon to WinXP as Administrator
2. Create one temporary user account (USER for example)
3. Logon as USER
4. Run FF and do setup somthing (for ex. homepage and bookmarks)
5. Logout
6. Copy all files from USER Profile directory do Default User profile folder
7. Create new user account (USER2 for ex.)
8. Logon as USER2 and run FF

Actual Results:  
FF runs with default settings

Expected Results:  
FF should run with settings which was done undr USER account

sorry for my bad english
