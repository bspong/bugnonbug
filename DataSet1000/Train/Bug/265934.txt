Clicking 'Desktop' in Download Manager shows wrong folder
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041024 Firefox/1.0

If you go to the Download Manager, there is a button with 'Desktop' on it (I
haven't edited my setting, this is thus standard behaviour). Click it and it
shows me my Desktop folder in Windows Explorer. Well, that's what I expected. It
shows me a folder with this address: "C:\DOCUMENTS AND SETTINGS\HARM\BUREAUBLAD"
(I'm using a Dutch Windows XP version). But this isn't my Desktop folder. Using
Microsoft's Powertoys I set my Desktop folder to "D:\Bureaublad". That's also
the place where Firefox's downloads go to and that works like a charm. But when
I clicked the 'Desktop' button in the DM I expected to see my own Desktop folder
and not the old one.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Tools > Options... > Downloads > Set 'Save all downloads to this folder' to
'Desktop' (one of the options in the dropdownbox)
2. Go to the Download Manager
3. Click 'Desktop'

Actual Results:  
There opens an incorrect folder when you have changed the standard Desktop
folder in Windows with Microsoft's Powertoys.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have opened the correct folder, i.e. it should have opened
"D:\Bureaublad" instead of "C:\DOCUMENTS AND SETTINGS\HARM\BUREAUBLAD".
