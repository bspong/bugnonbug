firefox history database is endian; corrupts the display of titles
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; SunOS sun4u; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040630 Firefox/0.9.1

This bug is best experienced with screenshots, so I've put some up at
http://web.mit.edu/jmorzins/www/mozilla/history-endian-firefox.html

What's wrong:
Firefox stores titles into the history database in an endian-dependent fashion.

What happens:
If a user switches between little-endian machines (like PCs) and big-endian
machines (like Sun workstations), they will only be able to read half of their
history titles at a time.  The little-endian machine is able to read the
little-endian titles, and big-endian ones come out looking like garbled Chinese.
Likewise, the big-endian machine will be able to read the big-endian titles,
with little-endian titles coming out as garbled Chinese.

What should have happened:
Firefox should either store names in an endian-independent fashion, or should
tag the Unicode strings in a way that allows Firefox to recognize what
endianness the strings are.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
This bug will be trivial for anyone at a large Unix site to duplicate, but
perhaps there aren't that many of us left.

 1) Run Firefox on a little-endian machine, like an Intel PC running Linux.
    Visit some pages, such as:
      http://web.mit.edu/jmorzins/www/mozilla/little-endian.html
 2) Quit Firefox (to save your history).
 3) Run Firefox on a big-endian machine, like a Sun SunBlade running Solaris.
    Visit some pages, such as:
      http://web.mit.edu/jmorzins/www/mozilla/big-endian.html
 4) Quit Firefox (to save your history).
 5) Now restart Firefox. Notice that:
       (a) if you type URLs into the location bar, the pop-up autocompletion
           menu has garbled (Chinese!) titles for other-endian platforms
       (b) if you view your history, the list of titles in the history has
           garbled (Chinese!) titles for other-endian platforms.
