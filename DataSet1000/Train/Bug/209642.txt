New Style of Selecting and Managing Sidebar Panels using a Single-Selection
Dropdown List.

I always thought that the Mozilla Sidebar Panels took up too much vertical 
space. Removing them to get more space is also bad, because wanted sidebars have
to be added, and the wxisting one removed (IN A SEPARATE STEP) to maintain the
vertical space advantage.

Conversely, I think the the Firebird solution makes it too cumbersome to switch
between Sibebar Panels. The shortcuts have to be remembered and the menu is too
far away and deeply nested.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:



Expected Results:  
My suggestion is to introduce a new method of selecting sidebar panels that uses
the advantages of both current systems (increased vertical space and easy
accessibily) while eliminating the disadvantages of both current systems
(decreased vertical space and difficult accessibility).

Suggested UI:
+----------------------------+------
| Sidebar   [ Bookmarks  ] x |___    <-- currently selected: Bookmarks
|-----------| Customize Sidebars |
| Personal  | Sidebar directory  |
| > Compute |--------------------|
| > Persona |o Bookmarks         |   <-- currently selected: Bookmarks
| > Mozilla |  Search            |
|    mozill |  History           |
|    Bugs   |  Bugzilla          |
|    Etique |  ...               |
|    Thumpe +--------------------+
|    FlamingBird             |
|                            |
+----------------------------+ 

Notice that the dropdown list would show the selected Sidebar Panel with a
selection BULLET instead of (multiple) checkmarks.

My recommendation would be to alphabetically sort the entries in the dropdown
list when they are added to provide some structure and better overview.
