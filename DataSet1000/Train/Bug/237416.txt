I use Mandrake 9.2 with this kernel 2.4.22-10mdk 
gcc 3.3.1 
 
I tried to test with three profiles whose one is under root'a account. 
 
I tried with mozilla 1.6 
 
I tried with Flashfix. 
 
My plugins are recognised, i see them with mozilla "about plugins window". 
 
Nothing seems to resolve the problem.
