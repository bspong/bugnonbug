Back up option (settings, bookmarks, extentions, etc)

As people install more and more extensions, the settings become more
complicated, and harder to reproduce again on another computer, e.g. being ones
notebook or a friends/new users computer.

So I would like to suggest a entry in preferences called Back up. When pressed
the user should see something like this:

-----------------------------------------------

Select the items to back up

* Bookmarks
* Extensions
* Extension settings
* FireFox settings
* Themes
               ____________________________
Back up file: |____________________________|

-----------------------------------------------

The idea should be, that it should output a tar.gz file containing everything
that the user selected.

Selecting "extensions", "themes" should include the extensions and themes.

If the extensions can't be copied from the current computer, it should download
the xpi file, and include that in the final tar.gz file.

Losing the Adblock blacklist or Cookie white list, would not be fun at all, so I
see great need for such a feature.
