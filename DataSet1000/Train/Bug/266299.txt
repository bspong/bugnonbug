"Force links that open new windows to open in:"
This option badly needs an exception for javascript links, especially when "new
tab" is selected.

Example cases: online game sites like pogo.com and zone.msn.com that open a java
applet game in its own little window are forced to use a new tab in the main
window. This new tab is then resized by the applet, messing up all the other
tabs that are open.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.pogo.com
2. Make sure the Force links that open a new window to open in... is turned on
and that "a new tab" is selected.
3. Pick any game and enter a game room. Firefox will freak out.

Actual Results:  
Firefox resized itself to the game (Sweet Tooth in this case) according to the
applet's instructions, rendering the web pages open in other tabs nearly
unreadable until I resized the window again, correcting the other pages but
making the game look rather silly.

Expected Results:  
In this case, since the game is opened via a javascript link, it should open in
a new window.
