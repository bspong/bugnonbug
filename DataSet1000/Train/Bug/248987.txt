When closing last tab the tab bar disappears indefinitely until new tab is opened

If option 'Hide tab bar when only one page is open' is disabled, the tab bar
should always be visible. When you close the last tab on it, instead of the
window closing, or ignoring your close request, it gets rid of the tab bar while
keeping your current page remaining. Restarting the program will show that the
tab bar is still gone until a new tab is opened.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn off 'Hide tab bar when only one page is open' option
2. Reload the browser
3. Open any page in the first tab
4. Close the current tab
5. Restart the program
Actual Results:  
The tab bar dissapeared completely. Restarting the program did not help. The
only way to bring it back was to open a new tab.

Expected Results:  
I would expect closing the last tab to either close the browser window, or
ignore your request to close it. In any case, the tab bar should not ever
dissapear when the 'Hide tab bar when only one page is open' option is disabled.
