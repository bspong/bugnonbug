If you are on a page that's content is longer than the window (has a vertical
scrollbar) and you hit the down arrow on your keyboad to display a list of
values that you've entered in that textbox on that site in the past, select one
(with the arrow key not the mouse), then scroll down with the mouse scroll
button (no clicking), the list of past entered values will follow as you scroll.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to google.com
2. Do a search for "firefox rules"
3. Clear the search textbox, begin typeing "firefox rules" again until the
dropdown of existing values you've entered into that textbox in the past appears.
4. Make sure your mouse cursor is not within the dropdown and use your scroll
button (without clicking) to scroll down


Actual Results:  
The dropdown of values that had been entered in the past remains at a fixed
position on the screen while you scroll through the page content

Expected Results:  
Either collapsed the dropdown or left it directly below the texbox that has been
scrolled away from.
