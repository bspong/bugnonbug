"save image as..." then "folder" integrates differently in different situations

If I right-click "save image as..." on any image (except the following) and save
the image with the name "folder" in any folder, then view that folder from its
parent folder in thumbnail mode, the saved image is used as the folder thumbnail.

However, if I right-click on an image in Google Image Search results pages, I
get a different context menu. I can still choose "save image as..." and
"folder," but this image does not get used by WinXP for the thumbnail view of
the folder when viewed from the parent folder. Instead, it gets used for 0.25 of
the thumbnail view.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
0. Make folders C:\temp and C:\temp2
1. load
http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/04/uk_enl_1097158263/img/laun.jpg
1b. If that image is not available, just choose another one (but not via
Google), right click, then click "view image"
2. right-click
3. save image as...
4. select C:\temp\ or something similar
5. save with the filename "folder". Extension not important
6. use Windows Explorer (not Internet Explorer) to view c:\
7. click View | thumbnails
8. you should now see the folder C:\temp drawn with the thumbnail of the image
you saved as folder.xxx
101. use Google Image search to look for some pictures. e.g.
http://images.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&lr=&q=moon&btnG=Search
102. repeat steps 2-8 above using C:\temp2 instead of C:\temp. This time, the
image does not integrate properly with the OS and only a quarter of the
thumbnail space is used. For some reason, the file folder.xxx (where .xxx is
whatever extension the image ends up with, jpg gif bmp, whatever) is used as a
sample file rather than the folder's image. Beats me.

Actual Results:  
1-8. Folders get new livery
100-102. Saved file does not integrate and folders do not get new livery

Expected Results:  
Folders should get new livery

Default theme.
reproducible every time, whether using googlebar, google.com or google.co.uk.
