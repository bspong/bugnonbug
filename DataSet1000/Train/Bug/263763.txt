New bookmarks file is not created when browser.bookmarks.file value changes
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10.1

When trying to move the bookmarks file to another partition, I changed the value
in browser.bookmarks.file (as described in
http://texturizer.net/firefox/tips.html) to D:\\DATA\\ERIK\\BOOKMARKS.HTML. This
does not create a new file BOOKMARKS.HTML at that location. But my previous
bookmarks have gone. I also tried to have Firefox create the file at other
locations and with different extensions. The last thing I tried was pre-creating
the file at the specified location. That did not help either.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close all Firefox instances 
2. Edit the user.js file
3. add the line
    'user_pref("browser.bookmarks.file", "E:\\DATA\\ZOMAAR.html");'
4. Start Firefox

All bookmarks have gone.

5. Add a bookmark the way you prefer.
6. During the sessions, the bookmarks are available.
7. Quit Firefox
8. Restart Firefox

All bookmarks are not restored (or: gone again)


Expected Results:  
Newly created bookmarkfile at the specified location
