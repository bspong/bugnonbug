Selecting a window does not raise it when several windows are present

When I have several windows open and I select a window in the back by clicking
inside the window, but not on the titlebar, the window is selected but does not
raise above the front window. Also, even though the backmost window is now
selected, any keypress moves the selection to the front window, which responds
in an eratic way. When I however first move out of the application (e.g. by
clicking the dsktop), I can normally select and raise the back window (but
moving back to the first window gives the same problems again). 

Even when I do raise the other window using the title bar, which does raise it, 
keypresses will affect the first, nonselected, window. For example closing and
opening tabs will happen in the other window that was moved to the back. Again,
things go normally when I move to the other window by first going to another
application. 

This started for me in Firefox 0.9rc1, and remains in Firefox 0.9. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open two windows
2. click inside backmost window, but not on titlebar
3.

Actual Results:  
The back window is selected (title bar changes color), raises for a fraction of
a second, and is covered again by the former front window.  

Expected Results:  
The backmost window should be raised above the front window and stay there.
