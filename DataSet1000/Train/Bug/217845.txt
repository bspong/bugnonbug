While going to URL (http://www.schwab.com > Client log in), the site states that
the root certificate is about to expire.  When clicking on more information
(https://investing.schwab.com/library/html/VCUfaq.html), the site states that
the Verisign root certificate is about to expire on 12/31/1999 and that the
browser should be upgraded to Netscape > 4.05 or IE.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto http://www.schwab.com
2. Goto Client Log In
(http://www.schwab.com/SchwabNOW/Exec/gotrade?dest=login&orig=phome&pos=topnav&ebmk=acquisition)
3. Observe statement about certificate

Actual Results:  
Site prevents you from logging in, because the root certificate has supposedly
expired.

Expected Results:  
Logged in without error

Not sure if this is a Firebird issue or not.  Searching about root certificates
did not reveal other folks with same issue, so this might be a recognition
problem from Schwab or an client identification issue with Firebird and
Schwab.com.  I would suspect that Firebird probably uses Mozilla's root
certificate, threfore I would not expect problems.  In this case, however, I
seem to have encountered a problem.  I should note that other secure sites seem
to work appropriately.
