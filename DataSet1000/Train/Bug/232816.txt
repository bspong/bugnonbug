A feature I haven't seen so far in any browser: a link filter

Similar to a spamfilter, that puts bogus mails straight into the trashcan, I'd
like to have a filter system that does the same with links to bogus webpages. By
bogus links I mean links that a normal user would never want to click on.

Examples for bogus links:
- advertisement banners
- sponsors
- links to porn pages
- links to weird cgi scripts
- ...

I think it would be a great feature if a browser could just hide such links, by
following a list of rulesets (simple RegExps would be sufficient for me). Surely
everybody has noticed that more and more pages get filled with junk banners and
stuff. I want to allow my browser to hide such page content from me (or replace
it with some kind of symbol so that I know something is hidden there).

It would make browsing a lot faster, because:
- banner images don't have to be loaded
- 'real' links wouldn't be hidden under loads of bogus ones
- You Only See What You Want To See

A more general filter, that does not only allow to filter links, but Images, or
HTML Contents in general would be great, too.

It could also help to restrict browsing features for children. Don't allow links
that contain 'xxx', 'fuck', etc. and most porn pages won't work anymore... or
hide/disallow 'bad language' in general.

It would be great to see some development in that direction :-) In my opinion,
it would be a great new feature for a browser that already contains a whole lot
of great new features :-)
