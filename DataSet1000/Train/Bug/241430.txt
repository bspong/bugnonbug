seporate config and other files :: profile preference folder has mixed personal, and configuration data
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.2; Linux; X11; i686; en_US) (KHTML, like Gecko)
Build Identifier: any firefox, and I guess mozilla might have similar profile management

I just want to have a directory that contains world readable config 
information about my browser, and one that is private 
 
~/firefox/profiles/Default/ao;fsdkasg/shareableconfig 
and 
~/firefox/profiles/Default/ao;fsdkasg/confidentail 
~/firefox/profiles/Default/ao;fsdkasg/conditionallyshared/bookmarks.htm 
 
or something like that... I want to just be able to copy a users "layout" 
directory and have it be the default one for the system. 
I don't want to have to try every file combination to find the minimal set 
that contains the browser/toolbar layout, the extentions I want, a default set 
of bookmarks... all without having an accidental copying of my password 
database. 
 
 
I spent about a week trying to figure out how to apply my firefox settings to 
everyone on my computer. 
 
It wasn't that hard, except for not knowing what preference files to copy, and 
what ones contain, say my cookies or some sort of cache.. 
 
I wanted to have my exact layout copied for all of my users.  I went through a 
lot of ~/.firefox directories and Application Data/Firefox directories, 
because I had to copy systematically my config files in different combinations 
to the defaults/profile/US folder, then start a browser, and have it not work,  
then try again by deleting the firefoxconfig directory, copying another config 
file over to the default folder, (oh there was an su in there too, or a switch 
to a different xterm) and then trying again.
