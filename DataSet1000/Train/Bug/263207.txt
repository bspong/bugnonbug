The autocomplete list that appears when entering text field information in a
form erronously appears in the browser content area when the form element
belongs to the Web page displayed in another browser tab, *and* the form element
has the focus in the Web page displayed in that other browser tab.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the following URL: <http://www.vpl.ca/cgi-bin/profile>.  This is the
URL to an online public library catalog.
2. Enter a title to search for, e.g. "Netscape Time", and then click Go.
3. In the search results, click on the title just entered to view its
bibliographical and circulation info.
4. In the page that appears, right-click on any subject link, e.g. "Netscape
Communications Corporation -- History" to open the link in a new tab.
5. Once the new tab has finished loading, switch to it.  Click on the text field
form element and press DELETE.  Start typing one or two characters to invoke
autocomplete, then click on the first browser tab to return to it.
6. Once back in the first browser tab, try to scroll up and down the page using
the keyboard using the PAGE UP/PAGE DOWN or the up arrow/down arrow keys.

Actual Results:  
The autocomplete list, which belongs to the form element displayed in the second
browser tab, floats above the Web page content in the current browser tab, in
the same position it would appear in the second browser tab's content area.

Expected Results:  
No autocomplete list should appear in the Web page content in the current
browser tab.
