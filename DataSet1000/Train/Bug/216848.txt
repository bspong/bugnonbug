When trying to start browser, error SYS 3175 in XPCOM.DLL on some PC's
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (OS/2; U Warp 3; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030730 Mozilla Firebird/0.6.1


When trying to start Mozilla Firebird 0.6.1 on a OS/2 Warp 3 PC (Fix Packed to 
43/44) I get a SYS 3175 error in XPCOM.DLL.  This only happens on workstations 
that have had fixes applied over time.  (If a PC has been in use for 5 years, 
it has received loads of fixes, if a PC has a problem it was re-built with just 
the latest fix packs).

This problem occurs if withing the OS2.INI there is a Key 
called 'PM_SystemFonts' and an Application under this called 'Menus'. If this 
is deleted, no more SYS 3175 errors.

I have discussed this problem on the Forum and someone said to raise a Bugzilla 
for it


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add a key to the OS/2 INI called PM_SystemFonts
2. Add an application to the OS/2 INI under PM_SystemFonts called Menus
3. Start MozillaFireBird

Actual Results:  
Error SYS 3175 in XPCOM.DLL

Expected Results:  
Started the browser
