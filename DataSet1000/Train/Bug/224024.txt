If you have two browser windows open. Bring up the "About Mozilla Firebird" info
using window 1. Leave it open, but foreground and minimize window 2. Close the
"about" info associated with window 1. Maximize window 2 again. You'll notice
that the address bar in window 2 is unresponsive, amongst other things. If you
background window 2, then foreground it again, the problem goes away.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open two browser windows
2.Click on "About Mozilla Firebird" in window 1
3.Minimize window 2
4.Close the about dialog from window 1
5.Bring back window 2. Observe that the url bar in window 2 is unresponsive. You
can't type anything in it.

Actual Results:  
The url bar in the window is unresponsive.

Expected Results:  
The url bar in the window should work as normal.

If you have even more windows open, and minimize them all, then even stranger
patterns of window problems occur. If you minimize, say, 3 browser windows, it's
possible to maximize them again and see the bug on one of them without even
closing the "about" info first. It becomes difficult to find the pattern at this
point, so I won't try and go into it. Hopefully the simple steps above are
enough to isolate the problem.

This is a Mac-only bug and I suspect it's really just a part of bug 170499. I
reported it in that bug, but the bug was still set as fixed and this problem
wasn't addressed (see also bug 224022), so I've made it a new bug.
