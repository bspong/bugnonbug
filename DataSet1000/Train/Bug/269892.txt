frames don't always reload correctly when using scripts

The intranet of my university uses Hyperwave, which basically has a small frame
showing the tree structure of the content and a big frame showing the actual
content. When I click on an item of the tree structure, the big frame loads the
correct new content. However, the tree frame itself doesn't open the clicked
branch, it just makes nothing. The operation itself involves a lot of scripting
(tested with IE6, all scripts had to ask for permission). This renders the whole
intranet to useless, as the first page displayed in the tree frame is
'Loading...' and not updating correctly (correctly = not at all, thus giving no
further access). This can be bypassed, however, if I right-click on the frame
and then choose to reload it manually. Then it updates to its correct (new)
state. As most of my friends (non CS students) migrate to Firefox now, this is
quite a proplem ('better future? right now it does not even work').



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. get a login to intranet.fh-ingolstadt.de (University of Applied Science,
Ingolstadt, Germany)
2. log in
3. see that u can not access anything without manually reloading the 'table of
content' frame.
4. Manually reload it

Actual Results:  
After that, it worked. But end-users might not have the knowledge to bypass it.

Expected Results:  
Worked? (Loading the content frame correctly automatically)

Used a standard install of Firefox 1.0
