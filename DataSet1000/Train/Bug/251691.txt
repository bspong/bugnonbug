File Open & File Save dialogs not remembering on-screen position, or folder view

Whenever I use 'File' > 'Open' or 'File' > 'Save Page As' dialogs, they do not
retain the on screen position that I moved them to (for example, if I move them
to the center of the screen). 

They also do not retain their folder view. For example if I were to switch to
'Details' view or to 'Large Icon' view in the dialog, then when I next go back
to use it, it has returned to 'List' View.

Strangely, it DOES retain the dialog window's size however.

All other windows in Firefox seem to retain their on screen placement.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to 'File' > 'Open'
2. Re-position the 'Open File' dialog to the center of the screen
3. Switch the view to 'Deatils' view
4. Open a File
5. Go to the 'File' > 'Open' dialog again
Actual Results:  
The dialog window appears in the top left corner of the screen. The view is
'List' view. 

Expected Results:  
The dialog should have retained it's position and view. In other words, in the
example above, it should have appeared in the Center of the screen with the
'Details' view being used.

Clean Firefox install (No themes or extensions).

It would be best if settings for File Open and File Save Page As dialogs were
retained separately (so that altering one does not affect the display of the
other). 

This would also means that the last used folder will be retained separately for
each dialog too (which is important).
