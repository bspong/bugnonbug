Plugin EMBED does not  get repainted in Firefox (but does in Mozilla)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.8a3) Gecko/20040813
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.8a3) Gecko/20040813

I found this to be true with regards to the Neptune Plugin in Firefox. Mozilla
Does not experience that problem.
Version tried on:
OS: Windows
Firefox: 0.10PR, 0.9.3, nightly from 100704 - Does not work
Mozilla Suite: 1.8rc3 (20040813) - Works



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the neptune plugin from http://www.meadroid.com/neptune/download/
It requires a registration, so I suggest you use http://www.mailinator.net
or alternatively from
http://colormar.no-ip.com/freew/Internet%20Client%20&%20Utils/MeadCo_Neptune.exe
2. Installation instructions fro firefox/mozilla are found on the download page
Easy install: MeadCo_Neptune.exe is a zip file, extract npmeadax.dll and place
it in Firefox plugin directory
3. RestartFirefox. Make sure your IE preferences are set to decent security
4. Open http://www.meadroid.com/neptune/sample.htm (harmless sample page)
5. Try clicking, scrolling, resizing.

Actual Results:  
The embedded object does nto repaint when you click, resize, scroll.
It works fine on Mozilla Suite, so this seems to be firefox problem.

Expected Results:  
Display the page properly and repain when events(click, resize, etc) occur.

This in fact seems to be a greater problem with the EMBED object. So I set it as
major priority.
