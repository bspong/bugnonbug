Intellimouse side buttons not working properly with GTK2/XFT build of Firefox

Using Fedora Core 1 with Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer mouse which has the two
side buttons.  I have the following in XF86Config to allow these side buttons to
work:

Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier  "IntelliMouse"
	Driver      "mouse"
	Option	    "Protocol" "ExplorerPS/2"
	Option	    "Device" "/dev/psaux"
	Option	    "Buttons" "7"
	Option	    "ZAxisMapping" "6 7"
	Option	    "Emulate3Buttons" "no"
EndSection

I also have the following script that runs each time I start KDE:

xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3 6 7 4 5"
imwheel -k -b "67"

My .imwheelrc configuration has the following:

".*"
 None, Up, Alt_L|Left
 None, Down, Alt_L|Right

The GTK1/XFT build of Firefox properly responds as follows:
Near side button navigates back one page (mapped to Alt+Left above)
Far side button navigate forward one page (mapped to Alt+Right above)
This mirrors what happens when using Firefox on Windows.

The GTK2/XFT build of Firefox does not do this.  Instead, both side buttons act
as thought the Page Up key was hit.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
The details section describes what I am doing to reproduce this.
Actual Results:  
The side buttons on my Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer both act as though the
Page Up key was pressed.

Expected Results:  
The side buttons using the configuration I describe in the problem details
should allow me to page navigate back and forward.
