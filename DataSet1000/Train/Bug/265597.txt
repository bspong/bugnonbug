In my website http://www.sinevil.com,my website crashes for no reasen under fire
fox,it must be a bug,i heard it used to work fine under fire fox but now it
crashes.It could be a java script but I dont think it is because it used to work
fine under fire fox.Avant browser and IE works fine Even old mozzila it works
for but fire fox no.I would like to have the problem fixed as soon as possible
my site gets alot of hits a day and i dont really like the fire fox problem thanks.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.type in my site address www.sinevil.com
2.boom it crashes and looks all wierd
3.I did nothing wrong with my website

Actual Results:  
My site crashes under fire fox for no reasen,i hope it gets fixed,honestly i
dont think a browser should be realsed if it doesent have 100% compatabilty,in
witch fire fox does not.

Expected Results:  
Load It right like IE and Avant and net scape,and Mozilla does
