When browsing local file system using a FirebirdSetup.exe installed Firebird,
the images normally shown in front of files and directories are replaced by the
text "File:" and "Directory:" instead.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Run FirebirdSetup.exe to install Firebird.
2.  Open the URL file:///c:/
Actual Results:  
The directory list prepend "Directory: " to directory names and "File: " to file
names.

Expected Results:  
The directory list should show a folder icon in front of a directory, and a file
icon in front of a file.

Using "Page->View Source" to look at the HTML file for the directory listing, I
can see <img> tags pointing to "resource://gre/res/html/gopher-menu.gif" and
"resource://gre/res/html/gopher-unknown.gif".  They were no where to be found
inside the Firebird installation.

Unzipping the MozillaFirebird-win32.zip package from trunk, it has been found
that the "res/html" directory and GIF files inside it were not installed by
FirebirdSetup.exe.

Manually creating the "res/html" directory and placing the GIF files under it
corrected the problem.
