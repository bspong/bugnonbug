The system automatically logs me off right after I sign in, indicating a problem with the cookie.

When I log onto citizensbank.com, a cookie is set that tells the site how long I
am on, and after I believe 30 minutes, the cookie expires and I am automatically
logged off.  Something is happening to this cookie in Firefox, because as soon
as I log on, I am automatically logged off.  This did not happen to me on other
similar websites, such as for my credit cards.

Just to check that there was not a problem with the website, I accessed the site
using Explorer and it opened and remained open with no problem whatsoever.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. log onto the website
2. info is already auto-entered via the password saving function of the browser-
hit {enter} to submit.
3.

Actual Results:  
I get logged onto my account and then immediately logged off, receiving this
message:   Error #1004 - You were automatically logged off, please login again.

Expected Results:  
Allowed me to remain logged onto my account until either I logged out or my
session expired, which would automatically log me out.
