"Web Features" configuration is currently spread out amoung the "Web Features"
section and the "Advanced" section under the preferences dialog. By definition I
dont believe that firefox should (by default) have any advanced configuration
section (extensions might allow advanced config). I suggest simplifying the UI
and unifying the two sections under the "web features" section. 

I propose the following structure which slightly regroups the settings so that
they may be located intuitively. The UI changes i propose would work best if
implemented in the same way as the current "Privacy" section in the preferences
dialog. I have attached a rough mockup for illustrative purposes but  nothings
in the right order or anything. Here is my suggested ne "Web Features" Section:

+ Accessibility
    [x] Move system caret with focus/selection changes
    [x] Use find as you type

+ Images
    [x] Load Images
        [x] for originating website only [Exceptions button]
    [x] resize large images to fit in the browser window

+ Java / JavaScript
    [x] Enable Java
    [x] Enable JavaScript

+ Popup Windows
    [x] Block popup windows [Exceptions]
    
+ Security and Certificates
    [x] Use SSL 2.0
    [x] Use SSL 3.0
    [x] Use TLS 2.0
    [x] Ask which certificate to present [manage certificates]
    
+ Scrolling
    [x] Use Auto Scrolling
    [x] Use smooth Scrolling

+ Software Installation and updates
    [x] Allow web sites to install software [Exceptions]
    [x] Periodically check for updates to:
        [x] Firefox
        [x] My Installed Extensions and Themes

+ Tabs
    [x] Hide tab bar when only one tab is open
    [x] Load new tabs in background
    [x] Warn when closing multiple tabs
    [x] Force new tab when link specifies new window

Obviously any of these feautes that have changed since my last nightly should be
 updated. Additionally if you think that this is too complicated then remove
some of the menu items. This is not an all or nothing bug. Even a general move
to the concept will be appreciated. Discussion welcome
