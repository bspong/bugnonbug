Firefox does not load image from FTP (Mozilla does)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10

At the bottom of the site http://www.bifi.msxnet.org/ there is an image loaded
from an FTP, indicating whether the FTP is online. The image URL is:

ftp://ftp.bifi.msxnet.org/ftp.gif

This image loads fine in Mozilla, however it does not in Firefox. The image will
fail to show up, nor does it load when browsing to it in the FTP's directory.
However, strangely, after you right-click on the image and download it, it will
have no trouble loading anymore (clearing my cache didn't help get the bug back
again). Other (jpg) images present on the same FTP load just fine.

This has also been noticed by the maintainer of the site (which told me about
it), so I guess one could consider that kind of a confirmation of the bug's
existence.
