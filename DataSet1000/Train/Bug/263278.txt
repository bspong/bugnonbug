Bookmark menu hot keys are ambigous when the two hot keys are same

The keyboard shortcut sequence Alt+B selects the Bookmark menu, and when we
press the "first character" of the bookmark (Say G, for the Google.com bookmark
I have added) it opens the google site. But I have added a bookmark for the site
"http://www.miteindia.com", while added the menu caption in the bookmark as
"Manipal IT Education". But when use the keyboard hot keys as Alt+B then
followed by "M" it is opening "Manage bookmarks" window. But it must have went
to the option "Manage bookmarks" without opening it as there is another "M" also
available. (This is the exact behaviour of IE).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
It opened the Manage Bookmarks window.

Expected Results:  
But it must have highlighted to the option "Manage bookmarks" without opening it
as there is another "M" also available. When I press the M again it must have
highlighted the "Manipal IT Education" link. (This is the exact behaviour of IE).
