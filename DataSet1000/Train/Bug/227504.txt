Crash when page load fails while Firebird is hidden

When a site fails to load while Firebird is hidden, it will cause Firebird's
dock icon to bounce once, after which Firebird will crash.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0. Find a site that is down. A "Slashdotted site," for example. (The site I just
experienced the problem on was spymac.com, but it may or may not still be down
when this bug report is reviewed.)

1. attempt to access the site (type its address into the location bar, click on
a link from another site, it doesn't seem to matter).

2. while Firebird attempts to load the page, switch to another application (say,
the Finder), then access the Finder's application menu and select "Hide Others"
(or cmd+opt+h on the keyboard)

3. wait
Actual Results:  
When Firebird can't access the site, its dock icon bounces once or so, then the
app crashes, and then Panther's fancy "Submit Bug Report" dialog appears.

Expected Results:  
Bouncing the dock icon and then an error dialog. But not crashing.

I'm a designer, not a programmer, so this is purely a guess, but the crash might
have something to do with Firebird trying to draw the error dialog sheet.

Most of the time, I have all but the current application hidden, and I've
noticed that certain apps don't handle sheets properly when the program isn't
visible. For example, instead of the sheet being drawn attached to the window,
it's just drawn in the center of the screen, attached to nothing. This used to
happen with the app Cocktail.

Also, I'm using OS X v 10.3.1, and the default Pinstripe 3 theme.

I can provide crash logs if anybody wants to see them.
