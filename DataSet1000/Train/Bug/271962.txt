changing screen resolution down

Changing screen resolution up (from 1280 x 1024 to 1600 x 1200) works OK, but
changing down from 1600 x 1200 to 1280 x 1024 makes text on the right side in
the main webpage window go beyond the computer monitor. Firefox should redisplay
(pushing reload doesn't do the trick), but only restarting Firefox works. My
screen resolution changes are done with my ASUS software (for P2B graphics
adapter) but this is probably a general problem with Firefox 1.0.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a webpage (I used http://gimp-savvy.com/BOOK/ last time)
2. Choose software for changing display resolution, go down in resolution
3. See that the webpage is not displayed correctly (right margin)

Actual Results:  
Each text line on the webpage is not reformatted to fit the display, so the
webpage can no longer be read.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should redisplay (pushing reload doesn't do the trick), but only
restarting Firefox works. This is a bit drastic.

No crash, just wrong display.
