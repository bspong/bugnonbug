Inconsistent behavior when clicking the Download Manager toolbar button with the Download Manager already open

When the Download Manager window is open, left-clicking on the Download Manager
toolbar button sends it behind the main window on mouse-down, then raises it
again on mouse-release.  If one wants to hide the window, one can click down on
the button and drag the cursor off of the button before releasing the mouse
button, leaving it behind the main window without bringing it back to the
foreground.  If one simply clicks and releases the button (normal single-click),
the Download Manager window drops behind the main browser window and immediately
returns back to the foreground on mouse-release.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Place the Download Manager button in the toolbar
2. Open the Download Manager, either with the toolbar button, the hotkey, or via
the Tools menu.
3. Left-click the Download Manager toolbar button, both clicking down and
immediately releasing (without moving the cursor) and clicking down and moving
the cursor away before releasing.
Actual Results:  
When clicking down and immediately releasing without moving the cursor, the open
Download Manager window is sent behind the main browser window and immediately
brought back to the foreground on the release.  When clicking down and moving
the cursor away from the button before releasing, the Download Manager gets sent
behind the main browser window and stays there.

Expected Results:  
Both left-click actions should close the Download Manager window, making the
button a toggle for the window (click once to open, click again to close).

Bug occurs with the default theme.
