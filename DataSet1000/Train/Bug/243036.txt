Error when opening a new popup window via Javascript.  Firefox has error.  Moz Suite doesn't.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8a) Gecko/20040507 Firefox/0.8.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8a) Gecko/20040507 Firefox/0.8.0+

The page is a demonstration of a JavaScript that opens a window containing an
image, then resizes it based on the size of the image, then centers the new window.

The example on the page works in Firebird 0.6 - Firefox 0.8 (maybe earlier), as
well as Mozilla builds back to 0.94.  The April 28th build of Firefox ignored
the JavaScript window, and simply changed the main window to the image.  The May
8th build of Firefox changes the main window to the image, but also opens a new
default window, and produces a JavaScript error.

When trying this exact same page in Mozilla 1.7 builds of the same dates, the
example works as expected.

I made sure to uninstall my nightly builds of Firefox before installing the
newer nightly builds, as to avoid potential problems, although I have not
deleted my profile at all.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the webpage mentioned above.
2. Click on the example image.
3. Receive JavaScript errors.

Actual Results:
