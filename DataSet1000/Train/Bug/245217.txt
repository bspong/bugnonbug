This bug is very specific, I've tried some different circumstances, and to me it
seems Firefox only. So this is what happens:

I'm using the Horde (www.horde.org) webmail system for checking mail. My
username and password for this system are in my Firefox profile so I don't have
to enter it every time again. Then when I clock login, then logout again and
then decide to go to my startpage, everything is normal. But when I login,
logout, login again and logout again and THEN hit the Firefox startpage-button,
the browser simply closes. This has happened every time since I tried it.

I've tested it on 2 different websites where I have a webmail-account with
Horde, both the same story. Another thing I tried is to set another homepage and
the problem is suddenly gone!

Some details: I have http://www.scarlet.be/nl/consumer as "crashing"-startpage.
Something what might cause the crash are the Flash-banners?
When using google as startpage everything is normal.

Maybe this is not a big deal at all but it might be due to a bigger "unvisible"
shortcoming of the sourcecode, so I thought I'd submit this anyway ;-)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set browser startpage to http://www.scarlet.be/nl/consumer
2. Going to the horde login by entering the URL or selecting the bookmark (in my
case it's webmail.fuifbeest.com or wiebel.dommel.com/horde/
3. Login/username are filled in automaticly because of previous visits
4. Hit the login button
5. Click the logout-link
6. Hit the login button
7. Click the logout-link
8. Hit the startpage button

Actual Results:  
Browser simply closes, no more, no less.

Expected Results:  
Display my homepage http://www.scarlet.be/nl/consumer

* I've tested this with the gray-modern and the default theme, doesn't matter,
bug is still there.
* I'm using a fully up-to-date WinXP Home.
