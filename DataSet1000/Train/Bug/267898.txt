When I'm am using my scrollwheel in the "Languages and Character Encoding"-menu
to add a new language or set a default charachter encoding via the selectionbox,
it scrolls multiple pages with only one scrollwheelmove. It skips a certain
amount of options because it scrolls "too much".

I'm using the deafult mouse-settings of my Windows XP machine and installed _no_
specific drivers for my Logitech Mouseman Dual Optical.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. The default setting in the Wheel tab of the Mouse menu (in the Windows
Control Panel) is 3 lines at a time.
2. Go to Tools -> Options... -> Click in the General tab the Languages button 
3. Click on the "Select a language to add..."-selectionbox and use the
scrollwheel of the mouse to scroll down.
Actual Results:  
U can see the vertical scrollbar moves too fast and skips some languages. The
same applies to the "Default character encoding"-selectionbox

Expected Results:  
The scrollbar should have moved only the number of lines specified in the
Windows Mouse menu (Control Panel -> Mouse -> Wheel tab), which is 3 by default.

If I select "One screen at a time" instead of "3 lines at a time" in the Windows
Mouse menu it does what is sais (but I don't like that setting for surfing web
pages ;-).
