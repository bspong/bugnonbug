browsing multiple pages, new mozilla dialogs (search, remember password) hang firefox
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040207 Firefox/0.8

My setup was this: I had two fire fox windows open, each of them with about 6
tabs.  One window had about 6 tabs on the URL above (de.tikiwiki.org).  That URL
in itself hangs firefox while it loads.  I opened up another tab and initiated a
search in the page.  The search dialog was un-usuable, no button did anything
and I couldn't close it (i'm on ximian2 on redhat9).  Note that the browser was
still usable, I just had this dialog box hanging around.

I came here to register an account and report the bug, and when it prompted me
if I wanted to remember my bugzilla password, fiefox totally hung, couldn't
close/click anything.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. open up several of those complex urls
2. open up a non-complex url
3. try to do something that causes a dialog pop by firefox (search, password, etc)

Actual Results:  
Sometimes hangs

Expected Results:  
First, Firefox shouldn't hang - whether that be the 2 second hanging while
loading the above URL, or totally hanging with the dialog boxes

I marked this as a critical because it hangs and caused me to loose my data :|
