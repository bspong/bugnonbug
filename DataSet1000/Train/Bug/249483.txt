Visual information needed when search wraps
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; www.k2pdf.com; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

When searching inside a page (Find in this Page), either from the Dialog or 
Find-As-You-Type, when you iterate the several search matches, there is no 
information for the user when the search wraps (i.e., gets to end of the page 
and starts back up at the top), other than the vertical scroll-bar on the 
right, which is not very useful.

I think the user should be warned that the search has wrapped, because I often 
found myself analyzing several search matches for the second time without 
noticing that wrapping had occurred. This is pretty annoying and innefective.

A possible solution would be a message box like in IE, but this is terrible 
because you have to go click the OK button - not what "Find-as-you-Type" users 
like.

Perhaps a better solution is some other kind of non-obtrusive visual cue. In 
Microsoft Developer Studio the status bar shows an appropriate message with a 
blue background, to make it more evident. It serves the purpose.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any sufficiently large Web page (like the one you're looking at know, 
describing this bug);
2. Start a "Find-as-you-Type" search by typing the word "bug", for example 
(something that has several matches on the page);
3. Press F3 to iterate through the other matches until the last match on the 
page is reached, and press F3 once more;


Actual Results:  
The search wrapped to the first occurrence on the page.

Expected Results:  
The search should have wrapped to the first occurrence on the page, but giving 
some visual indication to the user, so he isn't left to recognizing matches he 
has already examined.
