Wheneven I'm managing the bookmarks using bookmark manager, I drag a bookmark to
its new location (mouse drag) for normal organization of bookmarks like
classification etc.

The bookmarks sticks in its new place properly. However, apart of this, the
bookmarks is also opened in the same tab and bookmark manager becomes history
(literally, as you need to go back in history to go back to bookmark manager).

This is very annoying as after every bookmark move, the bookmark loads and I
have to do history back to get back to bookmark manager.

Also, I remember, Earlier we were able to drag folder in new location on toolbar
itself. That no longer happens now. What happened on that front.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load Bookmark manager (Bookmarks->Manage..)
2. Drag a bookmark (in right pane) from folder "foo" to its new location in
folder "bar".


Actual Results:  
The bookmark moves from foo to bar.
However, bookmark also loads in manager tab.

Expected Results:  
Two choices
1. Bookmark should only be loaded in case of click and not in case of drag.
2. In manager window/tab, bookmark should never be loaded (since it is bookmark
manager afterall and not a sidebar)
