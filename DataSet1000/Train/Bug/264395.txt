"Force links ... to open in: the same tab" breaks some sites
Bug 172962 gives the user the option of folding new windows back into the opener
("force links that open new windows to open in the same tab/window as the
link.") Despite this just being a scary and seemingly technically inadvisable
thing to do, it pretty much works. Some things however will not work.

Websites coded to pass data between the opener and opened windows obviously
won't function correctly, since the opener is gone. Sites that will experience
this problem are generally sites that treat the opened window like a dialog.
http://www.magic.gov.uk is an example. There are of course many others. Sites
with complex opening code like this

var w = window.open("about:blank")
w.location = "http://www.mozilla.org/"

won't work, again because the script aborts when the opener window is replaced.
(Note that this:

var w = window.open("")
w.location = "http://www.mozilla.org/"

does work. I was able to finagle that.)

Obviously full-on Single Window Mode has disadvantages and I hope users will
lean toward tabbed Single Window Mode, which doesn't have the same fundamental
inability. It occurs that FoSWM could be fixed if we actually opened the new
window into a new tab, presumably without showing the tab bar. Now both windows
remain open simultaneously and script should work. Close the new tab and the
window reverts to the original window/tab. Navigate away from the new tab and we
know we can close the original tab. (Generally. Multiple layers of "dialogs"
wouldn't work if we were too eager to close the original tab.)

I'm not seriously suggesting we implement this. But it is an issue with full-on
single window/tab mode, and I expect this bug will collect duplicates.
