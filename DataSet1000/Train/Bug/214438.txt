When behind a proxy, and after initial proxy login, a file not found (404) is returned by yahoo servers; the username and password for Yahoo site are not remembered/autocompleted by firebird

In my office we use Novell Bordermanager as proxy. It requires me to athenticate
the first time I try to access an internet url. The proxy uses web based
authentication.
If this first page is mail.yahoo.com, then after the web based authentication,
instead of seeing my mailbox I see a "file not found" error from yahoo servers.

If I now enter the url again in the address box to reload the page, everything
works fine. From then on, everything works OK, until my proxy session times out.

This thing does not happen with Internet Explorer: after logging in with the
proxy, I get carried directly to yahoo login screen.

Another point is that my Yahoo username and password are not
remembered/autocompleted by Firebird. (whereas they are for all other sites I
access)

Thank you very much for your attention.
