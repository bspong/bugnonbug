If I type in the address bar www.cnn.com a descriptor appears to the right and
reads CNN.com.  If I then type www.msnbc.com, there appears no descriptor.  If I
then close the browser and reopen it, www.cnn.com remains in the address bar
drop down list, however, www.msnbc.com is no longer in the list.

4. In the address bar type www.msnbc.com and go to the site.
5. Pull down the address bar and notice there is no descriptor to the right
6. Close all browser windows
7. Open browser, pull down the address bar.  Only www.cnn.com remains in the
drop down list
