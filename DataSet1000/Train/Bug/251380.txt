When saving a picture, HUGE memory leak! Also slows machine down!

If I save some pictures (5-8 jpg pictures of a resolution of about 800x1000 are
already enough), firefox slows dramatically down and eats up *a* *lot* of
memory. This was present already in V0.9.1
After 10 saved Pictures memory usage increases from ~25 MB to more thann 200 MB.
(I have 640 MB RAM and a 1 GB swap file)

I don't know if it has sth. to do with AntiVir, but according to the Task
manager it's firefox who's eating up all the memory.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. surf to some site with large (800x1000 or greater) pictures on it
2. Open some (6..10) pictures in new tabs by pressing the mid button on the JPG
link. (Or only 1 pic in a new tab, save it, close tab, open the next, and so on
--- doesn't matter)
3. right click the picture an choose "Save picture as"
4. repeat 5 to 10 times from step 1

Watch the memory usage in task manager: it grows RAPIDLY. *MUCH* faster than the
file size of the images. Seems, the allocated RAM for the already DECOMPRESSED
JPEP-Picture isn't freed. 
(IMHO it's strange enough that so much RAM is allocated when *SAVING* a picture)
Actual Results:  
Firefox slows down RAPIDLY  (you have to wait more than a minute, to use firefox
again when the fith or sixth or later image is saved)
And firefox eats an never frees muuuuuuuuch memory.

Expected Results:  
free the memory or better: don't allocate it at all (what's the sake of
allocating memory, when saving a picture from memory, that already *IS* in the
memory?)
