Phoenix crashes directly on startup when it opens over my xterm and I was typing
something while it loaded.  This does not appear to happen if I was only typing
letters and numbers, but if I type return or an arrow key right when the window
appears.  The window then appears, thinks for a second or two, and then the
whole app crashes, taking down all of the icons from the web pages in the
bookmarks (which by the way I find _highly_ annoying and it deserves a bug
report in it's own right).  This would not bother me if there was a way to tell
Phoenix to start in the upper right corner, but Phoenix (bug three!) ignores
-geometry.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start phoenix
2. keep pressing return or the arrow up key while it loads so that the new
window (your window manager needs to give it focus for this to work) receives
the events while phoenix is loading


Actual Results:  
*boom* *crash* *burn*

Expected Results:  
not crash and burn

I am using the default theme.

Please note that I cvs updated my phoenix yesterday and rebuilt it as well.  The
fact that the user agent string reports a version from over a month ago is also
a bug in Phoenix (let's call it bug 4).
