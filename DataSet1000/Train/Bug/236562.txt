opening links from other applications hangs parts of Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

When opening a URL from another application and firefox is not running, firefox
becomes unusable. (not quite a hang)
firefox will open but the Bookmarks Toolbar will have no icons and you will be
unable to do anything with the URL bar or menus (can't select, type or use
keyboard accelerators) Also, the page does not load.

This behavior persists if firefox is closed and opened again, and closed then
opened a second time. Normal behavior resumes when firefox is opened a third
time. When normal behavior is resumed, the link that was selected will appear in
the URL bar history indicating that it way have loaded and just not been displayed.

The above does not occur if firefox is alread opened and an external link is loaded.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. set firefox as the default URL handler
2. close firefox
3. click a link in another application



I have not seen a bug with this behavior, however the following seem to share
some characteristics and may be related.
