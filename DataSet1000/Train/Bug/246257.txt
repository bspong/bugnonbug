i was using this script on firefox 0.8, the tagging was just fine, when i
selected some text and then clicked the bold icon, it turned out bold text, and
the next time, the text was un-bolded

so, this new beta release of firefox0.9 used the <span> tag, instead of
<b>hello</b> it was like <span style="font-weight: bold">hello</span>
which is -almost- as bad as the microsoft word html

and preloaded content can't be edited (about:blank works, but if i use an html
with text, it won't work)

i know i'm using a beta release, but you should fix that

i hope i wrote it good, 'cause i'm Mexican

gracias amigos, sigan con ese estupendo trabajo
