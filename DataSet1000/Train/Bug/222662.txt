Firefox causes Word Perfect 10 Temporary Backup File Creation to Fail
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031015 Firebird/0.7 (aebrahim)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031015 Firebird/0.7 (aebrahim)

Word Perfect has a temporary backup system, creating a file at whatever interval
the user sets; in my case, it is set for twenty minutes.

For the past few months, I have been having problems, where WP will give an
error message that the temporary backup folder does not exist, even when it is
definitely there.

After quite a bit of experimenting, I have been able to determine that this
problem only arises when Firebird is running; this was true for 0.6.1, for the
RCs of 0.7, and for the version I'm currently using.

I am NOT a programmer, just an experienced computer user. I would be happy to
provide any information you might need, when the failure in WP arises, to help
you figure out why Firebird and WP don't like to coexist. If you want that
information, you'll have to walk me through the steps, but I'll do anything I
can to assist.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firebird
2. Start WP, set temporary backup period to one minute to speed up the testing.
3. Create a document, add one letter, wait for the temporary backup to take
place. If it works, add another letter, wait, etc.; sooner or later, WP will
refuse to create a temporary backup.

Actual Results:  
Turn off Firebird, restart WP; repeat the steps above. I've done this with the
temporary backup period set to one minute, repeating it for over thirty minutes,
and, so long as Firebird is not running, WP will create the temporary backup
every single time.

Expected Results:  
That's rther hard to answer, other that to say that Mozilla Firebird should not
interfer with Word Perfect, I guess.
