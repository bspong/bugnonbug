If the Bookmarks toolbar is visible, you can normally add a new folder to it by
right-clicking on it and choosing "New Folder.." from the context menu. However,
after adding a new toolbar by selecting View->Toolbars->Customizize->"Add New
Toolbar" you can no longer add a new folder to the Bookmarks toolbar unless you
restart firefox.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make your Bookmarks Toolbar visible if it's not.
1. Select View->Toolbars->Customize->"Add New Toolbar"
2. Enter a name for the toolbar, Click "OK", the toolbar becomes visible
3. Click Done or drag some items to the toolbar and then click Done, either way
is fine
4. Right-click on the Bookmarks Toolbar and select "New Folder..."

Actual Results:  
Nothing, no dialog to create a toolbar folder was displayed.

Expected Results:  
A "Properties for 'New Folder'" Dialog should be displayed
