Linux version of firefox [and mozilla] renders page incorrectly works as it should with windows build of Firefox.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041026 Firefox/1.0RC1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041026 Firefox/1.0RC1

When I go to any of the articles like this one
http://ps2.ign.com/articles/562/562512p1.html on IGN the add towards the mid
left of the screen does not render properly. It ends up covering up part of the
text of the article in the shape of what the add looks like when it expands, and
when I hover the mouse over it the add expands as it should but does not retract
afterwards as it should. This same behavior is also exhibited in Mozilla 1.7.3.
The page renders perfectly when I use firefox on windows [I would assume mozilla
would also render the ad properly on windows as well; but I haven't installed
Mozilla on windows so I am unsure of it's behavior.] the versions of Firefox I
use under both windows and Linux are the same (rc1) so I am pretty sure it isn't
an OS or site issue.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to ign.com
2. Go to [apparently] any article which contains this ad at the left.
3.

Actual Results:  
Some text is covered over by the space which the ad will occupy when expanded by
mouse hover, ad will then not retract

Expected Results:  
Displayer the text that is covered on load of page until such time as I initiate
ad expansion by hovering my mouse over the ad.
