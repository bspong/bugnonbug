Page is not properly refreshed on scrolling up/down if there is (a) Flash content and a (b) "position:fixed" element present.

On scrolling up/down, you see "shadows" of Flash animations (normally gray
rectangles or still frames from the Flash movie) being redisplayed in the same
x-position on the new page (normally in the screen position the flash animation
was at before the scroll). This occurs whether you use the mouse, the scroll bar
or the keyboard to scroll. Tests have shown that if the div containing the ad on
the right (which has "position: fixed") is changed to "position: absolute", the
problem goes away. It does not matter what the content in the fixed div is.

The problem has been seen in both Firefox 0.9.3 and 1.0PR on MacOS X. In both
cases Flash plugin 7.0 was being used. The problem has not been observed in
Linux or Windows. It has not been seen in Camino 0.8 for OS X either.

It sounds similar to bug 256480 (despite a different OS) - perhaps it is related?
