crash when opening firefox browser by clicking a link in Outlook or opening html file from windows explorer
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1

When firefox is opened by clicking on a URL in an Outlook email message or when
I double-click on an html file in windows explorer, I frequently get the
following error message:

Windows error dialog title: "FIREFOX.EXE - Application Error"
Dialot text: "The instruction at "0x77f5b2ab" referenced memory at "0x00000030".
 The memory could not be "read".

Click on OK to terminate the program
Click on CANCEL to debug the program"

When I click on cancel it opened Microsoft Visual Studio and said there was an
unhandled exception.  (I've since removed VC++, so I don't have the exact text
any longer.)

This problem has been happening since I started using Firefox on version 0.9.3.
 I've had the problem with 1.0PR and 1-1.0PR.  In each case I've removed the
profile directory and performed a clean install.

One piece of information that could be significant is I'm using a dual-processor
HP x4000 workstation.  I searched for multi-CPU, dual-CPU, dual-processor
related issues and haven't seen any other bugs that match the symptoms I'm having.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Double click on an html file in Windows Explorer.
2. It generally works a couple of times and then begins to fail.
3. The same thing happens when opening URLs from Outlook.

Actual Results:  
Crashes with the EXACT same error message as I described in the Details section.

Expected Results:  
Opened without crashing.

I've generally use a different theme and have several extensions loaded, but I
just instealled 1-1.0PR without installing any themes and got the same behavior.

I'm using Windows XP Professional Version 2002 Service Pack 1.  The system I'm
on has two Xeon CPUs @ 2.8 GHz with 2 GB of RAM.

The last time I installed Firefox I installed the Quality Feedback agent, but
don't see how to get any more details about this crash.  If there's a way to get
more information, please let me know and I'll do what I can to provide the details.
