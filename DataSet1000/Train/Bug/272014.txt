When a completion combo-box pulldown has focus, tab-switching shortcuts move the
highlight up and down, and don't switch tabs.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Change focus to the address bar.
2. Type a few characters to show the address bar completion pulldown.
3. Hit ctrl-pgup or ctrl-pgdn, and watch the tab switch.

4. Visit http://www.google.com a few times, each time entering a query into the
web page's text field
5. Visit google again, and type a key matching the first character in a previous
query you typed
6. The text field pulldown appears, showing you possible completions
7. Ctrl-pgup or ctrl-pgdn just move the highlighted entry to the top or bottom
of the list

Expected Results:  
(item 3 above)

I have the 'keyconfig' extension installed, but the pgup and pgdn shortcuts
aren't listed.  I believe I installed keyconfig in an attempt to fix this problem.
