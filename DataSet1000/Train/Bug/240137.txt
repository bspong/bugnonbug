Feature Request: Multiple Sidebars

Opening something new in the sidebar replaces what is already there. This seems
sort of stupid. I run my computer in a 1680x1050 resolution (widescreen baby)
and there's a ton of wasted space below the information in the sidebar. Even in
lower resolutions this is noticeable. Wouldn't it make more sense to be able to
have multiple panes of information in the sidebar? For example, I use the
Download Manager Tweak extension, and put my download manager in the sidebar. I
usually keep my bookmarks there (widescreen gives me some extra space on the
side) and they go away when the download manager pops up. This seems
unnecessary. I'd love to have my bookmarks AND my download manager over there,
along with anything else I decide to add later.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Thuroughly explained in "Steps to Reproduce." Not too complicated.

1. Open something in the sidebar.
