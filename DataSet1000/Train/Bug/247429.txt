Firefox 0.9 milestone simply refuses to launch
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040531 Firefox/0.8.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040531 Firefox/0.8.0+

After downloading 0.9 and putting it in my Applications folder (after putting
the old nightly in the trash,) I tried to run it, but it bounced once, quit (the
arrow under it's icon went away) then it came back, bounced again, quit again.
Doing this over and over until I force quit it.

The nightly I was using about a week before 0.9 came out works fine, and is what
I'm using to write this. Only 0.9 has this problem. 

I've also tried deleting every Firefox setting I could find (~/Library,
~/Library/Application Support, ~/Library/Preferences) and the problem still exists.

It spammed my console, over and over, with the message below, and that's all I
have. If there's any other log you want me to dig up, just let me know.
