Please add the "Switch Profile..." option to the Tools Menu

I use profiles extensively and like the idea of being able to switch profiles
"on-the-fly". Mozilla 1.4 does offer something that will work. They have
included a menu option on the Tools Menu called "Switch Profiles..." (see
screenshot #1). This is great and is exactly what I need. However, Firebird does
not have this option (see screenshot #2) and I have to shut down Firebird and
restart it again with the -p flag. I do not want to use Mozilla because Firebird
is too damn cool in all other aspects, so please don't tell me to switch and use
Mozilla. I am looking to the Firebird developers to just add this piece of code
and this option back into Firebird. Thanks.
