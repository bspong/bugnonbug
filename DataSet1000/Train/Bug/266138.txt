If the browser follows a link that should result in a download, and the browser
is already open by another user (via OS X's multiple users), then it crashes.  

Selecting "save this link as..." from the pop-up menu allows correct download
without crash.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create two OS X user accounts on the same machine.  The primary account must
be admin.
2. Enable fast user switching (System Preferences)
3. Install Firefox using primary account
4. Launch Firefox in primary account
5. Switch to secondary account, leaving Firefox open
6. Launch Firefox in secondary account
7. Navigate to any link that results in a download starting (ie FireFox
download, Sourceforge project downloads, etc)
8. When the download should begin, Firefox crashes

*. Navigate to the same link, but "Save link as..." instead of clicking the
link.  The file downloads correctly.
Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes before starting download.

Expected Results:  
Firefox behaves as if user had chosen "Save link as..." from the pop-up menu.
