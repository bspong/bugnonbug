Select list inside div and table re-renders larger when button is clicked
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2

A SELECT list contained within a visible DIV contained within a TABLE increases
in size when a button is clicked, even if the button has no action.  I found the
bug disappeared if I made the DIV non-visible by removing 'border: ...; padding:
...;' from its styles.  The bug also did not appear when I removed the DIV or
the TABLE from the page.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a <table>
2. Inside a <td>, place a <div> styled to have either borders or padding and
styled with 'width: 100%'
3. Inside the <div>, place a <select multiple> styled with 'width: 100%', and
with options; close the select correctly
4. Inside the <div>, place an <input type='button'>
5. Finish the page
6. View the page in Firefox; when the button is clicked, the select increases in
size!
Actual Results:  
when the button was clicked,, the width of the select list increased.

Expected Results:  
There should hve been no change in rendering (except possibly the button-pressed
effect)
