If you click a url in JavsScript Console, View Source opens. It is different
from the normal View Source. It has Mozilla-specific menu items. Some of them do not
work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Javascript console.
2. Look for a link in it. If you can't find one, browse to
http://java.sun.com/getjava/
3. Click on the url (not beneath it).

Actual Results:  
A View Source window opens and jumps to the line of the error (new Mozilla
feature). It has several menu items from the Mozilla version of View Source,
which are not present in the "normal" Firebird version of View Source:
Menu File-New-Navigator Window, Composer Page (doesn't work), Message (my email
client opens a new message);
Menu File-Edit Page (doesn't work), Page Setup;
Menu Edit-Goto line, Find Previous, Find Text As You Type;
Menu View-Text Zoom;
Menu Help-Release Notes, About Plug-ins, About Mozilla Firebird.

Expected Results:  
The View Source window entered from the js console should show the same menu
items as the "normal" Firebird one. They should both contain useful items such
as Edit-Goto line, Find Previous, Find Text As You Type and View-Text Zoom.
