<col> tags css background formatting when using style or class attributes is ignored

here's some html to illustrate the problem:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
<html>
<head>
<style type="text/css">
#tab {border-collapse:collapse;width:100%;}
#tab td {border:1px dotted black;}
.number {text-align:right;background:red;}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<table id="tab" cellspacing="0">
<col><col style="text-align:center;"><col class="number">
<tbody>
	<tr><td>a1</td><td>b1</td><td>c1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>a2</td><td>b2</td><td>c2</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="number">a3</td><td style="text-align: right;">b3</td><td
style="text-align: center;">c3</td></tr>
	<tr><td>a4</td><td>b4</td><td>c4</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</body>
</html>

this table should be rendered with the second column text centered and the thrid
column text right aligned and red. The third row is rendered correctly as the
css is applied at the cell level (except that the third cell - c3 - should be
red, as it should inherit the css from the col tag).

Note that i've reported this bug incorrectly before (#262159), as i was made
aware, text-align and color are not supported for the col tag according to the
css 2.1 specs (http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#q4).

However according to the specs 'background' IS valid in col tags...
from the above w3.org link (17.3 Columns)...
----------------
The following properties apply to column and column-group elements:
...
'background'
    The background properties set the background for cells in the column, but
only if both the cell and row have transparent backgrounds. See "Table layers
and transparency."
-----------------

also, interestingly enough i've noticed that when changing the doctype to strict
(<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Strict//EN">) everything works
exactly like IE, even the text-align and color in the col tags - effectively
extending the css2.1 specs - VERY COOL.

anyway, please let me know if i'm missing something or if the css background not
working in col tags is infact a bug.

Thanks

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.paste the html code above into a texteditor (ie. notepad)
2.save as test.htm onto your computer (ie. desktop)
3.open the test.htm file in Firefox/Mozilla and observe the incorrect behaviour.
4.open in IE or any other recent, non mozilla based browser and see how it
should be interpreted.

Actual Results:  
renders incorrectly - the col tag background css is completely ignored when the
table is rendered.

Expected Results:  
it should use the css specified inside the col tags to render the table correctly.
