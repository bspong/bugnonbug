When using the Firefox DOM Inspector I tried to change some preferences.  Clicking on the Ok button for the preferences button doesn't close the window.  It is unclear whether it commits changes to preferences.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open DOM Inspector
2. Click OK
3.

Actual Results:  
Nothing

Expected Results:  
Ok should commit changes then close the Preferences window.
