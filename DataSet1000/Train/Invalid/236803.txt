In the page at
https://doc.telin.nl/dscgi/ds.py/Get/File-34088/Blogs_stikiness_factor.pdf, when
I print the PDF document, the text comes out garbled - squares appear as though
the printer doesn't recognise the text.  The page prints fine in Internet
Explorer.  Other PDF documents tested print and work fine.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the URL,
https://doc.telin.nl/dscgi/ds.py/Get/File-34088/Blogs_stikiness_factor.pdf
2. Print the document - File > Print... > OK
3. Look at the print out - garbled text.

Actual Results:  
Produced garbled text, although any graphics were printed correctly.

Expected Results:  
Printed legible text.
