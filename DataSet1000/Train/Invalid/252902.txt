I want a different cookie acceptance policy: I want to accept cookies from all
sites as "session" cookies, except for regular sites that I trust (web-mail,
google, mozilla, etc.), which I'd like to allow long-term cookies as well. 
This can be implemented by a simple white-list mechanism: any site not on the
list will have its cookies deleted when I leave it. As simple as that.
One more thing: add a "privacy" component to bugzilla.
