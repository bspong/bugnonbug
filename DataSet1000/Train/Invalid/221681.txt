I copied some lines from the table from
http://www.literaturhaus.at/autoren/H/horvath/fotografien/

When I wanted to paste into Google, it just pasted the first line. I tried the
same on several other websites. It seems that this just occures at this page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.literaturhaus.at/autoren/H/horvath/fotografien/
2. select some lines of the text below the pictures
3. and copy it to the clipboard either by shortcut or right-click -> copy

Actual Results:  
It just pasted the first selected line.

Expected Results:  
It should have passted all two lines.
