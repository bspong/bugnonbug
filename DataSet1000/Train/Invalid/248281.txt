Windows XP Pro SP1 with FireFox 0.9

Once 4 connections have been made through a proxy (ie with downloads) further
connections are blocked until there are less than 4 current connections. 
Connections not going through a proxy are not affected.  The only knob I can
find to twiddle is network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-proxy and
changing that makes no difference.

Under 0.8 this problem didn't occur and it doesn't occur under Mozilla 1.7.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install FireFox 0.9
2. Configure a proxy
3. Launch 4 downloads, through a proxy.
4. Try to launch a 5th, or connect to any web site through the proxy.

Actual Results:  
Step (4) blocked until one of the downloads ended.

Expected Results:  
There should be the ability to increase this limit, particularly as it doesn't
occur under 0.8 or Mozilla 1.7.
