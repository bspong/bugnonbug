Constant reloading *NOT REPRODUCABLE*

As others have said, certain pages will reload continuously. One of the few for
me is adobe.com.

This bug is MACHINE SPECIFIC. Different machines never have the problem with the
same website.

However, I have talked to close to 20 firebird users and all of them experiance
it on different sites.

Its NOT the site to my knowledge. Its a firebird problem. But as stated, it is
not LAB REPRODUCABLE. To acheive a reproduction, you have to locate a
production. Someone needs to surf around alot and find a site that produces the
bug on THAT machine.

I'm using 0.6.1 which I just installed clean.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Not reproducable cross-machine
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Reloads over and over endlessly. Resetting, any mouse clicks or form populations.

Expected Results:  
Not reloaded without request

If the same page is loaded in IE there is no problem.
