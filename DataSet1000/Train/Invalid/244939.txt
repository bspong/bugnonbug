When looking at the homepage of Apple's site (www.apple.com) with firefox on
Windows XP, the page is not shown apart from some text at the bottom. Viewing
the same site with Firefox on MacOS X shows the page perfectly.

Also, I notice that Firefox Windows doesn't display images, like in this BB page:
http://forum.macosx.nl/viewtopic.php?t=17125&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=15
where to me the code of the image looks quite fine (only the 'alt' property is
missing, but I don't see why that should break the display of an image).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox Windows (XP)
2. Go to www.apple.com

Actual Results:  
Nothing

Expected Results:  
shown the full page, similar to it's MacOS X version

Basic install of Firefox 0.8 about 2 weeks ago on a Windowx XP computer.
