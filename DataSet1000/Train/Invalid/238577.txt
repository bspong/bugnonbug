The browser crashes when attempting to render the page

The Firefox browser crashes when trying to render www.blvdbeer.com.  I've
narrowed the problem down to the browser attempting to render
www.blvdbeer.com/sticker.html.   That HTML has some \<applet> STUFF </applet>
stuff in it.

I only have the listed build (no Windows or Mac boxes to test on) otherwise I
would have been more thorough.  While you\'re trying to reproduce this bug, you
should check out www.blvdbeer.com.  They sell GREAT beer.
