At first I thought the bookmark's icon is not changed if it is a favicon but it
also doesn't work on normal Bookmark Icons.
Scheduler works as "Display an alert works"

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bookmark a page
2. setup schedule and notifier


Actual Results:  
Bookmark's icon doesn't change

Expected Results:  
change the icon
