The web features window in option does not look very professional. In
particular, there is an asymmetry between block popup (the list of sites has a
big text input box) and images (exceptions sites visible only when "permissions"
is clicked. The button text should be reworked.

My suggestion: remove checkboxes and replace them with radio buttoas, eliminate
the popup exceptions input box and make it accessible through a button with
button text "specify exceptions" (or "manage exceptions")
Same thing with images. Something like this:

o Block                  |--------------------|
          Popup windows  | Specify exceptions |
o Allow                  |--------------------|    

o Block                  |--------------------|
          Image loading  | Specify exceptions |
o Allow                  |--------------------|    


You may want to go as far as replacing the button text with "except for sites
listed here"
