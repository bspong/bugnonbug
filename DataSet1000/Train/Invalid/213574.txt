Just on Windows build it is necessary to click OK to post anytime the query data
to go back from the abstract window to the results list.
The same release works fine on Linux.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed
2. enter a keywork (ex : "thyroiditis") then click on a result to read abstract
3. when opened an abstract click the back button.

Actual Results:  
A window asks me to post again the query data or abort it

Expected Results:  
I expect Firebird to go back to results windows without ask anything, as it does
on Linux.
