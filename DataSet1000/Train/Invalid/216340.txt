The "cruise down" button on the Logitech MX-700 mouse is designed to scroll down while pressed and stop when released. Instead the "cruise down" button has no effect. This button works flawlessly in all other applications, but not in Mozilla Firebird 0.6.1. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open web page on a system using the logitech MX-700
2.attempt to use the "cruise down" button
3.

Actual Results:  
results are the same each time, "cruise down" button does nothing. The on screen icon indicating that the command is being presented to the program appears as it does in all applications, but no scrolling takes place.

Expected Results:  
When the "Cruise down" button is pressed the displayed page should scroll down.
