Tab bar color hardcoded black instead of being defined by Windows tab text color

I am a WindowBlinds (stardock.com) user and noticed this problem when changing
to dark windows themes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. No special steps, problem is always present.



Expected Results:  
Tab color should change depend on windows tab text settings.

The following was my discussion on the WinCustomize site:

Me: Theme problem: Go to mozilla.org, download the Phoenix browser (free) and
look at the tabbed interface. They're solid black with a green trim, the text
doesn't show up at all on the tabs.

Response: Aqua.: Unfortunately it appears that Phonenix is not properly coded,
it's ignoring the color settings for the tabs. Nothing I can do about that.  I
can see the text on my test machine but I have the brightness turned up a bit.

==============================

The above prompted me to test many themes, the tab color in Phoenix appears to
be hardcoded black.

When using dark themes, this renders Phoenix partially unusable because it is
difficult to see page titles in the tabs.
