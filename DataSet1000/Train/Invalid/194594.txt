JavaScript Console - No easy way to change sort order (was in removed menu)
The JavaScript Console in Phoenix doesn't have a menu as in Mozilla. This means
that there is no obvious way to change the sort order in Phoenix. 

This is quite annoying, since the last messages are appended to the list and the
list doesn't auto-scroll. I would be satisfied with a change in the default sort
order.
