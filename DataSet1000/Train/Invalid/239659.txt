MNG extension no longer works with Firefox nightlies

I'm not exactly sure where this bug should be filed-- or if it should even be
filed on this server-- but it needs to be pointed out that for the latest
Firefox nightlies, the MNG extension available at
http://quicktools.mozdev.org/mngsupport/ no longer works, producing an error in
xpcom.dll upon installation and producing no rendering for MNGs thereafter.

The error, if it's of any help:
The procedure entry point ??_7nsQueryInterface@@6B@ could not be located in the
dynamic link library xpcom.dll.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the MNG extension from the URL listed above.
2. Restart Firefox.

Actual Results:  
A dialogue box with the error mentioned in the description displays; then
Firefox starts normally, but it is unable to load MNG images.

Expected Results:  
No error should display, and Firefox should be able to display MNGs.
