Windows XP, all patches current. This problem much less in Firebird 0.61. When
opening several instances and several tabs in each instance, the response would
become slow in Firebird 0.61. Soon after all instances would crash. In Firebird
0.7, this crashing happens sooner. 

It would be great if instances were completely separate from each other. 

It seems sensible to increase the stack space to allow 40 instances with 10 tabs
each.

I am often asked to research numerous subjects. Each subject becomes a Firebird
instance. Each tab is some information found on the subject. The number of
subjects can easily reach 40 before I have finished some and can close them.
