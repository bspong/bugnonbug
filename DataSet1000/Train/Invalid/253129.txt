The above pretty much explains it, I've updated the java runtime plugin.  When I
try and login to my financial institution's website and tick off the "remember
login id" I get the javascript error that is supplied in the URL.

1. open www.pcfinancial.com
2. input my banking card number, tick off remember number, and supply password
3. hit submit info

Actual Results:  
error message in supplied URL pops up.  After pressing Okay on error message I
am left with the financial institutions login page

Expected Results:  
logged me in to my banking info.  Instead I have to use M$ Internet Exploder to
log in to my bank.
