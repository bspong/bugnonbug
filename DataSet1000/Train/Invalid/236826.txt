I am suggesting a change to the way you upgrade to Firefox. When I installed it,
it took over the tasks of Mozilla 1.6 (which is good), but it failed to bring
all my bookmarks from Mozilla 1.6 into its favorites. It would really be helpful
if it did. Thanks.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.have Mozilla 1.6 installed with some bookmarks.
2.Install Mozilla Firefox.
3.look at bookmarks.

Actual Results:  
brought in bookmarks from IE (very handy), but did not bring in bookmarks from
Mozilla 1.6.

Expected Results:  
I don't know if it is supposed to do this or not but I would have liked it to
bring the bookmarks from my previous version into the new one. Especially since
it deleted my previous version before I could record my bookmarks.

None.
