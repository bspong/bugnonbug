MIME type is ignored in new builds
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

The browser no longer correctly interprets the HTTP MIME tag. It seems to be
always falling back on using the file extension to 'guess' the file type, when
it should only do this if the server sends MIME type unknown. This is a
violation of HTTP protocol and a security risk.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Visit web server servering a file with an extension Mozilla has associated with
a particular application, and a MIME type differing from that.
Actual Results:  
Browser ignored MIME type and used file name extension to determine file type.

Expected Results:  
Browser should have used HTTP MIME tag to determine file type, and displayed
file accordingly.
