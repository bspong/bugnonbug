When I open a new window in Firebird 0.6, the bookmarks on my toolbar are
duplicated. If I go to the bookmarks menu/sidebar, they aren't duplicated - same
if I close & reopen Firebird.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a new window
2. Look at the bookmarks toolbar.

It very occasionally doesn't dupe the bookmarks (usually on the 2nd additional
window)
Actual Results:  
Instead of my bookmarks toolbar being:
Slashdot | Mozillazine | Mozdev.org
it was
Slashdot | Slashdot | Mozillazine | Mozillazine | Mozdev.org | Mozdev.org

Expected Results:  
Not duplicated the bookmarks.

I have added a couple of buttons to my bookmark toolbar (new tab, history,
bookmarks and home). I removed them and it didn't make a difference, but it may
be relevant that I have customized the toolbar?
