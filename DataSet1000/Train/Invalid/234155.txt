new installer does not work
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: ?

On managed systems you previously allowed the installation of firebird so we
couold use it. many students use firebird at uni and cannot install the new
system as the installer recognises admin restrictions preventing the use of your
browser. can you not offer the old method of installation as well. that was
suficient. more so than now. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.go onto an XP managed machine 
2. download the installer 
3. try and run installer. comes up with message you do not have suffiect
reight...or something along those lines

Actual Results:  
was very, very dissapointed with the new installer on offer, and wiched you
changed it back!

Expected Results:  
installed, so i could have user Firefox.
