When I click on the bookmarks dropdown menu, and click with the right mouse
button it only shows a small square when it should have shown a menu.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on "Bookmarks" with the left mouse button
2. Click on any bookmark with the right mouse button

Actual Results:  
A small white square pops up beside the are where I right-clicked.

Expected Results:  
A menu with the functions "Open", "Open in New Window" etc... should have appeared.

Right-clicking on the bookmarks sidebar and Bookmarks Manager works perfectly.
As a sidenote, I completely removed the old installation and profile directory.
