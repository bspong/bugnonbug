Hi All,

This page: 
        
         http://www.xpertss.com/cgi-bin/WebX?9@232.wZhga7FlfNA.3@.ee6cd17

is freezing up my browser.  It is the "add topic" button of the Word Pro "How do
I" discussion area.  The form pops up to add the topic and freezes.  My CPU
usage then jumps to 100%

You will need to sign up for an account at http://www.xpertss.com to test this.
They are safe.   They are a very nice tech support form for Lotus' Smart Suite.
And, I have used their services for years without a problem.  Posted a lot
with the combined Mozilla as well.

Please forgive me for posting this a "Critical" but the defination does
say "Crashes or hangs".  I was able to make my post with that "other"
broswer.   :'(

Many thanks,
--Tony
