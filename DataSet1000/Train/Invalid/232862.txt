Some form seems not to work if Mozex is installed.
I took the build FB 20040130 and set up a clean profile. Visiting
http://bugs.kde.org/query.cgi I could do some queries using the Start Query button.

After installing Mozex 1.07 and setting its preferences, the Start Query button
on above mentioned page doesn't work any longer. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set up a clean profile
2. After installing Mozex 1.07
3. Set Mozex' preferences
4. Try a query on "http://bugs.kde.org/query.cgi"
Actual Results:  
nothing

Expected Results:  
send request to "bugs.kde.org"
