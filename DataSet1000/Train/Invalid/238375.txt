mime type cached even if page reloaded

I have a new server with Apache. It wasn't configured for shtml (SSI)
originally, unbeknownst to me. I opened the URL with firefox and the index.shtml
page was rendered as text/plain (from tools->page info)

So I went into Apache and reconfigured it. It then worked fine on MSIE 5.5. In
firefox, however, it still appeared as plain text. I know its not firefox
caching the content as well, as I changed the page, and the content of the shtml
file when i checked again was the updated content, but it was being rendered as
text/plain.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Disable Options +Includes in apache for this directory
2. Load the URL (http://www.adamfowler.co.uk/articles/index.shtml)
3. Enabled Options +Includes and restart apache
4. Change the page content so we know its been modified
5. Either hit refresh in firefox, or clear cache and restart, and see the
updated content rendered as text/plain.

Actual Results:  
Page was still rendered as plain text, not html

Expected Results:  
realised a different MIME type was being sent by Apache and re-rendered the content.
