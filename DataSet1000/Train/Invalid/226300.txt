history, bookmarks disappearing

Using th latest milestone build (0.7), and then using a nightly build from about
a week ago, my history has been clearing itself, apparently at random, once
every few days. Also, after having used 0.7 since it was released, I lost all of
my bookmarks of a sudden, for no good reason(this was before I started using th
nightly build). I searched my computer for bookmarks.htm and bookmarks.html, in
th hope that th file had simply become slightly corrupted, but all I could find
were th ones from my old Mozilla and Netscape installs, th one from Firebird had
 just disappeared. I performed and AV upgrade and immediately scanned, but found
nothing.
