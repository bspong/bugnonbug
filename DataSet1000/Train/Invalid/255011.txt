Recent padding reduction is too much

From yesterday the winstripe buttons had their padding reduced to make them less
spaced out however the amount by which the padding has been reduced means that
in small icons mode the icons are tiny and quite hard to hit (see attached).

Could the padding be increased again slightly please?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get new nightly
2. look at icons in small icons mode
Actual Results:  
Icons now too small and hard to hit

Expected Results:  
Icons should have a bit more padding on them
