auto-monitor interesting URLs for updates

There are pages of interest which do rather rarely update. However, drooling
around and checking every few days whether there has been an update or not is
pretty tiresome.
What would be extremely nice would be an option to monitor a bookmark for a
change: If selected, the current page has to be saved somewhere by Firebird. Now
every few days (should be adjustable), Firebird automatically (or triggered
manually, where Firebird could give the user a hint) looks at that page in the
background (without opening it) and checks whether the html has been changed.
This will not work for pages like news-sites, but it may be cool for all those
other pages that only update once in a while and of which a user wants to stay
updated of. Eg. www.mozilla.org, www.kde.org, etc.
