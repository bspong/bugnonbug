Using the spellchecker files from Mozilla 1.7 (and previous builds) as well as a
couple of spellchecker front ends - add a word to the personal dictionary... it
is properly remember for that session. Restart Firefox and the word is not
remembered due to the persdict.dat file changing to 0 bytes.

This worked with Firefox 0.8 and I verified that it worked Firefox with 0.8
again before filing this bug.

It appears to be the same problem as the following Thunderbird bug:
