context menu view source in frame displays source for 'mother page' but not for frame

When right-clicking in a frame, the "view source" context menu command displays
only the source code for the page containing the frames, and not the page
displayed inside the frame. I suggest that when frames are detected, the context
menu should have two view source options: one for selected frame and one for the
frame container. It is possible to select text in the frame and then "View
Source Selection", but I believe it should be easier to do than this.
