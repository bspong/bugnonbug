View Image Context Menu Causes Back Button to Fail
20040608 trunk

Using the "View Image" context menu item to view an image makes it impossible to
go back to the previous page. When the back button is pressed you are redirected
back to the image. It's reminiscent of those crappy Web site that use JavaScript
redirects to disable your back button.
