On some special pages, phoenix crashes when doubleclicking on any link in the 
document, when it's loaded via the --chrome option. 
 
This is not working with all documents, but some special ones within our 
intranet-webserver. Those documents heavily rely on frames an javascript, and have 
onmouseover handlers on most links. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
[ this only seems to work with some, special pages, not with all. But within these pages, 
it works always, on linux as well as on windows ] 
1. ./phoenix --chrome http://ourserver/document.html 
2. <doubleclick on some link in the document > 
 
Actual Results:  
Phoenix crashes.  
It feels like (on windows) phoenix crashes instantly, during the 2nd click of the 
doubleclick. ondblclick doesn't get processed too. But when I click slowly, that no 
dblclick gets generated, nothing happens. 

Expected Results:  
Open the page normaly.
