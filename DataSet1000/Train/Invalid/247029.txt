The add bookmarks [by pressing Ctrl + D] dialog has a drop down box for adding
bookmarks within folders already made.  This can contain only 5 entries at most.
 Is this deliberate.  by clicking the expand button on the side the whole list
and bookmarks is shown.  I suppose the box should show all the folders the user
had created earlier.  

Also it should remember the status that user left this dialog earlier.  If he
expanded the dialog to its full, then the next time when the user want to add a
bookmark it should open up so.
