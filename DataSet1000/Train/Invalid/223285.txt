I enter "engineering", hit search, and get "yp.yahoo.com&qtx=engineering could not be found.  Please check the name and try again."  Other search terms seem to work; works in IE.

I have a smart bookmark for Yahoo! Yellow pages:
http://yp.yahoo.com/py/ypResults.py?stx=%s&stp=a&tab=B2C&addr=100+Pitt+Street&city=Alexandria&state=VA&zip=22314&country=us&msa=8840&slt=38.804963&sln=-77.044935&cs=9&Submit=Search
Keyword: yp

This doesn't seem to cause the problem.  If I go to http://yp.yahoo.com/ and
type in engineering, I get an infobox saying:
   "yp.yahoo.com&qtx=engineering could not be found.  Please check the name and
try again."

I went to IE and tried it, and the term "engineering" worked fine.  It may be a
Yahoo! coding issue, or maybe a bug in the code that handles the related HTML. 
Too bad IE uses non-standard ways of making stupid code work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://yp.yahoo.com/
2. Search for "engineering"
3. Hit "Search" button.

Actual Results:  
I got an infobox popup saying:

  "yp.yahoo.com&qtx=engineering could not be found.  Please check the name and
try again."


Expected Results:  
Submitted the search.

Tested in IE, works.  It worked on Win2000 at home; it may be a sporatic failure.
