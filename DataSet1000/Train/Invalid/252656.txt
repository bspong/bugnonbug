manage folder usability interacts poorly with new sidebar
The manage folder context menu item opens that folder in the bookmarks manager
with no way to get up to it's containing folder (or the root folder). The
sidebar doesn't take note of this and offers the root folder which is quite
confusing for users who think that if we display the root folder in the sidebar,
that they should be able to get at it in the main pane.

Tested with 7/21 branch windows build on XP
