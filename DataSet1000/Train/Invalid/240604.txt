I wanted to change the display of a document to be in UTF-16LE. Looking in the
'View->Character Coding' menu I only see UTF-7 and UTF-8 character set of the
possible unicode charcter-codings. Looking at the Mozilla 1.7b I see that there
is  a special 'unicode' group in the character coding sub-menu. They are not
even in the the possible character-codings that I can add. This needs to be
added to FireFox.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to menu view -> character coding and try finding UTF-16
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE, etc are missing.

Expected Results:  
They should be listed.

Also missing from MacOS X version, so it is not platform specific.
