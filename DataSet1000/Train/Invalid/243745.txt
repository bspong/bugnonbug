Not displaying personal toolbar anymore
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

Whenever I start up now Firefox doesn't display my personal toolbar, yet if I 
go look in the bookmark manager they're all there like they should be. However 
if I go into one of the personal toolbar links and modify their properties and 
hit 'save', then they reappear in the correct place. But they never appear on 
their own on startup. I haven't installed anything recently either that would 
modify my links.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start up
2.Right-click where toolbar normally is and get nothing.

Actual Results:  
You see a tiny little box that's about 10 pixels wide

Expected Results:  
Displayed my links as normal.

I'm using the default theme.
