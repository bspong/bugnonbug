Character entities are displayed expanded in Livemark threads.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add a livemark (to Slashdot, for example, since it often has article titles
with ampersands).
2. In the Bookmarks menu, look at a thread title in the livemark containing an
ampersand.
Actual Results:  
The ampersand is spelled out as the character entity: &amp;

Expected Results:  
The ampersand should be rendered as an ampersand character: &
