URL bar can falsely show certificate as being valid for the site
I stumbled upon a somewhat dirty trick:

Start your browser and visit:
https://robert.accettura.com

You'll get that notice that the cert doesn't match the server.  It shows with a
lock with a line through it... all is good.

Now open a new tab, and copy/paste the following URL in:
https://robert.accettura.com/gallery

You don't get a notification that the cert doesn't match the server *but* it
shows the icon as a normal healthy icon.

It should still show the icon with a '/' through it, since it's the same site,
and same server... they don't match.


Screenshots forthcoming.
