In the nightly Firebird build (XFT/GTK2) of 20030818, no vertical scrollbar is
present even though the viewed page extends beyond the bottom of the browser.
The page can still be scrolled via mousewheel. This has been tried with several
different themes (Skypilot Classic, Noia-Warm, & Crystal).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firebird
2. Go to any page that needs to be scrolled


Actual Results:  
Page was displayed but no vertical scrollbar appeared to allow one to scroll the
page.

Expected Results:  
Vertical scrollbar should have appeared to allow one to grab it with the mouse
to scroll the page.
