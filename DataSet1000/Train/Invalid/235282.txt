Tips & Tricks: "Open external links in new windows or tabs" doesn't work
User-Agent:

Till now I've used Mozilla package (Browser, Email,etc.), the latest was 1.6.

Introduction:
=============
I've decided to migrate to Mozilla ThunderBird 0.5 and Mozilla FireFox 0.8 instead 
(becasue I was annoyed when something corrupt in Mozzilla Email I also had to
restart Browser with all opened TABs and vice versa)

First, I migrate with this on my WinXP (cause I don't use them a lot) with
FireBird 0.7 & ThunderBird 0.5 and applyed some Tips & Tricks, mainly the ONE
which change the default behaviour of opening links from Email client in new
Browser Window to new TAB.

This works fine so later I've decided to do the same on my linux RH9 (but now
using FireFox 0.8 instead of FireBird 0.7) and what was the surprise thet it
doesn't work :-(

I've exactly followed your instruction on those URL:
http://texturizer.net/thunderbird/tips.html ->
   Open mail links in new windows or tabs
and at:
http://texturizer.net/firefox/tips.html#beh_reuse ->
   Open external links in new windows or tabs


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. I followed instruction at:
http://texturizer.net/firefox/tips.html#beh_reuse
and according them I've created user.js file in my
.phoenix/$profilename/xxxx.slt folder.

I'm highligting, that I've created more profiles, but using mainly this one.

// Stop reusing active windows: 
user_pref("advanced.system.supportDDEExec", false);

2. Then I've install the TABedBrowser Extension available on this URL:
http://texturizer.net/firefox/extensions/#tbe
BTW: The URL in your Tips&Tricks is not right :-(
http://texturizer.net/firefox/extensions.html#Tabbrowser%20Extensions

3. And change the settings of this Extension according your Tips&Tricks

Restart Browser and Mail Client


Actual Results:  
The links from MAil Client are still opened in new Window instead of new TABs

Also If I'm in Browser Options and click eg on getNewTheme The new browser
window is opened instead of in new TAB :-(((

Expected Results:  
In all case of clicking on link from external app it has to open this page in
new TAB instead of  new window.

That's totally ridiculous if I'm used on that behaviour from Mozilla package 1.6


Thus I'm marking it as Major or rather more important bugs at least it is regresion
