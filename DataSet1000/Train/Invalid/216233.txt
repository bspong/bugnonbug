user.js preferences do not overwrite defaults in v.6.1

I created an entry for 
pref("keyword.URL","http://search.yahoo.com/search/?p=");
in user.js. Under v.6.0 this worked correctly and the address bar search took me
there. After upgrading to v.6.1, however, this script no longer executed. 

I changed the name of the file to be "1user.js", restarted Firebird and things
worked correctly. I believe that the files are being executed in first
come-first served basis, and therefore elements defined in user.js will not
override the defaults.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. modify user.js to use a non-google search engine for keyword.URL, or simply
remove the lucky param.
2. restart Firebird
3. attempt to look for "banana" in address bar.


Actual Results:  
Notice that you're now looking at the banana republic site instead of the search
page you asked for. 

Expected Results:  
I believe that it should special case user.js to either load first if it exists,
or allow that file to ovewrite pre-existing values.
