Firefox 0.9 for Linux installation instructions say to run "firefox-installer"
this file does not exist.

Using SUSE Linux 9.0 Firefox extracts and will run (generates lots of ugly error
messages) but it sure doesn't seamlessly install into the OS.  If Linux is going
to be successful then products like this must have a braindead installer that
leaves the user with a nice easy to use icon (and inserted into menus) to run
the software.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to install on Linux
2.
