leaving browser unattended for 24hrs causes entire machine to lock up and absorb 100% processor
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2
Build Identifier: Firefox/0.9.2

on a Win2K platform (IBM A31, Intel pentium p4 chip, 30GB HDD, 512mb RAM)
leaving FireFox 0.9.2 unattended over night while connected to the web (ADSL
512kbps connection speed) results in FireFox absorbing all system resources
particularly processor (using task manager it is obvious that processor is at
100% and memory usage is up at 350+MB).  System cannot be shut down normally and
power supply must be interrupted to effect a reset.

I am running a Zone Labs fire wall, generally I have Mozilla Mail 1.7, xChat
2.0.8. MSN Messenger v6.1 (6.1.0211) and Microsoft Office Outlook 2003
(11.5608.5606) running concurrently with FireFox.  The problem only occurs when
FireFox is running however.  When it is not running and the others are all up,
things are fine.

This problem occurred when i was using Moz 1.4 - 1.7 release candidates, but
went away when the actual release of each of these came out.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Start FireFox 0.9.2 
2.  Leave over night
3.  Experience problems

Actual Results:  
the entire machine freezes up, the screem will refresh within 30 minutes to
reveal the system manager showing 100% processor usage and memory spiked over 350mb+

Expected Results:  
not frozen my machine
