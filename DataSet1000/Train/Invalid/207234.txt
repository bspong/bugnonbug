I downloaded Firebird in order to test it.
I chose to add a new profile as it had not detected my previous one.
I don't know what my existing profile has become on both Phoenix, Mozilla and
Firebird, the latter 2 being unusabel from work because of our incompatible
corporate proxy (see #207230).


Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.unpack firbird.zip in c:\program files\firebird
2.launch it
3.create a new profile
