Icons fail to change from IE to Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.9

I have changed all appropriate file types to display the Firefox icon. When I
add the "LINKS" option to the Windows task bar (Windows XP, Build
2600.xpsp2.020422-1633 : Service Pack 1), all the links that DO NOT have a
favicon show up with an Internet Explorer icon. Inside Firefox, all bookmarks
without a favicon show up as a "blank page with the corner folded down" which I
believe is the default.
