After Agent Switcher set to IE, "Java plug-in error" when starting Firebird
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)

Set Agent Switcher to show IE
Each time Firebird is started an error appears:
Window title:  Java plug-in error
Text states that Java plug-in for Netscape/MOzilla should not be used for
Internet Explorer and suggests installing correct IE java plug-in

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set Agent Switcher to show IE
2. Close and open firebird
3. see "Java plug-in error" window appear with the warning

Actual Results:  
"Java plug-in error" window appear with the warning

Expected Results:  
See through the Agent Switcher ploy and recognize it is just disguised Firebird.
I realize it actualy might be close circle and the problem is not really a bug.
It might not be solveable or at best solveable within Java plug-in, rather then
Firebird.
