Sometimes, the front page of Anandtech doesn't render properly. The Product
Coverage graphic ends up directly below the Top Insider Stories graphic.
Refreshing the page will often make it go away (though it can eventually be
refreshed into the incorrect rendering again).

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.anandtech.com
2. If page renders correctly, refresh a few times


Expected Results:  
Product Coverage image should be further down on the page above its respective
section.

I'm using the Adblock 0.5.2 & TBP 0.6.9 extensions.
