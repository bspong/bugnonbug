Firefox loads, and then gives me an error that stops the program from working at all.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0
Build Identifier: http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/download.html?http%3A//ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/0.8/FirefoxSetup-0.8.exe

I performed a standard installation of Firefox, and the installation finished 
without error. Upon running Firefox, the window opens, and I receive an error 
which states, "Error launching browser window:no XBL binding for browser." No 
menu items work, no tabs are open, and no keyboard shortcuts work (except 
windows keybindings for window manipulation: maximize, minimize, etc). 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run the Firefox executable.
2. Get the error
3. Exit and run again

Actual Results:  
The same result.

Expected Results:  
The software should not get an error and should be able to load without 
problems.

I am running Windows XP Professional. This is a fresh install of XP, fully 
patched and updated.
