Missing option to create new tab when pressing Ctrl+Enter in Location bar

In Mozilla 1.7 there is a Tabbed Browsing option called "Ctrl+Enter in the
Location bar" that allows the user to type in a URL and have the URL open in a
new tab by pressing Ctrl+Enter.  In Firefox it appears to be a shortcut to not
have to type in http://www.*.com.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type in the URL
2. Press Ctrl+Enter


Actual Results:  
It puts http://www.*.com around whatever is entered in the location bar and then
tries to open that site.

Expected Results:  
Open the specified URL in a new tab.

I don't know if this is the intended behavior or not, but I really liked the
Ctrl+Enter behavior of Mozilla.
