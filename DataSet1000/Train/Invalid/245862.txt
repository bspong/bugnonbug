Preferences dialog should be at the same place on all OS

In bug 245765, the Preferences menu entry moved to the Edit menu again for
XP_UNIX, but not for XP_MACOSX and also Windows. Because of this, Firefox users
cannot find Preferences on the same spot for all the supported OS.

That's *EXTREMELY* bad, because one of the MOST important pros of Firefox (and
Mozilla) is that it is cross-platform and thus should AS MUCH as possible behave
the same everywhere. 

With the introduced change, it no longer does.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Start Ff on Windows, Linux, MacOS X and try to find the Preferences menu entry.
Actual Results:  
On Linux, it is under Edit. On all the other OS, it is is still under Tools.

Expected Results:  
According to bug 245765, GNOME HIG dictates that Preferences has to be under
Edit. Because of that, the other OS have to follow.

Or GNOME HIG should not be followed, and Preferences should be under Tools
again. Either way is fine - it just *HAS* to be consistent.



Because it makes Firefox harder to use, I'm setting severity to Major.
