whenever i logon to my modem, and my defult browser is supposed to open, mozilla
sends me a messag saying i dont have a componant needed to open it. so i have to
extract all mozilla files each time i want to browse online. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. i logon, and IE says it's no longer my defult, and do i want to change that
2. i double click firebird and a message pops up saying that i'm missing a
componant needed to open mozilla
3. i open my zipped mozilla folder and extract all the files

Actual Results:  
everything is extracted and opens, and mozilla runs perfectly. however, the
files dont remain open for the next time i use mozilla

Expected Results:  
opened ject by clicking firebird icon
