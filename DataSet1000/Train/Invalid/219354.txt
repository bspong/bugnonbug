Browser is very slow, using up resources long periods of continuous execution: many refreshes or java to blame

I leave the browser open all the time, but over time the browser in *every* way
becomes slower and less responsive; it even takes a few seconds to
maximise/minimise.
I have the browser pointed at a page that refreshes every 30s, and the browser
usually survives a few days at least. The other unusual thing I have been doing
is trying to run an applet inside the browser. The page with the applet on has
been closed for about 18 hours, but the browser is still slow.
Obviously, as I've only just noticed this behaviour, I've yet to see if this
will happen again.
