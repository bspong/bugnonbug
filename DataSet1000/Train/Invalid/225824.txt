Reload with Proxy doesn't work for sites with frames
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7

Reload with Proxy doesn't update the contents of the webpage. This occurs
especially with sites having the following properties:
1) Site has frames.
2) URL in address bar remains the same.

Examples:
http://www.doom9.org
http://forum.doom9.org and all other forum sites using a similar system.

In rare occasions, the webpage gets completely garbled. Only resolution is to
clean the cache. Afterwards, still old content.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit webpage.
2. After content change, visit webpage. Press reload.
3.

Actual Results:  
Webpage content is not updated.

Expected Results:  
Webpage content should be updated.

Found a similar bug description for Mozilla1.0, though not specific for sites
with frames.
