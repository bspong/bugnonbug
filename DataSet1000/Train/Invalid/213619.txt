Problem with password manager and admin accounts using phpBB 2.04's administration panel

If you use the password manager to save an admin account's username and password
on a phpBB based forum, you'll discover that when using the administration panel
to change another user's account, it'll change their username and the first
password line to your own username and password.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to a phpBB forum where you have administrator access.
2. Allow Firebird to save your username/password details.
3. Select 'Administration Panel' at the bottom of the screen.
4. Select 'Management' under the 'User Admin' section at the bottom of the menu.
5. Type in the name of, or search for, a user account other than the one you are
using.

Actual Results:  
The person's username will be replaced with your one, and the first password
entry will be automatically filled in. However, the second password line (for
confirmation) will remain blank.

Expected Results:  
The browser should not automatically fill in a username/password box if the page
defines a default username (for when you are editing another user's account).
