Tried a number of different character sets on the latest nightly of Firefox
and none of them seem to want to render &prime; or &Prime;.  This is important
for sites like wikipedia that need this functionality in their mathematics
sections.  What are being rendered are little boxes with the numbers:

"2032" and "2033" in place of the correct glyphs.



Reproducible: Always
