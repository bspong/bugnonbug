Too much HTTP requests on page reload
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

When pressing F5 or the Reload button, page gets reloaded ok - but it's slower
than in Mozilla 1.5. Slower, because it appears to be doing lots of requests, I
think on every image on the page. As result, when you refresh a page with many
pictures, it starts showing HTTP requests for those pics showing the "busy" icon
in the browser... In Mozilla there is no such behaviour, at least visual.
Critical when playing on-line web games where speed of refresh is needed.

The same happens for many other people who're using Firebird for that site
