page edit mode? refuses to turn off

Just did a clean install of Win2kSp4, unzipped fb 0.7 release version and used
it only to find that (with no extensions installed):

if i clicked within a page and tried to scroll up and down with the up/down
arrows on my keyboard it acted like the current page i was viewing was edittable
ie: a blinking cursor moved along the page in that direction (up/down).

opening a new tab allowed up/down nav with keyboard unless i clicked within the
site at which point that pesky blinking cursor returned :-(

since i have a form of Rsi that makes mouse use uncomfortable, i tend to use use
up/down arrow keys to smootholy scroll up/down a page and this bug is driving me
nuts

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click within a page
2. try to scroll up and down with the up/down arrows on keyboard

Actual Results:  
firebird acts like current page is edittable in a word doc ie: a blinking cursor
moves along the page in the direction of keyboard key pressed (up/down).

Expected Results:  
scroll smoothly up and down page if keyboard up/down keys pressed after clicking
on particular spot of page

i thought the bug might be to do with "type ahead find" so i put:

// Find As You Type Configuration: 
// Set this pref to false to disable Find As You Type: 
user_pref("accessibility.typeaheadfind", false); 

into my all.js & user.js in the firebird profile. this did successfully disable
type ahead find, but the problem remained
