Everytime I try to customize my Phoenix build via "tools ->preferences ->
system" to adjust the assignment of file formats (i.e. default application of
.html files) or protocols I can not complete this selections since hitting the
ok button resulting in no effect.
If I want to access other items (i.e. general etc) I have cancel my operation
and restart the preferences to see other tags (downloads, connections, font
types and colors etc.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.entering tools menu
2.selecting preferences
3.go to system, selecting single listed items

Actual Results:  
can not access other tags anymore, when seleting an item within system-tag. To
enter these tags I have to cancel and start again to access config issues via
tools->preferences->system

Expected Results:  
Accept my selections and take "ok"
