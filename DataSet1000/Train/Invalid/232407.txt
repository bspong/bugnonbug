Hi all
Ive recently installed Firebird on RedHat 9 KDE.
What I'd like to know is whats the correct command for launching it.
My newsreader, Pan needs to know this, in Pan preferences I have;
mozilla-firebird %s
this sort of works but if Firebirds allready running it tries to start a
new Firebird profile and asks me to create one 
All i really want is a new firebird window.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Have firebird allready running then try to open another instance from a link in
email etc

Actual Results:  
profile manager pops up asking to create new profile

Expected Results:  
Should re-use existing (running) profile and just launch new window
