Please read carefully because below are 2 problems mentioned:

1.
In the bookmarks manager and the bookmarks frame each folder's contect-menu
shows an item "Expand/Collapse", "Manage folder" and "Open in Tabs" in its
context menu. But not the context menu of the bookmarks bar folder.

Please add these items for the bookmarks bar folder!


2.
"Expand" is also shown when right-clicking a folder in the bookmarks bar or in
the bookmarks menu. But it does not work. "Collapse" there is never shown.

Please make "Expand" working here and add "Collaps".
