Theme reported by themes page to be compatible does not show up after installing
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040120 Firebird/0.8.0+

AFter installing the theme which is compatible ( Under the theme there is a
statement giving if the theme is compatible with the present build), the theme
does not show up under themes and hence no change occours.

On the other hand, on installing themes which are incompatible, they do show up
and ofcourse they are incompatible(scroll bar vanishes or some of the toolbars
dont occour).

This bug seems to be there starting with this 0.8 build that i am using 0.8.0 + 
I didnt see such a bug with earlier versions. Only the Mozilla Firebird Default
Theme works perfectly.
