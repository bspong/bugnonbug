The basic navigation buttons in Firefox (Prev/Next/Reload/Stop/etc) appear as
black-symbol-surrounded-by-a-black-box.

The other buttons, such as Bookmarks, Downloads, New Tab, etc, appear as
colorful icons without any surrounding black box.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox 0.8
2. Click View > Toolbars > Customize
3. Drag the Bookmarks, Downloads and New Tab buttons to the toolbar
4. Click OK

Actual Results:  
Two completely different button types appear in the toolbar, looking very
mis-matched.

Expected Results:  
Consistent button appearances. The basic nav buttons seem to be vaguely based on
those found in Mac OS X Help Viewer, and to a lesser extent, Safari. However, a
much better role-model would be Mac OS X Mail, Disk Utility, Camino, etc, which
use a very recognisable Cocoa look-and-feel (ie: keep the color buttons, replace
the black ones and make it look more like a Cocoa application). Also note that
the Safari-style buttons appear on Metal/"textured" appearance applications,
such as Address Book, Safari, 10.3's Finder, not "white" Aqua applications.
