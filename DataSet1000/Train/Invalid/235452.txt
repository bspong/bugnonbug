firefox 0.8 seems to completely ignore css font-size when specified in em units
User-Agent:

When specifying font-size in an external style sheet (haven't tested on placing
right-in the page), firefox seems to totally disregard any classes with
font-size's specified in em units. I can use general (x-small) or px definitions
and it works fine, but em units are totally disregarded and it just sets my font
size based on what my browser setting is at. IE recognizes the em definition
properly.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Specify font-size for a class in em units in an externally linked style sheet
2. Enter some text in a p tag assigned the appropriate class
3.

Actual Results:  
My font-size specification was totally disregarded. It rendered the font at a
much larger size than specified.

Expected Results:  
It should have rendered my font at a much smaller size like IE does.
