In the page http://www.eluniversal.com/firefoxTest.html you'll find 2 table set
up with the excact same parameters besides the padding of the inner div of the
table number 2.

The first one shows the table with the div inside of it correctly, but in the
second the div is being drawn outside the boundaries of the table.

This behaviour appears only when the div's width is set to 100% and overflow = auto.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a fixed width table with 1 cell
2. Put a div inside of the cell with some padding and width 100% and overflow: auto

Actual Results:  
The div is drawn outside the boundaries of the table.

Expected Results:  
Increase the space from the border of the div to the text inside of it and leave
the size of the div and the table as set.

there are other problems when you try to show and hide content inside of the div
with the style.display property of the DOM object.
