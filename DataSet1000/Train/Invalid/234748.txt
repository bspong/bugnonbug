Type ahead find works, but fails to highlight matches
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040207 Firefox/0.8

The type ahead function works in the supplied URL but matches are not
highlighted. When I type something that I'm quite sure should match I can press
enter and the article opens.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open URL
2. Use type-ahead find to match something
3. Press enter




I use a pretty default setup. I've seen this on Windows as well, but I haven't
tested with the latest Firefox version on Windows.
