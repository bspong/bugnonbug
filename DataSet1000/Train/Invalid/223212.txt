Opening any SHTML file stored locally causes Firebird to spawn an apparently
infinite number of new windows, the only way to stop being to kill the
MozillaFirebird process from the task manager.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an empty text file called test.shtml
2. Open it with Mozilla Firebird


Actual Results:  
New Firebird windows spawned repeatedly

Expected Results:  
Treated SHTML file as normal HTML, and opened as with any HTML page.
