getRegistryEntry returns NS_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY when key not found
when you try to open a nonexisting registry key with getRegistryEntry()
you get:

launchy: Unable to find Mozilla Firebird due to [Exception... "Component
returned failure code: 0x8007000e (NS_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY)
[nsIWindowsShellService.getRegistryEntry]"  nsresult: "0x8007000e
(NS_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY)"  location: "JS frame ::
chrome://launchy/content/context.js :: anonymous :: line 47"  data: no]

isn't "NS_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY" wrong?

Isn't it correct to just return NS_OK since the operation went OK but the
registry entry just wasn't there?
