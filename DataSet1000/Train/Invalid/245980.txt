firefox.exe - Entry Point Not Found

Just after the first launch of firefox 0.9RC (old install was a firefox 0.8 not
nightly)
I reveive 3 times the message box "firefox.exe - Entry Point Not Found"
"The procedure entry point ??1nsCString@@UAE@XZ could not be located in the
dynamic link library xpcom.dll"
And now, at each new launch of firefox, the message box appairs 1 times ...
All extensions are disabled except DOM inspector...
The new firefox was installed on the same directory than the previously 0.8

Maybe a problem in the install (xpcom.dll in use ????? but firefox was not
running ...) ...

The firefox works well (i'm writing this report with 0.9RC ... but this should
be fixed before the release ...
