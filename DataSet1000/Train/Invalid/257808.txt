Firefox sometimes adds an extra set of www in front of the url.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3

Sometimes when I enter in an url, i.e www.slashdot.org, firefox says it cannot
find www.www.slashdot.org. I have experienced this on other machines with other
operatingsystem (if my memory serves me correct).
I have not found any pattern yet, since it happens so rare.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter a url in the address field.
2. Hit enter.
Actual Results:  
Once in a million, it fails to load the page and tries to search for
www.www.somedomain.com. In the address-bar it's only says www.somedomain.com.

Expected Results:  
Fetch the webpage, let me read the news in company time.
