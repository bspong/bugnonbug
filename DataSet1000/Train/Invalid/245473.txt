When clicking on a link with the middle button you should get the link open in
the new tab. I tested it with a Microsoft mouse and it works. With a logitach
mouse it doesn't work.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Click on the middle button of the logitech mouse.
Actual Results:  
Nothing. Or assigned logitech functionality is executed.

Expected Results:  
Open link in new tab.
