That menu as vanished -- all I have for tools is:
Downloads, JS, DOM, Page info and options

Also the bug search is TERRIBLE - so I couldn't tell if this is a dup

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Just pull down Tools -- menus' where there for the first week of using
firefox




Password fillins work - form fillins do not -- I tried switching formin on and
off and clearing form fillin - not difference
