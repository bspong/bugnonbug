Two tiny windows, one titled "window, the other "url"

Whenever I take any action that is supposed to launch a dialog box (like a
security warning or the password manager prompt), two tiny windows display, one
after the other, before the dialog box displays. The first window is titled
"window", has a message of five numbers followed by a letter (the most common
set being 25024a), and the only option is to click "OK." The second window is
titled "url", has a message of four numbers (the most common set being 2502),
and the only option is to click "OK." Once both windows are cleared, the
expected dialog box pops up. I uninstalled/reinstalled Firefox, but the odd
behavior remains.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Take any action that launches a dialog box
Actual Results:  
The two tiny windows appear in sequence.

Expected Results:  
Gone straight to the dialog box.
