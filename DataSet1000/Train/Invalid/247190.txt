After being displeased with some bugs in Firefox 0.9, I uninstalled it and
reinstalled 0.8.  Recently, I opened the "My Pictures" folder in Windows XP,
which generates thumbnails by default.  Before the thumbnails were generated,
all images appeared with the Firefox icon instead of the default "no thumbnail
generated yet" icon.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 0.9
2. Open your My Pictures folder.


Actual Results:  
The Firefox icon was displayed for images whose thumbnails had not yet been
generated on-the-fly.

Expected Results:  
Windows XP should have displayed the default icon, however, Firefox icon appears
to have replaced it.
