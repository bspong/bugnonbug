That I can find. 

Firebird needs a way to have the users default email client open up when an
emial link is clicked!

When I click on an email link, I get LOTS!! of MSIE windows opening up, and then
I have to get them closed RELA DAMNDED QUICK or my system gets overloaded and
crashes!!

At this time I use Netscape 7.1 email as default until I can ecide if I want to
keep Firebird and Thunderbird, or go to Mozilla!

Thank you
