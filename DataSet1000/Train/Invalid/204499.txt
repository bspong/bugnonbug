The Tabbrowser Preferences extension downloads and appears to install okay, and
it shows up as installed in the extensions list.  But the preferences that it
purports to add are not present.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to
http://texturizer.net/firebird/extensions.html#Tabbrowser%20Preferences and
install Tabbrowser preferences.

2.  Go to "Tools - Preferences - Themes and Extensions - Extensions" and
perceive that it reports the presence of Tabbrowser Preferences.

3.  Go to "Tools - Preferences - Advandced - Tabbed Browsing".  There is no
added functionality.

Actual Results:  
The menu in 3. above was not changed, and no new functionality had been added to
the browser.

Expected Results:  
There should have been a menu item to allow me to open new pages as a new tab,
rathar than a new window.
