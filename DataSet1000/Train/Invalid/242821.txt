I prefer it when Cmd-B opens the bookmarks window and when Cmd-shift-H opens the
history in a new window.  Actually, it's not even possible to open History in a
new window in Firefox, as far as I can tell.  I wish that were possible and I
wish that there were a preference to open History and Bookmarks in new windows
instead of sidebars.
