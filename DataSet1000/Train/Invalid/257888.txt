Just installed Firefox 0.9.3 in same subdir as Mozilla. Invocation of firefox
brings up about a dozen popups warning of Java functions missing in xpcom.dll;
and now Mozilla no longer comes up ("Mozilla has generated errors and will be
closed by Windows").  A copy of xpcom.dll, dated today, is in the same subdir as
firefox.exe (and mozilla.exe).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Have a running copy of Mozilla.
2.  Install firefox 0.9.3
3.  Try to invoke firefox -- many Java error popups referring to xpcom.dll.
4.  Try to invoke mozilla -- Win2K error generation popup.

Actual Results:  
Noted in steps 1 - 4.

Expected Results:  
Both Firefox and Mozilla should still have operated as separately invoked
instances of browers.
