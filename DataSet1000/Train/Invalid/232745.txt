0 themes available when using Firebird 0.7 in XP or 2000
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7

When I go to "texturizer.net" via the "Get New Themes" link underneath
Tools-->Options, the page comes up blank indicating the following:

There are currently 0 themes available.

I also went out to Mozdev to attempt theme downloading from there, and received
a similar response.  I tried it first in WinXP and soon switched to my 2000
partition to encounter the same thing.  Any ideas?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Tools-->Options
2. Click on "Get New Themes"
3. Theme page will load reporting "0 themes available"

Actual Results:  
It did not recognize any themes as being available for my browser, which I know
there are.

Expected Results:  
Shown the available themes applicable to Firebird 0.7.
