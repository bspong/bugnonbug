I like to use Cool Mouse 99 to allow easier middle-button scrolling.  This
utility works with most programs, but it does not seem to work with Firebird. 
Is there a simple fix?

Cool Mouse 99 lets me press the middle button in the top part of the selected
window to scroll up, or in the bottom part to scroll down.  It avoids having to
point the cursor at the scroll bar arrows, and I don't have to keep moving the
mouse in order to regulate the scrolling.  I think it's the best scrolling
interface I've seen so far.  I can't surf without it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Install Cool Mouse 99 utility.
2.  Configure middle button to scroll.
3.  Watch it not work in Mozilla Firebird.

Actual Results:  
Nothing.  Nada.  Nichts.

Expected Results:  
Scroll the window as described.
