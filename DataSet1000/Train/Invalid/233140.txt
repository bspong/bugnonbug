does not let  systemwide mouse-hook  work (e.g. MouseImp)
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; fr; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7

O.S. = Windows 9x as well as windows 2000.

MouseImp (TV4 Studios) is a Windows enhancement that lets user scroll windows of
most all appz, using a plain mouse (no wheel) : user 'seizes' window by pressing
& holding right mouse button, and then scrolls up/down by dragging, releases
when done. Works fine in MS-IE as well as Netscape browser windows, for instance.

This does not work in Firebird. Seems this browser does not allow systemwide
mouse-hooks to operate as intended.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.download the MouseImp from TV4 studios (www.tv4studios.com) and install ;)
2.in Firebird, open any URL which gives rise to vertical scroll bars
3.click in FB main window, seize it by depressing and while holding right
button, move mouse up or down 

Actual Results:  
none

Expected Results:  
smoothly scroll window contents up/down following the mouse' curse.
