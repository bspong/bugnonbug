False counting in history preserving time leads to the lack of a "today" option

When in the privacy settings I set the option "Remember visited pages for the
last x days" on 1 day (which apparently reads "one day into the past") Firefox
keeps the history for today and yesterday which is what I expected.

When setting the option to 0 days one would assume the history is saved zero
days into the past so there's only the history of today left. Instead setting
this option to 0 erases the history and disables the writing of a history at all.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set the described option to 0
2. Delete the history
3. Visit some pages and check the history. You'll find it blank.



Expected Results:  
Two different solutions are imaginable:
1. Keep the counting as it is but fix the "0" setting so that is doesn't erase
the history and keep (only) the history of the current day. Additionally there
should be an option to disable keeping a history at all.

2. Alter the counting so that today stands for "1". Then, a setting "0" would
act like it does right now (no history at all), "1" would keep the history only
for today, "2" for today and yesterday and so on.
