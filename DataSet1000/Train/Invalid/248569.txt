selected radio button changes upon reload of page when PHP session is running

I have built a form using PHP/Pear HTML_QuickForm_Controller and Smarty Template
Engine.  It builds 3 radio buttons.  The default should be enabled as the source
code has enabled checked.  It is selected upon the first viewing of the page. 
But when the page is reloaded once, the selection is changed and stays changed
on subsequent reloads.  Sometimes SHIFT-reload will bring back the original
selection, sometimes not.  Also, after the selection has been changed, you can
redo the error by either closing the browser session or deleting the cookie that
is generated by the PHP session.  Plus if you disable cookies, the page acts
correctly.  The HTML code is not changed by any of the reloading, the cookie
doesn't change the HTML in any way, except by changing the id to a randomly
selected id each time (this id change is done by Smarty).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load page
2. Reload page once (selection should change)
3. Delete session cookie
4. Reload page (selection returns to normal)
5. Reload page (selection changes again)
6. Disable cookies and reload (selection returns to normal)
7. Enable cookies and reload (selection changes again)
Actual Results:  
The selection changes.  As you can see, I showed different ways to change the
selection, all by just reloading the page.

Expected Results:  
The selection shouldn't change

I have reproduced this bug in Mozilla 1.6
