JAVA may be dangerous

I was feeling I'd fill up a new bug, although Bug 1785 and Bug 126568 are rather
similar.
Last night, I clicked a thumbnail in images.google.com, and as a result I got a
trojan!

This has apparently little to do with Firefox or Mozilla, but 1) I was running
the latest version of Java (5.1), which I got from UMO, and 2)JAVA is enabled by
default in Firefox prefs.
I therefore reckon something should be done to prevent JAVA from being triggered
like that. Perhaps it should just be disabled by default, or managed like popups
are.
