Browsing without typing www. before the address name
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: Firefox 1 Final

I hate to type www. every time I wana browse a website, Firefox should put 
automatically www. before the address that we type in address bar so we can 
type only the address name without the www. every time we wana browse a website.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
I did see that Firefox opens many websites without being necesary to type www. 
before the address name, but I don't know if it works with every address, but 
it should work with every address, because it is very anoyng to type www every 
time you wana browse a website.
Actual Results:  
Browsing should work for every site without typing www. before the address name

Expected Results:  
Browsing should work for every site without typing www. before the address name
