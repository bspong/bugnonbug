Auto scroll problem

This isn't really a bug in Phoenix itself, but I consider Auto-scrolling a very
important feature to get right in this or any broswer.  Thie feature comes in
the form of a downloadable extension.  The functionality of the extension is
just fine, but the display slightly distorts images that pass under it.  To
duplicate the bug, just click the wheel just above an image, but still in
whitespace.  Scroll so that the icon that comes up when you clicked is over the
image, and note the distortion.  This does not look very professional (well, the
IE one doesn't really, either, but at least someone can do something about this
problem).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
*Note:  Only works if you've downloaded the autopscroll extention for Phoenix
1.  Click the scroll wheel of a scroll mouse just above an image in a page
2.  Scroll so that the image passes under the the image that comes up when you
click the wheel button


Actual Results:  
The image distorts.

Expected Results:  
The image that comes up when you wheel-click should be semi-transparent, not
distort, and there should be no distortion or ugly halo lines around the image.
