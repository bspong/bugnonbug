Whenever I vist adult web sites such as
http://www.pornstarhouse.com/t1/pps=NoAdvert/, I get popups while opening or
closing the browser window and/or tab. This should not happend right? I have
popups blocked in my config and this happends under Mozilla 1.7.3 also. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Vist a lot of porn sites =)
2.open or close one of said web pages a window/tab 
3.you got a popup window

Actual Results:  
I colsed the popup window and got another one right after that.

Expected Results:  
Not allowed said popup windows from popping up in the first place
