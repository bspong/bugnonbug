When the Tabbrowser Extension Preferences -> Misc -> Use another appearance for
FireFox on Mac OS X is checked browser hangs on opening first page.  Attempts to
close browser indicate there are two tabs open - only one tab is showing.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Install FireFox 0.9.3
2.  Install Tabbrowser Extensions
3.  Set "Use alternate appearance for Fire Fox on Mac OS X"

Actual Results:  
Browser attempts to open page but hangs on page and is unuseable.  Pressing
Option-Apple-ESC to get force quit application allows killing FireFox.  Removing
Tabbrowser Extension manually restores FireFox to useable state.  Not using the
alternate appeance for FireFox cause tabs to be missing tab outlines in Fire
Fox. I can use the browser without the alternate appearance (I'm currently using
it to do this).

Expected Results:  
Tabbrowser Extension should produce correct tab appearance under default theme.
 It should not hang when that preference has been selected.
