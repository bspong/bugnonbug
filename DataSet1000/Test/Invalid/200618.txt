Hi,

Phoenix beeps if you accidentally type in a new window (no input fields
focussed). I think it searches through the document for links containing the
letters typed, and beeps if the search fails.

Often happens if I'm typing in a shell while waiting for a new browser window to
open.

My motherboard's onboard sound has the unfortunate feature of routing the system
beep through connected speakers. It is incredibly loud. No amount of tweaking
has gotten rid of this. In a house with roommates, loud beeps at three in the
morning suck. :)
