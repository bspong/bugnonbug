Configure for example a rule to block the javascript
'http://z.about.com/0/js/cj017x14t207.js' and select 'hide ads'. When you visit
'http://delphi.about.com/library/weekly/aa110203a.htm', the script will still be
executed. When 'remove ads' is selected everything works fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install adblock
2. Create in the options a rule 'http://z.about.com/0/js/cj017x14t207.js'
3. Select the option 'hide ads'
4. Go to 'http://delphi.about.com/library/weekly/aa110203a.htm'
Actual Results:  
When you scroll down, there will be some kind of menu moving along that's
created with the javascript we previously blocked.

Expected Results:  
The javascript should not be executed to create the moving menu.
