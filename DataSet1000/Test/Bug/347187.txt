extremely slow Javascript execution leaving browser unresponsive
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.5) Gecko/20060626 Firefox/1.5.0.5 (Debian-1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.5-1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.5) Gecko/20060626 Firefox/1.5.0.5 (Debian-1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.5-1)

The page at http://nl.maps.fon.com/ takes more than a minute to load. During this time, the user interface is completely unresponsive. The same page only takes a couple of seconds with Mozilla 1.7.12 (Gecko/20060607).

I think there are actually two problems here:
1) A regression causing a massive Javascript slowdown.
2) The fact that the user interface is unresponsive when the script runs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://nl.maps.fon.com/

Actual Results:  
Firefox is "dead" for more than a minute.

Expected Results:  
The Javascript code should run faster, and the user interface should not be blocked when the script runs.

I have the following extensions installed:
- User Agent Switcher 0.6.8
- Gcache 0.2.3
- MozEX 1.0.7
- Adblock v.5 d3 nightly 42
When I visit the URL with all extensions disabled, I get a popup message about an "unresponsive script" every 10 seconds or so. Apparently, one of the extensions blocks these messages.
