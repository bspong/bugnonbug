Been using Firefox for a while now, but recently the browser has been crashing
an awful lot.
Doesn't matter if its viewing a page, or if I have any tabs open - it will crash
at random times. I've tried re-installing the browser, logging in with a
different profile. It happens even with no other apps running. I also installed
it on another Hard-drive [and different partitions] with the same results.

Browser version: 0.9.2 [I've also tried 0.9.3 with the same results]
Operating System: XP Pro
