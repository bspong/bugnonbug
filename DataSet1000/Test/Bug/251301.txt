Automatic Proxy Configuration does not work
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2

If I use Automatic Proxy configuration (i.e. a PAC file) a message appears in
the Javascript console and the proxy server is not used. 


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a Proxy PAC file
2. Use Options/General/Connection Settings/Automatic Proxy configuration URL:
3. Enter the name of the PAC file
4. Reload the file

Actual Results:  
Javascript Console Error is as follows:

Error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x804b0012
[nsIIOService.newChannelFromURI]"  nsresult: "0x804b0012 (<unknown>)"  location:
"JS frame :: file:///C:/PROGRA~1/MOZILL~2/components/nsProxyAutoConfig.js ::
anonymous :: line 84"  data: no]
Source File: file:///C:/PROGRA~1/MOZILL~2/components/nsProxyAutoConfig.js
Line: 84

Expected Results:  
Used the proxy server.

The same proxy file did work in version "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT
5.0; en-US; rv:1.6b) Gecko/20031203 Firebird/0.7+ " which I replaced with 0.9.2.

I tried an even simpler proxy file:

function FindProxyForURL(url, host) { return "PROXY 127.0.0.1:8082" }

with the same result. Also I have 0.7 release version installed on an Windows XP
machine, this also fails with the same message.

The intention of my proxy file is to send requests for specific web sites
through a proxy for security purposes, because of the failure the sites are
displayed anyway defeating the security purpose. In other words I think this
should fail altogether and not display the page.
