Once the user permanently accepts a cookie from a page situated on the local
system harddrive, the "file" page could never be deleted from the "Tools >
Options > Privacy > Cookies > Exceptions" list.  When the user openes that
dialog and finds the "file" exception and deletes it, it disappears from the
list but when the same dialog is opened again, the "file" exception is still
there and the
file:///E:/programming/.......filename.html
page is still able to set cookies via JavaScript even the "Keep Cookies"
settings are set to "Ask me everytime".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the "Tools > Options > Privacy > Cookies" dialog.
2. Set the following preferences: "Allow sites to set cookies" and "Keep
Cookies: Ask me everytime".
3. Open a HTML page from the local system harddrive that wants to set a cookie
via JavaScript.
4. The "Confirm settings cookie" dialog appears.
5. Set the following preferences: (checked checkbox) "Use my choise for all
cookies from this site".
6. Click the "Allow" button.
7. Go to "Tools > Options > Privacy > Cookies > Exceptions" list.
8. Find the "file" site (its status is "Allow").
9. Select the "file" site.
10. Click the "Remove Site" button (the "file" site seem to be gone from the list).
11. Close the "Tools > Options > Privacy > Cookies > Exceptions" dialog.
12. Open again the "Tools > Options > Privacy > Cookies > Exceptions" dialog.
Actual Results:  
The "file" site was still there in the "Exceptions" list.

Expected Results:  
The "file" site should disappear from the "Exceptions" list and the same
file:///E:/programming/.......filename.html
HTML page should not be able to set cookies again unless I accept them.
