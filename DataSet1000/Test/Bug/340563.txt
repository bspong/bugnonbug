cut, copy, paste, arrow keys fail to work in 2nd browser instance (reproducable)

Sometimes certain buttons fail to function in firefox, usually notice while entering search terms and posting on forums when you (try to) use the arrow keys to navigate text, or when you want to copy/paste text and the browser seems to have disabled those options. This is how to reproduce this fault...

The error occurs when working within a 2nd instance of the browser. I.e. When you already have firefox open and instead of opening a new browser window you double-click the shortcut to firefox.exe instead. This 2nd instand will exhibit these issues. I can repeat this on my machine everytime...

Apologies if this has already been reported but although I saw several people complaining about similar sounding symptoms I found nothing explaining the reproducibility of the problem, nor a fix.

May be related to the instance checking highlighted in this bug:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=122698
perhaps some sort of hook is being held by the original instance and not available to the 2nd. <--that's a wild guess btw :o)

Cheers!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. close all firefox windows
2. start firefox using shortcut to firefox.exe (browse to whatever page)
3. start another firefox instance using the shortcut to firefox.exe (i.e. do not just open a new browser window but actually run a new firefox instance)
4. Try to use the arrow keys to navigate text you've entered, try to use pgup pgdn to navigate, press the '(apostrophe) key to see the search box pop up. certain keys/functions do not work.
Actual Results:  
Arrow keys, home, end, pgup, pgdn apparently do nothing. '(apostrophe) opens the find window (mimicing normal F3 operation). Cut, Copy, Paste options do not function.

Note that these keys/functions work fine in the initial firefox instance window(s).

Expected Results:  
The above mentioned keys should work to allow navigating, copy, paste functions, etc.

I'm using default firefox. Only extensions used are Adblock, Adblock updater, IE view, and Talkback.
