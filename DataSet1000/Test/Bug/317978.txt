wrong address hangs the browser
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

In a browser, if u open some standard url like - msn.com it works fine. 
Then on tab u open url  which is not present a wrong url by mistake, like colbsuite.com 
This results in hang and Browser does not responds even if u wait for some time.
Fow which i have to use Task manager and End task, as it is not responding. This in turn closes all Firefox browsers that are opened up.

This behaviour is seen mostly wheenever by mistake u enter wrong web address, which does not exist. 
This result in closer of all Firefox browser open, so loosing all other pages that were open.

Sometimes by chance u enter wrong url address, always result is hanging, and not responding. End task result in all browser closer.

This should not happen, like in IE , when u enter wrong address, it take to search page and suggest look for correct url.
