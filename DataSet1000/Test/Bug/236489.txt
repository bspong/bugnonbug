Select multiple about:config times at once, with options to set them all to the
same value, or reset to default. (not trivial because of different data types
error checking)

BackGround
I always turn off a lot of dom options... (switch disable from false to true)
to keep stupid web pages from resizing my web browser, or hiding the address bar...

anyway, I also do this ritual on all of my friends computers, because I refuse
to use Internet Explorer, and I show them the cool features of FireFox... and
they mostly don't care that I did a lot of work to get it all customized for
them, and installed all the plugins for them... but that is besides the point...

They do use the browser occasionally, and this feature would make it easier for
me  to install FireFox on more computers.

This is probably an extremely low priority task, because it seems like it would
be hard to do, with few people who want to do it...

another solution to my problem (proabably the right way) would be to make the
roaming profile support more rhobust and copyable so that I could just download
my config WITHOUT my personal data in it to their machines.

I am so looking forwards to developer.mozilla.org  I haven't figured out how to
do much yet...
