Adblock Plus crashes firefox on many images/flash

I encounter crashes constantly when having Adblock Plus enabled and trying to visit http://www.gmx.net/de/ (site has many flash and images)

Talkback IDs: TB18281375Y, TB18280816H, TB18280772X
Program Versions: 
  Minefield nightly trunk 20060503 
  Adblock Plus: 0.7
  filterlist: Filterset.G[http://www.pierceive.com/]=2006-04-06a

Looking at my filterlist, i don't see an entry for that site (but maybe for a third party image on that site). Also there is no "hit" increase in the list. I tried to export the filterlist, it seems to skip Filterset.G, the rest is the default entries: 
[Adblock]
@@|https://
*/ads/*
*/advertisements/*
http://*.adserver.example.com/*

Anyway, an extension call shouldn't be able to crash the app.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download newest adblock plus from mozdev (http://adblockplus.mozdev.org/installation.html)
2. Go to the URL http://www.gmx.net/de/

Actual Results:  
Crash

Expected Results:  
Warning of extension failing. 

I hope someone can reproduce. Tell me if there's anything I can do.
