- This is my first bug report and am sorry if I do anything wrong

http://tvguide.ninemsn.com/guide/16012004_73.asp?channel=free&day=16/1/2004

or 

http://tvguide.ninemsn.com -then select 'go' (to goto todays tv guide)

When you click on a tv programme, a new page opens in a new window (smaller) as
it should, but another window opens at the same time (full size). This worked
fine in 0.7.

But if you close the larger window, then select another tv programme while
leaving the smaller window open, it only opens the link in the smaller window
(refreshing it)... working as it should.

But if you close both the larger window and the smaller window, it again opens
only the smaller window as it should.

So it only opens the maximised window on the first tv programme you select, and
when you close it, it does not come back.

Did not work in:

(not sure about the last build date)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open web site
2.click on tv programme
3.close maximised window

Actual Results:  
2 new windows should appear with the same content, one the size it should be the
other maximised

Expected Results:  
just a single new window, not maximised
