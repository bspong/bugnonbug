Repeated password request in apparent infinate loop requires forced shutdown of applicable Firefox window

When going to the above website the user is repeatedly prompted for authentication information, even though the page itself shows up.  Hitting cancel on the password request window just brings up the same request.  I do not use a proxy, and it so far only happens with this webpage, though a similar effect is shown when searching on google for "run-time error 3045" (including quotes), though the authentication information is only requested once.  In this particular result the above domain is in one of the urls of the results, which is why I mention the google aspect here.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Go to the above website.
Actual Results:  
The web page shows up and the authentication info is requested repeatedly, without any known limit.

Expected Results:  
If anything, the authentication info should be requested once.

I am marking this as a security issue because this behavior appears similar to the famous issue with IE wherein closing certain webpages just spawned new ones.  Also, this could possibly be used in a phishing attempt in that someone getting this request repeatedly may put in username and password info for another site, such as a bank.  If a rouge website gets enough of these types of username and password sets then at least a few could be valid on one of the top banking websites.  In addition, there is the aspect of DOS.  I have not attempted to replicate this behavior in IE, mostly out of cowardice.
