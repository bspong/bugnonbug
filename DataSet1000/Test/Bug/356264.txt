Hi, When you click on one of the 4 images on the page under the "I GOL DELLA A 06/07" label, is called this Javascript Function:
function mediacenter(str) {
 var mcwnd = window.open(str,"MediaCenter","statusbar=0,width=825,height=600,top=10,left=10");
 mcwnd.focus();
}

the opened popup dimensions are wrong! Different from what I code on the script!
You can see the difference using Firefox 1.5 or Internet Explorer 6

I hope to be usefull...
Best regards,
Davide Gurgone.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the page http://www.gazzetta.it/passport/ whith Firefox 2.0 RC2
2. Click on one of the images under the label "I GOL DELLA A 06/07"


Actual Results:  
a popup with wrong dimensions

Expected Results:  
a popup described by width=825 and height=600

With Firefox 1.5 and IE 6  is ok.

This is the javascript called by the link:
function mediacenter(str) {
 var mcwnd = window.open(str,"MediaCenter","statusbar=0,width=825,height=600,top=10,left=10");
 mcwnd.focus();
}

On my PC the same thing is reproduced with every kind of popup...
