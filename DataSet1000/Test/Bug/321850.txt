This bug is hard to characterize, but it appears that the CSS "word-spacing" property is being applied differently to "ignorable" whitespace than to regular whitespace in XHTML documents, even when the xml:space option is set to preserve spaces.

Because this is complicated to explain, I'm going to recount my observations in order:

I was attempting to create an XML document (with a .xml extension) that had an embedded CSS stylesheet and view it in Firefox. The first symptom that I noticed was that all of the whitespace before a start element, and after an end element had been stripped from my document. At first, I thought this was the result of an improper xml:space setting, however when I added a "white-space: pre;" CSS style to the document, the whitespace returned, although now word-wrapping was disabled.

I next tried "white-space: -moz-pre-wrap;" and other variations, without success. Then I noticed that the spaces weren't actually being stripped, they were just very tiny - on the order of 1 pixel in width.

So then I added a "word-spacing" property to the document. This caused some interesting and rather odd results - for example, a setting of "word-spacing: 0.01em" caused the spaces to appear normally - in other words, it increased the size of the "ignorable" white-space without noticeably affecting the non-ignorable whitespace. However, "word-spacing: 0.001em" had no effect at all.

Another thing I noticed was that the width of the ignorable whitespace was different depending on its exact position on the line.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I will try to figure out how to attach my XML test document, but if I can't here it is:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<body>
  <p style="white-space: normal;">There is a xxx <span>xxx</span>. [white-space: normal;]</p>
  <p style="white-space: -moz-pre-wrap;">There is a xxx <span>xxx</span>. [white-space: -moz-pre-wrap;]</p>
  <p style="white-space: pre;">There is a xxx <span>xxx</span>. [white-space: pre;]</p>
  <p style="white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0.01em;">There is a xxx <span>xxx</span>. [white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0.01em;]</p>
  <p style="white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0.001em;">There is a xxx <span>xxx</span>. [white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0.001em;]</p>
</body>
</html>

Actual Results:  
There should be a space between "xxx xxx" in all 5 test cases, however I only see a space in cases 3 and 4. All others I see "xxxxxx".
