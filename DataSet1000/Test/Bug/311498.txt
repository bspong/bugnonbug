flash ads cause improper down scrolling when going back a page

Starting in 1.5B1 (I did not see this behavior in 1.0.x) if you go back a page
on some sites with flash ads the browser will not re-render at the correct
location on the page.

To replicate -- go down about halfway or further on the mentioned site (I can
replicate it easily here), click on a link, then go back (alt-left or whatever).
The page will be at the proper location for a split second and then scroll down
below where it should be. Very annoying. I've confirmed that this occurs both
with and without Flashblock 1.33a installed, and the scroll amount seems to be
directly in proportion to the size of the embedded flash ads higher up on the page.

Firefox 1.5B1, Flash plug-in 7.0 r19
