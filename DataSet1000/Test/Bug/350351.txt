Images not even posted on photobucket show as not there, certificates keep appearing.

The main problems are that images which have nothing to do with photobucket show as removed or invalid. Another problem is that certificates keep popping up randomly referring to different sites. For example, if I am on www.xfire.com, a certificate referring to google.com comes up and saying that it is coming from somewhere else. I can expand on this once I get a screenshot of it. Also when i go to some websites, it may just show as 
"URL Failed
/site/laksd/asdkjm/ is invalid"

and if i go to the parent such as www.xfire.com, it will be at the right URL but with the google homepage actually showing.

Many sites also just show a google error... PLEASE HELP MEH! IM DESPARATE! REINSTALLING DIDNT WORK!

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to site
2.If error occurs, take screenshot
Actual Results:  
One of the errors occurs and I wait until later in the day when another problem is occuring and this one is temporarily working. The image problem is always like that unless I renew the image by linking it to a new picture. Others see the pictures fine.

Expected Results:  
Shown images, gone to sites, not shown errors.

This also occurs with internet explorer but I am guessing it is firefox related for the first time the error occured, it was working fine on IE7.
