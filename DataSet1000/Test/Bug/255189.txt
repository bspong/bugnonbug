In Edit -> Preferences -> Downloads
Selecting 'Other...' from drop down list opens a dialog, which is a little
confusing. Let say it opens in my home directory /home/jatu, Cancel button is
enabled, Select button disabled. If I chose some folder with single click, the
Select button will be enabled. If I doubleclick and move to the folder, Select
is again disabled. I have to move up one level to be able to select the folder...

Summary: The current folder should always be default selection. I suppose the
dialog is opened in file selection mode, not directory selection mode(?).

Additionally: In Edit -> Preferences -> Downloads, the Show Folder button
doesn't work at all. And in the folder selection dialog the Go Up a Level and
Create Directory buttons have identical icons.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Edit -> Preferences -> Downloads -> Save all files to this folder -> Other...
2. Try to select current folder (or / which is impossible)
3.

Actual Results:  
I wasn't able to select the current folder

Expected Results:  
Current folder should be default selection
