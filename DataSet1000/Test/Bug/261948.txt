Cursor doesn't change when over selected text in form field

In IE, if text within a TEXTAREA element is selected, the cursor changes to an
arrow when it is positioned over the selected text. This is familiar behavior
for most Windows users as most applications with text editing capability possess
it. In Firefox, the cursor does not change when passing over selected text in a
TEXTAREA.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://www.google.com in Firefox
2. Type some text into the search field
3. Select some of the text using either the mouse or the keyboard
4. Mouse-over the selected block of text
Actual Results:  
The cursor remains the same over the selected text as it is over hte unselected
text.

Expected Results:  
When the cursor is over the selected block of text, it should become an arrow
cursor.

I'm attempting to move all users in my office from IE over to Firefox, but they
do quite a bit of editing in TEXTAREA elements. This was one of the first
complaints I received from my guinea pigs. It might seem like a small issue, but
the absence of that feedback can be disconcerting to new users.

I tested this in Mac OS 10.2 as well as RedHat 9, but since the behavior most
common in Windows, users of the other OSes might not be as troubled by it's absence.
