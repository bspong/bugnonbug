On accessing freebyte.com, the background color is set and the browser freezes
and the system hangs momentaryily.  Dr.Watson comes up indicating an error in an
"unknown module". Dr. Watson completes its routines and advises that the
application (mozilla firebird) is being shut down.  Exiting Dr. Watson leaves
the firebird screen in place and the hourglass cursor.  Ctrl-Alt-Del does not
show firebird as a running task, but other utilities such as wintop and Iarson
TaskInfo show it as a running task using cpu cycles (0.4% or less).  Other apps
can be loaded but load slowly.  The firebird task and the screen window can not
be eliminated *and* the only way to shut down the system is to do a hard reset.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load firebird
2.Enter the freebyte url by any method
3.Use 'Go' or press 'Enter'

Actual Results:  
As stated above.

Expected Results:  
Displayed the web page.  The page displayes correctly with IE 5.5 and Phoenix
prior to 0.5.
