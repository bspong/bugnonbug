FireFox on FC5 Linux cannot open page. Firefox on Windows can.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060808 Fedora/1.5.0.6-2.fc5 Firefox/1.5.0.6

Firefox 1.5.0.6-2.fc5 (Linux) cannot open any pages at www.contribs.org and the load attempt never times out unless manually stopped. A Win2K dual-boot on this same machine with FF 1.5.0.6 can easily open the pages. Also, other Win2K and NT4 machines on this home network also can open the pages. Other external parties with FC5 and Firefox also indicate the same difficulty. See:

I also have a thread concerning this at the Firefox forum:

Is Firefox blocking me from a specific site?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Going to www.contribs.org via address bar.
2.Clicking on a link to any contribs.org pages.
3. Using contribs.org IP address in address bar.

Actual Results:  
Browser attempts to load pages at contribs.org. Shows ... loading page ... in lower left info bar. Loading attempt continues until it is manually stopped. Never times out.

Expected Results:  
Pages should have loaded for viewing.

I am unable to determine if this is an actual Linux Firefox bug, a problem with the FC5 Firefox rpm flavor, a specific problem with FC5 or a problem with the websites code. I do know this is not a address resolution/connectivity issue. The site is up and FF connects. It just won't download and open in FC5.

I highly suggest you read the forum threads I indicated in the "Details" section of this report. They explain things much better that I personally can and probably can answer any immediate questions you have. 

I am running:

Fedora Core 5, Kernel 2.6.17-1.2174_FC5
Firefox 1.5.0.6-2.fc5
