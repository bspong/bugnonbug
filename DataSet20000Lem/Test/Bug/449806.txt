This happens mostly when you try to upload a page that is e.g. a job application form. On selecting the application button, the application form would still remain displayed, whilst the expected page is displayed behind.

Thus, if you select the contract assignment link, a form is displayed which is smaller than the main page.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Register with the link <http://www.theitjobboard.com/index.php?task=JobSearch&keywords=ORACLE&jobtype=1&xc=2&cmloc=180&lang=en>
2. On receiving a job advert on your email, select the job link
3. You should be directed to this link <http://webmail.aol.com/38159/aim/en-gb/Mail/DisplayMessage.aspx>
4. On the displayed page in step 3, select any of the vacancy link

4. fill in the detail on the form
Actual Results:
The page displayed in step 3, is still in place on performing step 4. This implies that the job application page is displayed behind the job vacancy link page.

Expected Results:
On clicking the vacancy link, the job description and application page should be loaded in front of the job vacancy link or the job vacancy link should disappear.

The width of the job description and application page is larger that of the job vacancy form and behind.
