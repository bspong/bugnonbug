Name field of bookmark saved via "Bookmark All Tabs" is empty when loading the tab is deferred
+++ This bug wa initially created a a clone of Bug #446171 +++

If "Bookmarks - Bookmark All Tabs..." is applied to several tabs, the particular bookmark do not get any page title. Part of the URL is shown in the bookmark folder instead.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open several tab
2. Open http://www.mozilla.org/community/
3. Set tab to only load when selected after startup (deferred tab loading).
4. Restart Firefox and see the title for all the tab are present even before loading them.
5. Select "Bookmarks => Bookmark All Tabs..."
6. Enter a Folder name, e.g., "foo"
7. Select "Bookmarks => foo"
Actual Results:
In the subfolder "foo" of the bookmark folder, the corresponding bookmark to http://www.mozilla.org/community/ appears not a "Mozilla Community" but a "http://www.mozilla.org/community/" instead.

Expected Results:
I expect Firefox to fill in the page title ("Mozilla Community" in the example) into the name field of each particular bookmark generated by "Bookmark All Tabs..." since the title is already present on the tab themselves.
