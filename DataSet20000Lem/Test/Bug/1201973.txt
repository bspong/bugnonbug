"Stop Sharing" in gUM in-use doorhanger doesn't revoke persistent permission in different-domain iframe
"Stop sharing" must revoke persistent permissions, or it ha not teeth. Try this (marking sec initially to not immediately publicize this trick, though it is fairly obvious. Please try it before removing):

STR:

1. Go to https://jsfiddle.net/jib1/g7atw687/
2. Don't hit "Share", instead choose "Always Share" in the list (trust me).
3. Try to turn off the camera using "Stop Sharing" from the in-use doorhanger.

Expected result:
- Camera stops, and (because the script is importunate) the gUM doorhanger re-appears.

Actual result:
- camera keep rolling (after brief iframe refresh flicker).

What make this bug extra foul is how hard it is to revoke permission in Firefox (you shouldn't have trusted me):

Non-working workaround #1:

- Reset camera permission under "More Information..." in the URL page-info
dropdown and then open the "Permissions" tab.
Doesn't work because jsfiddle.net us an iframe from a different domain.

Non-working workaround #2:

- Right-click on the frame and choose "View Page Info", then "Permissions" tab.
Still take you to the top Page info, not the frame's (Bug 1201972).

Non-working workaround #3:

- Open Preferences. There is no centralized UX for Permission Management (Bug 1201961).

Working workaround:

- Type in "about:permissions", and locate NOT jsfiddle.net but the domain from the iframe.
You wrote it down from the doorhanger you can no longer access, didn't you? Then reset
camera permission.

(It's "fiddle.jshell.net")
