Since I upgraded to the latest Firefox Aug 28, I have been unable to email photo through my EasyShare software or send the invitation to view online. So I cannot share my photos. When I wa downloading the upgrade - at the end I wa asked something about Kodak Easyshare and I am sorry I do not remember what it said but the inference wa that I needed to do this to make it work with the upgrade. So I said yes. Hasn't worked since.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Easyshare software and choose photo to email or share
2.If you chose email it will allow you to fill in the address etc but will not allow you to send the email
3.If you choose to send an invitation for the receiver to view your photo online..well it will not allow you to choose that
Actual Results:
Cannot send photo

Expected Results:
Should allow me to choose either send photo a attachment or share online


I am not terribly techy so that is the best I can do to describe it
