Some website open control panel in new window that are supposed to allow the
user to send data back to the page that opened them. For example, in phpMyAdmin,
the user can open a Query window that present a form to enter a MySQL query.
When the user press go to execute the query, the result are displayed not in
the popup, but in the original window.

This feature break when the original window is a tab which is out of focus.
Attempting to use a window like this when the tab that spawned it is not
currently selected will cause the panel to open a new window to display the results.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Assumes link that open in new window are being allowed to open in new windows,
not new tabs.

1. Open a recent copy of phpMyAdmin. This wa tested with 2.6.1-pl3. Any later
version should work.
2. Once logged in, click on the SQL button above the database selection box. A
new query window will open.
3. Enter a query. The result (or error message, a the case may be) will display
in the original window.
4. Open a new tab in the main phpMyAdmin window. Make sure it is selected and
browse to the page of your choice.
5. Switch to the SQL window, making sure the MyAdmin tab is still behind the
other new tab.
6. Run a query. The result/error will appear in a new window.

Actual Results:
The result of the query appeared in a new window, so I now had 3 window open:
The SQL panel, A new window with the results, and the original window,
containing a tab open to MyAdmin.

Expected Results:
No new window should have been open. The browser should have moved to the
original window, brought the MyAdmin tab to the foreground, and displayed the
result there.
