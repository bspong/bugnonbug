Firefox 3.0 beta are inconsistently handling right-clicks depending on how the right-click wa entered. In OS X, right-clicks can be entered via a two-finger tap to the trackpad, holding down Ctrl while left clicking (either with a mouse, the trackpad button, or a single fingered tap to the trackpad), or a an actual right-click on a multi-button input device. All these should be handled identically. However, Ff is not handling them all the same. The outcome varies, but two-fingered-tap seems to work correctly very infrequently while ctrl-left-click seems to work very consistently. The easiest way to see the problem is to right-click in the middle of a page to try to get a contextual menu. The two-finger-tap will work correctly for a few time and then will suddenly start selecting and executing a random item from the contextual menu rather than displaying the contextual menu.

Note that this affect more than just the contextual menus, but the contextual menu is the easiest to trigger and the most annoying.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a browser window and navigate to a page
2. Tap on the trackpad with 2 finger (must have this preference enabled in System Preferences) to emulate a right-click.
3. Repeat step 2 until a random item from the contextual menu is selected and executed
Actual Results:
The two-finger-tap method of right click will eventually result in a random item from the contextual menu being executed (such a Save Page As, Send Link, etc.)

Expected Results:
Two finger tap method of right click should display the contextual menu.

Default theme, some extensions, no crashes.
