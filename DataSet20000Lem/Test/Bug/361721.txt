the parameter of the chart can be modified in a pop up window which open when clicking on the "parametres" button.
the "style" of the chart (bar chart, candlesticks, line) can be normally modified by scrolling the list at the top of that pop up window and selecting an item.
when one doe that, the window disappears into the dock and becomes inaccessible.
also the number affecting the different parameter in the pop up window can not be changed.
the only thing that seems to work is the ticking/unticking of the boxes, which have no bad effect on the pop up window and do properly affect the chart in the main window

sorry the website is in french and thanks for all your great work!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.click on the "parametres" button, next to the save and printer icons, on the left below the chart
2.a small window opens. on top of that window, open the "style" scrolling list
3.select in that list another item than the selected (the default value should be "cloture")

Actual Results:
instead of changing the chart style in the main window, the "parametres" pop up window disappears into the dock.
also, the number can not be changed in any of the box

Expected Results:
the "parametres" pop up window should have remained there and the chart "style" should have changed, also the number in the box should be changeable
