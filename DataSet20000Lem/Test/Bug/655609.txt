I've noticed individual word a well a entire block of text missing in pages. At first I thought it wa poor editing, then after quite a few instance decided it wa not. If I cut and paste the problem area into a text editor, the missing text is relieved. A Google search show a similar problem a few year ago in the 3.x branch, but in that problem it appears that highlighting the text on the page would make it appear. Now, it doe not, although it is clearly there a cut and paste capture it.

The missing word thing happens quite often on a lot of site including google searches, slashdot, reddit and techdirt, among others, although I don't recall missing whole block other than on techdirt.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load web page
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Notice seemingly random word missing throughout the page.

Expected Results:
All text visible.

I've also noticed that reloading the page, visiting it later or, in the case of a Google search, typing in the same search phrase will result in the same word or block missing. The word is replaced with a blank space

I've also reported this on the ubuntu buglist a Bug 779364.
