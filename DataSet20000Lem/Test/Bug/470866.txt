after an upgrade of all extensions, the back button's history is once again showing only a dot and blank space below that - a pixel or 2 per history item, no text.

No helpful error show in the JS console.
This time the first window opened is fine, but the second window is broken.

This ha happened too often for me to keep solving it by wiping out a 50-90ext setup and reinstalling one by one to discover the culprit.

The one uninstall actually shown to fix this so far:

needlesearch

however, needlesearch work with some extension

I hope that all victim of this will
