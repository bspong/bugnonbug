A page includes two forms, one before a set of Google AdSense items, one after. When the submit button is hit, the second form call the form target page twice instead of once. It is not sensible to the eys, but the script on the page called by the form prof that the form target page is really called twiced. The form located before the AdSense item is not affected. When the Google AdSense code is removed, both form are correctly working. This doe not affect IE 7 RC1.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a page with a form. the form target should contain a script that render visible the double call : for example an hit counter recording into a database.
2. Insert Google AdSense item (ads, not "Firefoxfox with Google" stuff that doesn't trigger the bug) BEFORE the form.
3. Use the form and see what happens. remove the Google ad and see what happens.

Actual Results:
The form call it target file twice.

Expected Results:
the form should call it target file only once.
