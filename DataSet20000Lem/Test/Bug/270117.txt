An option to open urlbar, searchbar, bookmarks, history, javascript popup link and DDE call in new tab through left clicking

I am suggesting that we should implement an option in the option dialogue to
allow user to choose two mode of tabbed browsing: Traditional tabbed browsing
and Tabbed browsing.

Traditional browsing mode is basically how firefox handle tab right now (the
default setting). It will always open urlbar, searchbar, links, bookmark and
history in the present window and j popup link, DDE call to open in new
windows. Users must explicitly instruct the browser to open in new tab through
ctrl+click, middleclick or the context menu.

Tabbed browsing mode basically open everything in background tab by default
(through left clicking). It will open urlbar, searchbar, bookmarks, history,
javascript popup link and DDE call in new tab in the background. However, if
the user wish to, they can still open new windows/tabs through shift+click,
ctrl+n, ctrl+t and ctrl+click.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:





There are three reason why I am suggesting this change. This first one is the
present way firefox handle tab is simply inconvenient. A lot of computer
(esp. old computer and apple computers) do not have middle buttons, so they
have to resort to ctrl+click, which requires pressing key on the keyboard and
that is inconvenient. Middleclicking is not that comfortable either, since most
user don't use middleclicking on a regular basis (at least not in windows).

The second reason is that a lot of alternative browser (esp. IE shell such a
Maxthon and Avant) had already implemented this option (although their option
are more fine grained and are probably too complex for novice users). From what
I read on their forums, their user are very happy about this particular option.
I have also read many users' complaint on the mozillazine forum about how they
need to scan through forum and site just to make tabbed browsing partially
working the way they intend it to work (One can always dismiss those user a
the few vocal one or even trolls, but maybe it's time to have a serious look at
this issue). This must have meant that I am not the only user who is complaining
about tabbed browsing.

The last reason (and the most important reason) to implement this change is that
from what I have read on the Internee, it often take a novice user week to
discover the tabbed browsing function (if they ever discover it, that is. I
believe there are many people out there who are confused about all the fuss
behind tabbed browsing since they can never find it!). Even then, they would
most often discover the inconvenient way to open a tab (ie. ctrl+t, through the
menu or the context menu). This basically mean that to those users, opening a
tab in firefox is no more convenient than opening a window in IE. However, if we
employ the tabbed browsing mode I have described, then no one will have trouble
discovering tabbed browsing. This is also one of those addictive feature
(features the user can't live without), since it is so much more convenient
than shift+click or ctrl+click.

Lastly, you might ask: what about those user who want to open their bookmark
in a new window, their history in the present tab and urlbar in a new tab in the
background? My answer is although I don't suggest that we implement fine grained
option in the option windows, we should always consider implementing more fine
grained control in the prefs just to keep the advanced user happy.

Note: This is a refile of the previous tabbed browsing bug filed by me, since
the devs have complained that my bug are not fine grained. So please do not
mark this a a duplicate and just delete my previous postings.
