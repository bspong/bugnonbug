Sometimes when launching firefox, or opening a new window the bookmark toolbar loses all of it link except for the initial Home link. Restarting will usually restore the full set of links. Opening a new window will sometimes fix the problem too.

When the toolbar is broken, a secondary effect is that new tab won't have a close option on them (the cross inside the actual tab). The right-click tab menu still work though.

A third symptom is that in the bookmark menu the bookmark toolbar folder menu item often won't have a name against it, just a blank space.

I've not found a way to reliably trigger this bug, it just seems to be a random occurrence which happens on some launch of firefox. I've only ever seen it on OSX. I use the same version of firefox on window and haven't seen this.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox
2. Look at the bookmark menu
3. Open a new tab

Actual Results:
Shows only the home icon.

Subsequent tab have no close button.
