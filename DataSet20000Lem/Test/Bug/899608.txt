CustomizableUI: Make our wrapper fast
From IRC:

[2013-07-30 18:04:16] <Gijs> mconley: so, node should be made a getter, or possibly just removed
[2013-07-30 18:04:27] <mconley> yeah - is that ever used?
[2013-07-30 18:04:33] <mconley> at the very least, it should be lazy
[2013-07-30 18:04:37] <Gijs> mconley: forWindow should, umm, check the wrapper cache before going a-wandering around the DOM
[2013-07-30 18:04:45] <Gijs> (not after, which is kinda silly)
[2013-07-30 18:05:00] <mconley> I believe
[2013-07-30 18:05:34] <Gijs> and really, we could easily have a placement info getter on the group wrapper
[2013-07-30 18:05:49] <Gijs> which will eliminate DOM lookup entirely in the case where the widget is in the panel
[2013-07-30 18:06:04] <Gijs> (right now, you have to call forWindow)
[2013-07-30 18:06:24] <mconley> that'd be awesome
[2013-07-30 18:06:43] <Gijs> (we could do this by getting the area's type from the placement's area id info)
[2013-07-30 18:06:51] <mconley> yep


Generally, IMO the wrapper should avoid doing actual DOM poking until you ask them for a DOM node (and cache the results, of course).

(some of this slowness seems to be causing the bookmark UI's update on startup to take about 0.5ms on each tpaint window open)
