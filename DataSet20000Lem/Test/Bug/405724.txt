Reading a digital newspaper I daily load lot of pdf and jpg documents, in size from 10 kB to 1 Mb. The pdfs are handled by the latest Adobe plugin and the jpgs by FireFox itself. I save a lot of these file to my local hard disk C:. FireFox tends to remember the directory used last, but regularly loses this path and default to My Documents. This is extremely cumbersome, cost me lot of time and hurt my poor battered arms.
I don't know whether the cause is with FireFox or the Adobe Reader plugin.
Sometimes FireFox keep track of what I see a my "Session Working Directory" for dozen of file at a row, then again it loses the path after every three or five saves. Restarting the application doe not help. Neither doe restarting the machine.
The machine is a Dell desktop with 1 GB internal memory. Windows XP show no sign of stress, the max memory never get used (I monitor it permanently with Process Explorer). The OS is healthy, fast and bug free and regularly get the official MS updates. The problem never occurs with any other apllication.
The loss of the path seems most frequent when I change between the file type pdf and jpg, but otherwise I see no pattern.
A splendid option would be a field in the setup panel to specify a Working Directory that can be adjusted a needed.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to www.nrc.nl
2.choose the digital newspaper (a small rectangle showing a newspaper image, under a caption "Digitale editie", at the right, near the top)
3.choose "print versie (pdf)" at the drop down box upper right
4.start reading and saving files, switching to jpg now and then, and you can't miss (on my machine, at least).
The digital edition is temporarily free of charge, but if prompted for a password, you can use user=haslo and pw=k5pjxxe6 (please keep this confidential).
Actual Results:
Saving files, the application loses track of the directory last used. This occurs after an unpredictable number of saves, but it never fails to happen.

Expected Results:
Application should always keep track of directory last used.

Well... I believe this is it.
