Enhancement: Middle Click on a Tab Shouldn't Close It

Steps to reproduce:

I have a specialized mouse to help with my rsi and to help with scrolling. The top button is wearing out and is giving spurious double-clicks and extra clicks. I used the driver to switch the top and middle buttons.

I mostly used the middle button for my scrolling software. It shouldn't matter if it get extra click while I'm holding it down to scroll, and it shouldn't do anything drastic a I adjust... right?


Actual results:

Now the top button, set to function a a middle button, close tab if I use the wrong button when I click on the tabs. And it sometimes close two or more tabs.

Apparently this is standard behavior, but who would expect any button to do this?


Expected results:

It make sense to have the *option* to use one button, and one click on the tab, to close tabs.

It doesn't make sense to have that default setting.

Users shouldn't have to change hidden Firefox setting to keep using a mouse for more than 1-2 years.

Either way a checkbox in Preferences > General would make this visible.
