Local copy of config file ignored and hence preference overwritten during product update

I have made some change to a system-wide config file - nsFilePicker.js but this bug applies to any file within /usr/lib/firefox/components (in Debian).

Whenever I update Firefox these file are overwritten and my change lost - fair enough they are system-wide after all.
To avoid this I have placed a copy of the file (including the changes) in my local ~/firefox/<profile>/components directory - a is the norm when making user specific config changes. This file should be detected and used overriding the system-wide one but it is not.
Thus each time I update Firefox I must make those change again or copy a backup version of my changed file over the freshly installed one - this is not a good way to do things!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Copy /usr/lib/firefox/components/nsFilePicker.js to ~/firefox/<profile>/components/nsFilePicker
2. Make some change in the local copy
3. Start Firefox
Actual Results:
Changes in local file are ignored but make those change in the usr/lib/firefox/.. copy and they are obeyed.
Note: when making change to nsFilePicker you need to refresh the Extensions list by adding, removing or updating an extension and then restarting Firefox. This is done in both case and the change in the local file are still ignored.

Expected Results:
The local config change should be obeyed.

The reason I am making the change is to make firefox stop using it's own file/print dialog and get it to use my preferred window manager one (in my case the KDE dialogs).

So what I am really after is a local config change that allows me to set which dialog to use. Changing nsFilePicker.js is a workaround and I'm happy with it but the local copy being ignored is a pain a I have to repeat my change each time I update Forefox (which is quite a bit when using Debian unstable!).
