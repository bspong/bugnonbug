Phoenix (but not Mozilla) ignoring "background-image" url in CSS style / "Find My Match" button appears in gray, even though CSS is set to display red (and Mozilla correctly display the button in red)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.3a) Gecko/20021207 Phoenix/0.5

Actually this happens with all of the red button on the entire site at
http://personals.yahoo.com, but I chose to focus on one concrete example to
simplify the discussion.

Viewing the source, the button is of CSS class "yperbttnlgbrdr".

This CSS style is defined at http://personals.yahoo.com/css/yperadv.css as:

.yperbttnlgbrdr {
background-image:
url(http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/us/per/gr/btn/lrg.red.100x18.gif);
color: #ffffff;
width: 100px;
font-weight: 800;
}

Apparently, it is ignoring the red button background image at
http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/us/per/gr/btn/lrg.red.100x18.gif

This button appears red in both IE and Mozilla. It's only gray in Phoenix
(Firebird?), which really puzzle me, since I thought Phoenix and Mozilla were
using the same HTML rendering engine.

So is Phoenix ignoring the background-image even though Mozilla is not?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://personals.yahoo.com in Phoenix 0.5 and Mozilla
2. Observe the color of the "Find My Match" button
3.

Actual Results:
In Phoenix, the button ha a gray, rectangular background.
In Mozilla, the button ha a red, rectangular but slightly rounded background.

Expected Results:
Phoenix should be rendering the background-image exactly the way Mozilla does.

This is the CSS style that is not rendering properly:

.yperbttnlgbrdr {
background-image:
url(http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/us/per/gr/btn/lrg.red.100x18.gif);
color: #ffffff;
width: 100px;
font-weight: 800;
}
