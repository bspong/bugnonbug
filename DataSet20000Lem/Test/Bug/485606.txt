This problem appears on many page at many site I've visited. Severity depends on complexity of the page design.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Preferences > Content pane > Colors button
2.Uncheck "Allow website to choose their own color instead of my setting above"
3.Perform the above step while on www.kcrw.com and you will see the effect instantly; no need to close Preferences.
4. Re-check the box and the page reverts to it correct form.
Actual Results:
Web page hide certain elements, including Javascript buttons, frames, and part or all of tab row (e.g. the tab name may appear, but it border and color won't). Also, some frame containing list don't draw properly (missing or overlapping text). And background color disappear.

Expected Results:
Complete, accurate appearance of the web page, but color for text and background and visited and unvisited link should be a the user ha specified.

If you know the button etc is there, you can hover the cursor over the point on the page where the button should be and then click it. This will launch the process etc (on www.kcrw.com, starting an audio stream). But, of course, a new visitor to the page can't see what's not (apparently) there.

Being able to change color preference is minor compared with losing button etc. The preference should be disabled until fixed, or a warning added: "Caution: Clearing this checkbox may cause some page to not appear correctly."
