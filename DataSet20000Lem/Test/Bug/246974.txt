CPU usage reach 99% and will not go down

I've had this problem in the last few version of Mozilla (0.9, 0.8, 0.7).
Firefox start without a problem and I can browse webpage fine. After what
appears to be a random amount of time (maybe 20 minutes?) Firefox jump to 99%
CPU usage and will not go down. It still load page fine (slowly, but fine),
everything work a expected yet it is at 99% and all my other program stop
working. There is no perticular trigger that I can identify, it appears to be
random.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load Firefox
2. Start surfing
I know these step are hardly going to result in a problem for everyone, but
that's what is happening for me.

Actual Results:
CPU usage of Firefox go up to 99%.

Expected Results:
Stayed at it usual rate of <5%.

I know I am giving little information here, but I really don't know what I
should be saying. I can't identify anything that is causing this. I guess I'll
give my system specs, maybe there is something strange there:

Windows XP Pro SP1 (all window updates)
Inspiron 8200 Laptop
1.9 Ghz P4 processor
512MB DDR RAM
40GB HDD (over three partitions, still 15GB free)

I'm not running any really strange application in the background. Norton
AntiVirus, Office 2004, Winamp.

Not sure if it's related, but I use a proxy server to access the internet.

If there is any information that you think would be relevant, please tell me and
I'll try and give it.
