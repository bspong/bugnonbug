If you search for ticket for an event, after typing in the captcha, it keep displaying "please hold" message and doesn't let you get past the screen to buy tickets.

I go to comcasttix.com which had worked just fine with the older version of Mozilla Firefox. If I try to search for ticket for any event, it brings me to the captcha to type in...I do it and it say "Please wait while we reserve the best possible seats". It doe state it may take up to 3 minutes. I waited 10 minute and it won't pull ticket for me and let me past the page to buy them. I try on other browser and no problem at all. It seems to be an error with the new version of Mozilla Firefox. Thanks. Looking forward to the problem getting fixed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to www.comcasttix.com and click buy ticket for any Event currently onsale
2. Enter quantity of ticket and select "best available"
3. Type in the code/captcha given and you will see it ha you hold and never pull up tickets.
Actual Results:
I wa never let past the "waiting to pull the best available tickets" screen, but on other browsers, it pull ticket for me in le than 10 seconds. On Mozilla (this new version)...it almost seems stuck.

Expected Results:
I hope to be able to use mozilla to search for, pull and buy ticket soon on comcasttix.com a Mozilla Firefox is my preferred browser.

one that I can think of...other than I never had any of these issue with the older version...only with this new 3.0
