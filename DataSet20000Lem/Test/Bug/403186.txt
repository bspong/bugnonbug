Using Firefox and preferred website link = bookmarks(in Dutch : BLadwijzers), and having had no problem when accepting update Firefox ( i.e. my preferred website/website-groups, I relaunch Firefox at +/- 12.00 a.m. (Brussels Time) , November 9th 2007.

All my preferred bookmark disappeared after update wa made.

I have found no online help. And consider it unacceptable a to have to pay +/- 38$ for help by third party to the Mozilla-organization.

Please can you (re)direct me to effective solution for recovering of
more than 100 installed preferred bookmarks-incluse password
for professional use !! and other,
which did function this morning before 12:00 a.m.
Brussels-time)- +/- hour of dramatic update Firefox?
