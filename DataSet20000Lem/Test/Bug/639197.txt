I'm attempting to create a clickable email page in order to use the browser email function to contact several people. I've coded three separate email in the same page but each link open an email window addressed to the last email address coded... that is, I have three separate contacts; 1, 2, and 3; and have coded a separate link for each. The problem is that no matter which one I click, the window that open is addressed to number three.

This doe not happen in IE- each link open a window addressed to the intended recipient

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Code several mailto link on the same page and save
2.Open that page in FF
3.Click any one of the mailto link
Actual Results:
An email window open addressed to the final contact no matter which link is clicked. If I want to have an email page to contact Tom, Dick, Harry, and Bob- and I have Bob listed a the last link in the list, no matter which recipient I click, the window is addressed to Bob. When I omit that option the target recipient becomes the new last address.

Expected Results:
When I click Tom, I should get a window addressed to Tom. Likewise for Dick, Harry, and Bob.

Email client are notorious target for virus and worms. This is supposed to work around that- to enable me disable Outlook Express.
