Computed Panel on Element Inspector Malfunctioning
Created attachment 8662032
View of rule repeating over and over

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:40.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/40.0

Steps to reproduce:

Resizing window, selecting element that are child of already inspected elements, just pretty much most type of behavior one would carry out while developing a site.


Actual results:

Rules in computed panel show up multiple time (ie height may show "100% 50% 100% 50% 100% 50% 100% 50% 100% 50% 100% 50% " rather than just "100%" with 50% in strikeout. Also seeing rule of parents/children/unrelated element at time that should not be present and have no impact on inspected element.


Expected results:

Up until about a month ago this wa much tidier, and not broken. If for example an element had one general CSS rule and one additional contained within a medium query, the computed panel would display both rule once when the rule is expanded – the inactive one would have a strikeout. They now repeat over and over indefinitely if the window is resized to trigger each CSS rule interchangeably. I've tested this in both OS X 10.9.5 and 10.10.4, both Macbook Pros.
