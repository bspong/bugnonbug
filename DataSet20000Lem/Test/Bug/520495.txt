I wanted to print a page in my facebook inbox.

I wa on the page, selected print from my pulldown. The first page it printed wa blank except for the headers. The 2nd page printed fine. The 3rd page wa blank except for the header and 1/3 of information on my facebook page did not print.

I restarted and tried again. I used Preview and it is not accurately showing what is on the page to print.

In Safari it printed fine and there wa 1 1/3 page of information.

with Firefox it printed 3 pages. page 1 and 3 were blank with header only and i wa still missing 1/3 of the page.
