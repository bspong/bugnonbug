Why is there not the ability to be able to save a security "profile"?
Much like my firewall protection that allows me to create various level
of protection and then to just switch between them on the fly, I should
be able to create a security profile consisting of my Java(script)
settings, plug-in enabled/disabled choices, pop-up blocking preferences,
etc., and to be able to apply them to a single tab just by having their
user-assigned name appear on the right-click context menu.

Better still, I should be able to TAG website on the fly, using the CM
menu in an open tab/window. Finally, I should be able to right-click on
a link and on the CM it should offer to open in a new window/tab but
applying a specific security profile.

This whole process of having to specify which site are allowed to
install software, which site are allowed to launch pop-ups, etc, etc.
is both counter-intuitive and lead to REPLICATION OF INFORMAION and
REPLICATION OF INPUTTING BY THE USER, a the same allowed site appear
in multiple list over and over again.

Internet Explorer nearly had it with the "Zones" concept except that the
User couldn't create their own zone (they could only modify a single
"custom" zone) thus it wa completely useless.


Reproducible: Always
