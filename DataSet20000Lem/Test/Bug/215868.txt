After opening a real-audio stream (i.e. www.ffn.de -> click on "webradio" in the
lower right corner of the screen->press play) the firebird browser isn't working
properly any more. The personal toolbar isn't clickable anymore. Windows warning
message (popup like) cannot be closed. It is not possible to start another
firebird instance.

Real-Plugin: RealOne Player (win32) V2.0, with technologie from Helix
V6.0.11.853 Distribution: BFL01D German-Version?

The problem occurs only in Firebird not in Mozilla (1.4)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Browser
2. www.ffn.de -> click on "webradio" in the lower right corner of the screen
3. press play on popup

Actual Results:
it is not possible (i don't know if instantly or after a while of browsing) to
use the personal-toolbar nor close errormessages like "URL not available"

Expected Results:
close errormessages after closing them and react on click on the personal-toolbar

-Windows 2000 german version, SP 4 (5.00.2195)
-All available patch distributed by Microsoft installed (except Media Player 9
and Microsoft .NET Framework Version 1.1 (German))
-Parallel installation of Firebird and Mozilla
