XML viewer doesn't handle expansion/hiding properly

When using the XML viewer, certain node are not handled correctly when
hiding/expanding. I have seen 2 bugged behaviour which I suspect are caused by
the same bug:

1. Hiding a node (click -) cause the node to be hidden, but the node
underneath it are not moved up, leaving a white space on the page.

2. Expanding a node (click +) cause the node to be expanded, but the node
underneath it are not moved down, causing overlapping text.

This doe not happen for all nodes, however it doe happen in one of the node
in an XML document I will attach in a comment below.

1 is really simple to reproduce, simply contract the <nav:url> tag in my
example. This is 100% reliable on this browser.

2 is harder to reproduce because it only happens for the <nav:url> node, which
doesn't move the text below it up in normal circumstances. By clicking on random
stuff I have managed to reproduce this (only take a few second of random
clicking), but I haven't worked out a reliable path to it.

Note that this work fine on Mozilla 1.7.2.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open example.xml, which I will attach below.
2. Hide the nav:url node

Actual Results:
The node wa contracted, but node below it did not move up to fill the space.

Expected Results:
The node should contract and node around it should adjust properly.

Look in a comment for example.xml
