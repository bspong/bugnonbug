When a new window is opened a a child, it focus a expected. But when focus return to the parent, for example when a link is clicked in the parent to open the same child with a new URL, the focus doe NOT return to the child even when it is explicitly called.

Repros on FF2 in Win XP Pro a well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open attached file in Firefox 2 (downloaded from http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/)
2. Click on the first link, see new child window open and focus
3. Click on the second link in parent, child win doe not gain focus, new URL ha loaded.

Actual Results:
Instead of child window gaining focus from myNewWindow.focus() (see small code in attached) and loading the new URL, the child doe not gain focus.

Expected Results:
Expected behavior a found in previous version of Firefox and other browser which is that the child would gain focus if told to do so.

I suspect this is related to other bug dealing with child windows. I've attached a very simple repro case, hope it helps.

I classed the severity a Major because really, a major piece of functionality is broken. Many site rely on being able to bring focus back to child window for thousand of reasons, this functionality should not have gone away.
