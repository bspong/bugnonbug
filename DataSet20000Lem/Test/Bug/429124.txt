Several other user (including the author of the applet, whom i have consulted) confirm this.

Reproducible: Sometimes

1. Access http://electronictiger.net/stereo/page01.htm
Actual Results:
Applet apparently runs, but display message

Stereo Applet 2.2 beta

Preview image not found - please check parameter!

Expected Results:

This bug doe not always manifest; i have had report from others that it did work for them in Firefox (but most report are that it doe not).

It appears only when accessing the page posted on my website - if i open the local file of the same page (stored on my hard drive with identical directory structure), it work correctly.

In addition (infrequently) is i open the local page and then, in another tab, open the website page, it may render properly.
