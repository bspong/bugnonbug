Javascript failure popup bigger than the screen

It happens to me in authentication to BlueHost through CPanel.
When the session expires, the failure of authentication cause a javascript failure popup to appear with a long javascript code.
Since the code is very large, it go above and below the screen, and cover about 50% of the width of the screen. the "close" button is not visible or reachable.
You can not scroll down or up to find the "close" button and click it to make the popup disapear, at the same time FireFox and all it open tab are not clickable.
The only solution to recover from the problem is to kill firefox from window task manager.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.login to CPanel
2.wait long enough for the authentication to expire
3.click any link on cpanel

This is just an exmpale, I think every large javascript code cause the same problem


Expected Results:
see portion of the javascript if the whole thing take more than one screen, and the ability to page next and previous on large javascript code on popup screens.
