>>> My Info: Win7_64, Nightly 46, 32bit, ID 20160107030235
STR:
0. (optional) Open 12 tab with different bugs. You can skip it if you already have 12 different item in history
1. Open about:preferences#general
2. Click in the field "Home page", delete all text there, press Down key to open suggestion
3. Scroll suggestion list to the end

Result: A blank unselectable line appears in the end of suggestion list.
Expectations: There should be no blank line in suggestion popup

The mechanism is the same a described in bug 1227734. Workaround:
to install extension "Stylish" and create the following style (without ">"s)
> @namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);
> @-moz-document url-prefix(about:preferences){
> #browserHomePage tree > treecols { border-bottom-width: 0px !important;}}

It wa regressed by bug 1087618 because I see exactly "border-bottom: 1px.." added in the changeset
