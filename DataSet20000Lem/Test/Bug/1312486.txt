Enable no-extra-boolean-cast, no-new-object, no-shadow-restricted-names, and spaced-comment rule for eslint
Running eslint-nibble showed that there were a number of easy to fix rule that didn't have a bunch of occurrences. We can fix some of these now to prevent them from becoming problem in the future.

This patch enables no-extra-boolean-cast, no-new-object, no-shadow-restricted-names, and spaced-comment rules.

max-len and no-return-assign were not enabled because they actually have a lot more occurrence when run in the full codebase.
