Div line-height is inconsistent with pt, px and em measurement

In the first set of Divs, the height is alternating between 25 and 26 pixels. If the the Minimum Font Size is set to 24 the height alternate between 31 and 30 pixels. Similar thing happen if using a px measurement for the "line-height" setting.

In the 3rd set of Divs, the 2nd Div is 24 pixel high and all the rest are 25 pixel high when the Minimum Font Size is set to None or 9. If the the Minimum Font Size is set to 24, all divs have a height of 30 pixels.

In Opera 9.64, the first set of divs are consistently 25 pixel high no matter what Minimum Font Size is set.

In Opera 9.64 the 3rd set of Divs are all 30 pixel high when the Minimum Font Size is set to 24 and are all 25 pixel high when the Minimum Font Size is set to 9.

In IE6 the first set of divs are consistently 25 pixel high whether "Ignore font size specified on Web pages" is checked or not and regardless of the selected Text Size.

In IE6 the 3rd set of divs are consistently altered when "Ignore font size specified on Web pages" is unchecked and the Text Size is changed.

Reproducible: Always

Expected Results:
Using pt setting for Line-Height of a Div should produce consistent and equal heights.

This is also happening in SeaMonkey 2.0b1pre.
