When I recently switched to using Firefox 0.9.1 I noticed an annoying behavior.
When I click the x in the upper right hand corner of the screen (minimize,
close, maximize, etc) it close all open firefox windows, not just the current
one. If other window had more than one tab opened it doesn't even give the
'closing multiple tabs' warning like it doe if I close the window with the
multiple tab directly. So basically when i revert to habit and use 'x' to close
the current window I can lose all my firefox window and tab immediately. i
didn't know if this wa intended behavior or a bug so I figured I'd report it in
hope it wa a bug.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.open multiple window of firefox
2. click x in upper right hand corner of any firefox window
3. swear and curse a you try and recreate the tab you had opened in other
firefox window

Actual Results:

Expected Results:
It should only cause the main window to close, not all open firefox windows.
