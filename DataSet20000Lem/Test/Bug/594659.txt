Actual Results:
I thought my previous Firefox had picked up a bug/malware (I don't really know what to call it) and no matter what I did I could not get rid of that annoying search wesite. So I removed that Firefox from my file via the control panel "add/remove". I made it a point not to retain any information of any kind. Then I closed my browser for about an hour.

Then I went to http://mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/ie.html/ to download a "new" firefox browser. I though my problem would be solved. This website/search engine or whatever started taking over my firefox originally when I would use Google search. Google would no sooner be opened then this file would take over. Lately this file take over even when I use Hotmail to use my sympatico email. Any type of "search" will trigger this website.

Expected Results:
I wa hoping that by deleting the Firefox browser and installying a new version I had solved my problem. This file change the sequence of letters/numbers/symbols every time it come back to haunt my Firefox. This problem doe not happen when I use the Internet Explorer. It come under three names: 1. the one beginning with Cl-finde.com/(plus the extension)used first followed by 2. beginning with filenxt.com?DN=cl-finde.com/?fp=(and three row of letters, number etc, and then the 3rd version kick in if I deleter the other two. This version begin with SEARCHDISCOVERES.COM/SEARCHINFO?DOMAIN=CLcl-finde.com&fp=(ETC....) My spyware never catch the first time, but now block number 2 and 3 version. Right now I must use IE or that website would try to take over.

It look like I will have to give up using Firefox. but I don't really want to. My spyware people could not figure it out yet, so maybe you can.
