When using a shared spreadsheet in google docs, navigate to the 'discuss' tab. There are two text boxes, the top one display the conversation, the bottom one (under the text "Press enter to send your message") can be used to type and send messages. After filling the top box with a conversation the top box will expand and push the lower box off the screen. After pushing the lower box off the screen the top box will continue to expand so that all new message (shown on the bottom) are unreadable unless the FF window is resized to be bigger. Correct behavior should create a scroll bar on the top box after it ha filled up the space.
