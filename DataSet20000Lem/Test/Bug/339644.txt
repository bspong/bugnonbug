Adding bookmark to the bookmark toolbar folder cause near 100% CPU utilization and increasing memory utilization. This can be demonstrated by moving bookmark into the bookmark toolbar folder. At some point the CPU utilization increase to 100 percent. Removing these bookmark eliminates the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Increase the number of bookmark in the bookmark toolbar folder
2. As the number of bookmark increase the CPU utilization increase to near 100%
3. Removing the bookmark eliminates the problem

Note: This ha been a problem with all version of firefox on this platform (Windows 2000 service - with latest service pack and updates).
Actual Results:
CPU increase to over 95% and doe not decrease. Memory increase slowly (possibly a memory leak).

Expected Results:
The browser becomes incredibly sluggish (very slow drop down actions)...page scrolling is very slow....etc.

If too many bookmark cause a problem, then a hard limit should be put on this folder size (at least a a temporary fix)....maybe something like: "folder capacity limit reached".
