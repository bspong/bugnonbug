Download Manager no longer recognize MIME type under Linux, making impossible to open downloaded file

After updating from Firefox 3.5.7 to the newest and greatest 3.6, file association stopped working on my Fedora Core 6 system. Now, the Download Manger asks me to pick an application to open "file" link for every file, no matter the MIME type. Also happens with "Open Containing Folder". This also mean that downloaded file will have no matching filetype icons.

Although FC6 is ancient, FF3.5.7 worked fine with no issues.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download any file that requires an external app for open it under Linux (let's say, a ZIP file), select "Save it to disk"
2. Wait the download to complete
3. Double-click the file on the Download Manager (or right-click the file, and select "Open Containing Folder")
Actual Results:
The "Start Application" window pop up, asking me to select an application for opening the file/folder

Expected Results:
The file should open with the default application specified on the system. For example, GNOME user will get their .ZIP file loaded on file-roller. Folders should open with Nautilus, or something like that.

Deleting mimeTypes.rdf ha no effect. Even worse, specifying the app may not work, depending on how the app deal with file/URL path (for example, GNOME' File-roller say that the file doe not exist (!), but KDE apps have no problem opening the files. Looks like FF is sending a file:// URL a the file path - KDE apps that use Kioslaves have no problem for dealing with such paths, but GNOME apps do (file-roller doe not like "file-roller file:///path/to/file.zip")
