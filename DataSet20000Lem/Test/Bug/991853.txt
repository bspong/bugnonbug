Use a temporary list of directory tile link
Seems like we don't want to put the sponsored icon on site that aren't actually sponsoring, so it sound like we'll want to just replace everything with Mozilla related thing until we get an actual list from bug 990713.

Where * could be marked a affiliate and everything else organic (so no sponsored). Both bug 974736 (icon) and bug 974745 (panel) have been verified, and we're just changing the reference data, so I think we should be good.

clarkbw, can you put together the urls, images, and colors?
