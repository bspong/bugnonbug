Some secure page have code in them that change the URL in a manner that cause a saved page to be unopenable. Somewhat recently, NewEgg added the following JavaScript code to the header of their secure page (including receipts, which I prefer to save, instead of print):

if(window.location.protocol!="https:"){if(window.location.replace){window.location.replace("https"+window.location.href.substr(4));}else{window.location.href="https"+window.location.href.substr(4)}}

This cause saved purchase receipt to redirect from "file:///C:/..." to "https://c/...", giving an error that no server exists at "c".

Some other site use various different method that break Firefox's Sage Page As... feature

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Buy something at NewEgg
2. Save the receipt
3. Try opening the receipt
Actual Results:
File fails to open because Firefox look for an HTTPS server in the location of the file

Expected Results:
Firefox already edits an HTML file upon save to replace image location with the file saved on the hard drive. The Save As parser should be modified to look for redirects that will "break" the saved file. One example is given above, using a JavaScript URL rewrite command.

I've seen other secure site exhibit similar behavior, but I've also successfully saved many secure pages. There is no easy workaround to this problem - the user must know enough HTML, JavaScript, etc, to be able to edit the saved HTML file, troubleshoot the cause of the problem, and manually edit the saved file appropriately.
