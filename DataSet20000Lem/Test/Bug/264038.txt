Button Hit area of Flash Components are shifted if placed in div position:fixed

If a Flash Component(<object><embed> etc...) is placed inside a <div> with
position:fixed the hitareas of button become offset by double. If the fixed div
is placed at x:0 y:0 everything is fine, but if the div is placed at e.g. x:10
y:10 the hitareas will be doubled to x:20y:20. if the fixed div is at x:150y:150
the hitareas will be shifted to x:300y:300 from the top left of the document
etc... all other element in the flash file are where they should be, even the
image on button (up over down state are where they should be) just the
'invisible' hit area layer is shifted by double of the fixed div coordinate.




Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.



Expected Results:
hitareas should be aligned with Flash button within fixed dive regardes of
coordinate of the fixed div.

i wa able to come up with a workaround by putting a relative div with the flash
code inside a fixed div positioned at x:0y:0. this will however not work with
with positioning from the right or bottom edge of the document. (e.g. right:0px;
and/or bottom:0px;)

i wa not able to recreate this problem on a macintosh version of firefox.

ie, even though there is not support for div fixed, get around this problem by
using cs expressions. would be nice to see that in firefox ;-)
