Hi,

I get 100% CPU usage on my girlfriend's computer when doing this. NOTHING extra is loaded in FireFox. This is a very clean, no-frills, brand new installation of FireFox 3.0 installed yesterday (07/15/08) -- no AddOns, Extensions, etc installed whatsoever except the default that came with FireFox 3.0 upon installation.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Reproduction is incredibly easy. Open any two website so that the Tabs show up along the top of the screen. URLs used doesn't matter. Now wiggle your mouse pointer along these Tabs at a moderate-to-quick speed and CPU Usage will climb to 100% within seconds.
Actual Results:
Excessive mouse pointer lag and 100% CPU Usage (based on Task Manager data)

Expected Results:
Should not lag or use CPU whatsoever beyond maybe a slight increase. "Wiggling" the mouse pointer around on a normal webpage display (i.e. the actual viewable page area) within FireFox 3.0 on this PC, or on this PC Desktop, increase CPU usage by about 10%.

Theme = Default Firefox 3.0 theme. No modifications.

System Information to be attached shortly.
