firefox stop everything while 'file-selection'-dialog for <input type="file" /> field

If you click on a 'Browse' button from an INPUT-field (type:file) the file-selection dialog opens. While this, firefox won't do anything and the whole application wait for the dialog to be closed.

Problem especially is mad while running a flash in a different tab streaming music/videos.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Stream a music-video using flash (youtube.com)
2. Open a different tab containing a file-upload formular (phpmyadmin, import-sql in my case)
3. Clicked on "browse" to select a file - 'file select' window opened
Actual Results:
The streamed music in the parallel running tab (.flv video stream) stopped running. Also all tab will stop everything like JavaScript or loading/displaying content.

Expected Results:
The flash shouldn't stop. Maybe even the browser should still be able to be used at all. Maybe someone follows a tutorial and want to check which file he ha to upload.

I don't know if this problem is limited to windows. But for me the solution for this problem seems to be a full replacement of the Windows-API-call, finding an alternate method for file selection or running the call in a parallel thread.
