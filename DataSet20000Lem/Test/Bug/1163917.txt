The built-in Pocket is NOT completely disabled if Pocket is already installed and used a an add-on
Reproducible on:
* Firefox 38.0.5b1 (build1: 20150510205200)
* Firefox 38.0.5b1 (build2: 20150511143336)

Affected platforms:
Windows 8.1 (x86), Windows 7 (x64), Mac OS X 10.9.5, Ubuntu 14.04 (x64)

Preconditions:
* the user ha a profile with Pocket installed a an add-on from AMO

Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox with built-in Pocket using that profile.
2. Open a page that's currently NOT in your Pocket list. Right-click somewhere in that page and click "Save to Pocket".
3. [Linux only]: From the Bookmarks Menu, click "View Pocket List".

Expected result:
* The Pocket add-on is used instead of the built-in one.
* The built-in Pocket button is NOT visible in the toolbar.
* The "View Pocket List" menuitem from Bookmarks Menu is NOT visible.
* The "Save to Pocket" context menu option is NOT visible for eligible pages.

Actual result:
The Pocket add-on is indeed used instead of the built-in one, but the following built-in functionality remain visible:
* on Linux: the "View Pocket List" menuitem from Bookmarks Menu, the "Save to Pocket" context menu option, the "Save Link to Pocket" context menu option
* on Mac: the "Save Link to Pocket" context menu option
* on Windows: the "Save Link to Pocket" context menu option

Additional notes:
* The "Save to Pocket" and "Save Link to Pocket" context menu option actually work, although the add-on is installed and used instead of the built-in one.
* On Linux, clicking the "View Pocket List" menuitem from the Bookmarks Menu point the user to Pocket's sign-up/sign-in page (although the user is already signed in with the add-on).
