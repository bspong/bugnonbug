Bookmarks toolbar submenu disappears when dragging new URL to it.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

When I'm visiting a page, and want to bookmark the current URL, I usually drag it from the address bar, by grabbing the favicon, and drag it to my bookmark bar.
In the bookmark bar I have a couple of folders, with subfolders in them.
If I hover over a folder on the bookmark bar, a menu opens.
However, since upgrading to Firefox 4.0, very often when I move the mouse downwards over the open submenu, it closes, just a the mouse leaf the folder "button" in the bookmark bar.
This also happens when dragging an existing bookmark from the bookmark bar to a folder.
It doe not happen when "empty handed" and clicking on the folder "button" to open the menu.
It also only happens to top level folder on the bookmark bar. Any subfolder menu work a expected.

It seems like the problem is constant when moving the mouse slowly, but it can sometimes be mitigated by moving the mouse very fast.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Drag the current URL or an existing bookmark from the bookmark bar
2. Hover over a non-empty folder in the bookmark bar, so that it menu is displayed
3. Move the mouse from the folder "button" towards the open menu
Actual Results:
The open menu disappears when the mouse move over a small area between the folder "button" and the corresponding open menu.

Expected Results:
The open menu will be kept open, to allow the user to drop the bookmark in a certain order, or in a subfolder.

I'm using the default theme.
