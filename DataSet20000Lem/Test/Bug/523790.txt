Firefox ignores link to specific page inside a pdf
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; pl; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I'm using official Adobe Acrobat plugin for viewing PDF files.

It is possible to link to specific page inside a pdf file. It is done like this:
<a href="http://matacq.free.fr/Publis/sheep.pdf#page=6">Link text</a>
The first time you try, it always work a expected. But if you scroll to some random page, close the tab, and re-open the tab, the pdf will be opened on the page that wa displayed when the tab wa closed. This is despite the fact that the link explicitely tell firefox where to open the pdf file. (page 6)
I think it would be best if firefox remembered last viewed page ONLY if the pdf file isn't supposed to open in a specific place.

Trying to refresh the page, clicking enter doesn't help. The focus should jump to page 6, just like it work for html2html links. It doesn't.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on a link to open a pdf file on a specific page. Open it in a separate tab.
2. Scroll away from that specific page.
3. Close the tab
4. Repeat step 1.
Actual Results:
The pdf file is opened at last viewed page

Expected Results:
Pdf file should be opened at the page the link is pointing to.

Note that firefox WILL reopen the pdf file correctly (without ignoring #page=6) if you wait for a couple of minutes. But within minute of closing a scrolled pdf, it won't.

I suspect that link from html to "named destinations" in pdf file are also affected by this bug. I don't have any such pdf file at hand to test.
