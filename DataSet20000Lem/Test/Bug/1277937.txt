http ha an underline instead of a strikethrough when mixed active content is loaded
STR:
1) Go to https://people.mozilla.org/~tvyas/mixedcontent.html
2) Open the control center, go to the submenu.
3) Click Disable Protection
4) observe the url bar. It should show an crossed out grey lock and a crossed out https, like the fourth picture in the second column here:
https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/security/files/2015/10/combo-graph21.png. It actually look like a crossed out lock with an *underlined https*.

Why did the http switch from being struck through to underlined? What release did this issue occur in? Sometime between 46 and 49. In 46 it look good, in 49 it doe not.
