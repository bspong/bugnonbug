Firefox 13 - Constant Lockups In Linux
I'm running the latest Firefox 13.0.1 in Linux Mint 13 x86, on a Dell Laptop N5010
and Slackware 13.37 x86, on a Sony Vaio, both laptop also with completly different hardware and both system have the exact problem of constant lock up and freezing the entire desktop...

On occassion I'm able to run Ctrl Alt F1 to boot out the desktop to the console to log back in and start over, but many time the entire system is locked up and I have to do a hard shut down, turn the power off and repower on and I'm not enjoying this at all...

I've used Firefox since Firefox came out, and I've been using it that long in Linux and I've never had lockup like this till version 13, but whatever is going on with this version to cause it, it's really bad, this is like every 1-2 hour I encounter this and working all day long needing a browser is a real pain and I hope this issue will be resolved soon.

If I click any section in the toolbar, needing to adjust Preferences, addons, or use the Bookmarks, or add a new tab, Firefox will sooner or later lockup and this is happening on two completely different Linux systems, different kernel versions, different desktops, so the situation between these two system have nothing in common, except for the fact that this is both Linux, practially all of the system library and dependency are also different versions, there isn't much similarity here between the two, so that make me realize this is a Firefox issue, not a system problem.

In Linux Mint I'm using the Cinnamon desktop and in Slackware I use only OpenBox.

Whatever log or files, information, etc., you'd like from these system to help resolve this please let me know and I'll submit this, but I hope we can get on this, hopefully since I'm having this on two different systems, I can't believe I'm the only one with this issue...

Also under the Advancved preference for Browsing I unchecked all these new features, hoping it might help on both systems, but it didn't.

In Slackware, since I have greater control over it, I've changed two different kernel version and the Sony ha an Nvidia 410M GPU and I've changed three different driver version and none of this ha also helped...

I personally don't know if there is anything I can change, it just feel like a buggy version of Firefox is all...
