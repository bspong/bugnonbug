computer lock up while closing pdf file.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Firefox/1.0.4

My config: 2.5 GHz P4 Notebook, 500M RAM, 700M pagefile. WinXP 2000 + SP2
Acrobat 6 Full for editing pdf file + Acro 7 reader for viewing pdf wthin browser.

Having read the FAQs & info on Firefox and Acro bat page ( I hope all) I edited
Grepref/all.js to search for acro7 plugin - OK finally. Having to do that may
count a a minor bug in itself, but moving on:

pdf file now load nicely into browser. WHEN YOU CLOSE THEM the computer freeze
& the hard drive start spinning at max rev for up to a minute or until I force
FF to close with Task Manager.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have a large number of tab open, preferably with two or more window
2.Open a pdf page
3.Close a pdf page

Problem is noticeable when simply closing a pdf page with nothing else open.

Actual Results:
FF 104 hangs, swinging gently in the breeze. Hard drive appears determined to
achieve speed of sound, spinning at max rev for up to a minute. I then forced
FF to shut down with Windows task manager. At some point this ha caused FF to
behave strangely:
1.The default font change.
2.Adblocker, which is turned off, consistently block some links:
http://www.qantas.com.au/fflyer/dyn/partners/wineClub then click
http://www.qantaswineclub.com.au/
3. Some radio button option in Tools/Options have no selection made. eg
General/Connection Settings; Advanced/Tabbed Browsing/Open link from other
apllications in..

Expected Results:
Gracefully closed the pdf page.

The problem with Adblocker and the new font can be fixed by creating a new FF
profile.
