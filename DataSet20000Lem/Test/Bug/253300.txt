While loading SitePoint Forum thread (seems to be any of them), the window
stop updating; the status bar and throbber freeze. That single window won't
ever redraw; other existing window and newly-created window function normally.

The window will not redraw; scrollbars are non-functional. However you can
still create new tab (you won't see them, but the close window dialog
accurately report the number of tabs), switch tab (using standard shortcut or
clicking where the tab would be if you could see them), go to different page
by typing into the location bar (the current address won't be selected or
changed, but the auto-complete menu will appear), clicking link in the
Bookmarks Toolbar (the bookmark don't respond on hover, but the menu still
appear with a click), using the Bookmarks menu, etc.

The loading cursor icon will appear when navigating to new pages, and the title
bar will update when chaning tabs, etc., but nothing else redraws.

You can even open the History sidebar and click on link (neither of which
you'll be able to see), and the page will load (but you won't be able to see it,
only the title bar changes). You can tell when you're over a link because the
pointer change to the hand icon.
