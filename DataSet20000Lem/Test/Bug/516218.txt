If i try to open the above link in firefox, window Media player (version 11) produce an error saying: Cannot play this file because the protocol is not supported.

THIS IS CAUSED BY:
I open the link in firefox, and then in medium player select the file "currently playing" and select properties. it says: ".\ftp://ftp.ncsoft.com/Aion/Movies/dd2-highres.wmv".
When using Internet explorer, it say : "ftp://ftp.ncsoft.com/Aion/Movies/dd2-highres.wmv"

This mean firefox sends an malformed url to medium player. (".\" at the beginning.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open the url in forefox
2. click off error message in mediaplayer
3. view property of the file in the medium player playlist by rightclicking on it and select properties.
Actual Results:
File is not played by window medium player because Firefox sends a malformed url.

Expected Results:
Firefox should send the correct url.
