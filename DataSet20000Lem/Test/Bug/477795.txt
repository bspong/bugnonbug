I tried creating a HTML5 page with an embedded video using a "mms://" type URL:

<video src="mms://somestreamingserver"></video>

Unfortunately, Firefox claim that it need an external application to open this, even though the QuickTime (or Windows Media player on Windows) browser plug-in can handle this properly using Flip4Mac (Safari doe it without a problem). I cannot select the QuickTime plug-in from the list of suggestion that Firefox offers. I also cannot browse to the plug-in on disk and select it (grayed out). I know of no manual way either that I can tell Firefox that it should just use the standard plug-in for this.

Is there any workaround for this?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create HTML5 page with <video> tag pointing to an MMS stream
2. Watch a Firefox prompt you for something that you cannot fix

Actual Results:
It is only possible to play video in an external player.

Expected Results:
Video should play in the browser. The nightlies of Webkit do this properly.
