When trying to open my gmail account, the green progress bar at the bottom continuously reloads, but never open my email until gmail report this error:

Request-URI Too Large
The requested URL /accounts/ServiceLogin... is too large to process.

I then blocked the page with my no-script v1.9.1.6 add-on just playing around and tried to open my gmail and it appears the address keep getting appended to. You can see it update real time until the gmail server apparently ha had enough and kick back an error.


Also, I noticed this exact same error when trying to load the scratch and win application in facebook. The only help I can offer with that is that the application requires you to install flash player to scratch the tickets.

Everything I've read say gmail is flash heavy, so maybe given that both a flash heavy facebook app and gmail have the same issue, it's flash related?
