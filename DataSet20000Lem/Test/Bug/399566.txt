Bookmarks and History menu open slower than other menu every time
2007-10-11-04 linux trunk nightly (and others, not sure when it regressed)

With my places.sqlite file, the bookmark and history menu open slowly, taking noticeably longer than the rest of the menus.

This doe not happen in a clean profile. However, if I export my bookmark to a bookmarks.html, then remove all trace of bookmark and history from a clean profile, then import the bookmarks.html into the clean profile, the clean profile demonstrates the same slowness.

I do not have a lot of bookmarks--105 to be exact. Nor are they complexly structured--they're at most 2 folder deep.

Bug 385036 is similar, but say it only happens the first time the menu is opened. This happens to me every time the menu is opened.

I'd rather not attach my bookmark file to bugzilla for eternity, but I would be fine emailing it to an individual. Boris, in bug 385036 you offered to look into it if someone gave you a testcase, is that offer still open? Anyone else with a bugzilla track record would be okay, too. Alternatively, I could try to minimize it to see if it's a specific bookmark causing the problem, but I'm pretty busy so I might not have time for a while.
