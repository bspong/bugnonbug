Since Phoenix/Firebird can change theme in a second, I would like to see an
optional dropdown menu for themes.

Just a there are button for history, favorites, etc. that can be put up on the
menu bar or on a toolbar from View > Toolbars > Customize, a Themes button could
also be available. Clicking on this button would cause a dropdown menu to
appear, with only the name of the available theme (if you need to see the
pictures, go to Tools > Preferences >Themes). From the dropdown menu you could
choose your theme for instant change.

This would allow you to change theme for various websites.

Eventually I predict that we will have an option for associating various theme
with various websites. Farther in the future, I suspect that a broadband
becomes closer to universal, website developer will provide custom theme that
will automatically take over when we visit their site (subject to a
custom-theme-blocker, of course).
