multiple operating system process are not supported

multiple process are not very well handled.

i.e.:
- on a terminal server, the same user can open more than one connection
mozilla-firebird complains about "profile already in use".
- if mozilla and mozilla firebird are run in parallel it
complains about "profile already in use"
- testing web-sites requiring user login is difficult.
sometimes you want to be able to login with two user at
the same time, it would be nice to fire up two firebird
(i.e. operating system processes) to log in a two different
users.

if we want to have that features, we have to use internet explorer currently ...


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click on icon on desktop
2. firebird start one operating system process
3. click another time on desktop icon
4. firebird doe "open new window" instead of starting
another operating system process




Expected Results:
1. clicking on icon on desktop start a new operating system process.
2. "open new window" doe not start a new operating system process,
just a new bowser window opens.
