When attempting to access a SUSE Linux 9.2 system over the local network via the
VNC Java applet in a Firefox 1.5 Beta 1 window from a Windows XP SP1 PC, the VNC
login page is displayed for a split second, then a blank screen replaces it.
"Applet VncViewer started" is displayed in the information area at the bottom of
the blank page. Firefox 1.0.x and Internet Explorer 6 access the same
page/applet successfully from the same PC (same OS, Java, etc.) so I'm pretty
sure this is specific to Firefox 1.5 Beta 1.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Attempt to connect to http://192.168.10.3:5801/ (VNC client viewer applet on a
SUSE Linux 9.2 box) over the local network.

Actual Results:
1. Observe the Java applet startup logo for a few second (if Java VM wasn't
already running on client PC).
2. Observe the VNC login screen for a split-second.
3. Observe a blank tab (browser window) with "Applet VncViewer started"
displayed in information area at the bottom of the window.

Expected Results:
1. Display the Java applet startup logo for a few second (if Java VM wasn't
already running on client PC).
2. Display the VNC login screen with "Applet VncViewer started" displayed in
information area at the bottom of the window.
3. Wait for user input.
