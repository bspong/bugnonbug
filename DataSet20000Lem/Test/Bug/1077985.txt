User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; WOW64; rv:32.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/32.0
Build ID: 20140923175406

Steps to reproduce:

asp page scan recursively through a series of directory on the server (2008R2. IIS 7 SQL 2012) server using filesysytemobject looking for file (placed there by users) For each file, it par the name and file features, add that to a record in a to a SQL database using ADO. Then it renames the file using a unique recid/date/time combination (fso) (already generated in the SQL database) and move the file to a designated folder. The code work fine every time. When it get to the end of the sweep, the page show a date time remark ("last run at...") and the number of file it found (collected a a variable dimensioned and then set to RecordsProcessed=Cint(0) at the top of the page, then incremented a RecordsProcessed=RecordsProcessed + Cint(1) for each file it finds)
On Chrome, Firefox 32.03 and IE11 the purpose of the process work fine. On Chrome and IE the "number of files" works. On Firefox it ALWAYS say zero.


Actual results:

A vbscript variable is not incremented correctly (or at all!)


Expected results:

variable should increment - it doe with other browser
