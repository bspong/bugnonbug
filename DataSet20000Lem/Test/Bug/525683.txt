I have 2 issue which I believe might come from the same source.
these problem have occurred since a week or so.
1. My firefox seems to become slower and us more memory the longer I use it. Sites such a facebook seem to become incredibly problematic after a while, but the memory usage doe not significantly decrease (if at all) after navigating away from these pages. on 3 seperate occasions, this caused a crash hard enough to freeze my laptop until Firefox could be ended by force.
2. My laptop seems to stall and firefox seems to stall and/or increase it memory usage incredibly when a file ha finished downloading and firefox initiate the virus scan. after this is completed, thing return to normal.
having several downloads complete at once cause the program to freeze, needinga force end once again.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate heavy site
2. download several file of any filetype
3. leave the program running for a short while during normal usage.
Actual Results:
unpredictable, but without fail, firefox and the rest of the computer slows down.

Expected Results:
the same, but more severe, ending in a frozen program which ha to be force quit.

I have noscript plug-in installed, which I keep up to date.
somewhere along the line, I believe "ask.com" managed to get on my computer, I have disabled the toolbar, but I do believe there is more spyware. it might have an effect.
I have the yahoo! toolbar, disabled.
Skype extention for Firefox version 2.2.0.102. I have skype running most of the time
Java quick starter version 1.0 installed.
-
I run in multiple windows, not multiple tabs, by preference, this might have an effect, I do not know.
