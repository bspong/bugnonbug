Firefox go into a hang (50% CPU) when connecting to the Omnis Web Client plugin

We would like to report what we consider to be a major issue with this release of Firefox 3.6 on the Windows 32Bit platform (XP/Vista/7 and possibly others).
As far a we can see, this is not a problem for the Mac OS X platforms.

This version is causing problem with our Omnis Web Client Plugin (see note*) (NPH-OmnisCGI.exe) for client that have upgraded to this version of Firefox – there have been and there are still no issue with previous version of Firefox (3.2.x, 3.5.x).

From what we have established, a soon a you click on something within our plugin that sends an event to the server, Firefox enters a tight loop (see Task Manager and Firefox CPU usage will be at 50% or higher).
It is only when the mouse leaf our plugin that Firefox start to receive the response from the client (even though it wa sent immediately).
We can see that the Omnis Web Plugin is not in a tight loop within our code, so it look a if this is a Firefox 3.6 issue, particularly a this still work for previous version of Firefox.

This problem can be demonstrated very simply by downloading and installing the Omnis Web Client plugin and then testing some simple example that are currently available on our Web site.

You can download the ‘Web Client plug-in version 5’ from the following URL (http://www.omnis.net/download/index.html), and then run the downloaded application Omweb.exe, for which you will require Administrative permissions.
The application will install the necessary component depending on the platform to, c:\Webclient for Windows XP, or to C:\Users\xxxxxx\AppData\LocalLow\TigerLogic\webclient for Windows Vista/2008/7

Also, an Environment Variable (MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH) will be created, which will contain the installed path of the Web Client plugin.
After having downloaded and installed the Web Client plugin, it will be necessary to re-start the PC.

You can then use Firefox to access the Omnis Web Client Gallery and test the example (http://www.omnis.net/products/webclient/index.html?detail=gallery).

If you start with the Books example, the example will be displayed immediately within the browser, but when clicking any of the object (push buttons, sidebar icons.etc), very little will happen and the task manager will show Firefox at 50% CPU usage.
Moving the cursor out of the browser (plugin area) will then release whatever loop Firefox is in, and the web page will the display correctly.
Likewise, if you try the Images example, nothing will occur until you move the cursor out of the browser (plugin area). Again, the Task Manager would be showing that Firefox wa using 50% of the CPU.
