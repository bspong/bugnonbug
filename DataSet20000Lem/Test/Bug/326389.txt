Here's a list of some of the events/problems I continue to have :

1. FF is sometimes unreponsive - freeze for maybe 1-2 second between link
2. FF sometimes crash ( 5 time so far ) - report send to Mozilla
3. Closing FF often doe not close the process
4. Memory usage still high - usually over 100MB
5. After "first" loading FF, and after loading a "second" page/link, the BACK-ARROW remains inactive , i.e. a if the current page wa the "first" page to have been loaded
6. Sometimes this (5) effect appears during a longer session, i.e. not only on the first page
7. the 100% cpu-time problem seems to have abated - at least I haven't noticed it since the last trouble some week ago

Reproducible: Sometimes




I have Win2K SP4 installed.
The previous FF verions worked fine - but since updating to 1.5.0.1, the above small irritation have appeared !

What happens most of the time is that between link ( loading a new page ), FF more often than not appears to "freeze" - and only free itself once the new page is near completion !
All instance of FF freeze by the way - not just the one where the new page wa loaded !

I have Symantec Antivirus running and Sygate Persoanl Firewall.
A few plugins are installed - but have also tried removing them to see if the situation get better - to no effect ! ..and therefore reinstakked them again.

The problem is not critical but spoil the pleasure of using an excellent product !

Cheers
Phil
