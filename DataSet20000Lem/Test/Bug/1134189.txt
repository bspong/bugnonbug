Fan stay spun up even after closing Firefox, until next Firefox launch
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:35.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/35.0
Build ID: 20150122214805

Steps to reproduce:

-- Use Firefox normally.

-- After a seemingly random amount of time (from 10min to several hours), PC fan will audibly spin up to max for no apparent reason.

-- Close all my Firefox windows:
- the fan STAYS spun up!

-- Attempt to re-open Firefox:
- it will now tell me that Firefox is actually still running and must be closed.
- (I ONLY ever receive this message while the fan is noisy!)

-- I tell it to close and relaunch Firefox:
- it tell me that my profile cannot be loaded, and no Firefox window ever appears.
- at this point, FINALLY my fan always quiet down again.

-- Attempt to re-open Firefox a SECOND time:
- Firefox now launch correctly, and my fan stay quiet (for now).


Actual results:

A noisy PC fan and an inability to relaunch Firefox until I've attempted twice.


Expected results:

Firefox should not cause my PC fan to stay spun up after I have closed all my Firefox windows! If I'm done using Firefox, I should not have to close it then (attempt to) relaunch it to quiet the fan.
