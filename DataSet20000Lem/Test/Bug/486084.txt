Loss of previous functionality: Having many screens-worth of open tabs, double-clicking left/right tab scroll button move to first/last tab

In 3.08
1) DOUBLE-clicking doe what TRIPLE-clicking did in the previous versions.

In 3.0.7 and below:
1) DOUBLE-clicking left/right tab scroll button move one screen's worth of tab to the left or right of current.
2) TRIPLE-clicking left/right tab scroll button

Hence having 300 tab open (as I usually do). I need to hold down the scroll button to find the tab I want, rather than double-clicking to go by screen-fulls.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open 40 or so tab (at least 3 screen worth)
2. Make first tab active. Double-click right tab scroll button.
Actual Results:
I found that it take me to the last tab (tab 40).


Expected Results:
I can fit 14 tab in view, so I should have been viewing tab 15 - 28.

If I wanted that particular behaviour I would triple-click.




Works OK in 3.0.7, just not in 3.0.8. Maybe the version detail are wrong above a I have 3.0.8 on another machine, but posting from my 3.0.7 browser.

Great software otherwise. Keep up the good work!
