Bookmarks toolbar unresponsive until Google Apps Mail page finish loading

It work fine in Firefox 3.0.11, but not in 3.5.

I usually open Google Apps Mail with Calendar included (GAM) in a tab, then while it's loading, I select more page within folder on the Bookmarks Toolbar to start opening additional site in additional tabs, so I don't have to sit and wait while GAM finish loading.

With 3.5, I can't access any of the folder on the bookmark toolbar until GAM completely finish loading, so it force me to sit and wait. In 3.0.11 (and earlier versions) I have no such issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Google Apps Mail page with Calendar included
2. While it's loading, try to open additional page (tabs) via folder on the bookmark toolbar

Actual Results:
In 3.5, you can't access the folder on the bookmark toolbar until the page is done loading.

Expected Results:
To be able to access and use the item in folder on the bookmark toolbar to open additional tab while GAM is still loading, just like with 3.0.x.

Google Apps mail especially take a while to load when the Google calendar is turned on within Google Apps mail on a slower PC.

This 3.5 bug is especially noticeable on my P-III/1.3Ghz/768.Meg RAM computer, but is also noticeable on my P-4/3.Ghz/2.Gig RAM computer. (Windows XP Pro SP3 + all updates, broadband Internet access)

I assume the same issue occurs with other pages, but GAM is the one I notice the most, probably because I use it the most.

I am not the only one to have this bug (someone else mentioned the exact same issue with 3.5 in a forum I wa recently reading), but I didn't see it reported by anyone else yet even though I tried many different search here, and reading through the dupe bug list.
