I can't give a specific site because it doe this on pretty much every site that us quick time. when a movie clip start to play it stop and send a firefox.exe error message. it get so bad that i have to use Internet Explorer to view clips. the weird thing is firefox never crashed before till 2.0 version came out. the 1.0 version never crashed once. i already tried installing firefox and quick time again. the problem didnt go away. and i even checked my other computer to see if my computer wa messed up. all 4 computer had the firefox.exe error so i know for sure it the browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to a site that ha a video clip via quick time. Be sure that the clip is shown on the site and not sent to the computer via temp file.
2. play the video(s) at least 3 time
3.
Actual Results:
firefox.exe error message pop up and say it need to close. then the browser crash and closes.

Expected Results:
play the video clip without crashing the browser. Note: when viewing medium player video it will NOT crash.

if you attempt to open the file and watch a clip on your computer instead of the page you found it. the crash will not work. it only happens on site that play clip on the pages. a stated before there is no specific site. any site with quick time clip will crash. but for some reason medium player clip won't crash.
