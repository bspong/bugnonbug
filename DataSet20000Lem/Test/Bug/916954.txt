And everything go sadfaces. I'll look at this more tomorrow, but if anyone know what's wrong sooner than I do, then feel free. If anyone think it's urgent/necessary to back out what caused this, please back out bug 876926 only (not the followup I already landed that otherwise fixed the orange, which fix other bugs, too).
