Opening "Troubleshooting Information" page hang *computer* for nearly one minute.

Opening "Troubleshooting Information" in FF result in:

1. Nothing unusual for a few seconds.
2. CPU fan stops, indicating CPU use zero. Current window and controls, taskbar, etc. all become unresponsive. Keyboard LEDs cannot be toggled.
3. A few second after that, the mouse pointer freezes.
4. For roughly 40 seconds, the attached router show network activity and so doe the light on the NIC at the back; the drive activity light is on solid (no flickering at all) and an ear to the case reveals drive access noises.
5. Recovery is abrupt: everything start working again, and FF pop up a notice saying that a script on the page is unresponsive.

This obviously should be *physically impossible* under a protected-mode operating system such a Vista, but somehow you've managed it anyway. In fact it's even le clear how this can happen at low-to-zero CPU use. The obvious method (give a couple of thread Realtime priority and have them busy-hang) would max out the CPU instead. To have it happen at zero CPU seems to require complicity from an OS or driver bug that result in some systemwide lock being held for an unreasonable amount of time.

Remarkably, I had a number-crunching background process running when this happened and even that stopped. It doesn't touch anything except main memory and CPU in mid-job -- no I/O whatsoever, other than to print to a command prompt console. This would not have been trying to acquire DirectX surface or thing like that, in other words.

I'm classing this a critical rather than major even though the hang spontaneously resolve after a minute or so, on the ground that a lot of user will reach for the power switch much sooner than 60 second after a hang so complete a to include the mouse pointer freezing. This will obviously tend to cause data loss and crash absolutely everything, including Firefox.
