On session resume with master password and certificate authenticated pages, no page will load until master password entered, sometimes multiple time
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:21.0) Gecko/20130308 Firefox/21.0
Build ID: 20130308042013

Steps to reproduce:

1. Enable "Show my window and tab from last time" (session restore)
2. Enable "Use a master password" (I assume this is related)
3. Sign in to one or more website using certificate-based authentication. I signed in to cacert.org and startssl.com.
4. Close Firefox with File>Exit
5. Restart Firefox
6. After all window and tab are restored, notice that networking seems to be disabled. I cannot load or reload any pages.
7. Close Firefox (File>Exit)
8. After window close, I find "Password Required" (title) prompt that ask "Please enter the master password for the FIPS 140 Cryptographic, Key and".
9. Respond to several of those prompt (4 or more) until Firefox finally is completely closed.
10. Restart Firefox.
11. Finally discover two "Password required prompt hidden behind some of the visible browser windows.
12. Enter my master password at both prompts.
13. Notice this did not sign me in to either certificate-authorized website.
14. Notice that I CAN now browse the internet.

Last verified in Aurora 21.0a2 (2013-03-08) on Windows 7.


Actual results:

I could not browse the internet until entering my master password twice at prompt that were hidden behind other Firefox windows.
I could not exit Firefox until responding to those prompts, either.


Expected results:

Internet browsing should have worked unobstructed, since full interactivity with Firefox window wa enabled.
If my master password wa required, I should have received one prompt, and it should have been visible (possibly displayed on top after all Firefox window had been restored).
