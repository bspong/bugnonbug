empty value for app.support.baseURL redirects user to dubious website instead of Firefox Help
This issue wa discovered by a user in the German speaking Firefox support forum. For whatever reason the user didn't have any value in app.support.baseURL, it wa an empty string.

STR:

1. set app.support.baseURL to an empty string
2. go to Help > Firefox Help
3. another example: with unsigned add-on installed open the add-on manager and click the "learn more" link.
4. another example: with an legacy add-on installed open the add-on manager and click the legacy add-on badge.

Actual:

In step 2 Firefox open www.firefox-help.com. In Step 3 Firefox open www.unsigned-addons.com. In step 4 Firefox open www.webextensions.com/.

These are all registered domain and have the potential to be abused because these domain are not under Mozilla's control!

Expected:

Mozilla can't control all domain on the world so if app.support.baseURL is changed to another domain Mozilla can't really protect the users. But at least Firefox should handle the empty string case better. Firefox should not try to interpret the IDs (or whatever this is [1],[2]) like "firefox-help" a domain name if the base url is empty.
