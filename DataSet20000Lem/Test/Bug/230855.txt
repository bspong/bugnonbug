Firebird crash if Thunderbird is trying to fetch a pgp key and a new tab is created into firebird

When I have Thunderbird 0.4 trying to fetch a pgp key from a source that it
cannot reach (being behind a firewall), I can't open any new tab nor access the
recent url cache on the location bar. This seems to think for a moment and then
the browser just crashes, but thunderbird continues to function.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open firebird 0.7 and thunderbird 0.4
2. open a pgp signed mail for which you don't have the key and you cannot either
reach a pgpserver that otherwise would have it.
3. open a new tab in firebird and attempt to open a new url

Actual Results:
Firebird always crashes. Once thunderbird ha finished it's attempt to fetch
the pgp key and is showing the mail without having confirmed the signatures,
firebird experience no more of these problems.

Expected Results:
firebird should remain stable.

Gentoo Linux newest version, with x86 stable selection, not unstable. Kernel
