Add a Keyword for this Search doe not warn on duplicate
Here are 3 scenario where I see a bug in the Keyword logic:


1) Using Manage Search Engines, set a keyword "g" for google search. Set a keyword for a search box on a webpage by right clicking and selecting "Add a Keyword for this Search". Add the keyword "g". Now go back to Manage Search Engines and you will see that your keyword for Google search is now gone. Typing "g foo" into the location bar will not take you to google, but to the website you set the keyword.

2) Using Manage Search Engines, set a keyword "g" for google search. Now set the same keyword for yahoo search. There is no warning that the keyword is already in use, and the keyword is NOT set for yahoo.

3) Set a keyword for a search box on a webpage by right clicking and selecting "Add a Keyword for this Search". Add a keyword "g". Now go to Manage Search Engines and try to add the keyword "g" for google. There is no warning that the keyword is already in use and the keyword is NOT set for google.

It look like there is code for prompting an alert saying "You have chosen a keyword that is currently in use by a bookmark. Please select another." Either there is a bug in this code, or it is not complete yet.

Here are reference to the files:

I observe this behavior using both firefox 8 and the nightly build from mozilla-central. Thanks!
