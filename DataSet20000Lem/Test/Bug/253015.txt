changing search engine doesn't set focus to search box

When a user change the search engine it is typically to either run a different
seach on an existing term, or just before changing the text to something else.
Either way it is desirable to have the focus on the search box, and the currect
search term highlighted.

Version 0.7 did exhibit this expected behaviour, but 0.8+ seems to have this
bug. The first time the engine is changed the expected behaviour is found, but
not thereafter.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox
2. type text in quicksearch box
3. Click in page to transfer focus
4. Use mouse to change search engine
5. Click in page to transfer focus
6. Use mouse to change search engine again
Actual Results:
Focus is not changed back to the search box.

Expected Results:
Search box get the focus, and text becomes highlighted.

I have also reproduced these result on a different computer (Win2k) with a
clean install of the most recent nightly build on 2004-07-24.

if implemented would make this moot. However, I think the behaviour outlined
here is preferable.
