Address Bar Scrolling Failure.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5

The address bar ha an arrow that drop down a list of previously entered sites. In the past, this list ha been fully scrollable.

Since upgrading to the latest update, I have found this function no longer exists; the browser limit the list to the last 12 site viewed, even though there is a week's worth of site in my search history. They also appear in no particular order (ie, not in the order visited).

Thinking it may be a conflict with an older theme, I changed my theme to the default of the most current version of Firefox. This did not alter the situation, apart from making all the browser's button look exceedingly ugly.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox.
2.Visit a few websites.
3.Pull down the arrow on the navigation address bar. Observe the total lack of a scroll bar adjacent to said list.
4.Weep over the loss of critical functionality like every other internet junkie in the 'verse.
Actual Results:
No scroll bar. Much swearing and weeping on the keyboard ensued.

Expected Results:
An ability to scroll through the previous url in the address bar drop menu.

I tested this on three themes: Firefox2 Reloaded, Default 3.0.5, and Classic Compact 3.0.9. This function failed on all three.

Computer wa shutdown and rebooted; error in browser persisted.
