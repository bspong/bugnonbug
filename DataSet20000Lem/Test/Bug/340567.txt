On dragging out a selection through a block of text in a web page, expanding this selection to include a JPEG or PNG will cause the area the image wa in to render the same a another area of the web page, but with the bluing of an image selection. GIFs also behave in this manner on the Firefox Start page, but not on any other site I've looked at.

Reviewing the area of text selected in the misrendering lead me to believe that the mis-rendering remains stating at the point where the image became selected until the image is deselected, though moving the cursor through the image area seems to re-render the image area yet again, in an area closer to the image. Upon deselection the image reverts to normal.

This problem appears on several website but I discovered it on the Wikipedia page for "Cable-stayed bridge".. I've not found an example of an inline SVG to test out.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View a page containing both text and inline images, ex., "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable-stayed_bridge".
2. Starting in a text area, click and drag a selection to also include one or more of the images.

Actual Results:
Images will appear to shift in position or another area of the page entirely will appear in their place; the selection bluing appears over this.

Expected Results:
The image should be rendered exactly the same a during page load, but with the bluing. No other area of the website should be displayed where an image should be.

There wa no crashing or other outwardly displayed error associated with this issue. I have reproduced this error on at least two systems.
