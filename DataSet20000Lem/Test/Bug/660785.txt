Tabs are always restored at startup after closing in Private Browsing mode

If you exit FF in Private Browsing mode, restarting ha the same effect a exiting Private Browsing from the menu: pre-Private Browsing tab are restored. This occurs even if a user ha selected "Show a blank page" or "Show my home page" (as opposed to "Show my window and tab from last time") a the option for "When Firefox starts".

Restoring tab when exiting Private Browsing is sensible, but start-up behavior should be the same whether Firefox wa closed in regular or Private Browsing mode. If a user ha "Show my window and tab from last time" enabled, Firefox should (and does) restore the pre-Private session when Firefox is restarted. But if the user ha enabled "Show my home page", the home page should be shown, not the tab from the previous non-private session. Users can always restore tab with "Restore Previous Session" in the History menu if they need to. But if a user close the browser (rather than exiting Private Browsing via the menu), then Firefox should close both the private session and the suspended non-private session unless a user ha selected to have session restored at each startup.
