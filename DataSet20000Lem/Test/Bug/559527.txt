I can't find anything quite like this on searching for 'form read only' ...

I run a number of web sites, most of which have some form submission on them. In particular, the one linked here is an OS Commerce application. Users with FireFox are having trouble with the form in that they suddenly become read only and will not submit. Looking at the server logs, it obvious from the page sequence when this happens and occurrence go back at least six months.

It ha only happened to me once late last year and nothing would get the form to work. The solution at the time wa to unload and reload FF and all wa okay. I've never been able to repeat it since much a I've tried once I realised it wasn't just on my machine. I haven't seen the problem with any other browser such a Chrome, Opera, IE7/8 and Safari on on any of the other four PCs and the iMac I have here.

Nothing on the initial form load will respond - everything is read only and there's no cursor. Javascript availability shouldn't be a problem a the page is coded to work with and without it.

The same problem affect other form on the site - contact, logon etc. However, it seems to have got much worse lately - it happened four time yesterday and I've had to put a notice up for FF user to try and tell them how to get round it - using another browser seems to be the best way. This is getting to be a PITA and my client is understandably upset at losing sale when people just give up.

It may of course be due to an addon at the user end but that I cannot tell.

AFAICT, it afflicts user of FF 3.5/3.6 on Windows machine but since I cannot reproduce it, I can't be sure that is all.

Any help would be appreciated of course.

I can't give any sequence to repeat the problem I'm afraid - other than load the above page and see what happens. It only ever seems to fail completely - i.e, if the text box are usable everything work from then on, else it's just in read only mode.

I've classed this is Critical since it's a total loss of functionality.
