When I go into manage bookmark I am not able to either drag and drop or cut and paste bookmarks, sometime it might let me put one in the wrong place and then it reappears elsewhere anyway. It is -- and I am not exaggerating -- 100% impossible to manage bookmark in Firefox in any meaningful way. It wa no problem before 1.5 came along. I have thousand of multifoldered bookmark I have been collecting and using since June 1997, so this is a major bug for me. I would be happy to provide you with any needed detail (gregbosco@gmail.com); sorry if this is not the level of specificity you wanted, but I am not a computer guru.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.hightlight (or cut) a bookmark
2. drag (or paste) into a new folder or location
3. watch it neither not appear or appear in the wrong place

Actual Results:
My bookmark folder, instead of becoming more organized, becomes significantly more disorganized.

Expected Results:
I'd like to be able to drag and drop or cut and paste bookmark the way I used to in pre 1.5 Firefox (which I've been using since December 2004) or Netscape (which I used from June 1997 until January 2005). I know what I am doing. It just doesn't work now.

The ability to manage bookmark is a major feature in my book, so I chose that severity level. I have also purchased duct tape and plastic just in case :)
