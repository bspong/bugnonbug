If you go to http://wtfpeople.com/ (for example) and middle-click on the white
iframe section in the middle of the page, the autoscroll icon appears (as
expected), however niether moving the mouse up or down scroll the page.
To scroll using auto-scroll, you've got to middle-click elsewhere on the page.

I believe this is because you are middle-clicking in an iframe, so the scrolling
only occurs in the iframe, and a all the content is already visible, no
scrolling occurs in the iframe (because none is required to see any more content).

Although this is (i guess) the proper behaviour for autoscroll, it not quite
what the user expects.
The user expects to be able to middle-click anywhere on a page, move the mouse
up/down and have the page scroll.

If nessecary, im sure i can make a simplified testcase of the problem.

(I'm not quite sure whether this should be an RFE or not, so ive filed it a
trivial for now. sorry if thats wrong)
