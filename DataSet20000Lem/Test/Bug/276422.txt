"firefox -chrome [...]/bookmarksManager.xul" can't use default profile
I am writing a separate program that launch the browser's bookmark manager.
For epiphany, it's a simple "epiphany -b". For firefox (or mozilla), a per
http://kb.mozillazine.org/index.phtml?title=Chrome_URLs, I tried
"firefox -chrome
chrome://browser/content/bookmarks/bookmarksManager.xul" and it work
great... provided that I don't already have an instance of firefox up and
running.

If I already have a firefox window open, then it will ask me to pick a
profile, because "the default profile is already in use". This doe not
seem to happen on Windows.

If I remove the "-chrome" so that it's just "firefox
chrome://browser/content/bookmarks/bookmarksManager.xul" then it doesn't
ask me to chose my profile (but the bookmark manager UI is then
embedded inside the usual firefox window, which is unacceptable).


Bugfix request is to allow "firefox -chrome
chrome://browser/content/bookmarks/bookmarksManager.xul" to be able to use the
already-in-use default profile.

I don't know if this is a bug in the bookmarksManager XUL, but there wasn't a
bugzilla component for Profile Management or Chrome, so I filed it under Bookmarks.

If it matters, I am running Firefox 1.0 on Fedora Core 3 Linux.
