Add-ons: No Updates Found message not accessible
Test environment:
Windows XP, Firefox 2 (Bon Echo) build 20060804
screen reader: Window-Eyes or JAWS

Description:
When the "Find Updates" button is selected in the Add-ons dialog, and no update are available, the message "No update were found" is displayed a text within the Add-ons dialog, instead of a pop-up message. The screen reader do not announce the message, a it is buried in the middle of the dialog window. For that same reason, it is nearly impossible for a blind user to know the message even exists.

Steps to recreate:
1. Start a screen reader (JAWS or Window-Eye)
2. Start Firefox
3, Open the Add-ons dialog (press Alt+T, then "A" to open Add-ons)
4. Press Tab until the "Find Updates" button ha focus, and press Enter.
5. Note the message "No update were found." is inserted into the dialog, between the Extensions/Themes graphic at the top and the list of installed extension. (This assume that there are no update available for the installed add-ons.)
6. Note that the screen reader doe not speak the update message.
7. Press Tab (or any other keyboard navigation keys) to try to focus on the update message. The message is NOT part of the tab ring.
8. The only way for a blind user to be aware of the existence of this message is to read the entire dialog from top to bottom, or randomly search the dialog for the message text.

Expected results:
The screen reader should automatically read the message when it is displayed.
