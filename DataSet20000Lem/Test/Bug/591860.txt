Several time now, while downloading a web page using "Save Page As" and choosing "Web Page, Complete", if the download fails to complete and I later hit the "Retry" option in the download manager, it only downloads the web page a HTML only, a if I choose "Web Page, HTML Only". I.E., it doe not download external content (images, etc), or create the *savefilename*_files/* directory and file of external/additional content.

I do not know if this is a problem with Firefox, the download manager, or even if it's one of my add-ons/extensions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Not able to reproduce a I am not able to force a download failure (tried to download a page with network cable unplugged--it seems to just save from the cache instead of failing..)
Actual Results:
Page saved a HTML only instead of complete web page.

Expected Results:
Ideally, it should "remember" if the download wa specified a "Web Page, HTML Only" or "Web Page, Complete", and when retrying (or resuming?), download external content/resources accordingly.

Not even sure this is really a "bug" or just a program design failure.. In the download manager, it may just queue the HTML file, not the HTML file and all related external resources. So when I hit "Retry", it correctly and faithfully retries ONLY the HMTL file that wa queued, and ha no way of knowing to download the "complete" web page.
