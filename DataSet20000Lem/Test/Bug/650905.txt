In FF 4.0, Thunderbird is listed in Edit>Preferences>Applications>Mailto a "use thunderbird (default)" yet clicking an e-mail link doe nothing.

In Edit>Preferences>Applications>Mailto, thunderbird is shown a default but it is dead. It also show Gmail and Yahoo!mail a selection and they both work but they are not external mail apps. Clicking below that list on Application Details would only show the Gmail and Yahoo a possible selection without the default T-bird included. I clicked on "Use Other" and selected /usr/bin/thunderbird with the box checked to use this app alwaysand this provided a working solution. It is shown a added to the list. Clicking an e-mail in Firefox now properly brings up a T-bird Write window with e-mail address inserted properly. So, the solution in Firefox to provide the proper default should be simple, I hope.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure Thunderbird is installed a the active mail program.
2. Open a page in Firefox with an e-mail address, eg., a Craigslist listing.
3. Click on the e-mail address to inquire about the listing. See Details.
Actual Results:
Before I made a new Thunderbird link in Edit>Preferences>Applications>Mailto, clicking an e-mail address in Firefox would do nothing.

Expected Results:
It should have opened a Thunderbird Write window with address already in place.

As stated above, since it wa easy to setup a correctly working entry in Edit>Preferences>Applications>Mailto, it should be easy to correct the dead link of "Thunderbird (default)".
