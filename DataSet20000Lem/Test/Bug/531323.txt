Firefox Crashes when I attempt to download file after previously uploading files.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 ImageShackToolbar/5.2.3

Basically, when I upload files, such a youtube videos, or any other kind of data, something happens in Firefox that cause it to crash in the event I attempt some kind of download afterward. This ha been happening on XP, Vista, and now Windows 7 (All 32-Bit).

A recent case is when I attempted to download an mp3 after I had just uploaded a picture to Imageshack.us

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Upload a file (Such a an image to photobucket or imageshack)
2. Proceed to download a file (A Direct download of any kind.)
3. Firefox will crash for unknown reason.
Actual Results:
Firefox crashes, and asks me to either quit, or restart the program.

Expected Results:
The download should start.

I initially believed it to be an issue with the Foxlinks and Imageshack Add-ons, but I've experienced this problem without them (or other add-ons) installed.
