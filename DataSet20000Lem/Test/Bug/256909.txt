FF09x still crash on my system once a while [@ nsMappedAttributes::Equals ]
E.g. see these two talkback IDs:

TB587096Z
TB587720M

They are both crashing in exactly the same line of code. But what I don't
understand is: There seems to not even be any code in the line causing the
crash! Or am I too stupid to read the crash reports?

It say "nsMappedAttributes.cpp, line 175", but there is no code in line 175,
it's a blank line. Or doe the crash in fact happen at "nsHTMLStyleSheet.cpp,
line 484"?

If so, should we CC to karnaze, a he last modified the code?

I'm just starting to understand the talkback system and I just started looking
at the browser code (after just being a user of Mozilla and later Firefox for
year now). I'm not a C++ programmer (I know very little about it), but I have a
degree in Java programming and did some serios C programming (only for Unix in
general and BSD in particular, but there even down to writing my own network
kernel extension), and I know about six other programming language, so I hope I
can pick up C++ rather quickly.

And if something crashes, I'd really like to find out why and maybe inform the
right person about my suspicion and how he may be able to fix it. Because every
error or bug is forgivable, excepy a crash. A crash is a serious showstopper.

And we have plenty of these. Take a look here:

What is meant by "Breakpoint hit"? Is there a debugger break point? Why doe
this cause a crash then? Or is it like a failing assertion? It's in a DLL
without source code, so how can we know what triggered the crash?


These crash seem to happen all very randomly and usually not during the page
loading process, but either when I try to close a tab or when I just scroll down
the page.
