Installing Firefox1.5 RC 3 give "There is no disk in the drive." error when selecting install drive

Just installed Firefox 1.5rc3.

When doing a custom install, and selecting the drive and folder into which to install, firefox generates this error (from a ctrl-c on the error dialog box to copy it's exact contents):
---------------------------
setup.exe - No Disk
---------------------------
There is no disk in the drive. Please insert a disk into drive \Device\Harddisk3\DR29.
---------------------------
Cancel Try Again Continue
---------------------------

Clicking "try again" give the same error. Clicking "Cancel" go to the next drive. Clicking continue go to the next drive (i.e. behaves same a "Cancel").

There are 4 card-readers on this machine (SD/MMC, MD, SMC, and MS), and the error is generated for all 4 disks, and only the device that ha the error change (e.g. to "\Device\Harddisk5\DR31"). Therefore I have to assume this error relates to the card-reader disk (which are becoming increasingly common). The error is generated by scrolling up and scrolling up and down the list of available drive under "My computer". At no point wa one of these 4 card-reader drive selected - simply having them appear in the list of disk wa enough.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox1.5 Rc 3 on a machine with card-reader disks.
2. Custom install
3. Scroll up and down list of available drive (No need to select any disks).

Actual Results:
No error unless drive is selected.

Expected Results:
Error, even though drive is not selected.

Before you try and dupe this (and the dupe would probably be bug 153377), note that bug 153377 ha already been marked a FIXED around April 2005, and this is from November 2005, seven month _after_ that bug wa fixed. (i.e. if it you think it is a dupe of a bug fixed seven month ago, then why is it still happening?)
