Cannot Stream Sirius Satelite Radio
This is the letter that I wrote Sirius and their reply. The website indicates
that I need an unknown plug-in.

Thanks...

Dear Sirius Rep:

I prefer the Firefox browser, but I wa only able to get streamed music
through MS Explorer. It appears that I am missing a plug-in? What
plug-in is
required to hear music through other browsers?

Very Respectfully,

JD Kristenson

Dear Joshua,

Thanks, we got your e-mail! We regret that you are experiencing
problem utilizing our streaming player. Below are step you can take
in order to receive your 65 commercial free music channel on
www.SIRIUS.com:

1) In order to ensure that the SIRIUS Player function properly, you
must set your browser to cache page either automatically or to never
cache them at all.

To do this in Internet Explorer, go to your browser's "Tools" menu,
click on "Internet Options," then "Settings," then select "Never" or
"Automatically," click "Apply" and then "Okay." This should resolve the
problem.

For Netscape on Windows, go to your browser's "Edit" menu, choose
"Preferences," select "Advanced," then select "Cache." Under "Compare
the page in the cache to the page on the network" select "Every time I
view the page" for best results".

For Internet Explorer on Mac go to your browser's "Explorer" menu,
choose "Preferences," then click on "Advanced." Under "Update Pages"
select "Always" for best results.

2) If you have Norton Antivirus / Firewall or any other antivirius
program, disable the program.

3) Enable javascript.

4) Make sure you have the updated version of Windows Media Player. Below
is a link where you can upgrade this program:
