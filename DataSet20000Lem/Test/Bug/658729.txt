Bug 574654, which landed in Firefox 4.0, removed browser.tabs.tabMinWidth and browser.tabs.tabMaxWidth in favor of CSS min/max width style rules. As part of this bug, it wa advised to use the custom tab width addon (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/custom-tab-width/) by Dao Gottwald. Other addons like Classic Compact Options (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/classic-compact-options/) followed Dao's suggested model for restoring the ability to customize the min & max width of tab (a feature CCO ha had since FF3.0). Now Bug 465086 ha landed in FF5a2 to stop tab from resizing when tab are closed until the cursor leaf the tab bar. The problem is, the "fix" in bug 465086 stop working if Dao's solution is applied to restore functionality lost because of bug 574654.

Given that bug 574654 and the suggested solution to restore functionality lost in bug 574654 landed first in FF4. The "fix" in bug 465086 need to be reworked to accommodate Dao's min/max width CSS solution.
