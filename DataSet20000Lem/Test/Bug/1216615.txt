1. Switch window to fullscreen mode
2. Open devtools -> inspector, open ruleview/computed view
3. Resize sidebar so that it wa a wide a possible
4. Slowly resize sidebar so that it wa a narrow a possible

Result: Right (end) border of filter field move to the right by ~6px
Expectations: Right (end) border of filter field should be stationary

Note_1: Currently inner input (.devtools-searchinput) ha "margin: 1px 3px;", and .devtools-searchbox (parent element) ha "padding:0px;". Removing margin-left/right from search input and adding the same padding to searchbox solves the issue
Example of CSS which work for me:
> .devtools-searchbox { -moz-padding-start: 3px !important; }
> .devtools-searchbox { -moz-padding-end: 3px !important; }
> .devtools-searchinput { -moz-margin-start: 0px !important; }
> .devtools-searchinput { -moz-margin-end: 0px !important; }

Note_2: The solution introduced in bug 1200073 only cure the symptom (by adding -moz-margin-start:5px to the checkbox in computed view); I believe that code is unnecessary and should be removed
