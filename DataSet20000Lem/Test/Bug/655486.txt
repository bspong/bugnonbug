Session restore from crash always restores after a system shutdown.

Even with browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash set to false, Firefox will reopen my last set of tab if it get killed via the system shutdown command. After reading on the Internet, it seems you guy changed the old way it worked and now I have to instead disable the ability to restore tab in order to completely kill this feature. That's crazy -- I shouldn't have to turn off the ability to undo tab closure just so that certain inappropriate website don't repopulate in my browser every morning. This hasn't embarrassed me in front of others yet... but it's sure to happen!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open URLs in browser tabs.
2. Use the system shutdown command in Ubuntu without first closing Firefox cleanly.
3. Wake up the next morning, open browser.
4. Tabs repopulate with last night's embarrassing browsing experience.

Actual Results:
Tabs reopened with previous browsing experience though I don't ever want the store restore to occur.

Expected Results:
The browser should open on my usual homepage or at least give me the choice to restore my previous session instead of just doing it.
