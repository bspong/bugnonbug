I like the new behaviour of new tab being opened next to current tab but the time-out for additional child tab opened right next to parent is too short.

Example: I'm browsing a shopping site, I sort some product by price. I open two interesting one in new tabs. I pause for a bit and open another new product in new tab. This tab is open right next to parent and not to the right of last child tab. This loos track of order of tab opened. Better behaviour would be to open all child to the right of last child of parent opened or at least make the time-out for opening child to right of parent instead to right of last child longer

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a page with multiple link
2. Open some link in new tab with middle-click
3. Wait for a bit
4. Open aditional links.
Actual Results:
They open next to current tab instead next to last new opened tab.
