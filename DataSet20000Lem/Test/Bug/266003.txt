when i click send link ( at any url ) it open up a new mail in outlook ( my
default mail client ) but when i send the mail nothing happens except that
outlook wont open up - when i investigate using the task mgr i discover that
outlook is running but not running properly a it ha no open window just an
entry in the task manager ( outlook run fine outside of this situation so i
expect the problem is not with outlook ) i have to shut down the crashed copy of
outlook and when i open it again i find that the mail ha not been sent and
there is no record of it in either outbox or sent item

outlook 2000
firefox 1.0 (i have noticed a similar problem in an earlier version of firefox )
window xpsp2



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.outlook 2000 a default mail client
2.open a page say google.com in firefox 1.0
3.click send link and fill out new mail
4 try to open outlook and verify that mail ha been sent

Actual Results:
outlook crashed
mail not sent

Expected Results:
sent the mail
opened up outlook ??
not crashed outlook

i cannot verify for absolute certain that firefox is actually supposed to work
with outlook 2000 a a mail client - but i presume it should !!!!
