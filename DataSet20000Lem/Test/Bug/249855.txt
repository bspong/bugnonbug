I have been trying to control an embeded quicktime using javascript to start,
stop and fetch the frame number of a quicktime movie. Which ever method I try to
use to call the quicktime function I get an error that the function doe not
exist. I have tried the same source code under IE and that appears to work with
at least some of the way of referencing the movie clip.

Example code taken from...

http://developer.apple.com/documentation/quicktime/REF/QT41_HTML/QT41WhatsNew-80.html

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. goto http://www.kenvillines.com/archives/000008.html
2. Click on any of the button to start, stop rwd the clip.
3.

Actual Results:
The clip fails to play and I get error in the javascript console

Expected Results:
play clip

This doe not appear to be a platform specific problem a it fails under v9.0 on
Redhat 9.0 too.

The article http://www.mozillazine.org/articles/article2351.html implies that
this ha worked for some time.
