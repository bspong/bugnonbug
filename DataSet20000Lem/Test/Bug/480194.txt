Whenever the Quick Find bar is visible, many key binding are broken.
PgUp/PgDown don't work (but should apply to the main window). This is rather annoying because one would use these key to begin searching from the top of the document.

When the Find bar (not Quick Find) is visible, then Ctrl-a/Ctrl-e don't work correctly, e.g., when clicking into the Search field (Command-K), C-a should jump to the beginning of the search field. Instead, it seems to manipulate the current find status.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. enable Quick Find in about:config
2. view a website and type something to start Quick Finding
3. (optional:) click into website window to change focus
4. Enter PgUp or Pg Down.

For Find:

1. Command-F, then type something
2. Command-K
3. C-a
Actual Results:
either no or an inappropriate command is executed

Expected Results:
PgUp/Down should move to beginning/end of document. C-a/e should move to beginning/end of text field.

I have not tested any further key binding - I suspect there are more!
