If the Main / Startup option
"When Firefox Starts"
is set to
"Show my window and tab from last time",
then *ALL* FireFox session cooky are preserved between FireFox sessions,
not just those of window and tab open when FireFox shuts down.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set Main / Startup option to "Show my window and tab from last time",
2. Set Cookie option to "Keep Until I Close FireFox"
3. Go to site (e.g. www.bing.com) with cookies. Go to another site.
4. Close Firefox.
5. Start Firefox. View the cookies.
Actual Results:
The "session" cooky for www.bing.com (and any other site visited) have been preserved between sessions.

Expected Results:
Cookies not preserved between sessions. In particular cooky of site not currently opened should not be preserved.

This ha privacy implications. If this is the intended functionality, then the user should be warned when setting "Show my window and tab from last time" that FireFox session will not end when FireFox close and ALL session cooky will be preserved.
