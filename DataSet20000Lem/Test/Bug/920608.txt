I've got these animation working in Safari/Chrome, and have correct vendor prefix for all the css. I'm using Jquery add / remove class event to trigger the animations, and I can see in firebug that the class are changing when I expect them to, but the animation only fire once and then just default to making the panel disappear /reappear without animation.

I apologize if it's bad etiquette to post a stackoverflow post on here -- I'm pretty stumped on this one and suspect it may be a firefox issue with the Jquery add and remove methods.


Actual results:

the issue is the animation fire the first time, but never again, and just default to making the panel disappear and reappear.

Expected results:

the animation should fire every time I call the togglePanel function, a it doe in Safari / Chrome
