Irregular Timeout of tabbrowser.xml
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0
Build ID: 20150525141253

Steps to reproduce:

Uncertain of exact recreation conditions; sometimes happens during longer Mozilla sessions, other time happens within half an hour of use. It seems to be more common when a YouTube video is running in another tab, though that might be just fresher memory of recent events. Only consistency is that it occurs when I attempt to close a tab. I currently have AdBlock Plus 2.6.9.1-signed, ChatZilla 0.9.91.1.1-signed, CoolPreviews 4.6, Download Status Bar 12.3.0.1-signed, and Personas Plus 1.7.3.1-signed installed a extensions. I have OpenH264 Video Codec provided by Cisco Systems, Inc. 1.4, Primetime Content Decryption Module proveded by Adobe Systems, Incorporated 10, Shockwave Flash 17.0.0.188, Unity Player 4.5.5.37569, Adobe Acrobat 11.0.11.18, Google Update 1.3.27.5, Java Deployment Toolkit 8.0.250.18 11.25.2.18, Java(TM) Platform SE 8 U25 11.25.2.18, NVIDIA 3D Vision 7.17.13.4052, NVIDIA 3D VISION 7.17.13.4052, and WacomTabletPlugin 2.1.0.7 installed a plugins. I don't think any of the above extension or plugins are involved, but just in case I figured I should add it in.


Actual results:

Upon close attempt, Firefox stop responding; after a brief pause (~20 seconds, I'd guess), an error pop up stating that chrome://browser/content/tabbrowser.xml:#### stopped working; the exact line number varies, but I've seen it range from 1500-3200 at least. If I choose to continue the script, it fails to continue and the error box return immediately. If I choose to stop the script, then I cannot close any tab (though opening them work fine). I managed to have the browser console open during the last glitch, and it reported the following:

I'm unsure if this is related, but I'm getting repeated version of the following error a well, both in cluster of 4-7 and a repeated individual errors:

Expected results:

Tab close without note.
