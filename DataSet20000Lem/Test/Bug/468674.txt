Failed to connect to internet using Firefox. Internet Explorer Works. Older Firefox version work.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.18) Gecko/20081029 Firefox/2.0.0.18
Build Identifier: Windows Firefox Latest Version 3.04

I downloaded the latest build of Firefox version 3.04. I found that the internal IBM intranet page work fine, but when I try to go outside of the company's firewall, I get a "Failed to Connect" message. Internet Explorer work fine. I downloaded an older version of Firefox version 2.0.0.18 and this work fine. I tried to download version 3.04 again and it still doesn't work so it must be the new build. I am using window XP with an IBM Thinkpad T42p. The problem occured right after I upgraded to version 3.04. Version 3.03 worked fine for me.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install latest Firefox build version 3.04 from firefox.com website.
2. Type yahoo.com or aol.com in url bar.
3. See error message "Failed to connect".
Actual Results:
internet access outside of IBMs intranet firewall doe not work with version 3.04, but doe work with older versions.

Expected Results:
I expected the web page to load correctly, but the new Firefox could not load the page. I had to use internet explorer instead to load the page.
