When the Home or Refresh toolbar button are pressed with something other than
the rightmost tab active, it is the rightmost tab that is affected (home page
loaded or page refreshed).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load multiple page in multiple tabs.
2. Press back and foward a few times. (Not sure if necessary.)
3. Activate something other than the rightmost tab.
4. Press the Home toolbar button.

Actual Results:
The home page is loaded into the rightmost tab, no change in the active tab.

Expected Results:
Home page should be loaded in the active tab.

Clean profile, no extension or themes.

Preference browser.sessionhistory.max_viewers set to 2 (set low hoping problem
would occur more often).

The problem is hard to reproduce. Here are some thing that may or may not be a
factor: used back and forward viewing radar image in
http://www.wunderground.com/US/LA/Baton_Rouge.html; had a page open with Adobe
pdf plugin. (But the affected tab may not be the one displaying a pdf document).
