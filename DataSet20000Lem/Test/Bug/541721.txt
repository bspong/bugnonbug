I wa visiting CarnageBlender.com which us frame and a java chat applet. After surfing around on this site for a bit, I left it open and walked away for a few minutes. When I came back, I saw that the entire browser viewing area had disappeared leaving the status bar nudged up against the bottom of the tab on the screen, with the theme picture covering around 1/3 of the blank space left below, and then empty white space covering most of the screen.

I could see the screen wa maximized, but hitting restore button or minimize didn't see to affect the screen being totally removed from itself. Unfortunately because this bug seemed to happen while I wa away I can't give anymore specific then that. Although, I've left it open on this screen a few times, and it ha happened 2 time in the past day or so that I have had Firefox 3.6 installed.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open browser
2. Open carnageblender.com (involves signing in and opening frames/chat)
3. Click on a couple links, surf around and then leave browser open and walk away for a moment (make sure the fight feed on the sidebar is displaying properly)
Actual Results:
The screen will disappear, only leaving the statusbar nudged up right underneath the tab at the top.

Expected Results:
Performs a intended, the screen should not disappear no matter how long I leave it on a screen with frame and java applet open.
