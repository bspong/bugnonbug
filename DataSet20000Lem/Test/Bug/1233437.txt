Steps to reproduce:

Navigate to google.com, gmail.com, or youtube.com


Actual results:

First I want to mention all problem below are intermittent and don't always happen. I have already tried starting firefox in safe mode and this doe not fix it. I have also tried doing a refresh of firefox and this also doe not fix it. Here are the problems:

On google.com: Page load a expected except Google logo is missing entirely. If I perform a search then in the top left corner of the screen where the logo or doodle should appear just text come up. For example today instead of the logo there is a text link that say "Celebrating Ludwig van Beethoven's 245th Year Doodle". If I right click on the link and select view image a blank white page load with no image.

On youtube or gmail.com: Again the youtube or gmail logo don't load and additionally some button such a the search button to the right of the youtube search bar don't show any text. It is just a blank grey square. The happens to a number of button in gmail also. Finally sometimes youtube video thumbnail load fine, but sometimes they are just a tiny black horizontal line. If I ctrl-F5 to refresh the page usually the thumbnail load properly after the refresh.

I have included a PDF with screen shot of all issue except gmail because at the moment gmail is working properly. If it start to not load button icon I will update this bug with an image.


Expected results:

All pictures, thumbnails, and logo should load on every page.
