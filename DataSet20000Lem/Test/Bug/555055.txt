Log-in problem with some websites, but mostly www.linkedin.com

When I attempt to log-in to my LinkedIn account, Firefox get stuck in a loop and doe not actually transmit the log-in and password to the website. If I use internet explorer I can access the LinkedIn website without difficulty.

This happened with another website, but only temporarily. However the problem with the LinkedIn website persists. I have emptied the cache, deleted cooky etc, but still it remains.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to LinkedIn website (www.linkedin.com)
2. Insert log-in and password
3. Click on "enter"
4. Repeat the step above 3 or 4 time
5. Use Internet Explorer
Actual Results:
Prior to step 5, I get stuck in a loop of "register or log-in" and "log-in". Naturally, I choose the "log-in" option from the former a I already have a LinkedIn account.

Expected Results:
At the "register or Log-in" stage, I should be able to log in to my own LinkedIn profile.
