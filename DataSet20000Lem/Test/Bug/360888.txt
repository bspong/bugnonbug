Hyperlink click recognition too sensitive -- moving the cursor even a pixel cancel the click

I often wa wondering why FF didn't recognize me clicking a Hyperlink. Now I know the reason: While having the mouse button pressed, if the mouse pointer move just one pixel before releasing the mouse button again, the click is interpreted a selecting text! (Equalling a "NULL" text marker range [= selecting no text]).

This is very annoying. IMHO, Firefox should interpret a click a a click even if a reasonably small amount of mouse movement occurs during the mouse button being pressed.

A reasonable measurement might be the trigger to change the text marker range.

Text Marker Range: The area of canvas being selected when dragging the mouse while having the left mouse button clicked.

So: Click should be interpreted a click until at least one character (or other inline element) is displayed inversed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move mouse to a Hyperlink
2. Press left mouse button and keep pressed
3. Move mouse pointer a few pixel while keeping it within the character you've initially chosen for your click
4. Release mouse button
Actual Results:
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:
The hyperlink should be followed.
