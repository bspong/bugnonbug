Firefox nightly crash immediately on startup in ntdll.dll
Firefox crash immediately on start-up. No crash submission dialog appears, so I have no crash IDs to show.

1. Start Firefox nightly.
2. Firefox immediately crash with a dialog that says:

Nightly

A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Please close the program.

[ Close the program ]

There is a Firefox process running, but it is only using around 1.5 MB of RAM.

Trying to launch Firefox in Safemode or Profile Manager result in the same immediate crash. The only way to make Firefox work is to start Windows in Windows Safemode.

I tried renaming the ../Mozilla/ folder in my User Profile to different thing but the crash still occurs, so I'm pretty sure this crash is unrelated to my profile.

Another person ha reported the same problem at Mozillazine @ http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=13376663#p13376663
