Integrated security authenticates against OLD password (changed several hour ago)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.7) Gecko/2009021910 Firefox/3.0.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.7) Gecko/2009021910 Firefox/3.0.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

We have a development site secured using Integrated security in IIS.

I recently changed my password. Both the new and old password now authenticate properly against the server. I'm not sure if this is a Mozilla or Microsoft problem, but thought I'd start here.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to integrated security website, login
2. Change your password, wait.
3. Browse to website protected by integrated security, login, with old OR new password.
Actual Results:
Authenticates whether using new or old password against IIS 6.0 integrated security website.

Expected Results:
Old password shouldn't authenticate.

I've killed all my browser-specific settings, caches, etc. Rebooted. Tried to make this NOT work, but it seems to work every time.

I'm not convinced that it's a problem from Mozilla or Microsoft's. However, I see this a a pretty significant security flaw.

As a side note, password several month old do not authenticate. Only the password I have changed recently (today, more than 3-hours ago).

I'll be happy to help identify the problem. idahoboy@gmail.com
