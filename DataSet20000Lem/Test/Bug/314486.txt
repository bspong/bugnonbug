Submitting form with method POST from one character set to another show target page in original page's character set.

I have a form on a page with character set:
Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8

and View -> Character Encoding -> UTF-8


I submit the form using POST to an external page (in this case, a bank e-payment website), the bank responds like this:

HTTP/1.x 200 Document follows

Content-Type: text/html


which may be wrong, not specifying the charset. but it's the bank so I can't change it.

Firefox display the site a UTF-8 even though it's ISO-8859-1

If I specify a hidden parameter named _charset_, Firefox automatically set it to UTF-8 and there is no way to override it.

utf-8 is automatically appended to accepted charset in the form:
Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7


If I manually set Character encoding to ISO-8859-1 before submitting then target page display in ISO-8859-1.

If I use GET method, then target page display in ISO-8859-1 even though original page wa in UTF-8.

IE work a expected.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Specify a form on a page with character encoding set to UTF-8
2. Submit the form to a page with no character set specified using POST method


Actual Results:
Form "action" is displayed using UTF-8.

Expected Results:
Form "action" is displayed in actual charset.

Using GET work and the Finnish bank accept it.
