I am switching from konqueror to firefox and one of feature I miss are the
'clear' button for the location bar.

The way I typically use any browser is that I select a URL in some application,
so that it get copied into the clipboard. Then I bring up a browser instance or
switch to one already present. Now I need to clear the location bar before
pasting the new URL into it. But the moment I select existing URL to delete it,
the one I saved in the clipboard is overwritten. Then I have to go back to the
app and select the URL again and then paste it into firefox's location bar !

If firefox ha a 'Clear Location Bar' button to the left of the location bar,
then it would enhance it usability. You could make if optional if you guy
think not enough people use it.

If you want to look at this feature in actionm kindly look at 'konqueror'. It
ha a button that look like 'x' (meaning clear, i suppose) at the left of the
location/address bar.
