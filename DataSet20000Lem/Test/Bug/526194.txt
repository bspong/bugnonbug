Switching in/out of Private Browsing mode too fast will restore window ton of time and freeze/crash the browser [@ nsXULDocument::ResumeWalk | nsXULDocument::OnStreamComplete]
Found by running the Mozmill test with Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 ID:20091102134505

Users who turn off the warning when switching into Private Browsing mode can enter/leave the PB mode really quick by holding down the Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P keys. If another window have been opened before those will be restored multiple times. Holding down the key for about 3-4s will hang/freeze Firefox for a long time with a high cpu load and completely fill the memory. After a couple of minute waiting I get the warning that the virtual memory minimum limit is too low. The only way to close the browser is to kill the process via the task manager.

After a couple of try the browser crashed now. There are failure with sending the report and those are not listed under about:crashes afterward. I will try to get it into the debugger instead.

Starting Firefox again with the same profile will result in the same state because session restore want to restore all of the >100 window again.

Steps:
1. Start the browser and start the Private Browsing mode
2. Uncheck the checkbox so the PB mode will be started immediately
3. Leave the Private Browsing mode
4. Hold down Cmd/Crtl+Shift+P for about 3-4s (or longer to get the crash)
