Firefox render this site http://southerngolfclub.com.au/welcome/index.mhtml and then show Upgrade of Flash Player required. However the latest Adobe Flash Player 10 is already installed on PC. Unable to log in to Members zone and make golf booking after correct password is entered. Previous Version of Firefox worked well. I have resorted to using Opera 10 and MS IE7 to get into this site and make golf tee time bookings, both these browser work well with this site !
Hope you can fix this, Firefox is the best browser !
