Adobe Acrobat fails to open a PDF containing a scanned document using Firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I have tried to open PDFs containing scanned document that have been OCR'd using Firefox 3.5.3 and Adobe Reader 9.2.0. The PDFs will not open. If I try to open normal PDFs generated by Acrobat or Word, they work fine. For example: http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/AST/BOHofSDAs.pdf#view=fit open without a problem.

When I tried to open http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/MIN/MIN1928-01.pdf#view=fit with other browser (using Adobe Reader 9.2.0 a the plugin), such a IE8 #8.0.6001.18702 it worked just fine. Opera 10.00 worked just fine a well. Chrome 3.0.195.27 unfortunately would NOT open the PDF.

Of interesting note, when I have Foxit Reader a my PDF plugin # 3.1.1.0928, then I can read the above PDF just fine using Firefox.

Considering all of the above, it appears that the communication between the browser and the plugin is the issue, since it work just fine in IE and Opera.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Firefox 3.5.3 and Adobe Reader 9.2.0
2. Browse to http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/MIN/MIN1928-01.pdf#view=fit
3.
Actual Results:
The PDF is not viewable. It appears that the "open" request just hangs, and then produce a blank screen on the browser. Sometimes on similar URL's I would see a "Expected a dict object" error message displayed.

Expected Results:
The PDF should be viewable.

It is also of value to note that my scanned image are often using JBIG2 compression for Bitonal images, and JPG2000 for Color images. They are produced using JRAPublish.
