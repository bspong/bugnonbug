Hi...

my issue is the following...
i have been using firefox for the past two years..

then i updated it regularly when ever a new version wa availabe.... till firefox 3.0...
there wa no issue till today.. i.e 3rd july 2008...
today morning when i loaded firefox, it didn't open.. i tried restarting the system and still it didn't work..
when i checked the task manager's process tab i found a process "firefox.exe" running... but the window itself would not open...
i tried uninstalling and again re-installing firefox 3.... still the same..
but then, i installed the old version i.e firefox 1.5.0.7, it's working fine...
