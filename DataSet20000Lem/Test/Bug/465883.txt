Please read this bug carefully, otherwise you may miss the point.

Ever since bug 225680, there have been random case of the left-most tab of any given window being stuck and incapable of being closed. Disabling a certain extension will solve it, possibly only temporarily, however, it is difficult to identify any given extension a a culprit.

Another person experiencing the same problem state that the solution is to close Minefield and delete sessionstore.js, but that the problem is happening more frequently: ref: http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=5031605#p5031605

When the stuck tab situation occurs, the following exception appears in Error Console:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIWebProgress.removeProgressListener]" nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)" location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/tabbrowser.xml :: _beginRemoveTab :: line 1509" data: no]

The step to reproduce, included here, provides a way to use an extension to trigger the bug. These step are for one-time triggering the bug and will not achieve the persistent condition that would require deleting sessionstore.js. To reproduce afterward, you will need to either create a new profile and run through the step again, or install an additional extension and restart

With my regular profile, I personally experience the persistent scenario (i.e. where restarting doe not solve the problem and only disabling extension or possibly deleting sessionstore.js would allow the tab to finally be closed).

And finally, when this bug occurs, the tab is itself usable; only it cannot be closed.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new profile
2. Go to Tools -->Options... -->Main and configure startup to "Show my window and tab from last time"
3. Restart Minefield
4. LEAVE THE FIRST TWO TABS ALONE (don't change or close them)
5. Install Nightly Tester Tools: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6543
6. Restart Minefield
7. Go to about:config and set value of general.useragent.extra.firefox to Firefox/3.0.4
8. Install Smart Middle Click: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3885
9. Restart Minefield
10. Notice that the throbber on the left-most tab is spinning indefinitely
11. Click that left-most tab's close button. Notice that the tab doe not close
12. Open Error Console and scroll to the bottom. Notice the following exception:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIWebProgress.removeProgressListener]" nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)" location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/tabbrowser.xml :: _beginRemoveTab :: line 1509" data: no]
