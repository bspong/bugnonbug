Test the effect of switching Australis selected tab curve from clip-paths to SVG curve with and without caching
On all three platforms, the selected tab is drawn a follows:

1) Fill the tab-background-start::before, tab-background-middle, tab-background-end::before element with -moz-dialog a a background-color
2) Apply a linear-gradient on top of those elements. That linear-gradient doe not use any system colours.
3) Clip the tab-background-start::before and tab-background-end::before element to the curve shape using an SVG clip-path
4) Put a tab stroke image on top of the tab-background-start::before, tab-background-middle, tab-background-end::before elements.

Bug 921038 is exploring moving the linear-gradient from step 2 into the image of step 4.

According to the Graphics team, clip-path might not be our best option here. Every pixel that might be drawn in the layer with clip-paths need to check to see whether or not they're within the clipped region. This is expensive - especially for thing like the tab label.

Graphics ha suggested we switch back to our original approach of drawing the selected tab curve with SVG. This, coupled with the SVG caching in bug 764299, could supply u with a nice all-around TART win.
