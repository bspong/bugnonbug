DevTools CSS Rules Inspector incorrectly collapse list-valued property whose list entry are only separated by CSS comment (sometimes changing valid value into invalid ones)
Created attachment 8784607
testcase 1

STR:
1. Load attached testcase.
2. Inspect any of the three line of text, in the CSS "Rules" view.
3. Compare to the "computed style" view to see what actually took effect.

ACTUAL RESULTS:
- The "rules" view show the original author-provided styles, with the comment removed, which convert e.g. 1/*ThisIsAComment*/2; into "12", and "5px/**/0/**/0/**/20px/**/;" into "5px0020px".
- It also strike out the last one ("5px0020px") a being invalid CSS, despite the fact that the actual declaration (with CSS comments) *does* parse successfully and doe get honored, a you can see in the rendering & the computed-style view.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- The "rules" view should preserve CSS comment inside of a CSS property's value. Or, it should collapse them away to "/**/", if needed. Or replace them with a blank space -- that would be fine with these properties, at least, though I'm not sure if it's fine in general.


For comparison, Chrome preserve the comment in their entirety, in it equivalent of our DevTools "CSS Rules" view.
