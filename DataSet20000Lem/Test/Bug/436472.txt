I am currently using mozilla on both my desktop and laptop (HP Compaq nc8430) on the desktop it is working fine however on the lap top when I try to open a link to a PDF file or a JPEG, in the bottom left corner of the page "waiting for website" message appears but alternate with a "stopped" message. This carry on until a "timeout" message is received or "problem loading page" message. When I used the 'other' web browser (explorer) to open the same file it open perfectly. I have tried different web link at different time but the result is always the same. I have also tried uninstalling and reinstalling Mozilla but end up with the same result. I am not a fan of the 'other' web browser and would much prefer to use yours so please can you help.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.type in Google search
2.find link to PDF, JPEG ect
3.click on link



Sometime if you go off the tab the file will load but have limited features, such a picture zoom doe not work
