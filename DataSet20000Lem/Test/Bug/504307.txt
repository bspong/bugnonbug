Hi.
At a moment my site crashed. FF showed a 501 Method Not Implemented error.
I called the company that host the site, they admitted it wa a problem and they repaired it.

However, since them FF keep showing the same error page (Method Not Implemented) even if the site is working now. I have tried with IE 6 then I asked a friend from a different country to try.
He confirmed that IE 8 and Chrome properly display the web site.

I have tried to reset the cache, the browser, Windows. I have also tried to run FF in safe mode. After two days, the error is still there.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Happens every time I access the web site but only for me :(

1. Visit any URL of http://www.bionixwallpaper.com (including the forum) or direct link to a picture from the web site (like http://www.bionixwallpaper.com/favicon.ico)
Actual Results:
Method Not Implemented

GET to /favicon.ico not supported.

Additionally, a 404 Not Found error wa encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.


Expected Results:
Valid home page or any other page requested
