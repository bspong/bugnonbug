When I use the context menu "Save link as..." item to download a file the resulting request doe not have the Cookie: header set. (checked using burp logging proxy) The consequence is that file which are protected by any cookie based authentication do not download properly.

This doe not occur at all when browsing normally.

I have tested this using FF 3.0.10 on Windows XP Pro and it doe not have the same issue but some Vista user at my client site have reported the same problem. I won't link to the site because it is NSFW but I have confirmed this issue on other site too (see below)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any site which set a cookie such a http://news.bbc.co.uk
2. CTRL Click on a link and select "Save link as..."
3.
Actual Results:
Request is sent missing the Cookie: header

Expected Results:
Request should be sent including the cookie header
