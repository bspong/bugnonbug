proto handler dialog need a11y love

Screen Shot of Mac UI

The Application selector is still missing icon for each application, and when it first run it come up too small such that the OK and Cancel button are trimmed off.

The dialog is resizable, yes, but it should first appear to be the proper size.

Also (judging from the DOM Inspector), it appears that we are missing an Access Key for the "Remember this selection" checkbox.

Should this be three bugs, or can both these thing be tracked here?

== Steps to Reproduce ==
1. Open Minefield.
2. Click on this link: webcal://info.vassar.edu/calendar/calendars/campuscalendar.ics
3. Note the state of the application selector dialog.

== Expected Behaviors ==
* There are icon for the Applications (at least default icon at this point)
* The dialog is the proper size
* Proper Access key are included for all part of the dialog (looks like they are used everywhere else, except the "Remember this" checkbox).

== Actual ==
* Neither of these ar true.

Attaching a screen shot of the UI.

If we are going to publicize our handler-test.mozilla.org website, and invite more people to experience this dialog, then I think we should really try to fix these issue for M9.
