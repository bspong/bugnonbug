I have been heavily recommending Firefox with Google toolbar. One major reason is FireFox 1.5 with Google toolbar spell check is superior to Blogger post editor built-in toolbar even after Blogger upgrade to New Blogger. On the encouragement of an IT savy blogger, I upgraded to 2.0 and found out to my horror the Firefox 2.0 Google toolbar no longer works. I can no longer download Firefox 1.5 anywhere, not even on a download page that say "Download Firefox 1.5". Now I have to edit all my post which recommend Firefox with Google toolbar which mention the advantage of it spell check :-(

I have asked Google AdSense support before when will their Firefox referral download FireFox 2.0 rather than 1.5 and wa told that when that happens, we will be informed. So since we were not informed, I assume that by uninstalling Firefox 2.0 and reinstalling Firefox via Google AdSense referrals, I would get 1.5. I did that by via Google Pack which among others, include FireFox. Unfortunately, even that resulted in getting Firefox 2.0

I shall copy this bug report and send it to Google AdSense support and see what is their response.

Note: I checked the spell check in the Internet Explorer Google toolbar and found that that work with Blogger post editor.
