Using Firefox to display Oracle Reports worked in 1.5.0.5. Doesn't work in 1.5.0.6.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 ( Firefox/1.5.0.6)

I use Firefox to run Oracle Forms and Reports. For the Reports I generate an Adobe pdf file which display on my terminal. With Firefox 1.5.0.6 the pdf file flash on my screen for a split-second then knock me out of Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I connect to an Oracle menu on our Applications Server
2. I select an Oracle report which when run will display the report in pdf format on my monitor.
3. The report flash on the screen for a split-second and I'm exited out of Firefox.

Actual Results:
see above

Expected Results:
The report should display on my screen. I can then decide to print it, save it a a file, etc. When that is down, I close the window and return to the Oracle menu.

I doubt I'm the only one using your browser to run web-enabled Oracle applications. Oracle would prefer that we use IE or Netscape but we like Firefox. This problem doe not occur when I use IE, and, like I mentioned, it did not occur with v. 1.5.0.5. The problem started yesterday morning when Fireffox wa updated to 1.5.0.6. Thanks for your assistance.
