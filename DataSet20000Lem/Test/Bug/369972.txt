This FEMA website ha popups for instructional purposes.

example: http://emilms.fema.gov/ICS100G/index.htm

There is a "Print" button for printing the content of page within these instructional popups. These, generally work.

Some of the instruction page have call for additional popups windows, which also contain "Print" buttons.

Example: Javascript:showDefLong(def05025)
This particular example is within the Lesson 5 [summary] of this instructional module. As is a lengthy piece; should be multiple page if printed.

When using the print button on this page
Javascript:Self.Print()

The print dialog box come up and report -only- 1 of 1 pages, rather than the correct total.

This behavior occurs in various place within the instructional modules, but not everywhere with respect to "Print" buttons. I will attach the code.

In the example above, which will print only the first page OF THE EXPECTED content, I saved the content to a file [this is attached]. If I then OPEN the html file from my desktop into a new FoxTab, I get a version of the PARENT popup, without the CSS formatting. I saved this content; it content is NOT the same [see SECOND attachment - ....WEIRD.htm]

Not sure if this is Javascript fault, CSS fault, or Firefox/Script fault or Firefox/Print fault.
