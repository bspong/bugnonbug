Move themes/*/devtools/font-inspector.css into themes/shared/devtools/font-inspector.css
As part of the process of DRYing up our CSS, we should move the font-inspector CSS file into the shared folder.

The main step for merging these file into one are:

1) Make sure there aren't any difference between the windows/linux/osx version of the files. You can use a diffing tool for this, or just look at them:

diff browser/themes/linux/devtools/font-inspector.css browser/themes/osx/devtools/font-inspector.css
diff browser/themes/linux/devtools/font-inspector.css browser/themes/windows/devtools/font-inspector.css

2) If there are no changes, then all we need to do is make a new file called browser/themes/shared/devtools/font-inspector.css, and copy the content of one of the other file into it. If there are changes, we will need to navigate them individually and decide if they should be kept or not. We can keep them with preprocessor directive if needed.

3) Delete browser/themes/linux/devtools/font-inspector.css, browser/themes/windows/devtools/font-inspector.css, browser/themes/osx/devtools/font-inspector.css

4) Modify browser/themes/*/jar.mn to replace (devtools/font-inspector.css) with (../shared/devtools/font-inspector.css). Note that the windows/jar.mn file ha two place that need to change.
