browsing history cleared at regular interval
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

While Firefox 4.0 (final) is running, the browsing history (Ctrl-H) is cleared at regular intervals. Firefox (automatically) set places.history.expiration.transient_current_max_pages to 5357, places.history.expiration.interval_seconds and places.history.expiration.max_pages are not set.

The system ha only 256 MB of RAM, so I assume Firefox want to do me a favor by clearing the history every time places.history.expiration.interval_seconds is reached. But there's no need to save memory, and those few byte for history don't really count compared to the memory footprint of firefox.exe itself. There's still unused memory, but maybe not the high percentage/amount Firefox try to keep free.

In opposite to Firefox 3 (and before), Firefox 4 doesn't seem to support a lower limit for history entry (only a maximum). I'm wondering that places.history.expiration.transient_current_max_pages is set to such a high value because in fact it's 0.

Happens with or without plug-ins.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get a system with 256 MB of RAM.
2. Start Firefox and visit some sites.
3. Wait until history is purged automatically (at regular intervals).
Actual Results:
History doesn't keep any history for long.

Expected Results:
Keep number of browsing history entry at least "near" places.history.expiration.transient_current_max_pages

I understand that places.history.expiration.transient_current_max_pages is "max pages", not "min pages", but I really like to keep at least some history and not nothing at all. There should be a lower limit (no matter what Firefox think about memory utilization).

Btw, I have around 8.000 bookmarks. Maybe Firefox 4 erroneously includes this number when expiring entry from places.sqlite? 8000 is greater than 5357, so that could explain why the browsing history is cleared - but I would expect, that places.history.expirition.* only relates to browsing history and not bookmark a well. But that's just a wild guess.
