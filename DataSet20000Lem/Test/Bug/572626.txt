n the login dialog of the applet it doe allow the user to enter the password in to the field. Password field doe not take the focus. I can not put the cursor in to the password field.
I tried tab key and it is not working. It look to me that any key on key board is not working. I can see the focus on "Ok" button but when i press "enter" key it doe not work. I am able to use the mouse. I can click "ok" and "cancel" button of the dialog using the mouse click. If there is no password then i can login to the applet. After that it work normally and all the field in the applet take focus. But if there is a password set, then i am not able to login a i cannot enter anything to the password field in the login dialog. I have JRE 1.5 on my mac osx. It work fine with firefox 3.0 and ha problem in 3.5 and above including 3.6.3.
