I work for a major international bank/stock brokerage firm and deal with fixing website issue for client all day that are accessing our website (www.benefitaccess.com). Until the newest version of Firefox there wa no compatibility issue and Firefox worked great with our site. Now those using Firefox cannot access our site. Nothing ha changed at our site. We were told by IT and mgmt to inform caller that there is currently an issue with Firefox accessing because the newest version of Firefox and the newest version of FlashPlayer (which came out almost simultaneously) are not compatible. Is this in fact true. I use Firefox at home, but at work we are required to use IE. However, until the recent upgrades, there wa no issue with Firefox. NOTE: I am NOT part of the IT team, and I have no position of authority regarding this issue. I just have liked and used Firefox since version 1.0, and hate to see it take a rap for an issue if it doesn't exist. Unfortunately, until this is resolved, we are directing client (about 20 million worldwide) to try IE or Safari, and both work for them.

Reproducible: Always
