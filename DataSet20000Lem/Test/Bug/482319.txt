This problem occurs with firefox running behind a proxy and trying to play a video on tv.adobe.com. As part of the application protocol, firefox doe a GET http://cp48521.edgefcs.net/ident. The response is an XML data tag containing an IP address like 97.65.135.205. Firefox attempt direct connect even though it is configured with automatic proxy URL. Of course it hang because there is no 97.65.135.205 on the local intranet. This problem is in the LINUX version ONLY.

Windows version OK. On the same network and same proxy, the window version of firefox attempt to do a direct connect to the absolute IP like above. But when it can't connect it then query the proxy and retrieves a .pac file. Subsequently it access the IP address using POST 97.65.135.205 that it sends directly to the proxy.



PLEASE FIX. THIS IS A LINUX KILLER AND KEEPS ME STUCK ON MICROSOFT.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Navigate to http://tv.adobe.com/#pg+1478
2.Click on "Flash in a Flash" - episode 1
3.Firefox hang
Actual Results:
A blank video player inline frame appears

Expected Results:
The video should play

Tried all other proxy settings. Results under Linux the same. Tried other Mozilla browser on Linux and got the same result.

IE7 never attempt direct connect in this scenario. As soon a it get an absolute IP it immediately access it through the proxy.
