Firefox hang when loading MIME content
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20050210 Firefox/1.0 (Debian package 1.0+dfsg.1-6)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20050210 Firefox/1.0 (Debian package 1.0+dfsg.1-6)

After I installed some additional software on my machine, Firefox started
freezing anytime I loaded a non-vanilla html file. In other word if I clicked
to download a file or multimedia content, Firefox would freeze hard. This did
not usually affect X Window or Linux directly. Doing a 'killall firefox-bin'
would kill the offending process.

Having never seen this before, I thought that one of my last kernel change had
screwed up Firefox. Luckily I ran 'strace' to find out what wa going on.

As you can see below, the trace begin with Firefox doing a polling routine a
it wait for events. When I click on a 'download' link, Firefox doe a number
of things, but primarily it's looking for MIME library to figure out what to
do with the content I just clicked on.

If you look closely, it doe manage to open the '/usr/lib/gnome-vfs-2.0
directory looking for the 'modules' subdirecty and various helper modules. It
apparently load the one it's looking for and then us some sort of gnome-vfs
protocol to try to load the correct helper app. Some of that routine includes
opening up an RPC channel to the localhost.

Well since I just have gnome-vfs installed, but I'm running XFCE4 there isn't
anyone listening for RPC/Orbit requests. It essentially wait forever.

I even told XFCE4 to startup gnome service after starting itself, but to no avail.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have libgnomevfs2-common installed on Debian or gnome-vfs-2.0 folder in the
/usr/lib/ file hierarchy.
2. Use XFCE4 (or possibly another) Window Manager. Anything but Gnome/Metacity.
3. Load up Firefox and click on any page that would normally be processed a an
unknown or non-native file type.
4. Watch Firefox Lockup Hard


Actual Results:
Firefox locked up hard, but Linux and X Window are still active and stable.

Expected Results:
Firefox should either give you a popup asking where to save the content, or it
should already know what helper application to use.

Firefox should not believe that vfs2 MIME service are actually available unless
it's made call to check that gnome-vfs-2.0 service is actually listening.




Problem wa isolated using 'strace firefox'.

Temporary, but ugly work around is to rename the /usr/lib/gnome-vfs-2.0
directory to something else. That fix the problem, but if you use this I hope
you don't need gnome-vfs functionality ;-)
