Enhancement: multilevel undo in text box editing

Briefly, I suggest exactly what I say in the subject line: that FireFox (and
Mozilla, for that matter), have multilevel undo in the text box.

More specifically, here is what just happened to me, that motivates this:

Like many people, I use wikis. Wikis allow you to edit web page using a simple
text form. Because of this, unfortunately, sometimes I do extensive editing in
the text box, rather than in a real editor.

Just now, I entered quite a lot of text, cut it to paste elsewhere, had a phone
call, cut something else ... and therefore lost what I had originally cut.

Yeah, yeah, I should not have been doing any extensive wiki editing in FireFox.
But I wa - many people probably do - this isn't the first time that exactly
this problem ha bitten me - and the solution is well-known: multi-level undo.

I believe this is within FireFox and Mozilla's purview: the text box handling is
the browser's responsibility.
