This class of issue ha been closed by bug #17686, which created a preference item to stop *all* animated content. That's fine, but not what I or advertiser want.

I'm happy to see the animation the first time. But I'd like a manual "stop" feature. This used to be the "ESC" key. It worked good. Where did it go?

This bug report is most similar to #32513, which ha been closed and can't be reopened. I'm creating a new report to reopen discussion in to the manual-stop approach.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a site with lot of animated images.
2. Try to get other work done on your computer.
3. Get frustrated.
4. Press ESC a few times, in hope that the animation will stop.
5. Report this a a bug on mozilla.org again, a others have done in the past.



Expected Results:
The "ESC" key could stop all animaged gifs, and pause all flash animations.

What it should do with javascript is an open question. One line of thought is that it should suspend all javascript timers. What do others think?


Please read this bug in the context of a manual STOP feature, not a global preference.
