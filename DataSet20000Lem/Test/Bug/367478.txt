When loading page like these in a tab (with several other tab open), clicking on the button that select between dynamic content (Whois,dig,host,fetch,asn) or sometimes just scrolling down a it loads, freeze the window. The 'loading' indicator on the window freeze though the indicator by the mouse pointer carry on (until the page is loaded presumably). From then on clicking on tab will change the window Title appropriately, but the content is stuck on the tab that caused the freeze. I have only been able to replicate this in the first window that is opened a FF is started. It is intermittent but once it ha occurred you obviously have to close the whole window, and it seems more likely to recur from then on until the PC is shut down.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load that page
2.Reload and fiddle with scrollbar/dynamic content button
3.sometimes, even when the page is loaded it will freeze after scrolling to the button and clicking one rapidly (rapid mouse movement).



Default theme.
