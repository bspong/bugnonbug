Firefox prompt to install a plugin, despite the Flash object being fallback content only

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I don’t have Adobe Flash Player installed. I upgraded a page on my site to use <video>, with a fallback to an <object> for those with Flash, but not the latest Firefox/Safari.

If the page contains no Object element besides those within fallback content, i.e.

<video><object ...></video>

And Flash (or whatever the object requires) is not installed, then you are prompted to install, despite the object never being visible (when <video> is supported.
Actual Results:
I get a prompt to install Flash, when the native OGG video play just fine!

Expected Results:
Firefox should not prompt to install a plugin, if that <object>/<embed> sits within fallback content (<video>...</video>, <canvas>...</canvas>) and that element *is* supported (thus not showing the fallback content)

I’m done with Flash, and don’t want to be bugged to install it when I’ve moved onto native OGG already!! I’m only providing a Flash fallback for others.
