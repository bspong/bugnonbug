An empty bookmark file only feature the folder 'Bookmarks toolbar folder'
This folder is not deletable.
After an import of previous exported bookmark (where this folder is already
included), the 'Bookmarks toolbar folder' appears twice.
The first folder remains empty.
The new folder, with the same name, ha the bookmarks.
They should have merged both.
The bookmark present in the exported version appear in the second folder.
I suppose they are not taken into account because no bookmark appears on the
bookmark toolbar of my browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add some bookmarks, both in the normal folder and the 'Bookmarks toolbar folder'.
2. Export these.
3. Delete all bookmark (notice how the 'Bookmarks toolbar folder' can be erased)
4. Import your exported bookmark again
5. Notice how you have two 'Bookmarks toolbar folder's.
You'll have no visible bookmark in your browser's bookmark toolbar because
they are all in the second folder.


Expected Results:
The link from the two 'Bookmarks toolbar folder' should have merged.
