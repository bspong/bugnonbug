the 'no site info' tooltip from location bar can be le intrusive, more informative
The site-specific preference and the "site identity" info from the location in FF3 are both great features, but they can be done in a more user-friendly and user-manageable manner. I think that these suggestion are all possible and are not exclusive of each other. It would be good to do any or all of these.

- Right now, for an unverifiable site, the tooltip say 'This web site doe not display identity information'. It could say 'Unverified...'.

- In the security preferences, two checkboxes are:
[ ] Tell me if the site I'm visiting is a suspected attack site
[ ] Tell me if the site I'm visiting is a suspected forgery
Add:
[ ] Tell me if the site I'm visiting is not verifiable identifiable
I would suggest this should be un-checked by default, but I can see the other side of that a valid also.

- Right now, a command-click on the location bar icon (on Mac OS X) give a "info box" that says:
This web site doe not supply identity information.
Your connection to this site is not encrypted.
It could also say:
Disable this warning in the Security tab of the Preferences.

- When one get the "info box" above, there is a "More information" button which take you to a site-specific option pane. That pane can have an option for 'Do not warn about lack of identity verification for this site.'
