Steps to reproduce:

* open a profile call it A
* open 2nd profile (use command line arg -no-remote) call it B and make the panel stay open with this code run it in * scratchpad of profile B.

```
var PUI = document.querySelector('#PanelUI-popup');
var previt = function(e) {
e.stopPropagation();
e.preventDefault();
e.returnValue = false;
return false;
}
PUI.addEventListener('popuphiding', previt, false);
```

* now click on the open panel


Actual results:

it will focus the panel but not the panel owning window. profile A window is still on top. (IMAGE 2: http://i.imgur.com/Rdmo8lY.png)


Expected results:

profile B window should come to top when click on the panel. of course panel shuld be on top of that.
