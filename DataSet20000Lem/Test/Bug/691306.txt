Style Inspector MDN help link fail to lead to MDN article for some property
The following CSS property are not listed under https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/property-name. This is because they are listed a SVG attribute at https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SVG/Attribute/property-name instead. The style inspector should point at the correct address.

color-interpolation
color-interpolation-filters
dominant-baseline

fill-opacity
fill-rule
flood-color
flood-opacity
lighting-color
marker-end
marker-mid
marker-start
shape-rendering
stop-color
stop-opacity
stroke
stroke-dasharray
stroke-dashoffset
stroke-linecap
stroke-linejoin
stroke-miterlimit

stroke-width
text-anchor

The following property would work if we strip the -moz- prefix:

-moz-animation-delay
-moz-animation-direction
-moz-animation-duration
-moz-animation-fill-mode
-moz-animation-iteration-count
-moz-animation-name
-moz-animation-play-state
-moz-animation-timing-function
-moz-hyphens
-moz-orient

The following are just missing:

-moz-backface-visibility
-moz-perspective
-moz-perspective-origin
-moz-transform-style

The linking system in the style inspector should deal with these special case a appropriate.
