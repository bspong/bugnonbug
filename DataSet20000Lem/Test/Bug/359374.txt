Single window mode doe not work for external link

Please note the user agent string is incorrect a I had to change it in order to get into site that do not accept FF2 :-( This is the OS/2 Warp build.

Since running *any* version of FF2 I have been unable to get external link to open in a new window. I have *every* setting I can find on google WRT opening new window in tab set in about:config and a link
from an external program *still* open in a new window. :-(

browser.link.open_newwindow 3
browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction 0
browser.tabs.showSingleWindowModePrefs true
browser.windows.loadOnNewWindow 1
browser.link.open_external 3
browser.link.open_newwindow 3

Messing with these setting make no difference. (BTW is changing in about:config enough or do you need to bounce FF?)

I think it also might have been the case with 1.5 but I wa using Tab Mix + which ha a "force single window mode" that works. However, there is not a FF2 version of that add-on.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use any external program to open a link in existing browser

Actual Results:
New window open

Expected Results:
New tab opened
