SonicWALL Firewall Appliance with Gateway Anti-Virus is currently blocking the 64-bit stub installer
[Preconditions]:
- SonicWALL Firewall Appliance ha to be installed and active:
https://www.sonicwall.com/products/sonicwall-nsa/
- The "Gateway Anti-Virus" option need to be enabled for SonicWALL.

[Affected versions]:
all

[Affected platforms]:
Windows (all)

[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Download the following 64-bit stub installer:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8805254
2. Run the stub installer a administrator.
3. Follow the setup wizard's step to install Firefox.

[Expected result]:
Firefox is successfully installed via stub installer.

[Actual result]:
- The stub installer hang in the "Downloading Firefox" stage for a
while and then the following alert is displayed:

Gateway Anti-Virus Alert [...] This request is blocked by the
Firewall Gateway Anti-Virus Service. Name: InstallCore.A_237
(Adware) blocked.

- As a result, the stub installer is blocked from downloading
Firefox and the install process is cancelled.

[Regression range]:
This issue is not a regression.

[Additional notes]:
- We are using SonicWALL Firewall Appliance in all of our offices,
but for one of them we've recently enabled a specific option:
Gateway Anti-Virus.

- Based on a few test across different offices, we concluded that
only the office that had Gateway Anti-Virus enabled wa showing
this problem.

- Initially, we've noticed that suddenly both 32-bit and 64-bit
stub installers were being blocked.

- Starting last Thursday and without any change being made to our
office's firewall rules, we noticed that 32-bit installers were
no longer being blocked and I've double-checked that again today.
As of this moment, only 64-bit stub installers get blocked, with
the same alert notification.

- These are the stub installers we've used to test the firewall's
behavior:

- 64-bit (blocked):
* https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8805254

- 32-bit (initially blocked, but now they're not):
* https://mzl.la/2eXc5VD
* https://mzl.la/19V7f56
* https://mzl.la/2fyuVAG
* https://mzl.la/2g7bQcV

- We tested the same firewall setup with other stub/web installers,
to see whether it's something isolated to the Firefox stub:

- Google Chrome: not blocked
- Opera: blocked, reason: MalAgent.I_12705 (Trojan)
- Torch: not blocked
- Pale Moon: not blocked
- Vivaldi: n/a, no web installer available
- Maxthon: n/a, no web installer available
- Yandex: n/a, no web installer available
- Dropbox: not blocked
- Google Drive: not blocked
