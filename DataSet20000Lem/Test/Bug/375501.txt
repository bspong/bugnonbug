Website button don't do anything (basically, I can't log in ANYWHERE on the web).

It first happened when I tried to log into Hotmail, right after I got the new FireFox. I entered all of my information and pressed the "Sign in" button. Nothing happened. I tried it a few times. Nothing happened.

After that, I went to GaiaOnline.com and entered my information there. Once again, nothing happened.

And even just signing up here. I clicked the sign up button and nothing happened! There isn't a loading bar on the bottom or anything.

Please respond quickly. This problem is really pissing me off, a I can virtually do nothing until it is fixed. Right now, I am using Internet Explorer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter log in information on any website with log in button (example - Hotmail).
2. Click the "log in" button
3. Nothing happens.
Actual Results:
NOTHING HAPPENS.

Expected Results:
NOTHING HAPPENS.

IT SHOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING!

I am not using any theme, because the new FireFox erased all of my preference (which piss me off a well; if I couldn't load my bookmark again I would be screwed).

I don't know what any of the other stuff means.
