Unable to delete bookmarks+history url from autocomplete though BookmarkBonus = 0

I have the following setting configured to turn off bookmark search in the Location Bar:
places.frecency.bookmarkVisitBonus = 0
places.frecency.unvisitedBookmarkBonus = 0
browser.urlbar.matchOnlyTyped = True

If the Location Bar search return a site typed that is also a bookmark I would expect to be able to remove it from the search result with DEL or shift-DEL, a I am only searching based on typed sites. However, because these site are also bookmark I cannot remove them from my search result without removing the bookmark even though Firefox is not searching my bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set the following in about:config
places.frecency.bookmarkVisitBonus = 0
places.frecency.unvisitedBookmarkBonus = 0
browser.urlbar.matchOnlyTyped = True
2. Type text to find a bookmarked visited URL
3. Highlight the result
4. Hit DEL or shift-DEL to delete
5. Re-enter the text from step 2
Actual Results:
The result reappears due to the fact that it is also a bookmark

Expected Results:
The result should not reappear since I don't care to search by bookmark and if I want to delete something from my history I shouldn't have to delete the associated bookmark first.

Would it be possible to allow deletion from the Location Bar result without deleting the bookmark, either 1) when the above config setting above are set or 2) generally?

The workaround of deleting a bookmark is not desirable in most cases.
