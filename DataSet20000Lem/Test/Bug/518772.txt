Currently when you have a proxy server set which need a password, firefox
prompt you to save the password and subsequently pre-fills it - great -
expected, wanted.

But when it you first start it up and it find update for add ons the
remembered information module is not used ... be good to use that in this
case too.

Can send screen shot if more explanation is required.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. set up a proxy which need a password, set browser to remember password
2. add a test add on via a web site u control - doe not need to do anything just hello world
3. update add on
4. close browser (or maybe first this then step 3)
5. restart browser should want to go to to the web, will ask you for credential but remembered credential will not be there.
Actual Results:
remembered credential will not be there

Expected Results:
remembered credential should be there in all case even when starting up and no main window is up, browser is updating add ons in the background. maybe it should update after main window come up when there is a proxy and then prompt to restart to enable add on change
