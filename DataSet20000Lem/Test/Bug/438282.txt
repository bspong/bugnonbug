Possible bug in ranking of url bar result
See http://tech.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=577139&threshold=1&commentsort=3&mode=thread&pid=23701343#23704335

The relevant part is:

Uh, no it doesn't. How long do I have to wait for this to magically happen?
Because it's been several week now, visiting that particular site several
time a day (& /. only every few days), and it steadfastly refuse to move
from the 3rd position on the list.

Note that, a I mentioned in another reply, this isn't the only case where
this happens. Currently, typing "sl" for me brings up "qut.edu.au" first,
"www.visibledust.com" second, then "slashdot.org". At worst, that's WTF
terrirory - at best, it's like FF3 ha decided "OK, I know enough, I'm not
going to learn and adapt anymore", and just stick with it chosen ordering
whether the user want that or not.

The original post in question here wa <http://tech.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=577139&threshold=1&commentsort=3&mode=thread&cid=23699609>:

Sorry to the lover of it, but when typing 'as' consistently brings up
slashdot.org and youtube.com a the first 2 choice before a URL actually
starting with those 2 letter (like ask.metafilter.com - and yes, before you
ask, all 3 are in my history and bookmarks)

Further info from <http://tech.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=577139&threshold=1&commentsort=3&mode=thread&pid=23704753#23707061>:

Type "as", get:

1. slashdot.org - bookmarked
2. youtube.com (page title "YouTube - Broadcast Yourself") - not bookmarked
3. ask.metafilter.com - bookmarked


Another example - type "sl", get:

1. qut.edu.au (page title "QUT | Queensland University of Technology,
Brisbane Australia") - not bookmarked
2. www.visibledust.com (page title "VisibleDust - DSLR Camera Sensor
Cleaning") - not bookmarked
3. slashdot.org - bookmarked

Note that this ha occurred, with variations, for me on 4 different machine
(2 x OS X, 1 x WinXP, 1 x Vista), in all FF3 version since b2, and across
multiple new profiles.
