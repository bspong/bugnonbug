Hi,

this is a very annoying problem, but probably also caused by some script fault in site I regularly visit.
However, FF (more exactly: Minefield) appears to fight some war against these sort of script and even after leaving the page again, the problem is not gone.

Unfortunately, it doesn't always appear but depends on the site AND, above all, the complexity of script (mainly JavaScript) used on the site.

Behavior is like this:
After the issue ha come into effect, you won't need your left mouse button any longer: you can move carefully to the lower right edge (ed: the one with the "dog-ear") and you can AUTORESIZE the window without even thinking of using the mouse button. Just HOVER over this area with the mouse button and you can trigger the window resizer, which, however, will make the window abruptly increase in size - with a smashing zap! the window is now about 100 pixel bigger in horizontal axis.

I'd like to know what cause this; nor do I think too many people have encountered this; it may even be a Win7-only issue.
NOTE: It doe NOT happen with Explorer windows, although these feature the same "dog-ear" on the lower right edge.

It only appears here UNDER HEAVY LOAD; that is, encoding a CD to MP3 or something. Or when I watch a video occupying the one screen half, and I simultaneously checking something on a web site in the other half.

That is: when the multitude of script can't work perfectly synchronously due to the high load, this problem may occur.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Surf around on various web site commonly known to have a huge army of javascripts and/or flash video and other multimedia stuff: candidate are gmx.net, adobe.com, cnn.com, youtube, dailymotion and others.
2. Hover (DO NOT click!) with the mouse pointer *gently* over the lower right edge of the window and move around the mouse cursor in DIAGONAL direction.

Actual Results:
If the issue wa triggered "successfully", the window will auto-resize without clicking anything, i. e. you have met the bug in person. Congratulations.

Expected Results:
Absolutely no window resize operation may come into effect UNLESS the left mouse button wa clicked.
