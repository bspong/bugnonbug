FF leak memory and us 100% processor utilisation

This problem ha existed since I first started using FF about 18 month ago:

Simply navigate to news.bbc.co.uk and leave the page open. Over several hours, FF will consume all available memory; after 6-8 hour it will also occupy 100% of one of the processor core on a multi-core (Intel or AMD Opteron) machine.

More recently (possibly since I upgraded DotNet to version 3.5), FF no longer actually shuts down when I close it gui - it remains in TaskMan's Processes list and I have to kill it from there to get the memory and processor utilisation back.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Navigate to news.bbc.co.uk
2.Wait several hour
3.Look at Task Manager
Actual Results:
FF exhaust available memory. Occupies 100% of one processor core. Does hot shut down when it gui is closed.

Expected Results:
FF should not leak memory, not monopolize a processor core, and should shut down when it gui is closed.

None - this problem arises on every machine I have tested (about a dozen).
