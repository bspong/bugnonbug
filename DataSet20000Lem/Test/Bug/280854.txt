Keyword or other type of search is performed for all form of one-word URLs
("any" or "http://any" and even "http://any/") if a proxy is configured.
"keyword.enabled" and "keyword.URL" setting are both ignored, a well a
"browser.search.selectedEngine" and "browser.search.defaultenginename". The URL
prefix used for search is "http://www.google.com/search?q=". Quite annoying,
since I have to type FQDN to reach frequently used site in my domain.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. configure the browser to use a proxy for http.
2. go to 'any' or 'http://any' or 'http://any/' URL
3. if not satisfied already try to change "keyword.enabled" or "keyword.URL" or
"browser.search.selectedEngine" or "browser.search.defaultenginename" and go to (2)

Actual Results:
browser wa directed to "http://www.google.com/search?q=any"

Expected Results:
go to "http://any/" URL and be presented with the site or relevant error message
returned by the proxy(or the browser if the proxy is dead) if keyword search is
either disabled(required, MUST work this way) or enabled(optional, but should be
the same since it is impossible to positively determine if the site doe not
exist when using a proxy=no DNS lookups). Probably the preference setting can
be enhanced to make the behavior really configurable, i.e. triple-state
enabled=always do keyword search,disabled=never do keyword search and auto=do
keyword search only if text is positively not a valid URL: is not a (java)script
command, contains space or other illegal char or DNS fails.

no other dependency found(i'm using the default theme).
