In the latest Minefield 3.7 nightly update I've noticed that - along with a new look for tab - the "tab tear" feature no longer works. My understanding is that this is the name of the feature wherein when a tab is pulled down from it location and into the page, it pop out and open in a new window. In the latest nightly update however it doesn't do that. Rather, it simply refreshes the page. Is this a bug, or is it intended? Either way I'm not impressed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a new web page in a tab
2. Pull it out like you would in Firefox 3.6
3. Expect it to open in a new Window; be disappointed.
Actual Results:
1. Opened a new web page in a tab
2. Pulled it out like I did in Firefox 3.6
3. The page refreshed. I wanted it to open in a new window

Expected Results:
1. Open a new web page in a tab
2. Pull it out like you would in Firefox 3.6
3. Tab is removed from previous window; tab now ha it own window
