User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Fedora; Linux x86_64; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0
Build ID: 20160411193902

Steps to reproduce:

1. cd /home/jgotts/.mozilla/firefox/<profile name>/extensions
2. ln -s my@extension.name.com <development directory name>


Actual results:

Extension no longer work with Firefox 45.x, 45.x ESR, or 46.x. Attached is a screenshot from Firefox 46.0.


Expected results:

The extension development symlink worked fine with Firefox 1.0-44.0.2, and also work fine when installed a an XPI file. Using the development symlink is how we've been doing extension development for at least 8 years.

The symlink allows u to edit JavaScript file in our local repositories, restart Firefox, and test our changes.

If we have to regenerate an XPI file every time we change even one character in a JavaScript file, then development time increase exponentially.

New error in 45.x that may be relevant:

Could not read chrome manifest 'file:///home/jgotts/firefox/firefox-46.0/chrome.manifest'.

I tried copying that file to the /home/jgotts/firefox/firefox-46.0 directory and making symlinks into the development directory but that didn't help.

I don't want to put my git repo into /home/jgotts/.mozilla/firefox/<profile name>/extensions/my@extension.name.com because that directory is wiped according to rule that a far a I know are undocumented. Even using the symlink, there are bug in Firefox that sometimes cause it to traverse the symlink and delete file in the destination directory. I believe those bug are being fixed, and this is not the issue I'm addressing.
