Having just opened the smh.com.au website (which I use all the time so I suspect
the page is coincidence), I scrolled down quickly using the mouse wheel and then
back up a little. The program crashed, with the title bar etc staying in view
after the crash. Shutting down required repeated click on nameless 'program is
not responding' window to get out.

This ha happened several time yesterday and today. The only other program open
wa Outlook 2000.

The crash advice window displayed the following:

FIREFOX caused a divide error in module <unknown> at 0000:00000204.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log on
2. Start outlook
3. Start Firefox (I have two homepage - google.com.au and smh.com.au)
4. Scroll down quickly using mouse wheel.

Actual Results:
Standard Windows 'This program will be shut down' error message appears. After
closing this, vestige of Firefox remain on screen and on the menu bar. They
disappear if I bring up another mindow (eg outlook), but are still there when I
minimise the outlook window.

Expected Results:
Not crashed!
