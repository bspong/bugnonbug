Our new permission prompt are practically modal! Make them "passive confirmation UI" again.

One suggestion for what a shrinking prompt might look like.

I like our recent redesign of permission for many reasons, but they're practically modal, which is bad.

(While perhaps not technically modal, they're so big they're impractical to ignore, to the point where continuing to operate the page underneath is a real challenge, so come on, they're modal.)

I can't say it better than roc in his excellent 2011 blog [1] which I hope everyone ha read many times, where he says:

"Long ago we learned that modal request --- interrupting the application with a warning, and forcing the user to OK/Cancel before proceeding any further --- wa ineffective for security, because user quickly learn to OK such warning without even reading them. An alternative approach is "passive confirmation UI": for example, UI appears requesting a permission, but the user can ignore it and continue using the application, so user who don't read the message are le likely to grant permission by default. Firefox's geolocation permission UI is a good example of this."

Our new UX ha lost this spirit in it design, which I'll paraphrase a "Here, user! Here's some additional functionality you can turn on for this site whenever you want, if you want, or not, whatevs." It offered the user a richer (optional!) experience in exchange for trusting this site with more of their stuff, with enticement, not pressure. The not-having-to-answer part wa intrinsic in this power dynamic between user and site.

Because make no mistake, this is a PITA for web developers, but user - individual - come first in the w3c "Priority of Constituencies" for the web [1], and the Mozilla manifesto [3].

The reason we dropped this wa that our *implementation* of "passive confimation UI", which roc referred to in 2011, wa flawed in two regards:

1. People thought the prompt wa gone when it went away.
2. Web developer expected some form of notification from what looked like dismissal.

These were UX challenge we could have solved, and still can solve, to avoid what are effectively modal dialogs. As proof of that (and only that) I offer up a mockup screenshot of what I'll call the "shrinking permission prompt" could look like.

It solves (1) by never fully going away, it just shrink enough to let user continue their work if they indicate lack of interest.

It solves (2) by not falsely implying dismissal.

Modal dialog also exacerbate permission spamming, so let's bring back Firefox's traditional defense against this (which frankly the redesign ha made worse). There change to the API are needed for this.
