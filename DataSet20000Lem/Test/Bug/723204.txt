Steps to reproduce:

*** To reproduce this bug an account might be required at ADVFN.com ***

The ADVFN website run streaming stock quote using Java.
I had no problem with this site before installing Firefox 10.0.

1. Open Firefox.

2. Open Level 2 quote at the ADVFN website. Use this URL:
http://www.advfn.com/p.php?pid=level2&symbol=NB%5EAXPW

3. Open a new tab in Firefox. In the new tab in Firefox open a webpage that includes a form that contains a text box and ha javascript enabled. Verify that the cursor can be placed in the text box in the new tab in Firefox. Close the new tab in Firefox.

4. The Level 2 page at the ADVFN website contains 5 embedded tab to accommodate Level 2 streaming quote for 5 stocks.

5. In the embedded tab labeled "2" on the ADVFN website type TTNP [enter]

6. Repeat step #3. When you click in the text box, the cursor will not appear.


Actual results:

Opening two Java stream in Firefox tab #1 seems to have disabled javascript in Firefox tab #2.


Expected results:

Step #6 and step #3 under "What did you do?" should have behaved the same.
