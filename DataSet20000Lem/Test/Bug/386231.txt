Firefox doe not properly calculate the table size based on what it is displaying. It seems a though if you put two span with white-space: nowrap next to each other inside of a TD that is set to wrap, the table expands correctly to the size of the largest span, a if it wa going to wrap the second span on to the next line. When displaying this, however, it doe not wrap the span, causing the second span to overflow.

Firefox 3.0 beta seems to have this fixed, however, it break when you stick an image inside of a table, incorrectly forgetting the size of the image when calculating the size of the table.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Put two span with white-space: nowrap inside of a table element directly next to each other with no space in between. This break Firefox 2
2. To break Firefox 3, put an image inside of a span with white-space: nowrap along with some text, the text will overflow
Actual Results:
In Firefox 2: The first table is the size it would be if the table cell wa wrapped, but the inside text is not wrapped, causing an overflow.

In Firefox 3: The image length is not taken into account and the text flow over that exact amount.

Expected Results:
In Firefox 2: Either the span should wrap on top of each other, or the table should account for them not being wrapped.

In Firefox 3: The IMG tag should be accounted for in the width of the table.

This ha been reproduced on several different machine with several different configurations.
