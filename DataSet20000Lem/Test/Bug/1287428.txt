Re-up or make immortal the FX_SANITIZE timing probe expiring in FF50
Thirteen Sanitize probe [1] will expire in FF50 which is real soon now.

Conversation with :mak on IRC suggests that we probably want to keep these a insurance against regression in these timing (which could result in bad shutdown experiences)

The choice is whether we want to try and argue that these deserve to be "expires_in_version: never" or if these should only be re-upped for another X version (X=5? 10?) to see if they actually _do_ catch regressions.
