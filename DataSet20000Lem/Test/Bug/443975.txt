I'm working on a postit feature with JQuery that work perfectly in both Firefox 2 and Internet Explorer on PC/Windows. However, I got to work (where they use Firefox 3) and both PC/Windows nor Linux/Windows version of Firefox 3 have a totally incomprehensible (to me and those I work with) bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a postit
2. Click on it to enable edit mode
3. Edit text
4. Click Update Postit to finish
Actual Results:
The id of the postit note print on screen a it is supposed to. The code to change the CSS of the postit, to change it content to the new text, and to change the variable which tell me if that postit is being edited doe not run.

Expected Results:
The id of the postit note should still print, but the border color should change, the content of the postit note should change from the Editor to the newly entered content, and the variable should change to say that the postit is no longer being edited.

When you have finished editing a postit, the function finishEdit() is called. It look roughly like this:

function finishEdit(postit) {
removeBorder(postit);
updateText(postit);
printPostitId(postit);
cur_editing = 0;
}

cur_editing is a global variable that store the id "postit1" of the postit being edited, or 0 if no postit is being edited.

This function work perfectly in Firefox 3 only if I comment out the last line. If I leave the line in, none of the code run except for the line that print the postit's id on the screen. So far, I have tried:

-Taking all the code out of function and adding it to the main body of code in case it wa a problem with function calls, for all of the below.

-Setting cur_editing to "none" in case it wa a problem with a) setting variable to something that could be considered null or b) string to integer conversion of a variable from 0 to postit1 and back to 0

-Abandoning cur_editing altogether and using the title attribute of the postit note instead, in case the problem wa with global variables. The new line of code acted exactly the same a the cur_editing = 0 line of code.

-I used Firebug to run each non-functional line of code separately. Each work exactly a they should in the function when typed into the Firebug console.

-I know the function is being called because of the print statement; I also know that it is being passed the correct id, for the same reason.
