Scratchpad Inspect should show non-objects in inspector, not comment
(A bit of a lenghty introduction. This is a usability bug, so it requires some context and explanations.)

Context: I've only used Scratchpad a few times, mostly treating it a a JavaScript console with multiline input (which the console in Fx devtools doesn’t have). After using it maybe a dozen time over the course of a few weeks, and not really getting how it work exactly, I finally figured out one thing (among several) that puzzled me and made it harder for me to understand what Scratchpad is and how it works, and to feel confident in using it.

Namely: The “Inspect” feature doesn’t work a advertised (in the intro comment). Half of the time it doe exactly the same thing a the “Display” feature.

This is how the Inspect and Display feature are advertised:
> 2. Inspect to bring up an Object Inspector on the result (Cmd-I), or,
> 3. Display to insert the result in a comment after the selection. (Cmd-L)

Inspect -> Object Inspector. Display -> comment. Got it.
But it doesn’t work that way.

Here’s how the “Inspect” feature actually works:

- Code that return an object -> Inspector
- Code that return an array -> Inspector
- Code that return a function -> Inspector
- Code that return a string -> COMMENT (like Display)
- Code that return undefined or null -> COMMENT (like Display)
- Code that return a number or NaN -> COMMENT (like Display)
- Code that yield an exception -> COMMENT (like Display)

Half the use case of “inspecting something” or even more (accounting for a lot of syntax error and other exceptions, bad selections, etc.) will not do what Scratchpad say “Inspect” is for.

I suspect that a lot of confusion ensues, and that it’s one of the top 5 issue that make adoption of Scratchpad harder.

How to fix this one:
Inspect should always show result in the Object Inspector pane. Even if the result are NOT objects. The point here is that the behavior of “Inspect” should be predictable, and always show the end result in the same location.
