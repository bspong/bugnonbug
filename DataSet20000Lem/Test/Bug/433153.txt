Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.13 cannot open file (for example *.html-s) named with lithuanian symbol on NTFS disk when regional setting is not set to Lithuanian on my English Windows 2000 pro sp4 and English Windows XP pro sp2. Probably the same thing is with all non english symbols, if regional setting from different code page is set.
IE 6.x, Opera 9.x ha no problem with opening.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get any supported file named with lithuanian symbol for example "xxxxx.htm"
2. Open it via the Internet Explorer 6.x, Opera 9.x (double-click).
3. File will be opened correctly
4. Try the same with Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.13
3. Firefox give an error message (sorry, don't remember exactly error message, probably ''Cannot open file xxx... will be displayed.

Expected Results:
6. Firefox MUST open the file! It is not a time of Windows 9x, it's Windows NT-s 5.x with NTFS (the same bug wa in Word 97 - he, he error message: ''Check the file name is correct!'')

Firefox displayed an error message. Please check the newer version 2.0.0.14 - about 100% true the bug is still present!
