I deleted my password since I temporary need to share my window account. After running the automatic upgrade to 3.x the password returned. Also previously deleted bookmark came back



Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firefox version 2.x
2. Store password for i.e. webmail
3. Create bookmark
4. Delete bookmark
5. Delete password through the clear private data method
6. Bookmarks and password are gone (I kept pressing do not now at the "remember password" box)
6. Automatic upgrade appears (would you like to upgrade to 3.x)

Actual Results:
After the upgrade I went to webmail, and the password field wa filled in automatically. I pressed login et voila, I wa logged in
Then I noticed all my old bookmark had returned a well

Expected Results:
Bookmarks still gone, password still gone
It should have deleted the password fully and not retrievable. The bookmark reappearing I don't mind (although that is a privacy issue a well). But the password apparently wasn't gone completely. The fact due to an upgrade bug it returned mean that the delete private data option doesn't delete the information 100%

This is on a Windows XP pc in a corperate environment with limited roaming profiles. I didn't however change pc in weeks.

I consider this sever since if you run upgrade on a shared pc, old information come back that may expose people email, and other habits. This is especially a problem if the PC becomes shared later and the person feel save since (s)he deleted the private data
