Firefox Setup 49.0.1.exe metadata is EMPTY!
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:51.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/51.0
Build ID: 20161007004004

Steps to reproduce:

1) Visit https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/
2) Download Windows or Windows 64. (Probably any language.) (I only tested with English-US and Windows.)
3) Right-click on "Firefox Setup 49.0.1.exe" and then Properties.
4) Click on Details.


Actual results:

File description is BLANK.
File version is 4.42.0.0
Product name is BLANK.
Product version is BLANK.
Copyright is BLANK.
Language is BLANK.
[Sorry if this delivery and packaging and issue might not belong HERE. (This report belongs somewhere, even if no place ha been provided.)]


Expected results:

There are 91 x 5 = 455 version on that page. (91 win32 and 91 win64.)
Metadata in each file must declare it Product name. (e.g., Firefox 32-bit)
Metadata in each file must declare it Product version. (e.g., 49.0.1)
Metadata in each file must declare it Copyright. (e.g., 2016, Mozilla Foundation)
Metadata in each file must declare it Language. (e.g., English (US))
Valid metadata (except for product version always 4.42) were entered until version 30.0 (20140606). After that there is only a digital signature, no metadata telling WHAT the file IS.
