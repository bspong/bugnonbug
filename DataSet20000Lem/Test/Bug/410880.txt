When i press the BACKSPACE key i expect it to go BACK, sometimes instead of this it will jump to the Address bar or text input box and start to delete text, this behavior really is problematic!! I expect to use BACKSPACE and SHIFT-BACKSPACE for going BACK & FORWARD respectively, i don't want or expect it to get focused and stuck in text box or the Address Bar ever, unless i click into those box on purpose. This behavior is very annoying, very very annoying and make me want a new browser period.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.use BACKSPACE to go BACK
2.At some point focus may enter a text box and get stuck
3.It happens very frequently, after a few BACKSPACES
Actual Results:
The cursor focus will get "stuck" in a text box or the Address Bar and i can no longer go BACK until i find and click on some non-active space on the web site i'm stuck on to reset pointer focus out of the text box or Address Bar - very annoying, if i click wrong on an active space i lose my BACK/FORWARD history.

Expected Results:
I expect the cursor to never ever get stuck in a text box. I expect BACKSPACE to smoothly always go BACK in the Tab or Window's history.

Perhaps this is where history ha left my cursor prior to moving off to a new link, but this may not be so because the cursor should have been left on the link i clicked on to move forward while browsing.
