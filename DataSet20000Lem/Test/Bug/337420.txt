After downloading and installing 1.5.0.3 on 2 Dell laptop (Inspiron and XPS), every time Firefox is opened, the original tab that were open when I shut down this version the first time reappear every time I open Firefox. Same on both computers. Yet if Firefox is not open and I click on a URL in an e-mail, Firefox open afresh with only the selected URL, no additional tabs.

(Both PCs are running XP SP2 with the latest Patch Tuesday updates.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox from an icon or firefox.exe from Explorer to produce the tab that were open when I shut down Firefox immediately after installing 1.5.0.3.
2. Open Firefox by clicking on a URL in an e-mail with Firefox closed to produce expected behavior.
3.

Actual Results:
1. The same tab that were open when I shut down Firefox the first time after downloading 1.5.0.3.
2. Normal behavior.

Expected Results:
Home page, no addiitonal tab open

It should have just opened to the Home screen, one tab only.
