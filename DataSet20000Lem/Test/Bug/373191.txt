if you go to http://www.artist-reference-photo.co.uk/site/45.asp and keep clicking the link for this page on the left hand side, the link is for Landscapes, you get a different rendering of the page on different loads. Sometimes the Rivers and Bridges Heading open up in a new box, when it should be displayed in the left hand box.
This never happens when I run the site on my development machine which make me wonder wether timing is involved somehow.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to http://www.artist-reference-photo.co.uk/site/45.asp
2.repeat clicking on the Landscapes button to the left
3.eventually a different rendering of the page will display.
Actual Results:
eventually you will see 3 box one in the middle with the heading Rivers and Bridges inside it

Expected Results:
There are two box

this can take up to 20 page load to happen. It seems to happen le if you use the refresh button rather than click the link
