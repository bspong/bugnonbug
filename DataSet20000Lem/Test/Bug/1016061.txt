OSX multiple click behavior (to select text) is both incorrect and inconsistent
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:29.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/29.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140506152807

Steps to reproduce:

(This is on OSX 10.9.3 using FF 29.0.1)

Go to this page (the problem occurs everywhere, but let's be concrete):
http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/

Now try the following things.
(a) In the magic bar (or whatever it's called, the text field at the top of the page showing the URL) place the cursor somewhere in the text, ie somewhere in
"http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/"
Double click and a word is selected. Triple click and all the text is selected.
This is CORRECT OSX behavior.
Now put the cursor at the end of the text, ie to the very right of "beegees/".
Do the same (double click and triple click) and the same (correct) behavior occurs.

Now change your attention to the text search field ON THE PAGE. This is about halfway down, to the left of the "Search Gibb Songs" button.
Enter some text, let's say "hold her in your hand".

Now do the same, double and triple click. Once again, double selects a word, triple selects all. Everything is correct.
Hit the search button, you get some result (which we don't care about) and hit the back button.

NOW it get interesting. Type in the same search string a before. After you type in hold you get the popup/autocomplete menu. Type in the full string, or use the menu, I don't care. The point is we now engage in the same multiclick behavior.



Actual results:

NOW:
- a single click show the autocomplete menu. (I don;t care care if you do this or not)
- a double click hide the autocomplete menu
- a TRIPLE click selects the word
- a QUINTUPLE click is required to select the entire text.

This is CRAZY irritating because it doesn't match anything else in the UI. This is the sort of muscle memory you just expect to work everywhere --- you just double or triple click while editing, and without even looking, because it's supposed to ALWAYS work that way.
Obviously what seems to be happening is that the hacked up autocomplete/popup menu is "eating" every other click. This is broken!


Expected results:

It should behave like the URL text field behaves. FWIW Safari get this write (including the autocomplete). The FF URL autocomplete also get this right, because it us some sort of different UI widget to draw it autocomplete menu.

The FF text field autocomplete with a full menu is more powerful than the Safari single-choice autocomplete for text fields, but if the ONLY way to implement it is with a broken handling of multiclick sequences, then it is not worth keeping. The rare occasion where the multiple choice are of value is not worth it compared to the CONSTANT breakage of standard UI patterns; and the Safari scheme (no popup menu, no eating clicks) should be adopted.
