Once I realised that problem when I wa using VLC player, it wa showing movie correctly until I open a website with Firefox and later, vlc player slows down and begin not to show some frames... If I close firefox after see that, problem still continue and restarting vlc is not a solution too (I check my CPU and memory with window task manager and everything is OK and firefox.exe is not in the process list too). VLC player is not the only problem, Firefox also cause my Windows desktop to slow down, I can see that by observing. I use Firefox for browse to some newspaper site and facebook and this site are using flash, maybe problem come from flash because in simple page (like this bugzilla page), it doesn't give that problem to me. When I wa using older version of firefox, there wasn't any similar problem.
