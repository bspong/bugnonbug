firefox not functional when places.sqlite* is corrupted
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008061712 Fedora/3.0-1.fc9 Firefox/3.0

(originally filed a https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=455633)

When my system wa powered off (something fell on the power bar switch), firefox
left an inconsistent places.sqlite* in place.

After reboot and restarting firefox, the following thing were broken:
- no working back button, reload button or stop button
- url were not displayed in the url bar (except the last url typed)
- no working "back" functionality in the browser
- every tab wa shown a "loading" (spinning loader thingy), the favicon wa
never shown

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start up firefox with a broken places.sqlite* (in my case,
places.sqlite-journal wa 0 size)
Actual Results:
suffer all kind of bug and missing functionality

Expected Results:
The browser should detect that places.sqlite* is inconsistent. Maybe it could
reinitialize the places.sqlite*, since removing those file restored firefox to
it former glory - everything now work again.

bug 249150, bug 431558, bug 406833, and bug 404171 are all possible candidate for being duplicate of this bug (or the bug against which this bug is closed a an duplicate), but neither of these seems to cover the breadth of disaster happening here.
