I tried using the forum and got no response. So now I'm trying here. I'm been having this problem for some time now. About 3 months. I had to install and update and eversince, I've been unable to print from Mozilla. So I have to do all my banking from Explorer, which I dislike,except now, I have to use because it works.

What happens is when I click on the print icon, the print box pop up and I select the office lan printer a usual, and then hit print, only then, a blank piece of paper come out instead of a copy of a transaction confirmation of banking statement or account summary or what have you.

I really hope I can get this printing issue resolved,as I much prefer using Mozilla to Explorer. But work is work, you know?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open bank website
2.log on
3.select account
4.select account summary for current month
5. click on print icon
6. print windown come up
7. select lan printer
8. click on print

Actual Results:
I get a blank piece of paper in the printer tray. This doesn't happen with any other program. I regularly print from Explorer, Excel, Word, ContaSol (our accounting software) all work fine.

Expected Results:
Printed something. Preferiably a bank statement.

I think I've covered it. Not sure what the issue is. I have Vista, that could be it... who knows...but I remember it starting after loading a Mozilla Foxfire Update back in the summer.
