Beginning with version 2.0.0.8 (and carried over to version 2.0.0.9), when using the Googlebar extension, clicking on a "search word" (the term used in the extension's documentation) no longer cause the word or quoted phrase to be selected/highlighted in an edit window. (The feature still work on static portion of pages.)

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the Googlebar extension.
2. Open an edit window.
3. Type a word or quoted phrase appearing in the edit window into the Googlebar text field.
4. Click on the word/phrase button that appears.
Actual Results:
The edit window will scroll to the first instance of the word or quoted phrase, but the desired text will not be selected/highlighted.

Expected Results:
The first instance (and each additional instance, a the button is repeatedly clicked) of the text should be selected/highlighted in the edit window (the behavior exhibited in version 2.0.0.7 and earlier).
