User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.2; WOW64; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20131205075310

Steps to reproduce:

Restarted PC, stopped other applications.


Actual results:

When showing a web page eg phys.org then using the scroll wheel or the slider on right hand side the window within firefox is corrupted, it look like it tearing the font and some word & letter are unreadable. Continuing scrolling up or down make it worse but, sometimes the display snap back to be partly readable. It doesnt matter whether the text is in a dialog box or in the web page, the corruption happens just the same though minor property are a bit different sometimes.


Expected results:

No font or display corruption, it should operate a it did prior to the update of 20th Dec 2013. Otherwise firefox ha been fine on my Dell Inspiron 1545 with XP64 bit for over 2 years. This is the first and only display corruption, all other application seem fine so far, esp MS Excel, Word etc. The change is directly causal with the 20th Dec 2013 update, thanks & good luck.
