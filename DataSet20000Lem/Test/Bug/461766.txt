Node.appendChild(other_node) is very slow in Firefox 3+ on Linux, compared to Opera, Webkit and to Firefox 3+ for Windows.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the provided TC in Firefox 3+ on Linux.
2. Click the button.
3. Wait for "done!" to show.
Actual Results:
The code execution is very slow (several order of magnitude slower). It take an unusual amount of time to appendChild 2000 nodes.

Expected Results:
appendChild of 2000 node should be instant, in the same way a it is in Opera and WebKit.

The provided TC creates 2000 <span> element and appends each of them to the #container. To avoid any rendering performance issues, I did set style="display:none" for #container.

The script run instantly in Firefox 3+ on Windows. The performance issue is visible only on Linux with both Firefox version (3.0.3 and 3.1 nightly build of today).

In Firefox 2 on Linux the script run faster than in Firefox 3. It look like this is a regression. Still, Firefox 2 doesn't do the appends instantly like Opera and Webkit.

Note: this performance issue doe not seem related to the new JIT. I ran test with JIT enabled and disabled (both run very slow). Besides, the perf issue is also valid in the case of Firefox 3.0 (which ha no JIT).

I also tested doing 2000 appendChilds into a documentFragment, instead of #container. That's a fast a in the other browsers. It look like this perf issue only affect appends to the main document.
