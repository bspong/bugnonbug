Any extension that utilizes a "hot-key" to access a menu item, doesn't work. Core Firefox "hot-keys" work fine, but any extension that set a hotkey, it doesn't work.

Ex. Flashgot, Ctrl-F3 (Flashgot All) is set and DOES work under Windows, but not under Linux. Mr Tech Local Install about:config hotkey (Alt+C) doesn't work under Mandriva Linux but doe under Windows.

MISC: I've disabled KHotKeys just in case it wa a KDE issue, but doesn't appear to be. I do know that Amarok (audio streamer) will override Alt+X in FF, but once it is closed, Alt+X work again in FF core.

PLEASE NOTE I AM NOT USING THE FIREFOX THAT MANDRIVA DISTRIBUTES! I downloaded the FF from http://www.getfirefox.com/ and installed it.

Thank you in advance. :)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load FlashGot and Mr Tech Local Install under Mandriva LE2005/LE2006/PowerPack 2006
2.Try Alt+C from MTLI to load about:config...fails
3. Try Alt+F3 on a web page that ha some link to download...fails

Actual Results:
Nothing happens...even JavaScript Console is empty.

Expected Results:
Hot-Keys to work in any installed extension.

Just remember the same extension with "Hot-keys" work under Windows 2K and XP but not under the last 2 major release of Mandriva...already have a request sent into them to see if anyone can actually address the issue.
