On our o ( qnx ) a well a on window there is a problem with midle button
scrolling.
The special icon that is displayed while the middle mouse button is pressed
leaf trace up/down ( or left/right a misght be the case ).
This is what happens:
- the special icon get displayed when the middle button is pressed
- nsWindow:Scroll() is called and we blit the content of the window up or down.
This mean that the special icon will be blitted up or down.
- the special icon is redisplayed at the old position, but portion of it are
already displayed up or down, leaving traces.
Please note that the middle button scrolling is disabled on window ( you have
to change your pref.js in your profile to enable it ).

I think the code that handle the scrolling should clear the special icon off
the screen ( expose the space underneath it ), then call nsWindow:Scroll(), then
redisplay the special icon on the same position.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. In Windows enable the middle button scrolling in your pref.js
2. Click the middle button and hold it pressed over a scrollable area
3. Move the mouse up or down while holding the button down. The trace will appear
up and down.
Actual Results:
There are trace left from the scrolling, that are due to the special icon being
displayed while the window is scrolling.

Expected Results:
No trace should be displayed.

On linux this works, but I guess their implementation of the nsWindow::Scroll()
is not blitting the actual content of the window up/down.
