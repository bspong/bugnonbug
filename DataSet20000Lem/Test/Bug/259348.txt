This behaviour look like when problem generated by poor network connection...
dns timing out... but that's not the case for me.
So, more details:
I am browsing and out of blue it stop loading.
I've noticed 3 thing basically:
- status bar usually remains on (most of the time) Waiting... or sometimes on
Connecting... or on Stopped
- the gif with the dotted circle (the logo which is at the top-right of the
window.. right the menu, the same one with the logo that appers - when loading a
page - on the begining of every tab)... this gif keep spinning
- the progress meter doesn't do anything... even if this "DoS" last for 1
minute the progress meter doesn't change.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. navigate
2. navigate

doe absolutely nothing for some time

I've started to have this painful problem within 2 week ago. I've completely
excluded a network problem or something... IE work smooth (and other apps) when
this is happening to me... ping to server doesn't even change.
I've started to uninstall extension one by one. No extension installed now.

It is really annoying. It took me almost 1 hour to search through bug and file
this bug.

There can be another program running on my computer that interferes with
firefox? As I know prior to build of this month I haven't installed anything
new. I think what's new it is BitDeffender 8, (even when it is off doe the same
thing). DC++ is another programm running 24/24 that eats memory, cpu and
bandwidth. Even with it stopped doe the same. As I said, IE doesn't behave like
that and work pretty fast because of the QoS...
New is ATI Control Center... their latest... other apps running are: IIS,
MSSQL2000, yahoo messenger, seti@home, iTouch & Mouse from Logitech, winamp,
AsusProb, ActiveSync, Labtec webcam or sound Manager
System: PIV 3.0Ghz with 1Gb RAM... (2x512 MB different memory brand, same speed,
MB's speed greater than memory's speed... MB 400, mem 333 Mhz... this is
causing me crashing any video compression I am making...)...
I am running out of ideeas... help me please or fix this bug...
