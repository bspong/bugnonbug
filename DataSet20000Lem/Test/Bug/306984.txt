string "url(paper.png) scroll;" in page from W3C show broken-image instead of typed text, work in IE, Netscape 8
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; Media Center PC 3.1)

I updated to Firefox 1.0.6, and wa looking up some CSS spec at
http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/colors.html#propdef-background-attachment, and I
found where the source is:
------------------
<pre>
body {
background: white url(paper.png) scroll; /* for all UAs */
background: white url(ledger.png) fixed; /* for UAs that do fixed
background */
}
</pre>
---------------- it display in Firefox as:--------------------
body {
[broken-image-symbol]) scroll; /* for all UAs */
[broken-image-symbol]) fixed; /* for UAs that do fixed background */
}
-----------------
I tested it under IE 6.x, Netscape 8.0.3.3 and they work correctly.

apparently the statement is being interpreted a a style sheet instead of a
text string to display, and since there is no local file of that name, it
display a broken-image or broken-link instead. I've noticed it before, but
never chased it down to see what it was, so it wa probably doing it back in
Firefox 1.0.4

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox.
2. type: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/colors.html#propdef-background-attachment
into location input area
3. type return. or press GO button

Actual Results:
I see broken image or broken link image in place of the character prior to
the ')' in a 'background: <color> url("someurl") scroll; statement.

Expected Results:
It should have simply displayed the text:

..... with the keyword 'fixed'. For example:

body {
background: white url(paper.png) scroll; /* for all UAs */
background: white url(ledger.png) fixed; /* for UAs that do fixed
background */
}

See the section on .....


I have created a PNG image of trimmed screenshots from Firefox, IE, Netscape
and the "show source" window of that URL. You can download it from:
http://www.baptistanet.com/ff_tb/img/busted-image.png
It is pretty large so it will probably need to be displayed in Psp or some
other graphix tool. The image will remain at that location until you inform
me that it is no longer needed there.

There need to be another level for severity between minor and trivial.
It isn't something that is major, it's trivial but there isn't a workaround,
and should be fixed if you find the problem is in the code and not just
something that I am seeing locally here.

I only had one other Firefox install that I could compare against, and that is
a 1.0rc2 on a Win2K platform, and that one work correctly. I did search for
an existing entry but didn't find any matches, so that might indicate it is
just my install that is bad.
