Read Mail: Trying to check mail (in the Mozilla toolbar) cause the system to initiate an infinite # of start of the program (displayed all over the screen in new windows), until the system lock up and halt
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1

When I try to "Read Mail", the system try to open the program, but nothing
apparently happens. After waiting for around a minute, an infinite number of
"Mail" window keep popping up all over the screen rapidly until the screen is
filled and the system come to a halt. There is no crash, and the system is
still functioning, but all resource seem to be dedicated to replicating the
opening of the "Mail" program. Also, there doe not seem to be an option for
putting in the "Mail" setting for the Mozilla browser.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click "Tools"
2. Click "Read Mail"
3. Wait for almost 1 minute. The system will then open the "Mail" window an
infinite number of time all over the screen until the system lock up, but doe
not crash.

Actual Results:
The system, being locked up, will not respond to "CTRL + ALT + DEL" so I can
terminate the offending functions. There is no crash, just a halt, so I must
manually shut off the computer (power button) and re-boot. The system function
normally after re-boot, and the Mozilla browser function normally a well.
Avoid the "Read Mail" function at the moment.

Expected Results:
Asked for "Setup" information for the desired e-mail functions. Then, if there
is an error, inform the user of the error and allow for a "Cancel" so the user
can continue to use the browser and the system without having to do a re-boot.
