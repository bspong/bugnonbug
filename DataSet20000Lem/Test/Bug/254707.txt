One annoying feature that would be nice to disable is link dragging. Let me
just say I find it useless and suspect that many or most other people do a well.

However, I select text from web page constantly, to copy and paste into emails,
search forms, etc. Sometimes the text I want to select is in a link. In that
case, I must be extremely clever to figure out where on the page I can click to
make my desired selection. For example, on the http://texturizer.net/firefox/,
in the sidebar, try to select the string "Shortcuts", "Documentation", or
"Keyboard". You can do it, but it's hard.

I suggest that link dragging should be disabled by default, but enabled via an
extension, preference panel, or something like shift-click. Alternatively, for
people who get annoyed by link dragging, please at least put an option
accessible via prefs.js to disable this. I searched all over the web and found
no solution.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. click on link
2. drag to select text
3. release mouse button

Actual Results:
A cursor with a picture of a piece of paper appeared, then snapped back to the
starting point of my click.

Allowed me to select the text.
