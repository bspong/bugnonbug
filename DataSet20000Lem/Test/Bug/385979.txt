One clearly repeatable symptom of what is otherwise a periodic hang with FireFox 2. Was not an issue with FF1.5 previously, ha been regularly happening with 2.0.0.4 after the upgrade.

Situation: Open Tools>Options dialog, click on Advanced category and then try to change tab among those offered: [General | Network | Update | Encryption]. At each click/tab change, experience hang [freeze|delay|pause] of 6 second (one-onethousand, two-onethousand... six-onethousand) before the tab focus changes. Running Process Explorer, see CPU go from 0-4% to 100% at each tab change for that same period. Happens nowhere else in Options dialog - eg: can change category [Main | Tabs | Content...] readily with no delay, and no blip in CPU usage.

I am also experiencing periodic hang [freezes|delays|pauses] when browsing web page (like on this one) that affect typing, clicking on links, etc. However, I have not been able to figure out a pattern for that behavior -- but the above is 100% repeatable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Tools>Options>Advanced
2. Change tab focus among [General | Network | Update | Encryption]

Actual Results:
Experience 6 second delay while CPU usage go to 100% and then drop

Expected Results:
Minor to no delay and little impact to CPU usage while working in preference

I can supply a flash movie of the preference situation if that would be helpful. I have tried running in safe mode for the general browsing freeze (no difference) but cannot remember whether I tried the prefs issue while in safe mode. Will do that and post a follow-up.

BTW: Bug category read "Preferences" but FF2 now call that dialog "Options"?
