In the page at http://www.foxmovies.com/ the system is not responding when using
the mouse:

Trying to find out why the system is not responding to the use of the primary
mouse button when using Firefox, I checked to see if the same problem existed in
Netscape 8.0.1 based upon Firefox a well a Mozilla 1.7.7 Using both Netscape
and Mozilla, the mouse wa functioning properly. However, when using Firefox,
the system is not responding. Tried to find something similar in the bug
records, but couldn't.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://www.foxmovies.com
2.Click on secondary mouse button - mouse responds properly with Flash Player
3.However, use Primary mouse button, icon on the page are not responding or
functioning properly - cannot select anything on the page

Two different mouse were used to see if the problem wa associated with the
type or make of mouse being used - both failed. Made by two different companies.
Actual Results:
No response to the Primary mouse button.
No conflicting extensions.

Expected Results:
Icons on the page should have taken the user to another web page, or downloaded
a file for observation with RealPlayer, or Windows Media Player - no response
what so ever.
