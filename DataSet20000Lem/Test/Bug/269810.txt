When on kuro5hin.or, http://www.dailykos.org, and other Scoop-rendered sites,
clicking on link lead to stalling and (most often) total lockups. Pages open
in other window stop working, too. This is a new thing with FF1. I did not
experience this with 0.9x branch builds. Does not happen in IE, Opera or Safari.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to page using Scoop (a perl-based dynamic CMS).
2. Click on a link.
3. Only occasionally it take a second link click.

Actual Results:
The processing icon start to spin, but the status bar still say page load is
done. If I wait a minute or two, the page may start to load, but not always.
Meanwhile all other page open also stop functioning. New URL in address bar
yield no response. About 10% of the time, closing the window of the Scoop site
lead to regaining browser function.

Expected Results:
Load the new page.

It usually take 2 or 3 time of selecting Quit Firefox (or apple-Q) for the
program to actually close. Less than 10% of the time it take Force Quit.
Closing usually take 20 second or more from closing of actual window to
closing of FF from the title bar.

I searched for existing reports. This is such a specific problem, I did not
find any open or unconfirmed bug listed. My apology if I'm repeating
something already reported. I love FF!!!
