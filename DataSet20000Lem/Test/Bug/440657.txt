When a plugin (eg flash) is focused, pressing Alt once ha the following unusual effects:

- Mouse wheel scrolling stop working
- Most key press seem to go into nowhere, except Up/Down/Space which open the _window_ menu for the firefox window.

Selecting something like Restore ha further unusual effects: namely, pressing Alt now will activate the main menu bar, but most other key press (eg Ctrl+T) continue to go to the plugin.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Focus a flash plugin
2. Press (and release) Alt
3. Scroll using the mouse wheel, or press Space
Actual Results:
No scrolling; Space open the window menu.

Expected Results:
It really depends on bug 78414 - I think Alt should certainly open the browser menu like it always does, but that's another matter.

Assuming that the desired behaviour is for Alt to be consumed by the plugin, pressing Alt should certainly not break mouse wheel scrolling or open the window menu.
