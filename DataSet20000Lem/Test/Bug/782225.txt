Can't load nor open page like google reader, gsp.rp, code.google.com
Build ID : 14.0.1, 15.0b4, 17.0a1 (latest 08/12/2012)

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Open new tab -> write reader in URL -> enter -> first suggestion in google search is Google Reader : www.google.com/reader
2. Open gsp.ro -> after page load try to pan, choose article, open new tab

Expected result:
- page google reader (www.google.com/reader) should be displayed
- you should be able to load article or pan page like gsp.ro

Actual result:
-> After choosing first suggestion Google Reader : www.google.com/reader the browser freeze and get in non responsive state - undetermined time
-- you need to force close either through process manager or x close button - force close.
-- at restore - you don't get reader page in the session restore list
-> Page gsp.ro load and after it the browser freeze - same behavior a above.

Note:
- I also tried the following but nothing helped:
--> set spdy on false in about:config
--> enetr save mode
--> disable harware acceleration
--> set to false all network.http in about:config
--> Here is a screencast of the workflow on my desktop
--> delete all profile related data

- Everything wa working fine till this morning
- Everything work fine in Chrome Browser
- I can access this page from other work station with same outside IP
