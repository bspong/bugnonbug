For instance, I open youtube.com and play a video in one tab and myspace.com in another. No matter what is in the other tab...youtube will cause the browser to hang, resulting in freezing/crashing.

When it first start to hang you can't:
-click on links/buttons/etc. Just wont do anything
-Can't exit Mine Field without force closing.
-Cant switch tab

You can:
-Close tab (still stay frozen)
-Hover over link
-Scroll
-Interact with some of the drop down menu such a Tools or Help.

What to do in order to use Mine Field again:
-Force Close Mine Field
-Open task manager and then end the Process in which Mozilla runs.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go onto youtube.com in one tab and any other link in another.
2.Play a youtube video.
3.Browse using another tab while the video is running.
Actual Results:
Mine Field will hang up, resulting in crashes.

Expected Results:
Should have just played the video while you browser in another tab.

The video still continues to play while hung up.
This started to happen a few day ago from Feb 16. I update daily.
