Polish the player widget in the animation inspector panel
Now that the first version of the animation panel ha landed in bug 1105825, I've noticed a few UI problem we should fix and a few change we could make to overall polish the UI and it behavior.

I've got 4 small things:

- When an animation ends, the player should remain on the screen but be disabled, this is better than making it disappear automatically. It avoids the UI to "jump". Also, in the future, the web animation API will allow u to re-run an ended animation, so we'll need to keep the widget around for this anyway.

- When you pause an animation, then switch to another node and then back to the same one again, the state of the timeline widget is incorrect.

- When an animation ends, the time label continues to be updated until the next synchronization from the actor, that mean that for instance, even if the animation ha a duration of 1 second, the current time label may show 1.02s for instance.

- Animations that don't repeat (iterationCount=1) shouldn't need to display "repeats:1" in the UI.

Each of these 4 thing are very minor fixes, a few line at most, and they're all about polishing the UI, so I didn't file separate bug for each of them.

I will create separate patch though.
