***********
before this lands, we must be able to measure performance of various action
that flex this code. a low-bar approach i've been thinking about is to write
chrome mochitests that contain perf score in the test comments.

for example, we could write a mochitest that time the opening of the history
menu, and the test comment could be "ui-perf|places|open history menu|20ms" or
something like that.

eventually we could build a datastore and UI, making it generally useful, but
the log data alone provides a simple solution for our immediate needs.
***********

the attached patch provides a basic test framework for doing this, and test the history and bookmark sidebars. there's no reporting at all yet - need to manually look at the log before/after your check-in.

issues:
- should up the history visit to 10,000
- or maybe should do multiple runs: empty profile, small profile, large profile
- i'm not able to get the menu to open yet, so that test is disabled

other test that should be added:
- open the library
- add different quantity of visits, bookmark
- remove different quantity of visits, bookmark
- annotation
- switch between the various history sidebar view
