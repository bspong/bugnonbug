A webpage with multiple <center> tag followed by other html will eventually fail rendering.
In a locally generated webpage - about 2 meg of table (200 or so tables) where each table is prefixed by <center>, but the <center> tag is not closed, will eventually fail to render - the table towards the end will fail to be rendered.

A possible work-around would be to automatically close the <center> tag on encountering another <center>.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Generate a webpage with a large number of individaul table (any number of row / cols)
2. Before each <table> instert a <center> tag. Do not close the tag.
3. Display in FF
Actual Results:
Last X number of table will be corrupt. Viewing the source in FF (view selection source) will show the DOM ha incorrectly intterpret the HTML

Expected Results:
all table should be rendered correctly.

While this is not 'wonderful' html - this issue doe not show in other browsers.
I imagine the rate of occurance is low, but it still show up poorly.

No error are thrown by FF when this occurs. Tracking down the cause of the issue to the multiple <center> tag took quite a lot of debug (trial and error),
