Firefox get lost when same history.go(-1) Javascript statement is executed second time around. Works Fine in IE.
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; InfoPath.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)

Java Servlet #1 executes and present HTML to Firefox to be filled in. User filled in and press Send. Java Servlet #1 then call Java Servlet #2 which verifies HTML data and post the below snippet javascript alert "not found" message and performs the history.go(-1) statement to repost original web page previously posted from Java Servlet #1 upon correctly detecting error. The first time around Firefox navigates this browser history correctly. User performs exact same senario where ...another... "not found" condition is detected in servlet #2 and upon excuting the same javascript snippet this time the javascript history.go(-1) produce a blank screen in Firefox. When these same servlets are performed under IE they work fine and the history.go(-1) statement always return to the correct previous history page. Below is the javascript snippet Firefox fails the perform of the second time around:

//
// We Must First Check For No Find And If Found Tell Administrator
//

if (p2.indexOf("Not Found") != -1) {
//
// If we get here, then alert Administrator of no find and they can try again if desired
//

out.println("<html><head></head>");
out.println("<script LANGUAGE=\"JavaScript1.2\"> \n");
out.println(" function alertAdmin() {");

out.println(" alert(\'Supplied Subroutine Object Name Not Found! Retry \'); }");

out.println(" </script>");
out.println("<BODY onload=\"alertAdmin();history.go(-1); \">\n");
out.println("</BODY></HTML>");

out.close();


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. See above javascript snippet from java servlet...
2.
3.

Actual Results:
See above javascript snippet from java servlet...

Expected Results:
Firefox should go back one page in it's history ...everytime... correctly display the original servlet html page based on executing the history.go(-1) statement. The first time executed it doe this correct. However the second time yield a blank browser window. The same test in IE work correctly everytime using the identical code the previous/original web page is rendered correctly.

It's like Firefox is loosing track of it's history location...

*** Because of this critical regression I cannot recommend Firefox for use with my Java product... ***
