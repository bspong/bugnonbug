Upon attempting to upload or Save As a file, firefox becomes unresponsive
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; InfoPath.1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

Whenever I attempt to upload a file or download one in firefox, the file upload/save a will cease to work. All function related to firefox freeze, and the menu itself cannot be clicked on to shut down the upload. If I attempt to end firefox in task manager using end task, I recieve alternatively 'not responding' and 'windows cannot shut this down because it is waiting for a response from you'. These seem to happen at random intervals, because I have recieved both at similar timeframes running on a clean PC with no background program beyond critical system processes.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Attempt to upload any file to a website such a www.imageshack.us
2.
3.
Actual Results:
The program freezes. In some situation this occurs for up to half an hour (before the program unfreezes and then immediately freeze again). The only way I can stop this second freeze is to close a window with more than one tab in it, and when the menu asking 'would you like to close multiple tabs?' appears, then close the file upload window.

Expected Results:
The file upload process would not have locked up Firefox and I could have uploaded normally.

All of the themes, etc are all completely default.
