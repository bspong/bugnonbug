I am uploading file in a portal application. In IE it is working fine.
but with firefox, I can't.
If it is a general web application, I am able to upload using ff but can't if it is a portal application.
In the server log I am getting the following message:
"Post parameter are null or too large to store into a cookie"

For portalet appliacation, I am using jsr286 resourceurl.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.create a jsr286 portlet application.
2.use the resource url to upload the files.
3.Upload the file and check in the portlet whether the file are uploaded or not.
Actual Results:
not uploading

Expected Results:
should be uploaded.

I am not seeing what is happening at the browser level.
But in the server log I am getting the folowing message in the log:

[1/11/11 17:23:08:523 IST] 0000004f WebAuthentica W Post parameter are null or too large to store into a cookie.
