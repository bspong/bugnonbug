When going to http://mail.myrealbox.com, or logging in throught the main page at
http://www.myrealbox.com, there are two problem when loading. Firstly, when I
enter my username and password and tell password manager to remember them, next
time I try to log in it doe not auto fill it in. Secondly, even after typing my
username and password painstakingly slow to ensure I make no errors, it often
asks for it to be entered again after partially loading the page. If this
happens, whenever I go to click on something, it asks for my username and
password again, and once typed in it go to a white page saying that my session
ha timed out and that I need to log in again. Occassionally I can get in at
this stage without a problem, but more often than not I am forced to use Mozilla
or IE to check MyRealBox.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.myrealbox.com or http://mail.myrealbox.com
2. Enter your username and password. If it load correctly, log out and in until
step 3 occurs.
3. It should half load and ask for your username and password again. Nothing
will load properly now.

Actual Results:
Nothing would load properly, session timed out.

Expected Results:
It should have loaded properly and the session stayed logged in until I logged
out myself.
