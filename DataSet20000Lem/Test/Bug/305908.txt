When I open my yahoo.com email and it contains embedded picture in the body to
display, the picture doe not show up properly. Instead the each picture
display on top of one another and you only see one picture and the scroll bar to
the right is not showing up either. If I use IE browser on www.yahoo.com web
email, I am able to view all the picture embedded in the body of the email and
I'm able to scroll down to view the rest of the picture .

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have someone send you an email to your yahoo email account with embedded
picture in the body of the email message.
2. Log on to your yahoo email account and open the email that contained embedded
picture in the body of the email message.
3.

Actual Results:
The embedded picture start displaying and it overlap each picture and the
last picture will be shown and the rest of the picture can't be seen. The
scroll bar doe not show up and you to click back to continue because the
button for your email is not showing up either.

Expected Results:
It should have displayed the embedded picture individually in the body of the
email message and the vertical scroll bar to the right should function so that
the user can view the picture up and down. Other email button function should
be visible to continue.

To my recollection, this problem ha been happening since the release of Mozilla
Firefox. I'm reporting this now because we are using Mozilla Firefox more often
and I don't want my user to complain about this problem and start using IE
browser again because Firefox can't display their picture properly on their
yahoo email.
