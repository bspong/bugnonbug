When Firefox is closed normally, Crash Reporter cannot send it's error report due to an unknown error
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

After I close Firefox normally on Vista SP1, either Crash Reporter or Windows Problem Reports and Solutions pop up and either asks me to send crash data to Mozilla or sends info to Microsoft (respectively). It's one or the other, never both.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Firefox 3 a one normally would (Facebook, Yahoo Mail, Gmail, etc.)
2. Close Firefox via either Alt+F4 or the red "X" close button in top-right
3. When the Crash Reporter window appears, send the error report by clicking "Quit Firefox" or "Restart Firefox" (both seem to get the same results)
4. You should see the picture of the window shown above.
Actual Results:
Error report NOT sent, doe not appear in about:crashes

Expected Results:
Error report should be sent, report should appear in about:crashes
